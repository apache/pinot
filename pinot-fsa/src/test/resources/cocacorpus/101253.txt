Nothing too fancy . No fondant flowers . Just the basics to even frosting , smooth sides , and a spiral top . The basics with which to tuck another kitchen skill under our belts , gain kitchen confidence , and impress ourselves and our birthday companions . <p> ( Note : These items are as negotiable as you 'd like . This is a pretty bare-bones list and the absense of these items wont make for an awful cake not at all it just might make decorating a cake more difficult . ) <p> Tip : Let 's start with the cake and with the frosting .

Place a cake layer , top side up in the center of the paperless diamond . <p> Were using a paper border to frost the cake to keep the cake plate clean . Well carefully remove the paper when the cake is done being frosted . <p> Tip : Fill a large pastry bag fitted with a very large tip with frosting . This makes for easy frosting distribution without tearing the cake crumb . <p> Starting on the outside edge of the cake , apply pressure to the bag and trace a thick line of frosting around the edge of the cake , making a spiral towards the center . <p> Use a cake decorating knife to evenly spread the frosting , allowing some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of cake . <p> Place the second cake layer , top side down , atop the first frosted layer . <p> If you need to trim the second make layer because its drastically uneven , carefully trim the top even before placing on the first layer . <p> Repeat the frosting trim and coil towards the center . If you 're keeping track , the frosting on each later will be a about 1/2 cup . <p> Use the cake decorating knife to again spread frosting in an even layer across the second cake , allowing some of the frosting the cascade down the sides . <p> Trim the top of the third and final cake layer and place , top side down , atop the second frosted layer . The bottom layer of the cake will face up , ensuring a super smooth and even cake top . <p> Press gently and check the sides of the cake with your hand to make sure the layers are placed on evenly . <p> Use the piping bag , you may need to refill it at this point , to again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cake , spiraling towards the center . Be a bit more generous with this layer as the frosting you place on top will also be worked down the sides of the cake for a thin crumb coat . <p> Rinse the knife in warm water and shake off excess water . <p> Work the frosting into an even layer across the top of the cake , pushing the excess frosting over the edge of the top cake layer . <p> Holding the knife vertically , use a short sweeping motion to spread the frosting across the sides . <p> The frosting that we allowed to cascade over the sides of the lower layers will come in handy here for lightly coating the sides of the cake . <p> A crumb coat is the thin layer of frosting that seals in any pesky crumbs . It does n't  need to be perfect , the sides can show peeks of cake edges . <p> Refrigerate for at least 1 hour . Its important that the crumb coat chill and set before we put on the final coat of frosting .

This does n't  have to be perfectly smooth , just try to make sure that all sides have an even thickness of frosting and no naked cake layers show through . <p> I find that a clean and slightly warm ( from the warm water ) knife makes smoothing the frosting much easier . <p> Tip : Frequently rinse the knife in warm water , shaking off the excess and getting back to frosting .

This will create a smooth finish along the side of the cake . <p> If you do n't  have a bench scraper , use the knife you used to frost the cake . Rinsed , held vertical and still alongside the spinning cake . <p> Once the sides are smooth , gently and starting from the edges of the top of the cake , lightly scrape the frosting towards the center . <p> Now for the spiral ! <p> Hold the cake decorating knife at a 45 degree angle so the tip meets the center of the cake . <p> This is similar to the motion we used to scrape the sides of the cake with the bench knife . Holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spin the cake ( at a medium speed ) , smoothly working the knife out towards the edge of the cake as you spin .

Time to celebrate ( yourself and the birthday someone ) ! <p> This is the one thing in baking I just cant seem to get . I find myself screaming " THIS IS WHY I HATE YOU " at the cake in the middle of the process . I always end up heavy handed , scalping the frosting off the cake as I 'm trying to smooth it . But you make it look so easy , so I 'll have to give it another shot . <p> I took a job at a bakery as an already accomplished baker .

I know you know not to throw a carton of eggs in the bottom of the grocery bag , toss them thoughtlessly in the trunk of the car , shove them in the fridge , slam them on the counter . I do n't  need to tell you to treat eggs delicately until , that is , the very moment you want what 's inside of them . <p> It is with humility that I show you how to crack and separate egg . <p> Baking is all about the details . How you measure flour , the accuracy of temperature in the oven , the softness of butter , the size of egg . All of the details matter and its helpful to know the rules and details in my case in order to occasionally break and ignore them . <p> Let 's talk about how to crack an egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Getting in good habits in the kitchen is key . <p> How to crack an egg : Crack an egg with firm pressure on a flat surface . Gently , but with confidence , separate the sides of the shell . I find it best to first crack eggs into a small bowl before adding them to a mixing bowl with other ingredients . This way , is a shell shard sneaks in , or if the eggs is bunk for some reason , you have n't ruined you whole batter . These are things you learn by ruining large batches of Blueberry Muffin batter while working in a bakery . <p> How not to crack an egg : Try to refrain from the age-old method of cracking an egg on the side on the mixing bowl . This will shove ( technical term ) egg shell shards up in the egg white and yolk , possibly getting egg shell in your batter . This method may also break the egg yolk and cause all sorts of problems if you 're trying to separate an egg . <p> Note : Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the end of the world ? No , and definitely yes . <p> Let 's talk about how to separate an egg . When we talk about separating an egg , we mean that were going to separate the egg white from the egg yolk . Were separating protein ( the white ) from fat ( the yolk ) . This will come in handy when you want to use egg yolks to make ice cream or egg whites to make angel food cake . <p> How to separate an egg : Set up two small bowls . Gently but firmly crack an egg on a flat surface . Use two hands to confidently pull the two halves of the shell apart over one small bowl . Were going to use the edges of the shell to help us separate egg white from egg yolk so try to create two even halves with the egg shell . As the shell separates , bring the shell half in your right hand to face cracked side up . The yolk will rest in the shell and some of the egg white will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining white to the shell half in your left hand , allowing the remaining egg white to fall away from the yolk . Gently place the yolk in the second bowl . <p> Another way to separate an egg : Set up two small bowls . Gently but firmly crack an egg on a flat surface . Place one hand over a bowl . Use the other hand to open the egg shell , dumping what 's inside the cracked egg directly into your hand over the bowl . Cracking an egg with one hand will take some practice . Allow the egg whites to fall between your fingers into the bowl and gently cradle the egg yolk . Gently transfer the egg yolk to the second bowl . <p> This is exactly how I crack an egg and how I taught my daughter to do t too . And I completely agree on cracking eggs into a separate bowl before adding to the batter . I even go so far as to separate egg whites individually before adding to the main bowl . I cant tell you how many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only for the whole batch to be ruined by a trace of egg yolk in the very last egg . : - ( <p> Love the photos . This would have been great to show my students when I taught Home Ec . I often use my hands to separate eggs or an egg separater . Great tips . Another helpful tip is that you can freeze egg whites for future use . I always save the egg whites when I make a chocolate or banana cream pie and freeze them in a small labeled baggie . Then , when I want to make an angel food cake , I simply thaw the whites in the fridge and they are ready to use .

The small stuff , explained . <p> A recipe that calls for beaten egg whites can be intimidating enough . There is enough fear around getting the mixing bowl dry and grease-free enough to fluff the egg whites to frighten even a seasoned baker . Having to then fold those egg whites into batter can feel , well like too much . How does one fold a fluffy ingredient into a dense wet ingredient ? This is nothing like the time I spent a summer folding shirts at The Gap ( in my imagination because I always wanted to work at The Gap because it seemed sooooo cool but wwhhhyyy ! ? ) , and also nothing like the time I spend four minutes trying to fold a fitted sheet before deciding that the task is 100% IMPOSSIBLE ( because dammit IT IS ! and do n't  you dare send me a Martha Stewart link about it because I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm trying to say is , folding egg whites is possible and sometimes necessary and if I can do it , you can do it . <p> How To Fold Egg Whites : <p> Get ready . Gather your batter in a large bowl ( its going to get fluffy ) , your stiffly beaten egg whites , and a rubber spatula . <p> Add a small portion ( a spatula-full ) of egg whites to the batter . Were adding a small amount at first to help loosen the more dense batter . <p> Using the spatula on its side , slice down the center of the bowl from the top towards you , bisecting the egg whites and batter . We obviously are n't  cutting the batter , were momentarily and temporarily dividing it in two . <p> As the spatula is pulled towards you , flip it to the left , scooping up the batter to the left , and folding it over the egg whites . <p> Bisect the dough again and fold over . Rotate the bowl a quarter turn to the left , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold again . Repeat until the spoonful of egg whites is almost entirely incorporated . <p> Add another large spatula-full of egg whites and fold in the same manner ; slicing down the center of the batter and whites , folding over to the left , rotating the bowl and repeating . <p> As you add more egg whites , the batter will begin to lighten and fluff . The key is to fully incorporate the egg whites into the denser batter while maintaining some of the fluff of the egg whites . This will lighten the batter . <p> Folding egg whites is a matter of technique and patience . It takes time , simple folding , and bowl rotation . The end result will be a fluffy batter that bakes up light an airy . This is a great technique for pancakes and light cake batters .

I have n't tested this recipe , but I 'm curious . <p> My mom taught me how to fold a fitted sheet when I was really young and Ive never had a problem with it since . Oddly enough , its the flat sheet that gives me problems .

Think about what you want from your baked good and go for it . <p> For pies , you want a burst of heat to set the pie crust to flakey , time in the oven to set the filling , and some quality time at the top of the oven to brown the crust . For this reason , we can start a pie on the bottom rack to brown the bottom crust , move it to the center rack for a majority of the baking time , and finish the oven on the top rack to brown the crust . See ? That 's an even bake . <p> For pizzas you want a crisp crust and a browned bubbling top .

@@2115337 <h> Baking 101 : Which Rolling Pin Is Best ? <p> I do n't  generally care how fancy your butter is , which set of copper measuring cups you use , or if your oven is gas or electric or hamster-wheel-powered . If you 've been around here for even just a few days , you know that I 'm a stickler , a nag , a nuisance , a pest , a finger-wagger about making your own pie crust . <p> Pie crust requires patience , guts , practice , flour , butter , buttermilk , and a rolling pin . But wait why are there so many different kinds of rolling pins ? Different strokes for different folks . ( Is that rolling pin humor ? ) Let 's discuss the differences . The right rolling pin and you 'll be on your way to pie crust success . <p> Perhaps this is the most familiar rolling pin to you , the American or bakers rolling pin . A wooden , in this case Maple , center dowel that turns in the center of two handles . You can comfortably curl your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm strength to push the rolling pin forward and back over dough . <p> Con : I 've found that these rolling pins can be a bit heavy and are slightly less maneuverable that other , handleless options . <p> Overall , I love this style of rolling pin . Its comfortable , versatile , classic . If you only have one rolling pin in your kitchen ( because you 're a reasonable person ) , this Maple Rolling Pin is great . Not too large or heavy , making it wonderful for pie crust and other rolling needs . <p> You may have run across a Tapered or French-style rolling pins and thought nope , too fancy for me . I did . I was wrong . <p> French Rolling Pins do n't  have handles , so you wont be grasping at the sides of the rolling pin to push and pull . Instead , you use the heel of your hand to press a French Rolling Pin away from you . Since you are n't  grasping the outside handles , you naturally place your hands , more towards the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough with more control and intimacy than a rolling pin with handles . <p> Pro : maneuverability , controlled pressure , more control in general , lightweight . <p> Con : great for soft bread doughs and pie doughs not good for a stiff or chilled cookie dough . <p> Overall , this is a wonderful rolling pin to have.Theyre beautiful , simple , and really easy to work with . <p> Maybe its your grandmothers rolling pin . Maybe its a great find from that awesome vintage shop you found in Nashville . Either way , a vintage rolling pin is lovely to have especially if you 're a food stylist who collects various dilapidated wood props . <p> Did people have smaller hands in the 1940s ? I 'm thinking yes . Vintage rolling pins are often smaller than modern rolling pins . This one in particular feels like something between a traditional and a tapered rolling pin . <p> Pros : way good vibes , and often smaller in size making them great for single pie crusts and food photographs . <p> Cons : sometimes they 're too small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they 're still lovely to have in the kitchen . <p> Marble rolling pins are for the aesthetically aware and the laminated dough enthusiasts . These rolling pins are rather heavy in weight but it can be chilled before rolling , making it a great tool for cool-sensitive doughs like puff pastry . <p> Pro : will hold a chill for the two times you might make puff pastry a year . Two ! ? Weight of the rolling pin can work for you less arm pressure . Oh so pretty . <p> Con : can be heavy and tedious to maneuver , but its hard to be mad at a piece of pretty marble . <p> Overall , a splurge . <p> To clean a rolling pin , here 's a trick : use a soft bench scraper to scrape any flour and dough bits off the pin then use a clean , damp cloth to wipe the rolling pin . No submerging in water .

To the absolute horror of my baker friends who visit and for some reason NEED a rolling pin , is my precious pink rubber ( no stick , anyway ) RP with turquoise handles that my Mom gave me when I THOUGHT I was a budding baker .

@@2115338 <h> My Favorite Places to Dine Alone in New Orleans <p> I find myself repeating this phrase often , not for lack of dinner company , but mostly because I really love eating out alone . It feels indulgent to me , and liberating , and exactly like I skipped that conversation that usually goes something like this : " Where do you want to go for dinner ? " " I du n no , where do you want to go ? " " Does your mother hate me ? " Silence . and someone orders takeout . <p> Because I often travel alone ( and have eaten enough room service club sandwiches to last me a lifetime ) , Ive grown to LOVE learning about a city through some of their best restaurants all by myself . Its like being a stranger in a strange land , leaving surrounding diners not to pity me , but rather assume that Im Sydney Bistow in the early seasons of Alias . They are correct , I 'm part ninja in confidence alone . <p> I also live in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only eat so many scrambled eggs for dinner at home before enough is enough . What I 've come to love about dining out in New Orleans is that I now have local knowledge under my belt . That 's handy as a single woman dining alone . Its nice to know what bars feel cozy to eat at ( without too much interruption from gentlemen folk ) , and which restaurants feel nice to sit at a table solo . Here are some of my favorite restaurants to dine alone in based on my experiences out in New Orleans . If you 're on a visit solo to New Orleans , welcome get some good grub and always have a Sazerac : <p> Sylvain in the French Quarter is one of my favorite places to grab a solo bite . Its especially great if you 're visiting town , wandering through the Quarter ( it can be pretty dreamy ) and looking for a good bite to eat . Some tips : Sylvain opens for dinner at 5:30 . I suggest arriving well before 7pm and finding a seat at the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bar can fill up quickly . The restaurant is cozy and dimly lit with a decent mix of local and tourist patrons . This is a good place to strike up a dinnertime conversation . Also , get the burger . <p> Patois is located in the heart of and Uptown neighborhood . It feels like a very local , heartfelt , comfortable neighborhood place . The food is sincere , generous , and really some of my favorite in the city . Tips : Do n't  be afraid to make a reservation for one and sit at a table on your own . This place is comfortable enough . The staff will take good care of you . <p> For breakfast I love Cherry Espresso Bar . Its a coffee shop Uptown with the best breakfast sandwiches , quinoa bowls , pour over coffee and no ridiculous line out the door for medium-meh diner food . <p> For lunch I love the locally sourced food and very chill vibes at Sneaky Pickle in the Bywater . Its mostly vegan food with a few meat options and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tips : This is an order-at-the-counter spot so cozy up at a small table , bring a good book or magazine , and enjoy the solo quality time . <p> For Southern Cajun food I really love a bite to eat at Cochon in the CBD ( Central Business District ) . They know their way around a pig . My very favorites at Cochon are the wood-fired oysters , the smoked pork rubs , and the cochon . Tip : ask for a seat at the chefs bar . You can peek into the kitchen ( its full of friendly hard-working folks ) , gaze into the wood-fired oven , and have a good chat with the chefs . Also , order a Sazerac . <p> For a solo happy hour , I recommend a seat at the bar at Peche . Go early . If the weather is nice they may even have the side doors open , which makes a bar seat even more lovely . Order the oysters , definitely get the tuna dip , and a lovely glass of crisp wine . The staff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Peche is very well-earned after an afternoon visiting all of the art galleries in the Arts District . here 's your guide to art in and around Julia Street . <p> N7 is a dreamy , romantic restaurant in the Bywater .

There 's seating outdoors , but when I 'm alone , my favorite tables are the cozy two tops inside the restaurant . I 've found there 's no real need for a reservation , head in , make eye contact with a waitress and theyll usually nod you on to find your own table . The wine list is excellent ! Bring a book and feel transformed . <p> Cafe Henri is an easy neighborhood restaurant , also in the Bywater .

I too travel for work , and Ive also eaten more than my fair share of room service club sandwiches . If you were ever to think of writing a book on this topic , for different cities , I would be ordering it right up , and I guess my fellow solo diners would too .

Sure , I can sit in Subway and eat a sandwich along , but a proper restaurant ( even a chain ) nope . Sochanneling my inner brave girl , I decided to have tea and scones at my favorite place in Savannah recently . It was nothing short of awkward , but it was n't so awful either .

You will probably end up with people asking to sit with you because there are just a few tables but , as long as you are comfortable with that , you will be just fine . <p> Midway Pizza on Freret is also a good place to dine alone and they have the best salads in town .

Respect the Order . <p> Did you know that a recipes ingredient list is usually set up by order of use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recipe wants us to know that well first be incorporating butter and two types of chocolate . Next up will be sugar , eggs , and vanilla , followed by our dry ingredients , and classy extras ( walnuts ) . The recipe list is built to help us , help ourselves . <p> 3 . The Comma . <p> The comma is everything when it comes to baking measurements . Every cut , chop , or dice instruction after a comma in an ingredient list is to be done after the ingredient is measured . <p> For example , 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate , coarsely chopped . <p> In longhand , this means go to the store and buy one of those four ounce bars of chocolate , probably that fancy bar of Ghirardelli that 's next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle . Buy it . Take it home . Unwrap it . Try not to take a bite because you 're using it for brownies . Put it on the counter . Chop it . Do n't  sneak any bites . We know its hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the dang instructions . <p> These recipe list does not mean chop a bunch of chocolate and measure out 4 ounces and snack on the rest . <p> In longhand , this means go to the store . Splurge on walnuts . Take them home . Chop them with the same knife you chopped the chocolate with ( because why would you dirty another knife ? ) . Measure the chopped walnuts in a 1-cup measuring cup and add them to the brownie batter like a boss . <p> One cup of chopped walnuts is very different that one cup of walnuts , chopped . Ya heard ? <p> 4 . Pack , Soften and Preheat . <p> Recipe lists often request that brown sugar be packed . Take the back of a spoon and firmly ( but not totally Hulk -style ) press the sugar into the measuring cup . Add more sugar and pack until sugar is flush with the top of the measuring cup . Boom ! <p> Soften butter by allowing it to rest at room temperature for about 1 hour . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter to soften before combining it with sugar and eggs . No one wins . Well talk at length about creaming butter and sugar soon . <p> Doneness is recipe instructions are usually described by a time range and visual characteristics . <p> Bake brownies for 30 to 33 minutes , or until the top is dull and a thin knife inserted into the center comes out clean . <p> Youve come this far , now its up to you to take your treat out of the oven at the right time . The time and description should give you confidence by providing you with as estimated time and appearance . Trust the process and trust yourself and standby with the pot holders . <p> Butbutokay , I get that " 1 cup chopped walnuts " can measure very differently than " 1 cup walnuts , chopped , " but is n't 4 ounces of chocolate always 4 ounces of chocolate ? The weight is n't going to change just because you chopped itis it ? Granted , its much easier to just plop the little squares out of the package all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or maybe physics . Or Brownies 101 . <p> I was going to point out this same thing . 4 ounces ( and any weight for that matter ) is 4 ounces whether its whole or chopped or whatever . The cup of walnuts example is a great one though . Volume is affected by the size of the pieces . <p> Thanks so much for this post . I am very very guilty of not reading recipes before I get started and I never knew how important that comma was ! I 'm really looking forward to this series of posts ! <p> I suppose it depends on whether the 4 oz are weight ounces or volume ounces , as in melted chocolate . Four ounces of chocolate , melted is *not* necessarily the same as four ounces of melted chocolate , yes ? <p> The one that used to get me was that 4 ounces of frozen chicken breast is not the same thing as 4 ounces of cooked chicken breast , not even close DOH ! ! If you are logging your food , and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounces straight from the freezer ( no ! ) , prior to cooking ( maybe ) , after cooking ( different weights , depending on how much was it cooked ) . Same with having " respect for the comma " in baking , I guess . One always has to pay attention to the directions . <p> I guess the process would eat some of the ingredients up . 4 ounces of melted chocolate would still be 4 ounces of chocolate , melted , only if you would wipe clean all of the chocolate clean from the pot . And this is even worse with the case of chopped ingredients since some will fly away or stick to any tools you are using . That 's my humble opinion from experience working in traditional medicine . <p> This truly could not have come at a more perfect time than now ! With two recipe books ready to be devoured ! Thank you so very much . And again , I had no idea that there was a hidden meaning to the commas . Can not wait for more baking 101s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and memorizing a recipe from start to finish , my eyes are always darting up and down all over the place ! I really have to take these tips seriously and read the recipe properly before starting anything so I wont abandon my half mixed batter in the middle to grab an egg or butter or something ! <p> I love this post , thank you so much for taking the time to write it up ! Its not just a great reminder of how to read recipes properly , but a reminder of how carefully I should be writing my own , as well . ( Especially the part about the commas ! ) Thank you so much ! <p> Gosh Did I learn " read the recipe fully " the hard way . Too many failed cakes and breads have ended up as trash in my kitchen . I learnt baking is not cooking , it is a science . A bloody delicious science but science none the less . I wonder why people do not use a scale more often in baking but I guess i am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Reading a recipe in full , from start to finish , such a simple thing that I thought everyone did , but I get near-daily comments that say things like , I did n't  read the recipe in full and did n't  know I was supposed to chill the doughand so.I baked it anyway . Or , I did n't  read the recipe in full and did n't  realize I was supposed to lower the oven temperature . Its like some people literally read just the very sentence they need , then stop reading ! Its kind of shocking to me but I know it happens ! And I love this post and rule of the baking road . Also the part about doneness . That is so variable and lately I 've started saying bake about 30-32 mins , or until top is set , edges are crisp ; or until done . I sometimes just want to say , bake until its done . That way people can take some ownership : )

@@2115345 <h> How To Be A Better Baker <p> We talk a lot about doughnuts and waffles . We talk about my cat a bit too much . We talk about New Orleans and beignets and parades , and beads . We could , if you 're at all interested , talk about how many peanut butter cups I just shoved in my mouth . That conversation would be short and barely interesting . 6 . That 's the number . <p> Today let 's talk about 7 ways to be a better baker . A few small tweaks and little nuggets of advice to build confidence in the kitchen . Read through and leave a comment below if any questions come up for you ! I want us to be the best bakers we can be . <p> Well , unless you 're a raw pastry chef , in which case , cheers to you . No need to have the fanciest , latest and greatest oven . Its more about your relationships , how well you know each other , and how readily you accept all the quirks . <p> Some ovens have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotter than others . Get familiar the hot spots by seeing how a cake browns in the oven . Is one side more golden or burnt than another ? Take note and rotate the your cakes and breads during baking . <p> Stop what you 're doing right now and invest in an oven thermometer . A gauge inside the oven is the only way to know how hot the hot is . Sometimes the dial does n't  reflect the actual heat correctly . <p> 2 . Yes you have to follow the directions , mostly . <p> Baking is a delicate balance of flours , moisture , leavening , and heat . A recipe is there to hold your hand , lead the way , and give you a high-five at the end . Youve got to trust the recipe to be good . Sometimes they 're not , but you have to trust the process , cold butter , buttermilk and all . <p> So often I end up with a container full of egg whites after making ice cream , a small handful of pecans , and leftover fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things away or let them languish to death in the refrigerator . Delicious treats come from leftovers ! Do n't  let em go ! <p> That 's not just something your grandmother said to get you from jumping up and down indoors . Cakes need a bit of care even when they 're in the oven . There 's a critical stage about 12 to 18 minutes of cake baking where the leavening and eggs are doing their best to support the rise of the cake , if you jostle the cake by rotating it in the oven during this period , the cake could sink in the center . No good . <p> They always leak and make for really infuriating and soggy cheesecake crusts . Its not right to blame yourself . They 're just the worst . And do n't  even get me started about wrapping the springform pan in tin foil . That worked for one person once and then never again . <h> Share <h> 69 comments <p> Great tips ! I 'm the worst about neglecting the leftover bits of egg white . So frustrating ! Your buttermilk pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be a requirement to make it one time before some buys a poor imitation of pie crust rolled up and sad in the refrigerator section of the store .

I am confident in the kitchen and stuff but its always good to look for more knowledge from people with more experience ! Thank you for the post ! <p> I have never made a from-scratch pizza crust that turned out well ( taste and texture are always off ) . I always cheat and buy the Trader Joes crust . What am I doing wrong ? I have tried numerous recipes . <p> I felt the same way until I found Jim Laheys overnight no-knead pizza crust recipe . You just leave all the ingredients overnight in a bowl , leave it to spread out in a cast-iron skillet , bake it in a super-hot oven and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , even though you 've only ever felt like a putz who ca n't make pizza crust : ) <p> Its called double 00 flour from Italy its the only way to get authentic Italian pizza crust the ap flour just does n't  do it justice . You 'll probably need to order it online . Might get pricey good luck ! <p> I so agree with you on pie crust ! Its way too delicious &amp; way too easy to make it yourself to waste a perfectly good pie filling on a mediocre store-bought crust . I 'm also on a mission to get my loved ones to stop buying premade pie crust . <p> I think that all baking requires a bit of gumption ! Cooking without a recipe comes easier to me , so I always feel like I have to pull on my big girl pants when I sit down to bake something . That being said , you 're inspiring me to try out my own pie crust . I 'm also a big fan of rule #4 . I think its a responsibility as a home-cook or baker to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them go to waste .

@@2115351 <h> Baking 101 : How To Brown Butter <p> Browning butter is one of those life skills that should be taught to everyone alongside things like : how to change a tire , how to tip at a restaurant , how to ride a bike with no hands , and how to mince garlic . Everyone should know . <p> Its a good thing I 'm here . I do n't  know how to change a tire but I 'm here with butter . <p> Browned Butter is butter cooked until it has melted into a liquid , the water has cooked out , and the milk solids begin to toast and brown to a delicious and nutty state . <p> When incorporated into desserts like breads , donuts , and cookies , it subtly deepens the flavor from delicious to ohmygod who made these cookies ! ? ! ? . That 's the power of browned butter . here 's how to make the magic . <p> Its important that the bottom of the pan be lightly colored so you can actually see the butter browning . In a black-bottom pan , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or silver-bottomed pan is best . <p> Place the butter in the pan and place the pan over a stovetop set to medium heat . Gently place your arms on your hips , assume a good attitude and peaceful face , and standby . <p> Whatever you do , do not multitask . As soon as you step away from your pan , its scientifically proven , you 're going to burn your butter . <p> Step Three : Now were going places ! <p> Once the butter has melted into a liquid , it will start popping and crackling . That 's the water cooking out of the butter . Once the water cooks out , the milk solids in the butter will begin to brown . <p> So first popping , then browning . <p> Swirl the pan around if you 're feeling restless or chef-y . Do n't  even think about stepping away from your butter . <p> Step Four : Getting there ! <p> Once the crackling subsides , the butter will begin to brown . This means that little brown bits will start to appear on the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown , but rather , the milk solids will begin to brown at the bottom of a pan . <p> Use a heat-proof spatula to stir the browning milk solids off the bottom of the pan so they brown more slowly and evenly . <p> Once you see the butter browning on the bottom of the pan , the rest of the process will move pretty quickly . But do n't  forget you 're in charge ! <p> To prevent the butter from browning too quickly and burning , simply remove the pan from the heat source . The heat of the pan alone will slowly brown the butter . Leaving the pan over the heat source will brown the butter much more quickly , forcing ninja-like reflexes upon you . <p> Once the butter solids are browned to golden , immediately remove the pan from the heat ( if you have n't already ) , and remove the butter from the pan .

Especially taking it off the heat and also removing the butter from the pan when the browning has finished .

So I googled it , and this site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see why . Great directions , even to the subconscious ! <p> Is the measurement still the same ? E.g. , if the recipe calls for half a stick of butter and you brown the butter , there will be less of the butter to go in to the recipe because of the cooking off of the water . Do you simply use the half a stick you browned or do you add slightly more butter to brown to compensate for what is going to burn off ? 
@@2115352 <h> Vegetarian Swedish Meatballs <p> I 've never been one to fall into a fancy food category , whether by desire or dietary need . I think there was a brief period in the early 00s when I was a vegetarian until I forgot due to chili cheese fries ( really that could happen to anyone ) . I 'm gluten-free only so far as the hard pretzels are concerned ( because they 're definitely better than gluten-full pretzels ) . I 'm vegetarian until I want to put bacon in something , and vegan until I reach for the butter . I 'm a cupcake enthusiast exactly when the mood strikes , and paleo only by accident . <p> I felt like I should explain some of those details in introducing this cream-filled , butter-laden , vegetarian faux meatball recipe . Its vegetarian and creamy and indulgent with very few ( actually no ) apologies .

Legumes are just the ticket . <p> To turn our beans to balls were also using eggs and ricotta for binding , onions and garlic for flavor , fresh herbs for pep , and fennel seeds , vegetarian Worcestershire and mustard for layers of flavor . Breadcrumbs too , for binding . Weve got a lot going on . Its all worth it . <p> Butter is melted and onions are softened .

This is a solid meal for solid people who have their two feet on the ground and a grumbling belly . <p> *To make the lentils , in a large saucepan bring 6 cups water to a simmer . Add salt ( like you 're salting pasta water ) , crushed garlic clove , wedge of a yellow onion , and a bay leaf to the simmering water .

And do n't  try to give me that nonsense abt how cranberries taste the same , because they.do.not . Not at all . And you can make the yummiest dessert by beating egg whites w a little sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowberries/lingonberries ( use the name you like best ) it is called TROLLKREM in Norwegian and that is ( you got it ! ) troll cream for ya ! <p> I personally think cranberries and lingonberries taste fairly similar ( more than any other fruit ) BUT if you happen to have an IKEA nearby , that 's where I get my lingonberry jam ! Makes a great PBJ , too . <p> wow , that was kind of rude response . we do n't  have lingonberries in my part of united states . and cranberries is easily accessible . although , the taste is quite different , that was an alternative . Unless we are close to an IKEA we can not get lingonberries easily . We are usa and Joy did a great job adjusting to meet the needs in a traditional way in the usa . Please do not take this offensively , but you were quite rude and that is not nice . If you are an example of all Norwegians I would not want to travel there ! How very unkind are your words ! Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are making " Swedish Meatballs " and it is nothing like Swedish meatballs .. But this looks rather tasty ! I love meat , and make my Swedish meatballs ( or , meatballs , as I call them as I am Swedish .. ) with actual meat , but this looks like an interesting alternative worth trying . Especially when having vegetarians over , or just for meatless Mondays that we have at home . Thanks for the inspiration ! <p> You just made a real Swede very happy ! Hey , you need to try out the swedish pastry " Semla " , its a perfect cloud of cardamum bun , almond paste and cream . Its what all Swedes crave for shrove Tuesday or mardi gras as you lot call it Leila does a great version ( although I do n't  really think she uses 132 eggs for the egg wash ) LONG ...

I 'm going to buy one and then use it for everything ! <p> These are definitely straight out of the comfort food category , and I 'm just fine with that sometimes you need a little something extra . Thanks for letting your vegetarianism run amock just long enough to create these ; ) 
@@2115353 <h> How To Make The Best BLT Sandwich Pro Tips from a Professional <p> Ok . So maybe I 'm not a professional BLT magic maker in the strictest sense of the word professional . A professional BLT magic maker is a good-hearted line cook who sneaks extra bacon into your sandwich . I 'm just an enthusiast . A professional enthusiast can we leave it at that ? <p> Here are my Top Seven Tips to making the best BLT ! You think you know but you have no idea . <p> Let 's start with bread ! Bread should either be perfect , or perfectly horrible . Let me explain . The best BLTs are made on fresh bakery-baked bakery bread . The more times you mention the word bakery , the better the bread . I chose a soft loaf of bakery-baked white bread from Willa Jean Bakery in New Orleans . <p> If you cant , or do n't  want to , get your hands on bakery-baked bakery bread , go with grocery store sliced white bread I 'm taking like , Wonder Bread . Its so soft and fluffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snack myself to sleep every night . Thanks . <p> You can toast your bread under the oven broiler where you will forget it and find yourself with blackened bread pucks . <p> You can be like me and rub your sliced bread in lard and sizzle them in a cast iron skillet until mostly browned and a little burnt on both sides . I mean I just said lard and meant it . <p> Tomatoes . Let 's talk about spending $4.59 on a tomato because you cant grown your own because you 're never home to tend to plants and you still have a home-brew komucha kit sitting on your kitchen counter , staring you in the face , asking you to take the time to make it but you wo n't because , like you said , you 're never home and you cant grow your own tomatoes even though theyd grow like hot-cakes in New Orleans but that 's just not your path right now so you have to spend $4.59 on a tomato at Whole Foods because no , they 're not on sale . <p> So get a good tomato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow your own ( you show off ) . <p> Lettuce . Do n't  play . There is only one suitable lettuce for a proper and perfect BLT sandwich and that is Iceberg Lettuce . We need a light , crisp , consistent crunch from our lettuce . Nothing less . Nothing more . I will accept no argument to the point . Bib lettuce will do in a pinch . Spinach if you 're nasty . <p> Again , do n't  play . <p> Were going to talk about condiments because you want to get fancy , do n't  you ? Experiment with aiolis ? Add mustard ? This would be your greatest mistake so just stop right there . Let me save you from yourself . Mayonnaise . The End . <p> You do n't  like mayonnaise ? Yes you do . <p> Ai n't  no BLT without some bacon . Yes we can . Yes we will . If were going to bacon we are obligated to make it the real deal . Thick sliced , fatty , salty , perfect . If you 're thinking about bacon made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliciously thick bacon portioned from the meat counter at Whole Foods . If they have the Black Forest bacon , its your lucky day . <p> I 've had the most success baking my bacon in a 375 degree F oven for about 15 minutes , removing the bacon from the pan , and lightly dipping my bread slices in the bacon fat before toasting . <p> Whatever you do , cook bacon with a shirt on . Do n't  come home from Pilates , take your shirt off , and cook bacon in your sports bra and think that 's a good idea because I 'll tell you what hot bacon fat comes atcha fast . I know . I know . <p> Place a cast iron skillet over medium heat . Lightly dip both sides of your sliced bread in hot bacon fat . That sounds sexy and I 'm glad it does . Place in the warm skillet , flipping once or twice to brown on each side . <p> Remove from the pan . Smear generously with real mayonnaise . Spread the other slice of bread with mayonnaise too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been eating BLTs weekly here , and I agree with all of the above ( though I do like to add a little harissa powder to the mayo to give it a little kick ) . A total KISS meal , and nobody wants to be stupid . <p> In my humble opinion , you 're 100% a professional I 'd trust your opinion on anything food-related ! This is without a doubt , a perfect BLT . The heirloom tomatoes . The bacon fat-fried bread . THE MAYO ! You get it . Is it acceptable to make a BLT for breakfast ? cause I just do n't  think I can wait until a more civilized hour to wrap my hands around one of these .. xo <p> That 's the way I make my BLTs ! Super delicious ! One time I was making them at my MILs house and she was preparing the bread , and she did n't  toast it ! Noooo ! ! ! The sacrilege ! Anyway , one tip about the bacon Line the pan with foil and then all you have to do is ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and throw it away ! OR , carefully lift up the foil and pour the bacon grease into a jar in your fridge , because you save the bacon grease , right ? Of course you do ! It makes the best retried beans , scrambled eggs , etc ? ? ? ? 
@@2115354 <h> This Week : Finding Inspiration <p> I have a cookbook coming out soon . Its about Brunch and do n't  worry starting next week ( or sometime around then ) , I 'll shamelessly and relentlessly ask you to buy it and come see me as I 'm traveling around . This is not that conversation , but that 's soon and wo n't stop and I apologize ( half-heartedly ) in advance . <p> Over Easy will be my third book and I suppose by now I 'm accustomed to the cycle of it . I 'm not talking about the recipe testing and editing , or about the PR conference calls and the lists and emails I 'm talking more about the cycle of excitement and doubt that I work through in myself every time I release a new book . <p> Its hard putting anything you create out into the world . I suspect that is especially true of the children some of you have made with your bodies . That 's not my experience just yet , but I feel a similarly about the books I make . It feels especially stomach-knotted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant sneak in and make any changes or updates or move this here or that there . I cant move to Mars if no one likes it ( I 've asked ) . Its final and we all did our best and pretty soon its up for your consumption and critique . <p> In that simmering of excitement and doubt is a sprinkling of self-criticism a big sprinkling . Like I 'm trying to toughen my skin before anyone else takes any lashes at it . Do you do this ? Do you want to know how good I am at criticizing myself ? Lemme tell you : I 'm the best . There 's no one better . I 've looked . I 've asked around , but still I 'm the best at beating myself up . <p> I do n't  mention this because I want you to fill the comment section up with encouraging sentiments . Really that 's not what this is about . Its more that I want to tell you how that sort of thinking takes root in my brain once its planted . <p> I had to look for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird thing to do ) something to prove to national morning news shows that I wont go live on their television airwaves and make a fool out of both of us . In that search , with a hands-up / I do n't  know where I 'm going to find these clips kind of feeling- I googled myself , trying to be specific , trying to just find the thing I needed that probably does n't  exist anymore . In that search I stumbled upon one of those Hater Sites . You know the kind where anonymous people say mean things about other people on the Internet . I clicked it . I read the nasty things people had to say about me . <p> What I know now ( beyond the fact that some people are like legit-level weirdly mean ) is that when the self-criticism weed is planted in the front of my brain , it seeks out external messages to confirm its validity . And when its looking , it finds them . Its like watering the weeds . Yep well grow . Yep well stay . Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Well , yes I do see that now . And it does n't  take me on the loopy spiral of a rollercoaster that it used to . I care waaaay less about what strangers think of me . I 'm not feeding or watering that part of my brain . I 'm letting it be there until the weeds of criticism get thirsty , shrivel and wither . They will . Love lives in this brain of mine too and it always wins out . <p> This is just what it feels like wrestling with myself and creativity . So far I 'm pulling right on through if pulling through means making things that I feel proud of that are hopefully of use to you . <p> I 'm grateful for all of it , weeds included . <p> here 's where I 'm finding inspiration this week .

Usually I just replace the 2 tbs of flour with 2 tbs of cornstarch , and call it a day . But I will def do this sifting thing next time ! <p> you guys Stateside are lucky to have " cake flour " to buy !

A nightmare . ) Thanks for your joy always , Joy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tend to stay away from bleached flours . I 've found that this trick with unbleached all-purpose flour works wonders and I get to skip the bleaching . Bonus for me ! <p> This is really good to know . I do have a question however . I am allergic to corn and its by products . Have you ever tried this with an alternative starch such as rice or tapioca ? The cake flour I do use has no cornstarch in it , but I do n't  always have it on hand . Thanks ! <p> Vivian , you can replace corn starch with potato starch . They work one-for-one , so one tablespoon corn starch = one tablespoon potato starch . Be sure to get potato STARCH and not potato FLOUR . If you have trouble finding it now , wait until the Spring and look for it in the Kosher for Passover section of the store . It keeps a long time too ! <p> I 've never purchased cake flour but always sift my all purpose flour with potato starch . it has similar properties and acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same technique and amounts Joy listed with the substitution should work . Hope that helps <p> I 'm definitely bookmarking this post . I cant tell you how many trips to the store this one tip will save me . Or SEVERAL stores , because I never know which one will have cake flour on any given day . You 're the greatest , Joy ! <p> Bread flour is flour with a higher protein content , leading to more gluten , etc . <p> The level of protein in certain brands differ . King Arthurs " all purpose " can frequently be substituted for bread flour . <p> Also , if you are able to find " vital wheat gluten " and add some ( not sure of the precise proportions , but a bit less than 1 tsp/cup ) to all purpose then you 'll raise the net protein content enough to get by . <p> Check Peter Reinharts " Bread Bakers Apprentice " or Beranbaums " Bread Bible " for a bunch more information on this stuff .

I found myself cursing the heavens when I could n't find a pair of scissors to cut a perfect bow I had created on a perfect wreath I had created to hang in my ( good grief ) totally imperfect , tiny apartment . <p> Its easy to get caught up in the holiday fray of gift shopping , gift wrapping , re-gifting . Planning one party , hustling off to another , trying to incorporate cranberry into every meal from now until December 25th , and remembering not to tell any small children that Santa is n't real because he totally is . Totally real . <p> I have to remind myself that the holidays are , most importantly , that time of year when we ( somehow ) slow down long enough to make our homes smell like spruce trees , and gather round them slow do n't  long enough to mull our wine , make handmade gifts for people we love , and do all of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of year , since we can remember . <p> What makes the holiday really special are those small , kooky , forever-ago moments .

This Emerald porcelain Keepsake Ornament from Hallmark being my new treasured favorite . <p> What keeps you grounded during the holidays ? What keeps you rooted in what is happy and real in the midst of holiday madness ? Is it enchiladas and Peanut Butter Balls ? I hope so . <p> Let 's talk about these Peanut Butter Balls ! I do n't  want to delay this peanut butter and chocolate situation any longer . <p> In my family , we 've made Peanut Butter Balls ( a very technical term for this very technical dessert ) since the beginning of time or since my Mom got a hold of the recipes sometime in the early 1970s . <p> Ive added pure vanilla extract and fancy sea salt because I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always made this recipe by hand , on the tiny kitchen table , in the largest plastic bowl we had in the kitchen , with peanut butter up to our elbows and a fine powdered sugar dusting from the dining room , through the kitchen , all the way to the back bedroom . <p> We did n't  get snow in Los Angeles we had to make it feel festive somehow . <p> When I made this batch as an adult , home in New Orleans , I reached for my largest bowl and prepared myself for the dirty elbows and powdered sugar parade . Halfway through mixing I had a EUREKA moment : a stand mixer ! ! ! I have one of those ! ! ! <p> Into the mixer we went . <p> The peanut butter , butter , and powdered sugar ( with vanilla and salt bonuses ) come together into a thick dough . Not dry , just thick . <p> I scooped out heaping tablespoons of dough , rolled the dough between my palms to create a compact peanut butter package . Onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Chilling the balls will help make them be easier to handle when it comes time for dipping . <p> Dark chocolate ( chips are great ! ) are melted in a double boiler . I added a tablespoon of coconut oil to the chocolate , helping it melt into a beautiful chocolate gloss , that hardens as it cools . <p> You can go for a full dip or a half dip . You decide ! <p> Packed in festive tins , or gathered in little holiday bags these peanut butter balls are an easy , happy , heartwarming way that I share tradition . They 're no-bake , so for sanitys sake , were in business . <p> I hope you 're happy and well this holiday season . Doing all of those small , happy , quirky moments that make your holiday feel keepsake special ! <p> In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment , combine peanut butter , butter , vanilla , salt , and half of the powdered sugar . <p> Blend on low speed until the mixture begins to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bowl , and add the remaining powdered sugar . Mix until thoroughly combined . The mixture will be very thick , but not dry . The powdered sugar should incorporate easily . <p> Remove the bowl from the stand and use a small cookie scoop to scoop dough and roll peanut butter balls between your hands to make a tight , round ball . Place on a parchment lined baking sheet . Refrigerate for at least 1 hour , or overnight . <p> In a heatproof bowl combine chocolate chunks and coconut oil . Place the bowl over a small pot of simmering water and let sit until chocolate begins to melt . Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and reduce heat so the water is just at a low simmer . <p> Remove the balls from the refrigerator and using your fingers , dip half of each ball into the melted chocolate , and return to the parchment lined sheet . Repeat until all balls are dipped and place in the refrigerator to chill and harden the chocolate . <p> Keep peanut butter balls covered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tins and stored in the refrigerator for gifting . Peanut butter balls last up to 2 weeks if covered well and cool . <p> These are great ! I make a variation of this treat , but with the addition of puffed rice cereal ( yes , Rice Krispies ! ) and a complete dunk in chocolate so they end up looking like truffles or bon-bons . They are my most requested recipe and its super easy . Its a 1-2-3 of ( 1 ) stick of butter , ( 2 ) cups of Jiff or any non-natural , commercial peanut butter your choice of smooth or crunchy , and ( 3 ) cups of powdered sugar and ( 3 ) cups of puffed rice cereal . Mix it all together first the butters , regular and peanut ; then add the sugar , then the cereal . Round into balls , place on foil wrapped cookie sheets , refrigerate for a bit . Then , melt down your chocolate I use Ghirardelli melting chocolate , usually the dark , over a water bath . Dip the chilled peanut butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long handled spoon , and let them cool and harden . You can also add festive sprinkles or glitter if you really want to get fancy while the chocolate is still warm . <p> I grew up in Ohio where the buckeye tree is the state tree . We made " buckeyes " too and dipped them to cover almost the entire ball , leaving just a small circle uncovered at one end so they look like the nuts of the buckeye tree .

Two flavors really but when you 're the mom you get to make up the rules . <p> My sisters flavor was I du n no , maybe buttermilk biscuit because she was always eating those in heaps . <p> Your preferred flavor is what appears on your birthday , when you bring home a good report card , or when you graduate from one thing or another . Its these little traditions that keep families in line , and gives order and reason to family celebrations . <p> If all falls into this reasoning , these Peanut Butter Black and Tan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wants to . <p> They 're cakey peanut butter cookies ( yes , just let it happen ) are topped with a glossy dark chocolate and a creamy peanut butter frosting . A classic Black and White Cookie gone tan with peanut butter . Max out on flavor because it is a very fine idea , especially with chocolate . <p> Butter is creamed to fluffy along with creamy peanut butter and sugar . <p> Its key here that the butter be very well softened or it wont properly incorporate into the peanut butter . Essentially I 'm saying , follow the rules this one makes a difference . <p> Eggs are beaten into the batter , one at a time until the mixture in beautifully fluffy and creamed . <p> The dry ingredients are added to the wet , and buttermilk is streamed into the batter , bringing it all together . <p> The batter will resemble a thick and scoopable cake batter . I used a large cookie scoop to scoop about 1/4-cup of batter onto a parchment lined sheet . <p> here 's some things to know : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this recipe . Better than foil , better than an unlined non-stick baking sheet go for the parchment ! <p> The cookies spread so theyll need about 2-inches on all sides to do their thing . <p> The bottoms of these cookies are actually the top so if you 're baking two sheets at a time , its a good idea to alternate them on the racks halfway through baking for even browning . <p> While the cookies cool , well make the peanut butter frosting and chocolate glaze . <p> here 's how we do . <p> Bottoms up , frost half of the bottom with chocolate frosting and the other half with glossy chocolate glaze . Allow the cookies to sit and rest . The glazey tops will crust over a bit , making them easier to individually wrap in plastic . <p> 3 tablespoons heavy cream ( plus more if necessary to make the frosting spreadable ) <p> To make the cookies , place a rack in the center and upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Beat in the vanilla extract . <p> In a medium bowl whisk together flour , baking soda , and salt . <p> Add the wet ingredients all at once to the butter mixture and beat on low speed . Stream in the buttermilk and beat until all of the flour disappears into the batter . Remove the bowl from the stand mixer ( or set aside the beaters ) and finish incorporating the dough with a spatula , making sure that everything is well combined . <p> The batter will resemble a fluffy , thick cake batter . <p> Use a large cookie scoop to scoop batter mounds onto the prepared baking sheets , leaving about 2-inches of space between each cookie . Each cookie is a scant 1/4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until cookies are golden around the edges and spread out , about 13 to 15 minutes . Remove from the oven and allow to rest on the baking sheet for 10 minutes . Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting . <p> To make the chocolate glaze , in a heatproof bowl combine chocolate , butter , and corn syrup . Bring a medium size pan with two inches of water to a simmer . Place the heatproof bowl over the simmering water , making sure that the bottom of the bowl does n't  touch the simmering water . Were creating a double boiler . Stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is glossy . Set aside to cool just slightly before glazing the cookies . <p> To make the peanut butter glaze , in a medium bowl combine peanut butter , butter , powdered sugar , salt , vanilla , and 2 tablespoons of cream .

Allow to rest so the glaze hardens a bit on the top for about 30 minutes . Wrap individually in plastic wrap to store . <h> Share <h> 36 comments <p> Thanks ! Just finished frosting and sampling : - ) I love that they are not overly sweet ( the only change I made was using dark chocolate because its my favourite ) . These are great snacking cookies . I cant wait for coffee break tomorrow . <p> We got to pick dinner on our birthdays and did n't  have to do any chores : ) I cant wait to make these I may get fancy and sprinkle some chopped peanuts on the chocolate side and a few cacao nibs on the peanut butter side . <p> Oh YUM ! Peanut butter and chocolate are my absolute favs ! ( I just saw a chocolate bunny in the store being sold with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that ) . Will definitely be trying these . <p> I think my childhood favourite must have been mint choc chip but we always seemed to have a tub of cheap Neapolitan ice cream in the freezer since it catered to at least three different tastes . It was pretty magical as a kid to have one scoop of ice cream with chocolate , vanilla and strawberry all intertwined . And yes to cheapo peanut butter , sometimes you want that stuff slathered on toast to comfort you . <p> Whenever a kid asks my husband what his favorite color is , he always says " green with pink dots , " which always throws the kid for a loop , like " I did n't  know we could have options like THAT ! " And you can see the wheels of the little mind churning . Two great tastes that taste great together . I could see adding chocolate chips to get some chocolate onto the peanut butter side . Just a few .

Do not overheat the mixture or it will curdle . <p> Remove from heat and immediately stir in the milk and cream mixture you set aside earlier . Strain through a fine mesh strainer . <p> Been making homemade eggnog for years with almost your identical recipeI use a combo of 1/2 cup bourbon , 1/2 cup brandy , and 1/2 cup dark rum , then adding the softly whipped egg whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before serving to mellow mmmmm -its been called " Killer nog " by all ! Such a treat ! You are such a joy , Joy ! <p> That 's what I do when I make eggnog . Fold whipped egg whites into the nog . It will make a delightful foam on top a la cappuccino . Also , Joy , do n't  be afraid to drink your eggnog while its still warm . Equally delicious ! <p> We were just talking about making our own eggnog . Have you seen the list of ingredients in the store nog ? Just hope I can find heavy cream without that carrageenan ( #%@ ! ) Also since rum is n't an option though yummy can I add a bit of yum extract ? <p> this one sounds as if it would be less " eggy " flavoredand recipes vary sooooo much . I have one that calls for the addition of beaten egg whites , another that calls for rum , bourbon and brandy.another yet that uses softened vanilla ice cream i like the sound of yours . thank you ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I suspect my husband will too . He loves rum , eggs and cream , so . Nutmeg not so much . At least it is n't cinnamon ( how many French people have I met who hate cinnamon ! ) . So much for fitting in my jeans . I always thought the eggs were raw , and that the storebought eggnog was some kind of industrialized pasteurized process . I learn something new every day . 
@@2115381 <h> My Favorite True Crime Podcasts <p> This is a post about what I do at home while reading the newspaper and eating spicy eggs and rice on a Sunday morning . It involves listening to podcasts about crime and murder . If that last sentence left you with wide eyes and a face or terror I know . Its ok . More food on Thursday . Carry on and good day . <p> Now <p> Do you want to talk to me about a murder mystery episode of 20/20 from 2002 ? We could . I could tell you all about the suspicious shoe prints in the slow leading out of the master bedrooms patio door . I could tell you that the wife did n't  just disappear leaving her children . We could talk about how suspicious the husbands 911 call was . We could speculate all night because I have THEORIES ! Ive thought about it a lot likely too much . <p> here 's the thing- you know that I have a mind for butter and sugar and biscuits and bacon . You get it . Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past nine years . I also have a mind for true crime . Its dark , yall . Have you seen every episode of Forensic Files , too ? Its where you go when Law and Order Criminal Minds just is n't cutting it . Its real life stories of people and their people , the stories of times cut short and the insane circumstances that surround trying to catch the awful people who commit terrible crimes . <p> Maybe you 're like me . Maybe you 're deeply horrified by me . Maybe you 're confused and curious . I understand every range of emotion . If you 're like me . If you 're a murderino ( listen to the My Favorite Murder podcast and you 'll understand ) , here are a list of some of my favorite true crime podcasts . Some are really well-produced stories , others are more casual ( inappropriate word choice ? ) and conversational ( again with the word choice ) . BUT , if you 're like me you 've likely binge-listened to all of these . In that case . What else are you listening to ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ears on a plane , I 'm listening to a murder podcast , taking mental notes as to not get murdered myself , and I 'm feeling deeply suspicious of the man sitting next to me because you neeeeever know until you know . <p> My Favorite MurderIf you 'd like to dip your toe into the true crime genre , you might need a friend or two . Hilarious , easy to laugh , sharp and clever friends who make no qualms about their obsession for crime and murder . Meet Georgia Hardstark and Karen Kilgariff . Let them talk to you about crime and murder and life and cats . I recommend starting from the beginning and just letting it wash over you . Really the only way ( this is not a true statement ) to not get murdered is to be VERY well-educated and well-researched about murder.Georgia and Karen understand this and that 's why were staying sexy and NOT getting murdered ( for as long as we can help it ) . <p> AccusedBrought to us by the Cincinnati Inquirer , is this thoughtful and compelling telling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1978 . The police immediately pointed their police-y fingers and her boyfriend , but two juries disagreed . What happened ? What the heck happened ? I cried at the end of this podcast , spoiler alert . <p> In The DarkI found myself listening to this podcast in my headphones ( I think they 're called earbuds now but I do n't  know when that changed or how official it is ) at Target , in the kitchen towel aisle , with my heads covering my face in horror if that 's any indication of this supremely tragic 1989 kidnapping . Its the story of Jacob Wetterling , his friends , his town , his family , and how the case was just solved late last year , 27 years after his disappearance . <p> StranglersHave you ever heard of the Boston Strangler ? Follow up question : do you have any idea how strange that string of murders in the 1960s was ? There was more than one strangler , and my goodness it was hard to be a woman and stay alive in Boston between 1962 and 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized crime , political corruption , great accents , Providence Rhode Island . I listened to much of this podcast while our gardening one afternoon and when I emerged from my podcast immersion I had bizarre knowledge of very specific Rhode Island politics and a little bit of a mob mouth . No apologies . <h> Share <h> 104 comments <p> I stopped listening to Sword &amp; Scale after it was revealed that he was sending inappropriate messages to his female fans and plagiarized a whole episode from a Rolling Stone article . There has been a lot of shadiness around the creator . I really love MFM , Generation Why , Someone Knows Something and All Killa No Filla . I also recommend frequently The Last Podcast on the Left . They do n't  just cover true crime , they also dip into conspiracy theories , cults , and other horrors . With their serial killer episodes ( and honestly pretty much all their topics ) they do insane amounts of research and are incredibly thorough . I will say their humor is not for everyone , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and definitely not PC but when its hosted by three dudes , two of which are comedians you would n't expect less . <p> Sword and Scale is not my favorite " literally found it affecting my mood in a way I could n't shake . BUT I love true crime generally ! <p> I really enjoyed Undisclosed . Their first season they dove into the Adnan Syed case , but more deeply from the legal ins and outs . Their second season they explored an interesting wrongful conviction in Georgia . I have n't listened to any of the new season yet . <p> Criminal is also great " 20-30 minute episodes on all things criminal . Some are bizarre crimes , some are from a victims perspective , etc . <p> Serial ( season 1 ) was my gateway podcast for this genre . ( Before that I was all about Rescue 911 and 20/20 as a kid ) I 've got the same line-up as you and I do like Sword &amp; Scale , but I can not listen to the episodes about pedophilia and child abuse too too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also covers cult killings/activity , which I am so fascinated by . And Georgia and Karen joke about not forcing anyone to listen to the 911 recordings , but sometimes they 're insanely entertaining . <p> It does feel weird to admit to enjoying this stuff in mixed company , but I think it is about educating yourself , ESPECIALLY as a woman . F*ck Politeness , yo . <p> I always knew I liked you and now I know why ( besides the food , duh ) . I 've listened to all the ones you recommended , but Crimetown was a definite favorite . <p> Try homecoming next . Its made by the same team that does Crimetown , but its fiction . I did n't  think I 'd like it , but its SO good . It has Ross from friends and the older chick from 40 year old virgin . Its short and definitely worth a listen . <p> Also , a podcast about other podcast and all things true crime ( they often recommend new things to watch/listen/read ) is Crime Writers On . <p> Oh and Bowraville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kind of gruesome and hard to listen to at times , but in the best way . You know what I mean . <p> Sword and Scale is okay , but sometimes I have to turn it off because it gets too ridiculous . He s very into sensationalizing the crime while adamantly insisting that crime is not to be sensationalized . One podcast I love that is not all glitz and glamour is Dan Zupanskys True Murder : The Most Shocking True Crimes in History and the Authors that Wrote About Them . Perfectionism is not his style , which is what I love about him . <p> Sword and Scale is a great podcast but some of the episodes get REALLY dark ! I have had to skip over some of them . The creator/narrator does a great job on researching the cases though , and I usually think about them for days after listening . I recommend it to anyone who loves true crime ! <p> Up until a few days ago I would not have been interested in this post . BUT . A friend recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm hooked ! I might have to check out another crime podcast nextthough I do notice that I 'm feeling more scared at being alone or in the dark , which is probably not something I need more of in my life ! <p> HI Joy ! ! ! MFM got me hooked and now I 'm listening to most of those you posted . I have to say this you will love Sword and Scale . But it is dark at times . Like -Ive have to pull out my earbuds to keep from vomiting-dark . But well researched and soooo terrifyingly good . Listen then go back to Georgia and Karen for some comic relief . Stay sexy ! ! <p> Ooo , I love this list will definitely check these out . I am so morbidly curious about true crime and I 'm glad I 'm not the only one ! Have you ever tried All Killa No Filla ? It sounds a little like My Favorite Murder based on your description its deep dives into the lives of serial killer by two lady comedians with some rather hilarious asides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you made me laugh out loud , " were staying sexy and NOT getting murdered " ! Perhaps I laughed so hard because I too understand how intriguing murder stories can be . However , I keep it light with fictionalized shows like " Elementary " and " Rizzoli and Isles " , otherwise I would never get to sleep at night . <p> I used to be such an addict of mysteries ( murder or not ) , but I did notice that I started sleeping much better when I swore off TV and the typical French lineup of U.S. cop shows ( dubbed . nothing worse than lips not matching sound ) . Some of them are so sick , and I do n't  mean that in the complimentary way . True murder stories would be even worse , because somebody really was that sick . That said , I have long been a podcast addict ( podcasts were a lifesaver when I moved out of NPR reception ) . I binge on economics and politics , which are horrors in a different way .

@@2115383 <h> Grapefruit Curd in Grapefruit Cake <p> We had an avocado tree in our backyard growing up , in one of the more concrete-y neighborhoods of central Los Angeles . It was the humble avocado tree behind the kinda-rusted , maybe a little dangerous , still totally playable swing set in our patchygrass , mangy dog wandering , backyard . <p> I think of the relentless to-do list my parents upheld while my sister and I were kids things like : go to work , survive work , have food in the house , pay the light bill , raise not asshole children having a fluffy-grassed backyard was n't a huge priority . But this avocado tree in the corner of backyard was a little oasis ! I should tell you now that it had no avocados . Never did . Not even one time I know because I would check ALL THE TIME . It did however , provide a small ring of shade at most points in the afternoon and it was a fine tree with upstanding morals and values . <p> At some point in my 18 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard , someone mentioned that we had a male avocado tree which well , it seemed rather strange that this tree would have a gender . I often wondered ( once I was old enough to wonder such things ) , if there was a female avocado tree in a neighboring backyard that was just bursting with fruit because of our humble , unassuming , un-avocado-ing male avocado tree . <p> Likely not . Its not that we had a male avocado tree , its that avocado trees have this very delicate fruit bearing system . I know you 're curious so I 'll explain it to you before we talk about grapefruit cake . Were definitely going to talk about cake . See avocado tree flowers have both male and female parts but they do n't  release those parts at the same time . A flower opens and releases its female parts first . Closes . Then the male parts open , and then close . All the while waiting for the right bee at the right time to take the right pollen to the right flower . AKA : Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our avocado tree for them to both pollinate and flourish and provide more than greenery and shade . <p> I say all of this to say that big beautiful fruit ( were talking about grapefruit now ) that emerges from small flowers is , if you think about it and were thinking about it , AMAZING and should be turned to curd and into cake ( and if you 're an avocado , definitely guacamole ) . If you 're lucky enough to have a grapefruit ( or avocado ) tree in your backyard or in your neighbors yard within stealing distance you should hug it and thank all of the bees around you . <p> And now were going to make a cake . <p> Curd and cake . Both with grapefruit . Both from scratch . <p> First the curd . Citrus curd , which we should be making my the pint-full right now , is a rich , slow stove top custard with grapefruit juice and a pinch of ground cloves . <p> To start the curd , grapefruit juice ( fresh squeezed is preferable ) is simmered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor . While the juice simmers , butter and sugar are whipped together in a heat-proof metal bowl . This bowl will turn into a double boiler , so we need it to conduct heat . <p> Egg yolks are whisked into the butter and sugar mixture . Egg yolks and whole eggs will work to thicken the curd . <p> How long before were weirded out by the word curd ? Is it already happening ? ( Yes . ) <p> The reduced grapefruit juice is cooled slightly and whisked into the butter , sugar and egg mixture . Whisked well , it becomes a bit frothy on top . Were on the right track . <p> In a small pot , bring a few inches of water to a boil and place the metal bowl over the simmering water . Its a double boiler , and its a gentle way to coax our eggs into slowly thickening into a spreadable curd . <p> With constant whisking ( which means no multi-tasking ) the mixture will thicken to a warm pudding consistency after 8 to 10 minutes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Easy cake times thanks to Food52 . Were not going to over-complicate things here . <p> Softened butter and sugar are creamed together with grapefruit zest until very pale and fluffy . Hand mixer or stand mixer , but really fluff the butter . <p> The grapefruit curd is cooled slightly and 3/4 cup of our tangy grapefruit curd is added to the butter and sugar mixture . <p> The batter is spooned into an 8-inch pan and another 3/4 cup of grapefruit curd is lightly swirled into the batter . <p> Were great . Now is a good time to acknowledge that . <p> Baked to golden brown , the curd caramelizes a bit while the cake is tremendously tender . <p> Its the prefect afternoon tea cake , or morning coffee cake , or midnight snack with milk cake . Its cake . Whenever and however . This is the kind of cake you hope to casually have on hand when your neighbors casually drop by unexpected on a weekend afternoon . You hope hope hope that the stars align and you have this cake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows , and see if you can lure them over . <p> To make the grapefruit curd , in a small saucepan , simmer grapefruit juice . Simmer and reduce from 1 cup to 1/2 cup . Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly . <p> In a medium heatproof bowl ( a metal bowl is best ) , stir together butter and granulated sugar until well incorporated and fluffy . I used a wooden spoon and some elbow grease . Using a whisk , add the egg yolks and whisk to combine . Add the eggs , one at a time , beating for one minute between each addition . Whisk in the salt and cloves and lemon juice . The mixture will seem slightly curdled . That 's ok . Slowly stream in and whisk the slightly cooled grapefruit juice until evenly combined . <p> In a small or medium saucepan ( I used the same saucepan I used to reduce the grapefruit juice ) , bring a few inches of water to a simmer . Place the heatproof bowl over the simmering water , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simmering water . <p> Whisk constantly . The sugar will begin to dissolve and the mixture will begin to thicken . This take between 8 and 10 minutes of near constant whisking . If you stop whisking , the eggs in the mixture may create lumps so keeeeeep whisking . <p> Once thickened to the texture of warm pudding , remove the bowl from the simmering water and transfer to a small bowl . Allow to rest in the refrigerator while you make the cake . <p> Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of an 8-inch round baking pan with parchment paper , grease the pan and set aside . <p> To make the cake , in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment , or in a large bowl with a set of hand beaters , beat together butter , sugar , and grapefruit zest until pale and fluffy , 3 to 5 minutes . Add half of the grapefruit curd and beat to combine . Add the eggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each addition . Add the flour and use a wooden spoon to fold together until thoroughly combined . <p> Spoon the batter into the prepared pan . Top with the remaining grapefruit curd and use a butterknife swirl the curd just slightly into the cake . Bake for 35 to 45 minutes until a skewer inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs . <p> Allow to cool for 15 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely . <h> Share <h> 44 comments <p> These are my favorite types of cakes , the everyday ones that feel at home both as a rustic-ish desert and an indulgent-ish breakfast . If I had a grapefruit tree my fridge would constantly be full of grapefruit curd . Alas , I 'm an apartment dweller in Minnesota , and its not in the cards . <p> Thanks for the lesson on avocado reproduction , btw .

It fruits heavily year round , but the produce is only edible for maybe a month of the year when the weather is sufficiently cold for them to sweeten up a bit . I suppose now is as good a time as ever to pluck a few and see if I cant make a curd . <p> Awesome ! I love curds ( even the word ) and I love grapefruit and I just know I 'm going to love this cake . Ill be in your city this weekend celebrating le carnaval , with big plans to make this as soon as I get back ( and sleep off the inevitable hangover ) .

And not just any cake , but the perfect summer cake with sweet milk , sweet cream , spongy cake , and sprinkles because cake is barely cake without sprinkles . <p> Tres Leches is decadent but mischievously light thanks , somehow , to whipped cream and sponge cake . Its served chilled and can easily be filed under refreshing and holy cow this cake is good desserts . <p> Let 's celebrate these days . The best way ? Cake .

We want to make sure that the ultra moist cake moves easily from the cake pan to the plate and from the plate to my mouth . <p> In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salt to incorporate evenly . <p> The base of our Tres Leches Cake is a sponge cake which means were separating eggs a lot of them . <p> Were going to beat the egg yolks with sugar to add richness to the cake , but not before we whip egg whites to a fluff , creating the lightest , most bouncy sponge . Its all that bounce that will absorb our milks and sink into the most luscious of cakes . <p> Egg whites are ready for mixing . <p> To get the most fluff out of your egg whites : <p> Make sure there are no trace bits of egg yolk mixed into your whites . <p> Make sure that your mixing bowl and whisk are clean , dry , and free of grease . Do n't  be obsessive about it , but kinda be obsessive about it . <p> Add a pinch of cream of tartar to the beating eggs .

Were adding volume and air to this cake everywhere we can . <p> Once the egg yolks are whipped to pale and thick , we add our dry ingredients until just combined ! <p> Did you notice that there 's no butter in this cake ? Two reasons . Plenty of egg yolks bring fat and create a rich cake . AND we want our cake to be fairly dry so most of the mouth-watering fat and moisture comes from the three milks . Were starting with a dry cake so it can support being a very wet cake . <p> Fold in the egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the batter thoroughly and keeping the precious aerated egg whites present in the batter . Just make sure all of the white pockets have been mixed in . You can find the balance I know ! <p> Pour the light batter into the prepared pan and bake to golden puffed and golden brown . <p> And , not a thing to worry about ! We wo n't stick . <p> While the cake bakes , stir together the milks : heavy cream , evaporated milk ( maybe you want to use coconut milk here if you 're feeling wild ) , and sweetened condensed milk ( the hero of this milk story ) . Add a dash of vanilla extract and an extra dash of bourbon or rum because life is for living . <p> Whip of the whipped cream frosting too ! Its just cream and sugar and vanilla extract .

Torn cake is sad . <p> Here we go . <p> Were only getting better with time . <p> The milks are slowly poured over the cake . Allowing them to seep and soak as you go . <p> I found that this amount of milk was just perfect for the cake . If you know you like your cake less milk moistened , stop about 1/2 cup short . But really its all so good . You wo n't go wrong . <p> Whipped cream is spread across and to the edges of the cake .

Its Summer and the markets are bursting with sweet fruit flavors . Let 's get at em ! <p> Plums are perfect just as they are . Deep purple skin . Tart with just a hint of snap when you bite through . Sweet insides . Sour as you reach the pit . They 're exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the deep purple skin is dark enough to tint the finished sorbet a lovely shade of fuchsia . <p> Pitted and sliced plums are boiled in a mixture of sugar and water . <p> Boiled to softened . Boiled to almost jam . <p> The plums will fall apart . The skins will separate from the fruit flesh and tint the sugar water a lovely purple . <p> A blender gets us one step closer to sorbet . <p> The cooked fruit and sugar mixture is blended completely . Skins and all . No need to strain . Everything is everything . <p> The mixture will be hot ( it was boiling fruit ) when it goes into the blender . You may need to blend in two batches . Do n't  be cavalier . <p> The blended plum will need some quality chilling time in the refrigerator . Literal chilling not just relaxing . <p> It helps if the mixture is completely cold before its churned into a bright pink sorbet . <p> Smooth and glossy , soft and sweet . This sorbet is perfectly scoop able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar makes this sorbet creamy smooth and not icy . I also love the little bits of skin . <p> Top with chopped salted pistachios and even a bit of chopped dark chocolate to balance the plum sorbet sweetness . <p> In a large saucepan over medium heat , stir together water and sugar until the sugar is dissolved . <p> Add the sliced plum , a pinch of salt and stir . Allow to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes , until the plums begin to soften and breakdown . You might even find that the skins separate from the flesh of the fruit . The sugar water will be tinted purple . That 's exactly right . <p> Once the fruit is softened , remove from heat and transfer to a blender . You may need to do this in two batches but I managed it in one . Add the fruit and liquid to the blender , make sure the lid is secure , place a clean towel over the lid and blend until smooth . <p> The mixture will still be hot . Place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until chilled through . Leaving it overnight to chill is best . <p> When ready to churn , remove from the refrigerator and stir in the lime juice and vodka ( if using ) . Follow your ice cream machine instructions to churn to a thick , soft , sorbet . Transfer to a freezer-safe container and allow to rest in the freezer for at least 4 hours before scooping and serving . <h> Share <h> 42 comments <p> This looks absolutely gorgeous ! I love your writing , too . I 've never thought about using ponytails like an extension of a hand gesture , but its so true . I totally want to try plum sorbet now ! Thanks for the recipe ! xx Sydney 
@@2115397 <h> Brennans New Orleans Shrimp Creole <p> There 's a definite change in the air . I know because I have n't heard the on-click of my air conditioner in days . <p> I thought , for a solid thirty seconds or so that I was cold . Down here in the swamp , there 's just that tiny bit of chill in the air and there 's more to come we just know it . <p> There 's also a definite change in my kitchen . Maybe its because I 've been in New Orleans for some good years , maybe its because I 'm paying a mortgage instead of rent maybe maybe maybe I 'm just starting to FEEL IT deep down in my guts but I 'm just starting to feel comfortable cooking cajun + creole food in my kitchen . <p> here 's the thing : there are 1,001 places to get amazing Creole food around the city . Were talking classic places that know exactly what they 're doing , exactly how to make a perfect martini , exactly how to summon an actual marching jazz band to shine through the restaurant at just the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go ! ) <p> here 's the other things : Its sometimes hard to nail down just the right recipe . A recipe that you can hold in your hands and say yea , this is it ! That 's because , as with most special , regional cuisine it has a lot to do with who taught you and how it feels . When you do n't  have a Louisiana grandmother to show you the ropes you have to improvise and the classic Brennans New Orleans Cookbook is n't a bad place to get started . The flavors are simple but layered and it all starts with an onion , a bell pepper and some celery . The rest is a combination of time , spice , shrimp , laughter , fluffy rice and good company . <p> here 's my version of Shrimp Creole . Heavily influences by Brennans ( a classic , to be sure ) , with an extra kick from jalapeno and vegetable broth . <p> Creole cooking the base , the roots , the floor of everything is the Trinity : onions , green bell peppers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh garlic and fresh ( seeded ) jalapeno for an extra layer of spice just because because . <p> The Trinity+ is sauteed to soft , and fresh tomatoes are added . <p> Canned tomatoes ? Sure , you could . A big can of tomatoes would do ya . <p> Let 's get these spices going . <p> Well start with sweet paprika . <p> I added an all-purpose Creole Seasoning that has salt , pepper , garlic and onion powder , a little bit of oregano , a little bit of spice just a lot of very good news . <p> Spicy cayenne pepper to balance out the earthy sweetness . <p> Vegetable broth to thin the mixture to a soup and help the tomatoes cook down to soft and pliable . <p> To the simmered tomato mixture goes the raw peeled shrimp . <p> To thicken the tomatoe-y sauce just slightly , well mix a few spoonfuls of the simmering mixture in a small bowl with cornstarch . Back into the shrimp mixture boil a bit and thicken slightly . <p> Shrimp is cooked to a soft pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served with a cup of rice and green onions . Its fresh and warm and comforting and pleasingly Louisiana . Between soup and not-soup , sweet and hearty and spicy . that 's right ! <p> In a large saucepan over medium heat olive oil . Add the bell pepper , onion , and celery and saute for 6 minutes , until some of the water cooks out and the vegetables begin to brown , Add garlic and jalapeno and saute for 2 minutes more . <p> Add the tomatoes and stir to combine . Cook down for 5 to 7 minutes . <p> Stir in the paprika , cayenne , and salt . Stir to combine . <p> Add the broth and bay leaf and simmer for 30 minutes , uncovered . <p> Add the shrimp and cook for 12 minutes more . <p> Place cornstarch in a small bowl . Use a ladle to spoon some shrimp creole liquid to the cornstarch and whisk until smooth . Add the mixture to the simmering pot and simmer for 3 minutes more until thickened slightly . <p> Made this last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put some frozen tortellini in the broth before thickening . It was FIRE . ( And whatever , I live in New Orleans and am from Lafayette , so I get enough authentic rice-based dishes in my life . ) <p> An excellent creole sauce warms the soul . I have used a cornstarch slurry for a gumbo zherbes but roux for everything else . Please get a cookbook called RECIPES AND REMINICENCES OF New Orleans . Your mad baking and cooking skills would be wonderful with CALAS . ( Page 182 ) ? ? ? ? <p> If you do go the slurry route though , I 'd thicken before adding the shrimp , just to make sure that the shrimp do n't  over cook . When we make either shrimp creole or gumbo , I only put in enough shrimp for that meals servings , so the shrimp left in the broth do n't  go chewy in the leftovers . Gumbo &amp; creole are always better the second day . <p> I had no idea there was an actual difference ! I 'm still beyond jealous you get to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing . I know those flavors well and they are my favorite ! Also , i love the plates you have them on ! Adorable ! <p> This sounds quite delish , but one quibble : I find it very hard to believe that Brennans would thicken anything with a cornstarch slurry . In all my years of living in New Orleans , I 've never seen a local cook thicken any savory dish ( etoufee , gumbo , whatever ) with any agent other than roux . <p> I know what you mean about having such good restaurant options , why bother to DIYits what I often think about French food here . But sometimes we just feel like staying home . On Tuesdays we have fish in summer and soup in winter . This is perfect for a ( warm ! ) rainy fall day . Vive New Orleans !

Its mostly food and lots of New Orleans . I hope you 'll find some inspiration for yourself : <p> From left to right , left to right , each row : <p> @antiguafloral Sara is a fantastic floral designer here in New Orleans .

@@2115402 <h> Future Freezer Smoothies : a plan <p> Its certainly not the case that you need someone to tell you how to make a smoothie . Put a melange ( this is my word of the week ) of fruits into a blender , add a liquid , find the blender lid , hold onto your hat ( figuratively , mostly ) , and blend the mixture up . Pour into a glass . Convince yourself you 're about to drink a milkshake . Place the blender in the sink , fill it with water , and neglect to clean it for two days . Decide you want another smoothie , curse yourself for leaving the blender in the sink for so long , wash , and well do the hold dang thing over again . <p> So . Now that we have that mutual understanding , I want to introduce you to the VERY low-tech meal-planning happening that 's going down in my kitchen these days . It involves freezer bags , a little time , about 11% of brain power , bananas and berries that are about to lose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a podcast to pass the time . <p> There are a lot of prohibitive factors when it comes to making smoothies . Mostly its the fact that I 'm often out of one very important ingredient : no banana , no almond milk , no desire to actually drink a smoothie . You know . The best intentions can go sideways pretty quickly . <p> By combining smoothie bags made of single-portioned fruit , nuts , and butters , and keeping them in the freezer- all you need in the refrigerator is your milk or juice of choice and you 're smoothie bound . <p> I swear its simple ! <p> here 's how this goes : <p> Grab several sandwich-size sealing freezer bags . Earth-friendly note : consider using freezer-safe tupperware OR stick with sandwich bags , rinse them and reuse them several times . I reuse my bags and really they stay very clean once the fruit and veggies come out ! <p> What sort of fruit do you have that 's going bad ? What do you like in smoothies ? Bananas and berries are a great place to start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pick a green . I chose spinach . <p> In each bag place a handful of greens , a handful of sliced strawberries or whole blueberries , and half a banana ( sliced ) . <p> Add a dollop of almond butter , if you 'd like . <p> Add a few raw cashews or walnuts , if you 'd like . <p> Add a sprinkle of whole flax seeds or chia seeds ( these buggers will thicken a smoothie when blended so go easy ) . <p> Fold and seal the bag , label the outside with the date and ingredients using a permanent marker , and store in the freezer until ready to use ! <p> When you 're ready for a smoothie well , first things first , you 'll feel like you 're a real genius who is lookin out for yourself . Place the frozen fruit in a blender , add a cup of milk or juice ( you might add more depending on how thick you like things to be ) . Blend and tahdaaah ! Frozen fruit makes for the best smoothies and you 're a success . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink , fill it with water , and neglect to clean it for two days .

Its like everyone has come out of their lazy summer slumber , outdoor restaurant seats fill , sunset walk are more neighborly , everyone is less sweaty and heat-frayed . <p> New Orleaneans welcomes any and every reason to decorate a porch and wear a wig so the upcoming Halloween holiday is about to turn up the volume in the whole city . Get here . Get ready . <p> Here are my ten favorite things to do and places to visit in New Orleans this Fall ! <p> 1 The Fly A park on the back side of the Audubon Zoo in the Uptown neighborhood of New Orleans . The Fly is a locals spot , right along the Mississippi River . Peaceful and lovely . The perfect place to enjoy an early dinner / cheese picnic / to-go daiquiri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious ! The Fried Chicken and Biscuit with a fried egg is beyond ! And if you sit in the back of the restaurant , you can gaze lovingly inside their open kitchen if that 's your thing . Also really wonderful , the oysters ! So much good ! #HiltonAtPlay <p> 3 Sucre Bakery on Magazine St is my late Fall morning go-to . Black coffee , a small plate of macarons and some dreamy eyes towards their other beautiful cakes . Sucre is art . My favorite are the pistachio and strawberry macarons but everything is pretty pretty and tasty too ! <p> Also ! The makers of Sucre have a restaurant in the French Quarter . I have n't been yet , but check out Salon by Sucre if you 're in town ! <p> 4 My must lunch with a Pimms Cup is the Fried Shrimp Po Boy atParkway Bakery . Do it . Do n't  ask any questions . 5 A trip to the track ! New Orleans is a place that feels like no where else on earth . I feel like a visit to the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses are out and running around ! Fairgrounds Race Course . 6 Cochonisnt seasonal , but it is a must eat ! Order the grilled oysters , the shrimp and bacon sandwich and every cocktail with bourbon . You 're welcome . Actually , I have nothing to do with it Donald Link does all the work . 7 Early evening sazeracs at The Sazerac Bar inside the historic Roosevelt Hotel . Essential . Maybe even over-dress a little . You would n't want to be outdone by the artwork . 8 I love walking around the French Quarter just before Halloween . The quarter feels ancient and haunted on its own , but the homage to Halloween is strong . Do you know about the hauntedThe LaLaurie House ? The history is terrifying . Here are the entryway Halloween decorations of the LaLaurie house , a reference to the grisly owners Dr Louis andDelphine LaLaurie . New Orleans takes its hauntings very seriously . 9 A less gruesome walk through the modern art museum . There 's a lot of great art in this city . Museum time ! 10 Get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most lovely city to explore on foot . One of my favorite things to do is this self-guided Garden District walking tour . Have I convinced you ?

You have highlighted exactly the things I want to do . I plan to eat good food , listen to good music , and check off this list ! Thanks Joy ! <p> A few years ago I spent two days in New Orleans for a conference .

These tacos with their spicy crema hot sauce were the definition of divinity . I loved how they were fried up almost like an empanada . Made it so much easier for the drunk and clumsy hipster in all of us to devour .

@@2115421 <h> What Makes A Great Cookbook ? <p> Ive been thinking a lot about what makes a great cookbook . I 'm currently working on my third book ( wow ) about Brunch and as it carefully , lovingly , stressfully , curiously , and haphazardly takes shape , I think a lot about how to make it great . <p> Great is both elusive and subjective . I think its about being of service , being creative , communicating what 's beautiful about food and what 's beautiful about life . Easy . Super easy . Luckily , I have shelves full of useful , beautiful , encouraging , inspiring downright GREAT cookbooks to absorb as I make my own . <p> Let 's talk about cookbooks : the good , the great , the inspiring . <p> So much of the information we take in comes from our computer screens , our phone screens , our electronic books ( is that what they 're called ? ) . One thing we 've lost in this new transmission of information is FEEL . A great cookbook feels good to the fingertips . Its the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run your hands over before opening . Feel , for savoring . One feel-good cookbook in my collection is Jamie At Home . Its canvas cover , thick paper , and colorfully playful interior make it feel just special , every time I take it down from the shelf . <p> I eat with my eyes . Ok so I mostly use my mouth , but my eyeballs have a lot to do with how much I enjoy what I eat . A great cookbook often has really stellar photography . Mouth-watering , hunger-inducing , bright-light food photography . I always reach for The Kitchy Kitchen when I need inspiration for approachable , everyday food . The photography is clean , simple , special and just makes me feel like I 'm living a good good life . <p> Some of my favorite cookbooks have a laser point focus , or a specific niche to tease out . Such focused cookbooks can be a wealth of knowledge like little cooking encyclopedias . I love The Perfect Eggfor all things eggy from breakfast to dessert , and an old cookbook calledThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of my favorite baking books of all time : The Cake Bible it really is . <p> I call upon a part of my brain called my Food Brain to think up the recipes I post here and in my cookbooks . Its not rocket surgery but my Food Brain needs feeding . Great cookbooks are out-of-the-box and mega creativity . Hellloooooo : Momofuku Milk Bar Cookbook . Related : Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow Cookies . Be about it . <p> I 'm a self-taught baker . Translation : I do n't  make very good baguettes and I 've messed up more chocolate mousse than I care to mention . For me , great cookbooks are those that nail me with technique . Its about rules and regulations . I splurged on this Advanced Bread and Pastryjust after I had finagled my way into my first bakery job . It was a tremendous help in terms of technique and ratios . School yourself or let Julia Child school you : Mastering The Art of French Cooking . Classic and essential . <p> This is barely the tip of the iceberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention . There are many more great cookbooks coming out this Fall ! Well talk about those soon . I 'm really excited . <h> Share <h> 42 comments <p> I 'm all about the little stuff ( I 'm an editor in real life so that makes sense ) . Are the ingredient lists on the same page as the instructions ? That big photo is beautiful , but if it means Im going to spend the entire cooking time flipping pages , ugh . And are all the details right ? Pan size listed ? Temperatures correct ? Carrots shredded or chopped ? Its all in the details ! <p> I love to borrow cookbooks from the library for a constant ( free ) source of inspiration ! Sometimes I 'm looking for a specific author/type of food , but other times I pick one up randomly and flip through it . I 'm looking for lots of pictures , some words that catch my eye and make me want to stop and readreadread , and for at least 3 of the recipes I skim past to be something I want to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorites to my bookshelf at home ! ! <p> Great list ! I 'm a huge fan of Kitchy Kitchen too . I love her food style . I love your food style as well and I 've made several of your recipes . You have been a big inspiration to me as I am a self taught baker as well . : - ) <p> I totally agree with Allysas comment ; I love cookbooks that give me a photo for every recipe ! I do n't  want to have to image what the dish will look like show me ! I 'm WAY more likely to purchase and use a cookbook that 's full of beautiful images . <p> Congrats on your upcoming cookbook ! Ca n't wait to hear more about the project and see the final result : ) <p> I have over 150 cookbooks , so I do n't  even know where to begin . My favorites are Marcella Hazans Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking , Fuschia Dunlops Every Grain of Rice , Jennifer Reeses Make the Bread , Buy the Butter , Amanda Hessers The Essential New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor-Antoine dAvila-Latourrette . I 've never made a bad recipe from any of the above books , and I also love just reading them . I also love flipping through the Canal House small editions books for inspiration and dreaming . <p> For me , its GOT to have a photo on ( nearly ) every page . A cookbook with just the 10 color photos in the middle ? Never going to buy that . All of my favorite cookbooks that I use heavily include a photo on nearly every page ( your Homemade Decadence is my go to baking-everything I 've made gets rave reviews ! ) , and I also agree with your idea of " niche " . I love checking out cookbooks at the library and trying new things , but I only actually BUY the ones with great photography , spread thorughout . Sarah M <p> Dories book is one of the most butter stained and cream spilled on my shelves . She inspires me whenever I need a boost , a crowd-pleasing dessert , or a spirit-boosting treat . Another one of my faves is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she 's still a queen ! <p> For me , what makes a great cookbook is having a picture with every ( or at least almost every ) recipe . When I 'm looking through cookbooks to make my dinner menu each week , I flip through and wait for the pictures to grab me . The few books I have that only have one picture every 15 pages do n't  get looked at thoroughly because I rely on the picture to jump at out at me and tell me what to make . Its the same thing when I 'm looking for something to bakeif i cant see a picture that makes me say " mmmm I should make that " , I probably wo n't make it . <p> The greatest cookbooks are those that you can both read for inspiration AND use for specific recipes . That means they need to be light enough to hold in bed , but they need enough heft to stay open on the counter and not have tiny cutesy fonts . <p> I just love this post . There is nothing better than curling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barefoot Contessa and NIgella Lawson are 2 of my favorites . In response to LAZYW , I love the Kitchen Witch too . I can spend hours there on my trips to NOLA . Really looking forward to your Brunch book Joy . <p> I am so excited for you , congrats ahead of time on Brunch ! Ill be owning it for sure . One of my favorite places in the French Quarter ( in the whole world ! ) is a little cook book shop called Kitchen Witch I think . Have you been ? My gosh . I spend a couple of hours browsing there every time we visit NOLA . They have rare books , new releases sometimes , cool stuff , and music and neat old kitcheny items like aprons . Light strings everywhere , haha . Plus they sell a custom spice mix that I can not live without for cooking here at the farm . So good . One of my favorite " great " cookbooks is by Elizabeth David . Gorgeous . But I am really looking forward to your next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be a completely unique method/flavor/idea , or just something i do n't  know much about . and how many recipes i want to make ; if i bookmark the first 5 , its usually a good sign ( ; also if you 're willing to lug it with you when you go backpacking ( this may have happened with " the cake bible " a couple years ago while i was extremely stupid ) .

@@2115427 <h> Caramelized Banana Oatmeal Breakfast <p> There 's an alarming trend in food these days . Its as though we 've run out of things to put a fried egg on because now trendy breakfast places are putting fried eggs on their oatmeal . <p> Are you into this ? <p> I 've always used a bowl of breakfast oatmeal as an excuse for brown sugar essentially as an excuse to make dessert out of breakfast . For this reason , I simply can not accept a friend egg and a sauteed green on my oatmeal . If I 'm going to egg and green through breakfast , I 'm going to need a potato reward . <p> To amp up the dessert value of our breakfast , I 'm adding warm caramelized bananas , up with ground cinnamon and toasted pecans , to warm oatmeal . Honey-swirled greek yogurt is the cooling factor to this hearty steel-cut oatmeal . <p> In a small saucepan I melted butter with brown sugar , salt , and a touch of cream . Over medium heat the mixture comes together into a warm bubbling dream . Its luscious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , and warm through . <p> Thick tart yogurt meets pourable raw honey . <p> For me one of the best things in life . <p> Steel cut oats soak up a good amount of water to soften . The mixture will still be thick , not very sweet , and honestly a little moppy . That 's the best word I have to describe it . <p> Layered for breakfast . Softened oats , caramelized bananas with a bit of the caramel , a big dollop of yogurt , and a sprinkling of cinnamon and pecans . Its delicious sweet and just right . While the bananas caramelize you may be tempted to add a splash of rum and set the whole thing on fire but were still breakfasting and we 've got to keep it right and tight . The sweetness is treat indeed . <p> Start by making the oats . In a medium saucepan , bring water to a simmer . Add the salt and stir in the oats . Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until the oats have absorbed most of the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost milky looking . That 's right ! Set aside . <p> To make the bananas , in a small skillet over medium heat , melt together butter , brown sugar , salt , and cream . Stir until smooth and just beginning to bubble . Reduce heat to low and add banana slices . Toss to combine and soften , about 5 minutes . <p> In a small bowl , stir together yogurt and honey . <p> To assemble the breakfast , divide the oats between two bowls . Top with bananas , dollop with yogurt , sprinkle with cinnamon and chopped pecans . Enjoy warm ! <p> Ill put a fried egg on just about anything , but I 'm with you oatmeal is supposed to be sweet ! Ironically nothing grosses me out more than sweet grits one of my high school friends put grape jelly ( ! ! ! ) in her grits , and my college dining hall put tons of sugar in theirs . It was SO bad ! So Ill stick to caramelized bananas for my oatmeal and eggs with my grits . ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately and I 'm really looking forward to your new cookbook ! : ) <p> OoooIm going to be the contrarian here . I LOVE a good bowl of savory oatmealoats , some greens , a couple runny eggs , and some super rich caramelized onions ! BUTnot for breakfast . Never for breakfast . Not even brunch . That falls SOLELY into the " breakfast for dinner " category for me . <p> The biggest lesson I 've learned from brunch is there 's no end to things people will put eggs on . Thankfully , I have n't seen eggs on oatmeal , but now I 'm sure its only a matter of time . Caramelized bananas are a much better option . <p> Sounds fabulous ! My kind of breakfast . I like eggs but I often have difficulty with the thought of eating them for breakfast , but Eggs Bennie for lunch , yes ! I have noticed the Aussie touch of topping a hamburger with a fried egg has made its way onto Canadian menus . This is something else my stomach rebels at the thought of . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house , who 's a bit sick .

Cornstarch ( and sugar ) makes the flour share liquid , easing the gluten development and creative beautifully tender cake texture . <p> King Arthur Flour makes my favorite store-bought cake flour . - I love it because its an unbleached cake flour ( pretty rare because cake flours are usually bleached ) , has no weird chemicals , and has a slightly higher protein content that helps make consistently great cakes . <p> If you 're like me and want to read majorly nerdy textbooks about food , Understanding Food : Principles and Preparations is a massive reference book about everything from food service to food science . - Its a splurge. - The used book is the way to go . <h> Share <h> 46 comments <p> I used to keep a variety of different flours cake , bread , whole wheat , etc. but I found that having so many meant that they went bad before I got to use them . So now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornstarch to make it " cake flour " . Thanks for sharing ! <p> We do n't  have cake flour in the UK we just have plain ( all-purpose ) and self-raising ( which , as the name suggests , already has baking powder added to it ) . And then bread flour ( usually called strong flour ) and wholemeal etc . Interesting to read about the protein content ! We do n't  really have a tradition of making things like angel food cake or chiffon cake here , so I suppose that 's why cake flour is n't something we see in our supermarkets . <p> I 'm so happy you posted about this topic . I have a very small in-home baking business and use cake flour often . I 'm curious , do you prefer this homemade version of cake flour to the store bought brand , or is it just something you use in a pinch when you run out ?

Thank you so much for these Baking 101 posts ! <p> You can buy cake flour on amazon here in the UK . The reason we do n't  have it here is that cake flour is usually bleached and under EU regulations is against the law .

The deal with a well-crafted Summer Bucket List is that they 're set with intention , care , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with freedom and grace . In other words , make the list you want and try your best to accomplish ( and more importantly ) ENJOY it . <p> Here are my Summer intentions for these fine days : <p> 1 Take a road trip and visit a white sandy beach . Let it be Pensacola and let me eat my way through the Florida panhandle . BRB . <p> 2 Let there be a hotel pool day with wine . This involves playing hooky from work , putting on a bathing suit , and visiting a hotel pool like you own the joint , ordering wine , and just liiiiving . The slow sun life . Its Summah ! <p> 3 I was recently at the Aspen airport writing scenic mountain postcards in the airport . Its sweet to send people mementos of your travels . A little ray of sunshine folded in with bills and bullshit in the mailbox . Protip : carry postage stamps in your wallet . Very grown adult move . <p> 4 Visit Seattle and go for a hike . Sister , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> 5 Make sliders and sangria , because are n't  those two summer treats you want in your fridge . Pretzel buns its all happening . <p> 6 Find new friends to collaborate on photography with . It will feel your heart and soul and eyeballs . <p> 7 Polish the new house . Not literally but hang pictures , decorate the shelves in the kitchen , set up the bar , pet the cat , mow the lawn and just generally get + keep it together . Prepare for classes this Fall ! ( That means you . You 're totally coming over ! ) <p> 8 Last year one of my Summer Bucket List goals was to do a yoga headstand- something I thought was so so cool since I had just started taking my yoga practice more to heart . This Summer my goal is to extend my yoga practice with grace and patience . Its a practice and progress comes in very exciting inches . <p> 9 Take daily art breaks , with watercolor paints or calligraphy pens because its good for the heart and soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It takes time , and patience , and persistence . Workbooks and online lessons help . Its a practice . Sometimes in inches until you just subconsciously start to remember swear words . <p> I hope this inspires you to set your intentions for these warm days . What 's on your Summer Bucket List ? Please let it involve Summer Water key and crucial . Let 's carry on with it . <p> xo Joy <p> This picture taken at Sweet Greens in Santa Monica during their lunch rush when people were rushing me away from my table and I was n't having it . Do you . I 'll do me . <p> Pensacola is my hometown ! I hope you 're able to make it there this summer . The beaches are beautiful and the people are friendly . I know seafood will be the highlight of your trip while you 're there , but I have to make quick recommendations for End of the Line Cafe ( vegan ) and Taco Rock ( incredible Mexican food ) . They are well worth the seafood break I promise . Man , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your decision to go to the Panhandle . We love 30-A ( Santa Rosa Beach and Blue Mountain Beach are especially marvelous ) , which is about hour and a half to the east of Pensacola . The beaches are spectacular all in the Panhandle , but 30-A has such a great laid-back vibe . Lots of galleries , a state park in Grayton Beach with giant dunes , inland lakes , bike path all along the beach road , etc . <p> Things to eat : ice cream at Blue Mountain Creamery . Anything at Louis Louis in Santa Rosa Beach or Red Bar in Grayton . BBQ from 98 Barbecue ( literally the best potato salad I have had in my life ) . Smoked tuna dip from Shrimpers in Santa Rosa Beach . I could go on and on . <p> The Emerald Coast is my very favorite place on earth absolutely , 100% worth a trip . Plus , its a relatively easy drive from New Orleans . My moms family started vacationing there in the late sixties , so we are multiple-generation fans . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're now locals ! ) <p> On my list is to see my towns fireworks for the first time . Carcassonne has an incredible show on July 14 , but I 've always been in the U.S. at that moment . I also want to apply myself to really nailing some classic French dishes . <p> Joy , love #10 . That is on my list too , When I start to dream in the language I 'm learning I know I am halfway there . Does that happen to you ?

@@2115510 <h> YES ! Brisket Breakfast Biscuits <p> I 'm going to ask you a series of favors and I 'm going to suggest its for your weekend benefit . <p> Could you do me a favor and put the words big hunk of brisket on your grocery list ? Could you do me another favor and find your slow cooker ? It might be in the way back of some cabinet somewhere , but I promise its worth the cabinet dig . Could you do me one last favor and that 's , well slow cook that ample piece of meat you bought with onions and garlic , make some biscuits , poach and egg or two , and enjoy this No-Joke-Of-A Breakfast Sandwich either in your pajama pants ? Its all a favor to me , but really for you for you for you . <p> This dish takes some forward thinking . You 'll need to set yourself up for success by cooking the beef overnight . Well worth the effort for your future self , and your future future self you 're making a lot of beef . <p> Happy Weekending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooker . <p> I took guidance from The Kitchn for this brisket adventure . Essentially were putting a seasoned hunk of meat into a slow cooker , adding thick sliced onions , whole cloves of garlic , and beef broth . <p> Cook for a long time , a real long time and then a little longer . <p> Also I typed seasoned hunk into a sentence and made you read it . I 'm more satisfied than sorry . <p> Beef broth is added to the slow cooker , to cover about 3/4 of the onions and beef . Lid on ( and do your best to keep it on ) , for many many hours . I cooked my brisket on low overnight so the beef has a good 8 hours to think about what its done , ease , soften , and moisten to uh-mazing . And me ? I 've done nothing but slice some onions and get my beauty rest . <p> I 've made a lot of biscuits . Youve been around for most of them . <p> Youve seen me cut butter into flour more times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseradish the more the cream will taste like a punch in the nose but a good punch in the nose . Its temporary and delicious . I do n't  enjoy a reach punch in the nose nearly as much as I enjoy a horseradish punch in the nose . <p> Warm shredded brisket is added to the horseradish topped biscuit . <p> Because the beef has been in the slow cooker for so long , its basically self-shredding . <p> How about a few of those brisket cooked onions on top ? They 're basically candy , in the best oniony way . <p> The Best Way To Poach An Egginvolves a fine mesh strainer and a pot of boiling water . Its pretty fool-proof , but I never thought you were a fool in the first place so you 've got this ! <p> I like the egg best poached medium ( like the unicorn of poaching ) with the egg mostly cooked with just a little bit of yolk on the run . Its hard to do and comes from practice , poking , luck , and skill like most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top biscuit if you 're feelin it . <p> A warning that this will make the top biscuit a little slippery when it meets the poached egg . You 'll need a toothpick to hold it all together . Worth it . <p> When I make brisket in a slow cooker , I make A LOT of brisket in a slow cooker . Of course its great for these breakfast sandwiches , but imagine how could it will be in a Sunday Supper Pasta or paired alongside roasted vegetables with polenta . <p> There 's a lot you can do with tender brisket so make a lot while you 're making it . It freezes well , after cookedand it totally amiable in breakfast and dinner renditions . <p> To make the brisket , season both sides of meat generously with salt and pepper . Place in the slow cooker and top with sliced onions and garlic cloves . Pour in the beef stock to cover about 2/3 to 3/4 of the meat . Add the Worcestershire sauce . <p> Cover and cook for 6 to 8 hours . The longer the better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the lid on the slow cooker as much as possible . <p> Remove the cooked brisket from the cooker and shred with a fork . Top with cooked onions and a few garlic cloves if you 'd like . <p> Allow to cool slightly before assembling the sandwiches . <p> To make the biscuits , place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside . <p> In a mixing bowl , sift together flour , sugar , baking powder , baking soda , and salt . Using your fingers , quickly work the butter into the dry ingredients until some bits of butter are the size of oat flakes , some the size of small peas . Chunks of cold butter is what we want in our dough . <p> In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup , combine egg and buttermilk and beat lightly with a fork . <p> Create a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the egg mixture all at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moist , but not overly wet . <p> Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and use a floured rolling pin to gently roll the dough into a into a 1-inch thick oval . At the short end of the dough closest to you , fold the dough over until the edge of the dough meets the center of the dough . Fold the top edge of the dough towards the center over the first fold . Gently roll the dough into a 1-inch oval and repeat the folding process again . <p> After the second fold , again roll the dough out to a 1-inch thickness and use a 2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits . Press any dough scraps together to make a few more biscuits out of the remaining dough .

My grandmother always said that if you 're bored in London then you 're bored of life . <p> I love the idea of making this rice pudding not very sweet and then swirling the jam in at the end . I tend to prefer my desserts on the just barely sweet side , but my husband loves things to be sweet sweet sweet ! I like that here everyone can control the level of sweetness in their own serving . Thanks for another great recipe ! <p> This looks HEAVENLY . Ive been using light coconut milk in everything lately , and now youve given yet another recipe to try . I might use the blackberries I got at the farmers market week , though strawberries sound great . 
@@2115524 <h> One-Skillet Dark and Stormy Banana Bread <p> I 'm getting to know my new kitchen space . New oven ( its a KitchenAid its amazing ) , new light , new muscle memory from cracked eggshell to sink , new drawers for the whisks and spatulas to live and which dang drawer is it ! ? You know the drill . Change and newness . When I 'm getting to know a new kitchen I like to make a supremely familiar recipe . Something that I barely need a recipe to pull together . Something that I know backwards and forwards from batter consistency to oven smell . <p> Its banana bread . Its always banana bread . A house is n't a home without it . <p> A few years ago I made Brown Butter Banana Bread when I first moved to the French Quarter . The bread in various renditions has become a tradition that I 'll make long into my days in this new kitchen space . <p> Two things you should know . 1 . This is a one-skillet recipe . Were going to melt and brown the butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in layers , all in this one dang skillet . Stovetop to oven . 2 . A few months ago I thought someone was trying to break into my house ( they werent ) , so I stood behind my front door with this skillet in my head ready to bonk an intruder in the head . That was unnecessary , but still . hows that for versatility ? <p> I used Muscovado Sugar for this bread . Its extra dark , moist , and molasses-y . It brings a lot of depth to the bread . If you do n't  happen to have Muscovado , dark brown sugar will also be great . <p> Since were using a super dark brown sugar , and since I have a hunk of fresh ginger sitting in my fruit bowl staring me in the face , I thought it might be fun to play with a Dark and Stormy concept . Excuse to unpack the dark rum ? Obviously . <p> Browned butter meets very dark brown sugar . <p> After the butter and sugar are whisked together , the mixture will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sugar . Theyll act like they do n't  know how to get along until the eggs are whisked into the mixture . Eggs will make a glossy , smooth , refined butter mixture . <p> Since were going dark with the Muscovado sugar , well add a little stormy with fresh ginger . Splash of vanilla extra and a glug of dark rum . <p> At this point I 'm really happy this is a one-skillet recipe and I do n't  need to bother with a bowl for dry ingredients . At this point I also whisk some of the flour out of the skillet and onto the counter . I think that 's just part of the deal . <p> See ? <p> Its ok . Were still in business . <p> Scrape the edges of the bowl down and were ready for the oven . <p> Its familiar and new ! Like a new house with all my old stuff in it . The Muscovado and ginger gives this bread a depth of sweetness and hint of spice , bending it more towards a spice cake . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top to add some presentation flair , or impatiently cut into it because your coffee is getting cold . <p> Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. <p> Melt butter in an 9-inch cast iron skillet over medium-low heat . Melt until the crackling subsides and the butter begins to brown . Remove from heat and stir in sugar . Whisk until thoroughly combined . The mixture may seem broken as the butter wo n't completely absorb into the sugar just yet . Allow mixture to stand and cool for about 5 minutes . <p> Whisk in the eggs , one at a time . The mixture will begin to emulsify , be glossy and no longer greasy . Whisk in the vanilla and rum . Add the mashed bananas , fresh ginger , cinnamon , nutmeg , and ground ginger and stir to combine . <p> Add the flour , baking soda , and salt . Stir carefully until all of the dry ingredients are incorporated . Use a spatula to scrape down the sides and spread the batter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bake for 18-25 minutes until mixture is dry on top , but still slightly soft in the center . I like to slightly under-bake this cake . <p> Remove from oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes . Sprinkle with powdered sugar if you 'd like and enjoy warm . <p> Hey Joy , I 've eagerly been following your blog for a few years now and I just wanted to let you know how much I love the way you write .

I had no idea that was even a possibility for me when I was in college writing essays about the Harlem Renaissance . No idea . I feel lucky to combine my love of dough and words here on this blog . If you want me to talk about the Harlem Renaissance we can , though my essay writing abilities are n't  as polished . A topic sentence ? please do n't  make me do it . <p> I 'm living in my dream job . Some days it feels like more job than dream but that 's just the nature of having tasks to do .

I 'm amazing , but you 'll have to take my word for it . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself doing , free of the boundaries of age , lifestyle , and actual skill or ability . Its out there , and so what ! ? <p> Other than the current dream job , where I photograph doughnuts on my living room floor , here are a few of my most daydreamed dream jobs . They range from ridiculous , to just head-shaking no : <p> Dream Job 1 : Backup dancer for a Beyonce . In my mind backup dancers strike a lot of poses , wear bright red lipstick , and have flamboyant but supportive dance moves . Essentially , I 'd like to dance next to the spotlight and be Beyonces cheerleader . Unfortunately I do n't  have long hair to whip around , my body does n't  twerk , and I incorporate way too much thumb into my dance moves . <p> Dream Job 2 : Anonymous advice column author . My advice would be a cross between my mom , the cashier at the grocery with purple hair and the most epic acrylic nails , and this guy . Essentially my advice would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dream Job 3 : A drummer . My dream job is to be the drummer for the Foo Fighters . I know , the Foo Fighters already have an excellent drummer . That 's no problem , I want to BE Taylor Hawkins . Specifically , I want to be Taylor Hawkins playing The Pretender . I basically AM Taylor Hawkins when I 'm driving alone in my car blasting that song . Again , you 'll have to take my word for it . ( I 'm shaking my head no Im awful ) . <p> Dream Job 4 : An ER Doctor alongsideAnthony Edwards , Noah Wiley , and youthful George Clooney . I want to be an ER doctor among the original cast of the 90s television drama ER . Do n't  worry , this is a totally realistic dream job . You 're right , pipe dream . How about I just be Juliana Margulies before she goes to med school ? Good dream job compromise ? I thought so . ( I confident that only two of you reading this have any idea what I 'm talking about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Share <h> 141 comments <p> My dream job would be to own a small cafe that catered to breakfast lunch and dessert with a changing menu , Or have an American cafe for tourist in Italy . Another dream would be to be an actress or a dancer . Ah to dream .. <p> I feel like I have a new daydream dream job every day . Flight attendant ( without rude passengers , of course ) , peds doctor , travel writer , and would love love love to the community relations manager for the toronto blue jays ( hometown ) or any major league sports team . <p> Working on lighting in Pixar movies . Or really , if were going back in time , Avatar : The Last Airbender . Just being a writer but without having to do anything related to press . Doing a podcast , kind of just being a modern Dorothy Parker . I just want to talk to interesting people all day , or work in the dark on arty stuff . <p> I 'd like to hang out with David Chang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chef " celebrities . I would discover the best wines ( or bourbon , or other drinks ) to go with their food , travel to interesting remote locations ( see " Fire " episode with Ed Lee in Bolivia or Argentina or some such awesomeness ) and experience foods I 've never seen before . Naturally I would do this in an environmentally friendly , sustainable way , and support the local economies . Does this sound like a job ? Well not really- but its MY daydream ! I suppose I could record my experiences in a funny yet educational and inspiring book or two . Why not ! ? ! <p> Yoga instructor . That would be so awesome , you could make people feel better , pick amazing playlists , be in great shape I may still ditch my career and go for it . I could trade high heels for flip flops every day , yep . <p> 1 . Coach my own Internationally created Womens Ice Hockey Team in my own League in the United States 2 .

Be a paid Social Commentator . they are probably my dream jobs in order of preference . Womens Ice Hockey to me is a great sport and i honestly thought needed a boost in recognition . I created a league which would have done more ( created better world understanding , brought hockey more to the Agricultural areas of the US , Helped in the better self-confidence of kids , Helped show Alaska is n't just a resource cashcow which is noticed for the environment , risen the prominance of Womens Team Sport such that it would have been a Womans sport which ran alongside Mens sport not amongst it .. ie stood alone in its own right which i felt womens sport and a league of 30 would have accomplished and i 'd have ensured it did n't  interfere with present US sports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . Would have brought teams to locations ( towns owning the rinks once they paid off ) as opposed to mobile teams which seems to go on ( no money they up and leave and go somewhere else ) . As you can tell its something i felt strongly about . And well the sport , something i really enjoy watching-who wanted want their dream job to be connected with their hobby . Talking money apart from the current very top leagues , most Womens Ice Hockey players , even those which play for their countries , play for enjoyment and the competition , and receive NO pay or salary-i thought they deserved better recognition . Thanks . Ca n't dance , cant sing-so backup anything to Beyonce out of the question to me though i do like the song and music video If i was a boy : ) <p> oops and I meant coach my own international team .. i would have players from various ice hockey playing countries on my team ( my league ) -US , Canada , GB , Japan , China for example and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , majority of players on each other team from that country and the rest of the team from Canada or the US on each team in order that there is local interest . The US and Canadian Teams would be them solely , not just 2 teams from the home countries .. would be a good home country vs world teams competition vying for top spot . really good lol .. but alas .. lol thanks anyway <p> I 'm going to show my age here so be very afraid . My daydream dream job would be an 80s slut rocker chick , like Pat Benetar , Stevie Nicks , Heart ( both Ann and Nancy Wilson ) . Aside from the fact I cant sing , am terrified to be in front of people , and certainly cant pull off the outfits they did , but yeah , that would be fun . <p> Honestly I 'm doing my dream job as a gym teacher in NYS ! ! ! I mean , its all play and no work , hehe . Dodge ball , badmitten , table tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . And when you get mad at a student , just pound the dodge ball at them ( just kidding guy ! ! ) or not . <p> I would be a blogger like you but for my apple farm . Currently I work weekends at an apple farm/winery so I 'm 1/3 of the way there . Next up is starting the blog and then just waiting for the original owners to retire so I can buy the orchard . <p> When I was in middle school , we had a snow day and I was able to stay home and watch Regis and Kathie Lee . On this particular episode , I fell hard for a break dancer that was breaking the world record for number of spins on his head . That is my dream job . Slash backup dancer for Beyonce . Obvs.

@@2115543 <h> Gluten-free Banana Bread with salted caramel <p> Some days just feel like good days to turn on the oven . The kind of day when you think you might-could crank up the heater , but instead you let the oven do the work and maybe throw in a simple , fragrant loaf of banana bread . Its a win-win-win : warmth , aroma , and actual fresh banana bread . <p> I made this loaf of banana gluten-free using an all-purpose 1-for-1 flour mix . I really like King Arthur Gluten-Free Multi Purpose flour because it tastes clean . Bobs Red Mill is also good but has more of a bean flavor . Glutino , also found in many grocery stores is a great option . <p> I should do a baking test of gluten-free flours , should n't I ? Yes . <p> First , banana bread . <p> Banana bread is supposed to be fast and loose . We can bend the baking rules . Thank goodness ! <p> Bending the baking rules sometimes means mashing together bananas and brown sugar in a large liquid measuring , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd also like you to know that I dropped this measuring cup on the floor while trying to wash it . It broke into 1 million tiny pieces . RIP sturdy measuring cup . You were a good one . Thank you for your great service . You will be missed . <p> Browned butter , mashed banana , brown sugar , and vanilla are whisked together with eggs before they 're mixed with the dry ingredients . <p> Were building flavors one ingredient at a time . Brown butter and brown sugar are the heavy hitters . Anything browned . Anything molasses-y . That 's what we want . <p> I always want a crumble on a quick bread . <p> Its a wonder I do n't  just slice the top half of the entire loaf off and eat it myself . Like a muffin-top bandit but for entire quick breads . Its the buttery oat topping . Irresistible and crisp . <p> This bread is so tender , moist , and light I nearly forgot it was free of fluffy gluten . Its amiable , not overly nutty or beany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its just comforting and delicious . <p> I topped the bread with a drizzle of salted caramel because ( as always ) it seemed like the right , decadent , ridiculous , smart thing to do . <p> Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 9+5-inch loaf pan and set aside . <p> Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat . Butter will begin to foam and crackle as it melts . When the crackling subsides , the butter will begin to brown . Swirl the pan as the butter cooks . When the butter browns and begins to smell nutty , remove the pan from the flame and transfer the butter to a small bowl . Taking the butter out of the hot saucepan will stop the butter from overcooking and burning . Set aside to cool . <p> Add the wet ingredients , all at once to the dry ingredients . Fold together , making sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl to reveal any hidden pockets of flour . Fold together ingredients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into prepared pan . <p> To make the topping combine all of the ingredients in a bowl and rub together with your fingertips until crumbly . Sprinkle evenly over the batter in the bread pan . <p> Bake for 40-45 minutes , or until a skewer inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean . Remove from the oven and allow to rest in the pan for 15 minutes , before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely . <p> Bread will last 4 days , well wrapped at room temperature . This loaf also freezes well . Just before ready to serve , drizzle with salted caramel . <p> To make the caramel , add sugar , water , and corn syrup to a medium saucepan . Bring to a boil over medium heat , stirring once or twice . Bring to a boil and allow to brown . Once sugar has browned to a medium amber color , remove from heat and immediately add heavy cream and butter . Mixture will boil and foam . Stir well .

You ca n't go wrong . <p> I cant wait to make this ! My little girls are going to love it too ! Just so you know , Bobs red mill has a new 1-1 baking flour ( blue bag not their a.p . In the red bag ) that tastes exactly like normal flour ! I only know this because I have to use it all the time : ) <p> When you try and compare different gluten free flours , please try " Gluten Free Girl " flour . I think you need to buy it off their website . Her blog is one of the best ever and I do n't  know of a couple who are more committed to sharing gluten free delicious food to those who actually need it . <p> This looks so yummy ! Its definitely banana bread season and I 'm excited about this gluten-free version !

Actually what an obnoxious thing to say . I know were all just doing our best and chocolate is expensive and organic cream is bonkers . <p> here 's the thing : splurge on a good dark chocolate bar , use a moderately priced cocoa powder , organic cream if you 're feelin it , any salt , any cornstarch , an egg , and good vanilla if you have it if not , a splash of bourbon over bad vanilla .

After a few minutes of simmering and whisking were in business with a soupy-thick chocolate mixture . <p> We mustnt forget about our egg yolk ! <p> I spooned a bit of warm pudding to a small bowl with the yolk to whisk and temper it , then stirred the yolky pudding back into the pot . <p> Chopped chocolate and vanilla extract are stirred until the chocolate is completely melted . <p> Whisk together brown sugar , cocoa powder , cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan , then gradually whisk in the milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream .

@@2115563 <h> Buttermilk Beignets <p> Apparently one is not allowed to have a pity party upon returning from vacation . Such pathetic events are extravagant , really and one should just buck up and answer her dang emails and do her dang laundry . Just because one is several hundred miles away from the sweet doughy pastries of Cafe du Monde does not a pity party justify . <p> It turns out that vacation can feel closer to home when you decide to , you know throw powdered sugar and fried dough around the house . Its pretty much that easy . Who knew ? <p> This is what it looks like to throw powdered sugar around Cafe Du Monde . If you ever find yourself in New Orleans ( and I pray that you do ) , please spend at least one very late night and one early morning enjoying beignets and coffee . Dreams come true ! <p> Invite some friends over . Gather around a hot pot of oil , take out an extra pair of frying tongs . Measure out as much powdered sugar as you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double it . then pour some powdered sugar over your head ( just for good measure ) . Were all the way in . Let 's do this ! <p> Making beignets at home is entirely different from enjoying them at Cafe du Monde . <p> They 're a lot more work at home . Let 's just be real . <p> This version of beignets is much different from those I enjoyed in New Orleans . I made Buttermilk Beignets which are much more light and fluffy than those Ive eaten out in the world . They 're little powdered sugar clouds an incredible thing to coax our of your kitchens . To be sure . <p> Theyre called Buttermilk Beignets , but there are actually two types of milk in this dough . Whole milk pairs with buttermilk to create a super lush dough . Were also using bread flour instead of the all-purpose flour we usually throw around our kitchen . The bread flour is important for the structure of the dough . Its not to be skipped . <p> Ill be honest , there 's something a little nerve-bending about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the dough needs to come together in a stand mixer with a dough hook . There 's really no way to bring this dough together by hand without being up to your elbows is dough glue . <p> If your nerves do n't  bend when you mix together this very wet dough , you 're a better baker than me . That 's entirely possible , by the way you 're a rad baker . <p> This dough will stick to the bottom of the bowl as it is kneaded with the dough hook . It will stick to the spatula . It will stick to your fingers if you reach in for a feel . This dough will make you feel like you 're doing everything wrong . You are , in fact , doing most things right . The wet dough will eventually lead to super light beignets . <p> Trust the process . <p> With the 4 teaspoons of yeast in this dough , it will rise a substantial amount . Its bubbly and fluffed . <p> Turn the dough out onto a well-(bread)-floured work surface . It takes some coaxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  make me tell you again how wet and sticky this dough is . <p> Generously top the dough with bread flour and softly knead and tuck the dough into a ball . This is n't a deep knead . That would be all sorts of sticky . Its more of a light knead . Be cool . <p> Roll the dough to about a 1/2-inch thickness . I happen to have a giant beast of a rolling pin . Its a make-it-work situation . <p> Because the dough is so moist and almost delicate feeling , its hard to bully it around like you might a pizza dough . <p> Once sliced , the pretty little dough pieces are separated . They ca n't be trusted to play nice too closely together . Theyll stick together and no one likes that . <p> Deep frying may feel like a daunting task but once you have a candy thermometer you 'll want to fry everything in sight . <p> Call some friends . Really , you 'll need people to gather round for this achievement in baking . These beignets are more tender than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Pulling these out of your kitchen will make any day feel like a special occasion a really sticky , **33;476;TOOLONG , special occasion . <p> To start , allow the whole milk and buttermilk to sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before bringing this recipe together . <p> Pour whole milk into a small saucepan and heat over medium heat . Heat until milk is steaming and small bubbles form on the surface . The milk will be very warm to the touch . Remove from the heat and pour warm milk into the bowl of an electric stand mixer . Add buttermilk to the warm milk . Stir in granulated sugar . Sprinkle yeast over the milk and sugar mixture . Stir gently . Allow milk and yeast mixture to sit for 5 minutes to activate the yeast . When yeast is active , the tops of the mixture will be slightly foamy and bubbling . <p> Add flour , baking soda , and salt to the wet ingredients . Use a dough hook and beat on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a very wet dough so the dough will stick to the bottom of the bowl as it is beaten with the dough hook . Try not to be tempted to add more flour , but is you must , add up to 1/2 cup more flour ( the mixture will still be wet ) . Stop the mixer and use a spatula to scrape the dough from the bottom of the bowl , ensuring that all of the wet and dry ingredients are thoroughly combined . Remember : the dough will be sticky . AKA : do n't  freak out . Leave dough in the mixing bowl to rise . Cover with plastic wrap and a clean dish towel . Allow to rest in a warm place for 1 hour . <p> Generously flour a work surface with bread flour . Use a spatula to remove the risen dough from the bowl . Once dough is on the floured work surface , generously flour the top of the dough . Gently flatten the dough , fold it in half , then tuck the ends under to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moist , but as long as your work surface is well-floured , you should n't have any issues . <p> Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough into a 1/2 to 1/3-inch thick rectangle . Cover the dough with a clean dish towel and allow to rest for 5 minutes . Using a bench knife or pizza cutter , cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch squares . Stop to flour the knife or pizza cutter as you slice . Try to separate the slices as you cut them so the dough does not stick together after it is sliced . <p> Place enough oil in a saucepan to fill it to a depth of about 3-inches . I used 32 ounces of oil in a 3qt saucepan . Place a candy thermometer in the oil and heat over medium-high head to 375 degrees F. Place several layers of paper towel on a clean work surface . Place a cooling rack ( if you have one ) atop the paper towels . This will be our cooling and powder sugar station . Place powdered sugar is a fine mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil . <p> Gently add beignets to the hot oil . Try not to overcrowd the pan , I could fit three beignets at a time in my pan . Fry until golden brown on both sides , flipping them once or twice during frying , about 2 to 3 minutes . Remove from oil and place on cooling rack . Immediately dust with a generous amount of powdered sugar . <p> Before frying more batches of beignets make sure the oil is at 375 degrees F. Fry until all dough is cooked through and dusted with sugar . Serve immediately . These beignets are best ( as most things are ) straight from the fryer . These beignets are best the day they 're made , very soon after frying . <p> To Make the beignets ahead : <p> The beignet dough can be made up to 8 hours in advance of frying . Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray it with nonstick cooking spray . After cutting the dough , place the beignets on the paper and place another greased sheet of parchment paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate . The beignets can be fried straight from the refrigerator . <p> Your video is adorable ! I have been dreaming of beignets since I first tried them at Cafe du Monde during a high school service trip in 2008 . Your step-by-step instructions make them feel a little less intimidating . : )

@@2115565 <h> Baking 101 : What 's In A Whisk ? <p> We know all there is to know about whisks , right ? They 're bulbous and handy , the do n't play well in the utensil drawer without getting squished to misshapen or tangling up with the can opener . They make whipped cream if we 're feeling strong-armed , sift flour if we 're feeling lazy , and make the heck out of some pancake batter on very fine Saturday mornings . <p> What you might not know is that there are several different types of whisks . A whisk for just about every kitchen task from sifting flour to making roux . There is a big difference between a French whisk and a ball whisk and I want you to have that knowledge . Kitchen knowledge is kitchen confidence . <p> If you 've spent any time working as a baker or pastry person in a professional kitchen you know .. you know that that the chefs like to steal the pastry departments whisks and spatulas . It 's because we have the good whisk and the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever been looking for your French whisk and found a cook whisking his soup with it you may also know what pure rage feels like . It 's real . It 's why we steal their knifes and they deserve it ( mostly because they just have the good knives ) . <p> Now . Onto the whisks , though not free of judgement and opinions . <p> There are all sorts from silicone to wire to wooden . Today were talking about wire whisks because I find them the most useful for hot and cold tasks and enduring kitchen life . <p> Spring Whisks are made up of a single wire that loops around , creating a circular coil . It 's springy , as the name implies , and is reminiscent of jumping up and down on your moms mattress when she was n't home . This whisk does n't require the usual wrist flip , round-the-bowl action that most other whisks require . Rather , a spring whisk is pumped up and down in a liquid to mix and emulsify . You 've been doing it wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come with an instruction manual . These whisks are best for liquids , deep liquids , that need emulsifying . Not so great if you 're trying to turn egg whites into something voluminous . <p> A Spiral Whisk is a treat-yourself kitchen tool . Say you 're at the kitchen supply store and you see the spiral whisk and the flat pan whisk . The spiral whisk is yours if you want to splurge , as you 're likely make the best rouxes in town . Their coiled wire and flattened head make whisking all along the surface and sides of a pan a delight . A delight , I tell you ! <p> A good while back we asked the very important baking question : Do I really have to sift this flour ? The answer was no but really , yes you should . Questions , prayers , concerns answered with the Sifter Whisk . Built to aerate and combine big bowls of flour , baking powder , baking soda and salt . No more sifting box . This is a small though tremendous victory . <p> AFrench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires that cross and overlap and meet at separate point in a handle . The French whisk looks a lot like its balloon whisk cousin but is more narrow in shape . This whisk can do just about anything . I like them for whisking custards smooth and scraping around the sides of the pan while making a pudding . <p> I felt like there was no way to successfully make a lump free pan gravy before I met the Flat Pan Whisk . Typically made up of four wires that lay flat and meet at the handle . The angle allows the user to quickly work flour into a pan of fat without contorting their wrist or standing on their head . <p> A Dough Whisk is on the obtuse side of whisks for me . They 're loopy shaped ( definitely ( not ) a technical term ) and sturdy . While the whisk an be used to bring together yeasted doughs like a pizza dough , according to King Arthur Flour ( kitchen giants ) , these whisks are best to lightly mix things like muffin batters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without overworking the gluten or breaking the fruit . <p> Balloon Whisks are a popular , widely available whisk . I think of these gems as a kitchen staple . Wire whisks are typically eight or more metal wires that meet at a point or center and are attached at separate points to a metal handle . Balloon whisks can be subtle in their balloonish nature , or absurdly large . For the home cook I suggest a subtle balloon shape and a medium whisk , making for a whisk that is versatile enough to easily aerate and whisk cream and eggs to soft peaks and batters to smooth . <p> Ball Whisks are wiry and stiff . Like when you see someone coming to shove you over ( which I hope does n't happen often ) and you stiffen your body in preparation and resistance . Ball whisks are n't my favorite . I 'm always left wondering if they working , why they 're so inflexible , and if my French whisk is clean in the dishwasher . If you fancy yourself a Ball Whisk enthusiast they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to clean . <p> I know I know enough wire talk . What is the ONE whisk you should have in your kitchen that will get you through sweet and savory adventures ? A moderately stiff Balloon Whisk is a great investment and also a roux whisk if you live south of the Mason Dixon ( which is probably one of the weirdest things I 've typed in a long time ) . <h> Share <h> 33 comments <p> Whoa ! I had no idea there was such a difference in whisks . I love that you explain all these baking terms and utensils so thoroughly . So many baking cookbooks do n't  explain their terminology , so I 'm always left wondering if I 've screwed everything up or not ! ! <p> As you know , Joy , we have a ceramic jar on the stove with some different whisks in it . I had never given it much thought as to when to use what one . Now I realize I have been using the wrong one for oatmeal all these years . Thanks so much for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisk for years ! I may have even thrown one away But now I 'm super excited to get one and make a roux ! Also , the dough whisk batters , who knew ? ! Thank you so much Joy ! ! <p> Thanks for enlightening me ! I am printing this out and placing right in your cookbook . Ironically , my 16 year old son picks up different whisks every 6 months or so and is building his collection . Yes .. I use them ! Now I will know what they 're really for . <p> I know to some it might seem foolish , but if you 're ever looking for a topic .. a similar write up regarding pots and pans and suggested " proper " uses would be great too . <p> I think less is more . I have a balloon whisk and a fork . I make two meals a day , but I 'm not such an intense cook that I need special wrist-action utensils , which are going to take up precious drawer space . I am in awe , however , of people who know their whisks and use them ! 
@@2115566 <h> Cream Cheese Red Velvet Cake Ice Cream <p> We have a history of doing ridiculous things in the name of ice cream since childhood , right ? There 's no life lesson quite like learning how to both chew gum aaaannd eat ice cream when you order Blue Bubble Gum Ice Cream ( a flavor surely sent down from the heavens ) . I was also master of ordering a dish of ice cream , clenching my child-fist around my spoon and stirring my ice cream a perfect milkshake consistency . Knowing when to stop stirring is key and this definitely felt just like cooking to my child-brain . <p> Ice cream is fun , with or without bubble gum . But really , the more playful the better because life is short and days are long and we need treats . <p> I put cake in ice cream because it seemed like something I would have literally jumped up and down for 30 years ago . I jumped up and down having a scoop for lunch in my kitchen because I 'm grown now and ice cream can be breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly ache ) . <p> I need to let you in on the secrets of this ice cream : <p> The Red Velvet cake is baked from a boxed cake mix . Gasp ! I know . Guess what ? Its ok like 100% ok . Cake mix is fantastic in this recipe because its easier ( hallelujah ) and the oil and sugar in cake mix makes this cake more freezer friendly so its not entirely crumbly and dry as it freezes into the ice cream . <p> The cream cheese ice cream base is a simple combination of fatty and delicious dairy and comes together in a blender without having to cook egg yolks like a traditional ice cream base . <p> As simple as I 'm trying to make this you 'll still need an actual ice cream maker . I have this higher end Breville ice cream machine which literally makes dreams come true . The more wallet friendly ice cream makers , like this work well too . Just remember to freeze the bowl overnight and after about 30 minutes of churning the ice cream , transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the freezer bowls only churn effectively for about 30 minutes , longer is just warming torture for the ice cream . <p> Buy sugar cones at the grocery . Dig the sprinkles out of the cake decorating drawer . Its a party no matter what . <p> To make the ice cream , combine the cream cheese , milk , cream , sugar , salt , and bourbon ( if using ) , in the bowl of a large food processor fitted with a blade attachment . <p> Blend on high speed until smooth . Depending on how softened your cream cheese was , there may be a few flecks of cream cheese remaining in the combined mixture . That 's ok ! <p> Transfer the mixture to the bowl of an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer 's instructions , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . <p> After the ice cream is churned , please in a large freezer safe container and quickly stir large and small cake pieces into the ice cream . Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firmed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want that ice cream maker . Its been on my wish list for ages , but the price is just so hefty I would need to make sooo much ice cream to justify it . But this ice cream almost makes it seem worth it to just take the plunge ! I hate having to pre-freeze a bowl . <p> I remember that blue bubble gum ice cream ! I miss that stuff . Wonder where I can get it . Just yesterday I picked up one of those Nestle ice cream sandwiches , the long rectangular ones with the vanilla ice cream and soft chocolate cookies , in the name of childhood nostalgia . <p> I 'm definitely making this cream cheese + red velvet cake ice cream , because kid mes favorite way to enjoy ice cream was with birthday cake , sometimes on the side and sometimes mashed together . I also bought an ice cream maker a few months ago and have had so much fun playing with it , it seems about time for a new flavor ! <p> Also , awesome nails ! I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link . Unfortunately way outside my radius , but great inspiration ! <p> Years ago , I had leftover birthday cake and ice cream my husband said that when he was a kid , his grandmother used to crumble leftover cake , brownies , cookies , etc. into ice cream so they never had plain ice cream when they visited . Yes I crumbled the leftover birthday cake , frosting &amp; all , into store-bought ice cream . YUM ! ! I cant wait to try your version with this cream cheese based ice cream ! !

What would you add ? <p> I 'm Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reed Its been called a " tight , ferocious little book " full of mounting suspense . A friend suggested it saying its one of those crazy good books you read in four hours and with that recommendation , its the next book on my shortlist . <p> Night Film by Marisha Pessl Were in for thrills this Fall and Night Film was named one of the best books of the year by NPR . An investigative journalist tries to solve the murder of a cult-horror-film directors daughter . Sounds like a page turner so let 's get to it ! <p> The Nightingaleby Kristin Hannah WWII in France through the eyes of two sisters .

I am always looking for a reason to cry on the plane though <p> Sweetbitter by Stephanie Danler A coming-of-age in the NYC restaurant industry story . I 'm into it because I bout that life , and I know restaurant life is sloppy and romantic and messy and delicious and there are so many lessons to learn the hard way . <p> The Woman in Cabin 10by Ruth Ware Youre a travel writer on assignment on a luxury cruise ship pretty swanky until you see a woman being thrown overboard , but everyone on the boat is accounted for and you sound downright crazy . Now what ? Tell us Ruth , tell us ! I 'm just finishing In A Dark , Dark Wood and looking forward to this read . <p> The Girls by Emma Cline Let 's read this ! It sounds full and nuanced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover This is definitely the second book on my Fall shortlist . It sounds like a love story on a rollercoaster and I want on . <p> Queen of the Nightby Alexander Chee I continue to be obsessed with this book and its so good that I refuse to finish it . Its the story of a woman who goes from circus performer to the worlds most famous opera soprano . Shes got secrets and lies and its a stunning read . <p> Today Will Be Differentby Maria Semple We all think it from time to time , do n't  we ? Let 's read the fictionalized fiasco . <p> Everything I Want To Eatby Jessica Koslow Yes its a cookbook but Jessica has a very fine and earnest food brain and I want to read her words before eating her food .

I need a copy of this book for my coffee table and for both bathrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment . <h> Share <h> 71 comments <p> I have loved Cathleen Schines writing since she used to do flippant little things for the NYT . She has a new book : They May Not Mean To , But They Do , based on the totally hilarious and true Philip Larkin poem , which is one of two poems I know by heart . Also , I started The Truth About Alice ( young adult , but good ) and Don Quixote , which is far funnier and a better read than I had imagined . <p> I sooo recommend The Nightingales , it compares to The Winter Garden by same author which is the best book i have ever read . Many have mentioned All the Lights We Can not See whivh was really good as well . The Girl Who Wrote In Silk byKelli Estes was a very good book be sure to keep tissues on hand .

He wrote it in the 60s , so there are some dated references , but the overall messagelove God AND love thy neighbor , all through cookingis timeless . One of my very favorite books . <p> My fall book list is pretty similar . Another recommendation for your listA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towlesthe world and the characters are so richyou wont want the story to end . Its the perfect book to read in your cozy sweater with a cappuccino ( I read it in 90 degree weather in LA and that worked too ) . <p> I suggest The Shepards Life by James Rebanks .

The Girls is very well written but rather depressing . On the top of my to-read list is Jennifer Weiners Hungry Heart . She is such a good writer that I 'm sure her memoir will be moving . I also loved a book from a few years ago called Defending Jacob some great twists in it . <p> I just added a few of those books to my " must read " list ! I just finished up The Girl in Cabin 10 and if you feel the same way I did about it promise me you 'll hang on until about 3/4 of the way through .

@@2115578 <h> The 7 Rules of Compliment Club <p> COMPLIMENT CLUB , it would follow , is a group of people whom actively , enthusiastically , sincerely , and frequently offer words of praise to the people around them . My maj Tracy and I came up with Compliment Club as a way of encouraging each other to send good vibes into the world . Its not an exclusive club you should totally hop on in ! <p> Let 's talk about compliments . Youve likely gotten them when you 're wearing a flattering dress , when your hair is flipping the right way at the right time on the right day , when you 've made an impression on someone BOOM ! Sometimes they drop a compliment in your lap . It feels great ! It feels like you 've been seen and appreciated for your hard work to be a good human . Right ? <p> Well giving is more important that getting . I think it was Socrates that said that . Definitely Socrates . <p> There are some guidelines for offering compliments . We cant just go throwing them around willy-nilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Follow them . Let 's be better together . ( I sincerely mean that do n't  look at me like I 'm crazy . ) <p> First rule of Compliment Club ( yes we can talk about Compliment Club ) : Look for the positive in other people . This is imperative . You cant offer a sincere compliment if you are n't  looking for the beauty in the people around you . Naturally , sometimes seeing the light in people is easier than others . In gridlock traffic ? Hard . very hard to see the good in people . Behind the lady writing a check in the express lane at the grocery store ? Challenging . extremely challenging to see the beauty in that situation . <p> Its ok . Not every moment is the right time for a sincere compliment . But ! If you 're regularly looking for the good in people , those moments of frustration will likely ( hopefully ) have less of a tinge . <p> The second rule of Compliment Club : Be genuine . Mean what you say . <p> Stay away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gosh you 're the best person in the world . " An exaggeration . I mean they 're probably great , but literally the best person in the world ? Is that accurate ? <p> I 'm guilty of hyperbole . I think its the way of the Internet these days exaggerating to make things sound like the best , the biggest , the coolest thing EVER . Hyperbole has no place in a genuine compliment . It actually makes the compliment rather empty . <p> Root yourself in the compliment . Stand tall in it . I think we use hyperbole to separate ourselves from the genuine words we really want to say . <p> The third rule of Compliment Club : Be Specific . Specifics go a long way . <p> People want to be seen and noticed for their efforts in the world . See them . Comment on them specifically . <p> The fourth rule of Compliment Club : Be heartfelt is how things make you FEEL . Throw some emotional language into your genuine compliment . Make yourself vulnerable . <p> here 's one , " When you stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat available at Tartine , you made me feel really special . I see so much kindness in you and I really appreciate you . " <p> ( That was a good day . ) <p> The fifth rule of Compliment Club : Chill on the back-handed compliments . Do n't  do it . Rude . <p> The sixth rule of Compliment Club : Just go for it ! There 's no time to waste and sometimes the window to offer someone some kindness is short . <p> I saw the most lovely old lady walking her dog this afternoon . I admired her but hesitated . No compliment . I lost my chance . <p> I suppose the lesson is : do n't  worry about embarrassing yourself . Life is short . Say it and mean it ! <p> The seventh rule of Compliment Club : Do n't  expect anything in return . Everyone absorbs a compliment differently . Some people feel embarrassed . Others might want to refute you . Some with thank you . Some might back away slowly . Have no expectations . Just put your kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , soak in and your job is done ! Besides , expecting a compliment in return would make you a jerk and jerks do n't  deserve compliments anyway . <p> Ultimately , Compliment Club is not about being flashy , outgoing , or overly extroverted its about genuinely liking people , seeing their good , and reflecting their light back to them . Totally easy . Go on , have at it ! <p> Love this . Try to do this daily .. or monthly .. whatever . Not always perfectly executed . Recently on vacation in Carmel CA , I complimented an elderly lady on her amazing colorfull blouse . I crossed the street to tell her she looked like a Monet painting . She was quite hard of hearing and I had to repeat shouting the intended compliment 3 times . Pretty sure I scared herOops : ) <p> I do try to follow " If you cant say something nice do n't  say anything at all " . And I have said this to you before but it bears repeating you are a real inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love the idea . Its amazing how far a little kind word can go . I know that when I receive a compliment , it really brightens my day , so I try to pay that forward . Thanks for your suggestions on more genuine ways to compliment others . Its a good thing to think about ! <p> My philosophy too , but have n't articulated it well . You did a fab job of explaining the who , what , where , why , when and the how . And you did it in a lighthearted and welcoming way . Well done ! You 're helping to change the world , one post at a time ! Susan <p> Ooooooh I LOVE this post . This is exactly how I 'm feeling these days . Practicing getting vulnerable and showing people who you are .. and being brave enough to send them so much love . Favorite post of the internet right now ! And that is my compliment to you

@@2115580 <h> My Kitchen Resolutions <p> It seems all too easy for me , this time of year especially , to find my inner dialogue swirl around what I can and cant eat what I should and should not put in my body clean food this / dirty food that drink more water , eat more kale , for goodness sake STOP thinking about tater tots you heathen ! <p> Its not so much exhausting as it is tedious and banal . And really I know I can do better and drink more water , sure but I 'd like to focus on bringing more intention and care to my kitchen life rather than simply trying to eat kale instead of tater tots . What I 'm say is , I 'm not willing to give up tater tots or any other fried potato so Ill at least be intentional about what that looks like . <p> Know thyself better and better and better . Here are some of my Kitchen Resolutions . Maybe theyll inspire some good vibes in your home too . <p> Take good care . A few years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completely life-intertwined relationships , I stopped cooking dinner . I was no longer cooking dinner for two people ( ah the freedom / ooh the sadness ) so really , what was the point of dinner ? Scrambled eggs eaten out of the pan are fine for a single woman who just blew up her relationship life . Standing at the stove eating burnt tortillas with butter is plenty when the brain-plate is already full of heartache and change of address slips and internal dramatics and what are all these f-ing dating apps NO . Popcorn and wine because its good enough for Olivia Pope and she was sleeping with the damn president ( in a fictional series that bears no truth in reality ) , so its good enough for me . <p> I stopped taking care of myself by way of dinner because me , just me , was n't worth it . here 's the thing I was so deeply mistaken . All sorts of wrong . Dinner for one , made with care no matter if its in a hurry or extra leisurely , is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its become a space where I listen to podcasts , stir in silence and think my thoughts , and occasionally sock-dance around the kitchen with wine because good gracious what a privilege it is to have time and space to cook for myself ( I did n't  have to negotiate the vegetables or spice level , amen ) . <p> Be less wasteful . Sometimes it takes some convincing to actually eat what 's in the fridge , does n't  it ? What a luxury . I 'm doing my best to appreciate the food that 's in my refrigerator , use it all the way up , share it , and most of the scraps become either stock or compost . Its effort but the stock alone feels pretty fantastic . <p> And do I really know how to compost ? No but I 'm learning ! So far I think I 'm making fine dirt which is the point , I think . <p> Take on small cooking adventures . In short , make pasta from scratch more often . Not because there is n't a store full of plenty of lovely pasta options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying , and I can get friends to help . I 've found that when you realize , really realize with your own hands , what can become of flour + egg + water , you 'll be amazing and more kitchen adventures will follow . Its like learning magic you can also eat . <p> Do n't  present plates with apologies . I do this . " Oh this Gluten-Free Fried Chicken that I just spent 2 hours ( happily ) making for you , with mashed potatoes and yes I roasted those carrots in extra butter YES I DID Im sorry it took so long / I 'm sorry the chickens a little well-done / I 'm sorry the mashed potatoes are a little lumpy . " NO . Not necessary . Clean the rim of that plate , chest out , chin high , you 're amazing for frying chicken at home and you know it . Accept accolades and high-five your damn self , too . <p> Have fun , dangit . Two years back I was in the cozy , warm , exactly-right kitchen of Ashely and Glenn English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease and so much laughter . Glenn made a kimchi frittata and Ashley sliced star fruit for a salad then used a small star-shaped cookie cutter to cut star shapes out of sliced cucumber . Ill never forget it ! star fruit salad with star-shaped cucumber , herbs , citrus and FUN . It was a really simple reminder to play with my food in unexpected and delicious ways . <p> Recognize what you do n't  need and let it goooo . This comes from a person who keeps a legitimately broken spatula in my kitchen utility utensil drawer because its my lucky spatula . Not true exactly its mostly just my broken spatula and someone needs to throw the dang thing away while I 'm not looking . Since likely no one is going to do that , I 'll have to let it go myself . As I spend more quality time in the kitchen , I 'm going to pay attention to what I use and what I dont- and throw away or donate those things that no longer work . We do n't  need the luck , we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm the queen of eating ( cheese ) standing at the kitchen counter , flipping through my phone . At some point I run out of cheese , and wander away from the counter to accomplish another task , likely forgetting that I 've eaten just so much cheese . Sit down . Have a proper snack if you want one . Just sit dooowwn so your knows and recognizes that its eating cheese glorious cheese . Its probably how the French do it , minus cigarettes . <h> 63 comments <p> To kitchenmommy , I re-organized my spices this fall . I cleaned out a drawer which now holds the majority of the bottles I use most often . Alphabetized . I 'm short and was continually having difficulty finding spices in the cabinet . I 'd get really irritated which fueled the fire of " Why am I doing this all by myself , and why isnt one of my offspring in here helping me " rant . And I really like to cook . Really like it . So in a not so short recap , the re-organization still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find similar spice bliss . <p> YES to all of this ! I 'm often guilty of presenting what I make with apologies . Last year I made a galette des rois ( including the puff pastry ) and I had a problem with my oven , so it almost did n't  make it to the table . Everyone was happily devouring it and I was still apologising . For a while I also stopped making dinner because " why bother if its only me ? " I 'm worth it , damnit . These are the kind of resolutions I can apply to my life . No , I 'm not going to start running . Sorry/not sorry . <p> You are so right , especially with the last one : sit down , feel that you are sitting down , eat . I also decided to put my phone away for mealtimes , its just so distracting Thank you so much for sharing ! <p> Love your kitchen resolutions so wise and tempered by experience ! But in the name of January-related organizing , I have got to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store ( a big variety of ) spices ? So they 're actually easy to reach ? I have a tiered thing in a cabinet that I 'm always knocking the front row spices off , plus a box in a lazy Susan for lesser-used spices and blends , but I know there 's just got to be a better way <p> kitchenmommy , for my most used spices I got a bunch of square tins with see through lids , put magnets on the bottom of them and have them hanging on a metal board on my wall ( have kept them on the side of the fridge too ) . Easy to see and access and keep an eye on what needs refilling . <p> This list is FANTASTIC . As a single gal myself , this is all so so very true . Were hospitable , considerate and accommodating to everyone that visits our homes yet we forget about the OG us . Thanks for this love yourself reminder ! : )

Sauce will last in the refrigerator for up to 1 week . <p> Whenever I think of steak sauce ( which I do like ) , I think back to when my then vegan sister worked at a steakhouse , and swore she could tell how low her tip was going to be according to how people ordered their steak and what they put on it . Medium-rare and nothing ? Great tip ! Medium-well and steak sauce ? 50-50 chance of a decent tip . Well-done and ketchup ? Youre screwed . Might as well pour some water in their laps .

The shipping was n't too horribly expensive and believe me , it was worth it , Sir Ks is the very best ever , as you say Joy , all hands down , most definitely ! I will probably have to get another shipment this autumn to refresh my supplies , as I cant see using anything else now I 've had these . Good call , Joy ! <p> Wildflowers are amazing , best to make sure they are native to your region so as not to introduce " invaders " though . I saw an article not too long ago about an amazing street where all the neighbours agreed not to mow or manicure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a cul-de-sac , so that helped " contain " the new meadow . The pictures were gorgeous and the children in that neighbourhood had their own private meadow in which to play and observe the wildlife heaven ! However , if its just your backyard , you can sow them within a big barrel tub or other container to keep them from spreading . I had mine in the middle of my front garden , sown into a large but shallow pond liner to prevent spreading . It was lovely watching the various plants as they bloomed at differing times of the spring and summer . Nothing spread into the lawn , which was kept mown to keep the neighbours happy . Interesting , though , how many little wildflower containers sprang up in other peoples front gardens after that ! <p> Joy does n't  need to worry about what 's native in New Orleans . Its pretty much impossible to figure out what 's local . The city rests on limestone , along with being Zone 9 .

Or elephant ears . Or papyrus .

Tonight will be some luscious goat cheese , spread on slices of crunchy crusted , chewy baguette and topped with a little dollop of my homemade , home canned , pear honey ( its a fruit spread , not a flavored honey ) made from pears I grew , and a lovely chilled Sauvignon Blanc .

@@2115601 <h> Bowl of Food : Spicy Roasted Vegetable Ramen <p> It always felt like my parents were early adopters to the whole health-food kick of the 1980s . If you werent around then or you werent old enough to be scarred by tofu-heavy dinners , you might not understand . Health food in the 1980s was all about tofu and strange rices . That 's my 6 year old self using the word strange to describe what was like just brown or black rice more toothsome and nutritious and , to my horror , not nearly as buttered as white rice . The saving grace of the 1980s health food epidemic ( fast and loose with the vocabulary ) , is that no one stopped to think that cheese might not be good for us ( so we ate a lot of cheese thank goodness ) , and also the whole dang saga might have taught me fine , borderline good eating habits . I 'm such a troll for complaining . <p> All of that to say that , really all I wanted- what would have made me feel like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So salty , carby , satisfying and delicious . How ungrateful is that ? <p> Now is the time when I thank my parents for spending their hard earned money- more than 25 cents of it- on food for our family , and then also let them know that instant ramen is now my guilty pleasure because dang that salty bite is good and I really have to think that they agree somewhere deep down on the inside . <p> Vegetables for roasting : things like carrots , zucchini , onions , garlic , mushrooms think about what vegetables you like roasted and go for it . You 're the boss of you and all those vegetables you bought . <p> Chicken stock , or beef or vegetable , or turkey . Turkey stock is my absolute favorite , followed closely by this homemade mushroom stock . <p> Instant Ramen Noodles . I used the sort that come in the 25 cent package with a very salty seasoning pack . Seasoning pack aside , the noodles cook quickly and keep their clever curl . Theyre familiar and so satisfying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew I had a drawer full of those dang things for a reason . <p> Soy sauce ( for that umami saltiness ) , fish sauce ( because we all just trust the process ) , and a troubling amount of chili paste ( again , because we trust the very spicy process ) . This is the kind of dish that is flavorful and spicy so spicy that you have to keep eating it in order to manage the hot hot hot . Know what I mean ? Bring it on . <p> Seaweed sprinkles for topping because what is dinner without a damn garnish ? <p> I feel like roasting vegetables is always a worthwhile , satisfying , menagerie of color and flavor . <p> That 's the second time I 've used the word menagerie today and both times I think I 've used it incorrectly .

@@2115645 <h> Baking 101 : Secrets of a Home Baker <p> I believe in our success as bakers . Our success means a lot to me . When you step in the kitchen with a recipe , I want you to come out with a masterpiece ( and like , no dishes but that 's not realistic ) . We are working within certain limitations when we step into our home kitchens . We ( and I 'm speaking from my own experience ) have a limited amount of mixing bowls , two small oven racks , not nearly enough refrigerator space , and a quickly dwindling flour jar . Its how we work within these limitations that influence the cake that comes out of the oven . <p> I 'd love to share a few of my tips and tricks with you . Its all about making our lives in the kitchen easier , packing the most flavor into our baked goods , and emerging from the kitchen with something totally stellar . No fancy proofing boxes , steam-injected ovens . My kitchen is humble , but supremely delicious ( so I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start with some good , old-fashioned mise en place . I wrote my very first ( and mostly embarrassing ) blog post about mise en place that 's how strongly I feel about it . Mise en place is about having all of your ingredients prepped , softened , melted , sifted , and measured before you begin baking . Its a great opportunity to check out your ingredients , and make sure you have everything you need before you get started . Do n't  underestimate this step . There 's nothing worse than running out of buttermilk mid-recipe . A newly discovered , but very important part of my mise en place is the garbage bowl . So simple . Keep a large bowl ( any bowl will do ) on the counter and throw all your trashy loose ends in the bowl instead of walking back and forth to the trash can . Tracy introduced me to the garbage bowl . Game changed . <p> Two : Baking is a science . Sure , things need to be precise . Take yo time when baking . Take your time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baking 101 : How To Read A Recipe <p> Three : Some recipes call for creaming butter and sugar . here 's the deal , creaming butter and sugar means that you 're beating butter and sugar together ( usually using an electric mixer with a paddle attachment ) in order to aerate the mixture . For the best results , butter must be softened to room temperature . Cold butter will be too tough to aerate . Beat the butter and sugar for 3 to 5 minutes on medium speed . If the butter is at room temperature , after three minutes you 'll notice that the mixture is pale in color and slightly fluffy . <p> Four : Before the sugar gets creamed into the butter , consider whether or not your recipe has any herb or fruit zest . Rub the herb and/or fruit zest into the granulated sugar , releasing all of the essential oils . This will rub a different level of flavor into our baked goods . Were adding major flavor to the sugar and that flavor will be distributed through our treats by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Five : In the same way that were making the most of our lemon zest and herbs , we can also boost the flavor of out spices ! Most recipes want us to stir our ground spices into the flour and leavening mixture . Nah. if we beat the spices into the butter and sugar mixture , the flavors will be dispersed with the butter . Bonus : fat is great for transferring flavor . <p> Six : Its really helpful to know a few baking equivalents . <p> 3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon <p> 4 tablespoons = 1/4 cup <p> 5 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon = 1/3 cup <p> 2 cups = 1 pint <p> 2 pints = 1 quart <p> 4 quarts = 1 gallon <p> Seven : Have fun .

Its part technique encyclopedia and part recipe book . There are helpful graphics , super solid recipes , and really beautiful photography . I adore this book ( and I 'm sharing the Curry Chicken Soup with Roasted Peanuts recipe soon ) ! <p> I love the garbage bowl idea . I love to clean as I go as I do n't  have a ton of counter space so I love this idea . Always checking ingredients before baking is a good one too .

Softening butter in the microwave makes the butter more melty than soft and can break our perfect buttercream , <p> Whipping together perfect buttercream frosting is n't hard , but there are a few tricks to make things go smoothly . <p> First , room temperature butter is creamed together with unsweetened cocoa powder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cocoa powder will ensure that the butter is soft and pliable and the chocolate is evenly distributed throughout the frosting .

Its so soft and creamy it wont rip the cakes or cause you undue stress . Plenty of frosting for a three layer cake or a sheet cake with frosting to spare . Any leftover frosting can be stored in the freezer for a cake or chocolate emergency . <p> This buttercream is also supreme eaten directly from the bowl with a spoon . <p> Cream together butter , cocoa powder and salt .

Bring to room temperature before frosting cakes and cupcakes . <p> This frosting is my go-to . I remember it was one of the first things I ever made along with your vanilla cupcakes . After making countless birthday cakes with these , all I can say is THANK YOU and may I return the favor with some cookies ? <p> This looks lovely !

First , you got to leave the heads on the shrimp ! Next , throw in some raw mushrooms . Use the mesh bag that the potatoes or lemons come in so that they do n't  disintegrate . Then throw in a few cans of artichokes . Just peel the label and pierce a few holes ( 6-8 ) in both ends with a screw driver and drain out the juice then just throw in the cans to soak up the goodness . You also have to double the amount of garlic you use . Nothing better then squishy garlic slathered on some saltine crackers . Lastly , throw in some good sausage that has been cut into 2-3 ? pieces . YUMMY ! That is how you do a shrimp boil . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to a LOT of boils .

@@2115654 <h> Baking 101 : The Difference Between Baking Soda and Baking Powder <p> I tell you this with nothing but love and understanding . I tell you this as a person who received the most mediocre grades in middle school science . I tell you this as someone who copied her chemistry homework from the nicest chemistry-smart boy she could find in high school . Do n't  judge . Its just the truth . <p> Baking is a science . Its important to understand the reactions . <p> We need to talk about baking powder and baking soda and you can totally copy my homework if you need to . Its cool . <p> The difference between baking soda and baking powder : <p> Baking soda and baking powder are both odorless white powders that work their magic in our cakes . Though they 're both white powders , the two are certainly not interchangeable . Let 's talk about the facts behind these baking essentials . <p> Baking soda is also known as sodium bicarbonate . I told you we were talking science . Stay with me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is formed . It 's this gas that gives rise to our favorite cakes , cookies and biscuits . There is one drawback to the production of this gas . When heated , sodium bicarbonate also produces sodium carbonate , which does n't taste very good . If you 've ever eaten any metallic tasting cakes or biscuits , you know what I 'm talking about . <p> Thankfully , the metallic taste of sodium carbonate can be neutralized by acid . Lemon , yogurt , buttermilk , and unsweetened natural cocoa powder can neutralize the taste of sodium carbonate and keep our baked goods risen and lifted . <p> Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda and acid . Yea ! Baking powder is part baking soda ! Baking powder is made up of baking soda , a powdered acid , and cornstarch . <p> Most baking powders are labeled double-acting ' meaning they release a small amount of carbon dioxide gas when they 're stirred into the batter or dough , but they release a majority of their precious gas when triggered by the heat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains both the sodium bicarbonate and the flavor-saving acid , it is usually paired with non-acid ingredients like whole milk and Dutch-processed cocoa . <p> Baking soda need an acid . Baking powder has an acid . We made that science easy , right ? <h> Share <h> 156 comments <p> Thank you for explaining it in such simple terms ! Light bulbs ! As a baker , I know which to use and know which ingredients pair well with them , but I could n't exactly spit the words out as to why it is that way . Sheesh , thanks ! <p> Thank you so very much . I 'm not a baker but I do a lot of cooking on top of the stove . I 'm slowly easing into baking because I have children who love baked breads muffins and cakes but I do have a question is there a certain flower that can be used to make light soft fluffy cakes instead of regular flour for bakery style cakes Thank you . <p> I like how simple you made this , even having already understood the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science and ratios behind baking , the more you can wing it and make up your own recipes ! <p> I make a caramel corn recipe that everyone raves about . Its calls for baking soda , but I never understood what the benefit of adding the baking soda is . I add it with vanilla after the butter , brown sugar and corn syrup boil . Can you tell me what the purpose of the baking soda might be ? <p> Do you bake the popcorn afterwards ? If so I think its because the caramel would make he popcorn soggy/soft if it was n't for the leavening . The baking soda makes the caramel crunchy after setting . This is just my logic though ! I 'm not absolutely certain ! : p <p> It actually literally makes the candy rise . Without it , the caramel corn would be rock hard , like a lollipop or hard candy . But if you add soda to leaven it , it adds teeny bubbles to the mix so its cruchy and does n't  break your teeth ! <p> Another difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder for baking soda , you 'll need MORE , since baking powder is only part baking soda . And that can affect the end taste , depending on what you 're baking . <p> I am enjoying the Baking 101 course and this lesson in particular . In future lessons I hope we learn about corn starch vs arrowroot vs flour and reasons why and when we should use or shouldnt use one or the other . <p> great post ! its something I 've always wondered about , ever since i first made banana cake with a recipe that called for both soda &amp; powder it turned out great , no doubt . But now I think I understand the reason better the sour cream in the recipe ( which really help keep the cake moist ) needs the baking powder to neutralize the acidity right ? 
@@2115655 <h> Six Ways To Make Instagram Both Beautiful and Bearable <p> Hey friends ! Can we talk about Instagram ? Does it feel like its gotten out of our hands ? Like everyone is everywhere doing everything ( with cocktails ) and were distinctly not ? Instagram has become a beautiful and nearly unbearable place . Here are my tips to contributing and carrying on . <p> First , we all owe one another an apology . I 'll go first . I 'm sorry I make everything look perfect on Instagram . In fact , nothing is perfect . Everyone is , in fact , doing the same thing .. hiding their pain and disguising their anxieties behind various overhead shots of coffee and doughnuts . I 'm sorry . I 'm guilty of the same . Let 's forgive people in advance for their perceived perfection , see past it and love each other anyway . <p> Let 's be generous with our likes . I mean , why not ? We follow each other for a reason and that reason is probably that we like each other , or you have cute kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent food adventures , or have a great sense of humor . Double tap . Like . Or unfollow in which case peace out , nothing personal . <p> There must be an element of beauty to Instagram . Were scrolling ( with increasing speed ) through visual images so our goal is to share our unique perception of beauty . Its about what you see , what speaks to you , and what you want to share . and a proper amount of apps to edit and filter the beauty we see . I love VSCO CAMfor overall filters and white balance , sharpening , and general loveliness . There 's a down and dirty VSCO food editing tutorial here for a few quick tips ! <p> Let 's talk about the nitty gritty of our food photography composition . Here are a few tips I like to work within when photographing the food I make and eat . <p> Tighten and clutter up the frame . This is a more is more approach . Add layers of texture and ingredients to the frame and inch them atop and very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  be scared . <p> Opposite of the more is more technique : allow for some breathing room in your photograph . Leaving empty space in a photograph is a nice rest for the eye . Simplicity is best ! <p> Remember the rule of thirds ? Same applies for ( ooey gooey ) food photography on Instagram . Its about placing a subject in the lower third , center , or upper third of a photograph frame creating concentration and tension in a picture . Also , all sticky buns look delicious so this was too easy . <p> Last , its ( just ) Instagram . More specifically its your Instagram . Do what feels good to you . Stand on a chair in a restaurant , style your friends hands just right . Forget the photograph and just dig into those cheese fries . Do what feels good to you . Perfection has its charm , but so does a real real life . Ai n't  no shame in the game . <p> Oh also all the cool kids are using Snapchat now so what are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently that to encourage people to take interest in your instagram you should develop a theme so I 've tried to keep my theme light and airy . I take loads of dark photos too , but save those for scrapbooking a more tangible version of instagram : ) <p> Instagram is the BEST . I used to use VSCO Cam to edit my pictures but now I just keep it to Instagram , I never use the filters but I do up the brightness by a big amount and play with saturation too , does the trick for me ! <p> So real , thank you . I wholeheartedly enjoy Instagram , but lately it has been more difficult than not to appreciate photos and scenes without having my head instantly compare or create or assume based on the fact that I am merely seeing " scenes of " and not a whole life . I especially liked the be generous with likes/comments part , which I will start doing . For me , my own Instagram is like my life photo album , I do n't  mean it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remind me who I am , what I 've done ( and that Ive probably had too many cocktails ) . <p> I love the idea of being generous with your likes .. I 'm often not , but seriously , why not ? Show a little love ! And the tips and tutorials are fantastic . Additionally your insta is amazing , Joy . When I insta , I seriously think , would Joy use this for a Let it Be Sunday ? Yes ? Post . Boom . <p> " We all owe one another an apology . " Ummmyou are the BEST ! This is true true true ! I totally did n't  even need the tips you shared . The first part was ah-mazing ! ( Though I do need instagram tips so perhaps Ill circle back ! )

Sincerely , Kimberly <p> We are egg free in our house ( allergies ) and I find using 20g of instant potato ( the powder stuffknown as Smash in the UK ) and 60ml of sour cream or yogurt or buttermilk works really well in most cases .

I 'm still not sure what to use it in . For baking I like to use regular table salt because I find the small grains blend easier into doughs , custards , and such .

This flour is great for just about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all-purpose flour is our happy go-to ! King Arthur All-Purpose Flour has a middle-of-the-road protein content of 11.7% ( while other brands typical fall around 10.4% to 10.5% ) . - This allows for the flour to be sturdy enough to hold its structure in a yeasted bread and light enough to produce an easy crumb in a layer cake . <p> I always have a giant container of all-purpose flour in pantry and I find that I use it for absolutely everything . <p> Whole Wheat Flour : Whole wheat flour means business . It is made by milling the entire wheat berry , not just the endosperm. - Whole Wheat Flour is darker in color , is full of wheat flavor , and creates a more dense flavorful baked good . It has a higher protein content ( about 14% ) as opposed to the 11.7% in all-purpose flour . <p> How do you substitute Whole Wheat Flour for All-Purpose Flour ? - Start by substituting- 25% of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour . - You can work you way up to substituting up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond 50% , we- have to make adjustments in terms of liquid , as whole wheat flour is more absorbent than all-purpose flour . - The easiest way to add the goodness of whole wheat flour to your all-purpose flour recipes is to use White Whole Wheat Flour . <p> I 've found that White Whole Wheat Flour is a really great way to incorporate whole wheat nutrition into many baked goods that may normally call for All-Purpose Flour . - Chocolate Chip Cookies and Blonde Brownies are especially great with White Whole Wheat Flour . - PJ from King Arthur Flour has a great tutorial on substituting White Whole Wheat Flour for All-Purpose Flour here . <p> Bread Flour : Bread flour is designed for yeasted baking ! It has a protein content of just under 13% which helps to create more gluten and more rise in our baked breads. - Its a very sturdy flour great to hold together the structure of yeasted doughs . <p> Irene from King Arthur Flour explained it in dinner roll terms . - Think about how you like your dinner rolls . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - All-purpose flour is the way to go . - If you prefer your rolls more firm , chewy , and substantial then bread flour would be your go-to bread baking flour . <p> Self-Rising Flour : Self-rising flour is a biscuit makers dream ! It is a softer , lower-protein ( 8.5% ) wheat flour that creates wonderfully tender biscuits and muffins. - Self-rising flour has an even lower protein content that all-purpose flour because its made using a soft wheat flour rather than the hard wheat flour that makes up all-purpose flour . <p> Self-rising flour also contains non-aluminum- baking powder and a dash of salt so we do n't  have to deal with measuring spoons and extra additions . <p> Cake Flour : Using cake flour in recipes creates the lightest cakes with the most tender crumb . King Arthur Cake Flour , specifically is very unique because it is unbleached ( the only unbleached cake flour on the market ) , with a protein content of just over 9%. - In this way , the flour is free of super-gross bleaching chemicals yet has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strong enough to hold together the tender crumb of a cake without adding toughness . <p> Think about it in terms of muffins vs cupcakes. - The inside of a muffin will have- bigger holes and a more chewy texture . - Cupcakes , on the other hand , will be more fine , tender , and even in texture . <h> Share <h> 87 comments <p> Oh my goodness , I 'm so excited !

You have answered a lot of the questions on the use of it , however I am still wondering on what is the difference between unbleached flour and the double 00 flour used in Italy .

My favorites were Horchata flavor and coconut . : ) <p> Between San Antonio and LA the best stops for gas and caffeine and candy and jerky and bucc-ee nuggets are Bucc-ees stations along I-10 and major roads , make sure you pick up some four cheese sausage for a quick meal in NOLA when you get there . <p> Lupe Tortilla the one Ive been to is in The Woodlands ( just north of Houston ) , but they have locations all over the Houston area .

I think of my starter as a pet , kept and fed so that I will have all the bread we need . Sourdough " starter " is a batter of flour and water , filled with living yeast and bacteria . The yeast and bacteria form a stable symbiotic relationship , and ( as long as you keep the starter fed ) can live for centuries , a thriving colony of microorganisms . To make sourdough bread , you blend the starter with some flour and make dough . The yeast propogates , and leavens your bread . This is how you make your starter : <p> Select a container that your " pet " will live in. - A wide-mouthed glass jar is best . I use a glass jar with a rubber and wireframe seal ; you can find these for $2-$4 in any antique or junk shop . A small crock with a loose lid is also great ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can also use a rubbermaid or tupperware container . I 've begun starters using the plastic containers that take-out Chinese soup comes in , and then transferred them to jars later ! A wide-mouthed mayonnaise or pickle jar will also do just fine . Metallic containers are a bad idea ; some of them are reactive and can ruin your starter ( for the same reason , avoid using metal utensils to stir your starter ) . <p> Blend a cup of warm water and a cup of flour , and pour it into the jar. - That 's the whole recipe ! I use plain , unbleached bread flour most of the time , but I 've had good results with all-purpose and whole-wheat flour , too . If you want , you can add a little commercial yeast to a starter to " boost " it . If you do this , sourdough snobs will look down their nose at you but who cares about snobs ? I personally find that ( at least here where I- live ) no yeast " boost " is necessary , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you are having trouble , go ahead and cheat . I wont tell . Note that starter made with commercial yeast often produces a bread with less distinctive sour flavor than the real thing . <p> Every 24 Hours , Feed the Starter. - You should keep the starter in a warm place ; 70-80 degrees Farenheit is perfect . This allows the yeast already present in the flour ( and in the air ) to grow rapidly . Temperatures hotter than 100 degrees or so will kill it . You can take comfort from the fact that almost nothing else will do so . The way you feed the starter is to(A)- throw away half of it and then- ( B ) - add a half-cup of flour and a half-cup of water . Do this every 24 hours . Within three or four days ( it can take longer , a week or more , and it can happen more quickly ) you should start getting lots of bubbles throughought , and a pleasant sour or beery smell . The starter may start to puff up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - When your starter develops a bubbly froth , it is done . You have succeeded. - If this sounds brain-dead simple , that 's because it is . People who did n't  believe the Earth was round did this for millenia . <p> Refrigerate the Starter. - Keep the starter in your fridge , with a lid on it . Allow a little breathing space in the lid . If you 're using a mayo or pickle jar , punch a hole in the lid with a nail , that kind of thing . Once the starter is chilled , it needs to be fed only once a week . Realistically , you can get away with less ; its important to remember that your starter is a colony of life-forms that are almost impossible to kill ( except with extreme heat ) . Even starving them is difficult . <p> More about caring for and feeding your starter , as well as proofing and baking can be found on S. John Ross helpful page . <p> I find sourdough starters to be intriguing . I had to make one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out as soon as class was finished . I was n't interested in breads at the time . What I find kind of cool is that the flavor of the starters varies by region depending on the air . A sourdough bread made in my kitchen might not taste the same as one made in the next state over . <p> I worked with a chef who has had a starter for years and years . I hear those things can really get out of control ! <p> OK , I 'm in . Your timing couldnt be more perfect because just this last weekend I was thinking that I needed to get a new starter going ( just did n't  like the last version enough ) . Anyway , I will get this one , well , started ! <p> I am totally casual about feeding our starter . We 've had it for many years and it thrives on neglect . Three weeks ignored ? No problem . We add flour and water the night before we want pancakes- equal parts with some interesting combination of flours ( often use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it looks too thin , we add flour , if too thick , we add water- all corrections in the morning . The hardest part of keeping it alive is keeping it- remembering to save a dollop before cooking . Any amount will do- that we never measure . Pet rock- good description ! <p> I keep two starters in the fridge , all-purpose and whole wheat , both come from a woman who baked bread EVERY day for 25 years for her family with six kids . Whoa , that 's a lot of bread . For the longest time , I fed my starters every few days , being oh-so-careful with measuring / weighing / timing . Now I only feed them the day before I 'm going to use them throwing in some flour , stirring in some water then leave out on the counter to revive . Theyre resilient more like an independent cat than a needy dog . Or maybe mostly , like a pet rock . <p> I just created my first starter , and baked my first loaf of sourdough bread a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that I used ) is to weigh your starter ingredients , instead of measuring them by volume . This makes things more consistent . Also , after feeding my starter once a day for a few days , I started moving to twice a day , which ensured that my starter was well-fed . You 'll know your starter is working if it can at least double itself in volume between feedings . Yay for sourdough !

<p> In the same pan , having removed the chicken , I made a roux . - Butter is melted in a pan over medium heat . - Flour is added and whisked together is the butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youre totally doing it right . <p> Slowly stream in the chicken broth , whisking away . - The flour will ensure that the mixture is thick and luscious. - A little chicken stock at a time , followed by a little milk at a time . <p> Once all of the vegetables are chopped , its more about layering flavors that 's totally the fun part for me . <p> The vegetables are n't  cooked all the way through . - Its ok if there 's a bit of a crunch . - Once the vegetables are combined with the chicken and sauce , they 're ready to fully cook inside the buttery crust . <p> Oh man this is really getting good ! <p> The crust tuck is everything . <p> Its best to if your crust is still a bit chilled while assembling this pie . - That can prove challenging after all of the rolling , filling , and topping . - I 'm learning that keeping a chilled pie crust is also near impossible in New Orleans . - Seriously . - Just do the best you can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to . <p> Let 's talk about the crust tuck . <p> The bottom and top crust are trimmed , leaving about 1-inch over crust overhand. - Holding the bottom and top crust together , fold the two under , tucking it into the glass pie plate . - This will seal in all of the pie good-times . <p> To make the crust , - in a medium bowl , whisk together flour and salt . - Add cold , cubed butter and , using your fingers , work the butter into the flour mixture . - Quickly break the butter down into the flour mixture , some butter pieces will be the size of oat flakes , some will be the size of peas . - Create a well in the butter and flour mixture and pour in the cold buttermilk. - Use a fork to bring to dough together . - Try to moisten all of the flour bits . - On a lightly floured work surface , dump out the dough mixture . - It will be moist and shaggy. - That 's perfect . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disks . - Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour . <p> To make the filling , start by dicing the onion , garlic , carrots , green beans , and thawing the frozen peas . - Set aside . <p> In a medium saucepan over medium heat , melt butter . - Whisk in the flour . - Mixture will be very thick . - Heat for 1 minute . - Turn flame to low and slowly add the chicken stock . - Whisk until no flour bits remain . - Whisk in the milk and add the cream cheese . - Heat over medium low heat , stirring often , until cream cheese has melted and the mixture is the consistency of warm , thick pudding . - Add salt and pepper to taste . - Remove mixture from heat and spoon into a medium bowl . - Set aside . <p> To assemble the pie , remove one of the pie dough disks from the fridge . - On a lightly floured surface , roll dough out into about a 13-inch round . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fingers to move the emerging circle around the floured surface . - This ensures that the dough is n't sticking to the work surface . - The circle wo n't be perfect , that 's ok. - Try not to get any tears in the rolled out dough , but if you do , they can be patched together with extra dough . - - When you roll the dough and you can see it start springing back , that means that the butter is warming and the crust should n't be rolled out anymore . - Gently lift the 13-inch round from the floured surface and center in a deep 9-inch round pie dish . - Place in the fridge while you roll out the top crust . <p> Roll out the top crust just as you did the bottom crust , moving the dough across the floured surface every once in a while , and creating a roughly 13-inch circle . <p> Spoon the filling into the bottom pie crust . <p> Carefully remove the top crust from the work surface and drape over the filling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim the crust , leaving about 1-inch overhang . - With your fingers press the top and bottom crusts together and fold under . - Use a fork or your fingers to crimp the edges of the dough . - Cut five small slits in the top of the crust so the steam can vent . - Brush lightly with beaten egg and place in the fridge to chill while the oven preheats . <p> Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 400 degrees F. <p> Place pie in the oven bake- for 10 minutes . - Reduce the oven heat to 375 and bake for 10 to 15- more minutes , or until the crust is golden brown . - Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 1 hours before serving . - Place covered in the fridge to store . - Pie lasts up to 3 or 4 days . <h> Share <h> 131 comments <p> This is the most hilarious true-to-life post I have ever read here , which is saying by golly gracious a lot onion buttsbra strappingwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big deal or anythingor maybe we could be neighbors ?

@@2115688 <h> Beer Brownies <p> Brownies were the first thing I learned how to bake in the kitchen . My parents kept the flour , sugar , and those gnarly bars of unsweetened chocolate in a little cabinet just within reach of my little 8 year-old body . It only took me one nibble of the unsweetened chocolate to figure out that it was not at all suitable for sneak-snacking but the box of unsweetened chocolate had step-by-step instructions on how to turn the dark blocks into something entirely delicious , aka BROWNIES ! <p> In our house filled with whole wheat fig bars and date rolls , I felt like a wizard like an actual wizard because I could make brownies . <p> I still feel like a wizard . I mean brownies are magic ! Dense , moist , waaay chocolate-y , chewy at the edges , earnest , and everything ! <p> There are so many great Fall cookbooks hitting the shelves this year ! I need to make us a list . There 's just too much good ! <p> One of the books I 've been looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claire is the beauty and brains behind the blog The Kitchy Kitchen and she 's turned all of her amazing food-brain-thoughts into a lovely cookbook ! Among the goodness in this book ( it has an amazing soup chapter ) are these BEER BROWNIES ! <p> Think about it . Dark stout beer with all of its earthy bitterness + dark chocolate with all of its deep sweet fruit undertones . This is a very good marriage . Right on , Claire ! <p> These brownies have chocolate two ways : unsweetened cocoa powder and melted semi-sweet chocolate . I love the base that cocoa powder adds and the creamy fats that melted chocolate promise . <p> The butter is melted until juuust slightly browned , and the eggs are at room temperature for easy whisking . <p> Butter , melted chocolate , and beer are whisked together into deliciousness . <p> Sugars , eggs , and eventually the vanilla extract are whisked together . <p> Mixing dry chocolate and wet chocolate .

A little of that . A good splash of beer . Some time in the oven . A sprinkling of sugar and taadaaa ! Brownies ! These brownies are alluring . Its the beer . Dense and moist with a good dose of chocolate and an extra hit of sweetness . The beer does n't  add a beer taste to the brownies , rather an earthy depth that you cant quite put your finger on . <p> I found that these brownies were ( of course ) delicious warm from the oven , but were extra great a day after baking when the sweetness has a chance to mellow a bit . Keep the brownies , wrapped at room temperature and enjoy enjoy ! Thank you , Claire . Love your food brain for real . <p> Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the chocolate mixture and whisk to combine . Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until all of the ingredients are well combined . Fold in the chocolate chips . <p> Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the edges are firm and the center is set .

Paulette <p> Hey Joy I think you left something out or added something in . Either way , you list a cup of chocolate chips at the end of the ingredients list , but do n't  mention them in the instructions . ( Nor are they present in your pictures ) Also , there 's no mention of where you add the vanilla in the recipe itself , although you do say that you whisk them in with the eggs and sugars in the picture descriptions . But these look fab , and I 'm definitely going to try them !

@@2115701 <h> Baking 101 : Why We Use Large Eggs In Baking <p> Eggs play an important roll in our baked goods . Eggs add structure , leavening , color , and flavor to our cakes and cookies . Its the balance between eggs and flour that help provide the height and texture of many of the baked goods here on Joy the Baker . Its a balancing act . <p> Different parts of the egg pull the weight in different ways . When whipped egg whites are folded into a batter , they help the cake to rise . Angel Food Cake is a perfect example of the power of egg whites . Egg yolks add a really lovely richness and thickening power to custards and ice cream bases . Cookie No-Dough Ice Cream is a prime example of the luscious thickening power of yolks . Yes I just said luscious . <p> When whole eggs are heated , they become firm we know this from eating hard-boiled eggs for breakfast . That 's the structure that helps bind our cakes . Finally , when beaten eggs are brushed onto unbaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusts . That 's a lot , right ! ? All from inside that light brown shell . <p> With all of the heavy lifting that eggs do in our kitchen , we really should talk about why we use a particular size egg in baking . Why Do We Use Large Eggs In Baking ? Because it matters . here 's the deal : <p> Here in the US we have different size eggs : medium , large , extra-large , and jumbo . The large the egg , the more egg goodness inside the egg . <p> Large eggs are about 57 grams or 3 1/4 tablespoons of egg . Extra-large eggs are about 64 grams , or 4 tablespoons of egg . Jumbo eggs are even larger . <p> Most baking recipes call for large eggs . If a recipe calls for two large eggs , that means the proportions of the recipe are counting on about 6 1/2 tablespoons of liquid egg . If we were to use extra-large or even jumbo eggs in place of large eggs , we 'd adding far more liquid that the recipe proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking . Its not always that 1 extra tablespoon of liquid will ruin a recipe . Let 's not get crazy . But , the more incorrectly sized eggs used in a recipe , the more the proportions are thrown . Four extra-large eggs instead of four large eggs means adding 3 extra tablespoons of liquid . <p> When it comes to successful baking ( and successful living ) , were just trying to get as many things right as possible . Using large eggs , as most recipes indicate , is a part of that success . <p> If a recipe does not indicate the size egg to use , stick with large . <p> If a recipe calls for extra-large or jumbo eggs , like many of Ina Gartens recipes do raise your eyebrow and follow along . That either means buying larger eggs or weighing the eggs for accuracy . Its weird though . I wish Ina knew that was weird . <p> I learnt this lesson early on in my baking experience . I always was ( still is ) cheap and wanted to save money by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never right . So now , I only every but large eggs both for baking and for daily consumption . Good writeup , Joy ! <p> Interestingly , a large egg in Australia is 50-58g , America is 57g , New Zealand is 62g , and Europe is 63-73g so you could be adding in a significantly incorrect amount of egg if you use a recipe that does n't  specify weight ( unless you know the authors country ) .

@@2115706 <p> There is a fundamental difference between Dutch-processed and natural cocoa powder . The difference is acid . - Yea ! - Were talking about acid reactions again , this time by way of cocoa powder . - Who knew that cocoa powder was acidic ? - Well .. now we do ! - It 's worth understanding . <p> Dutch-processed cocoa powder is cocoa powder that has been washed in a potassium solution that neutralizes its acidity . The Dutching process also gives the cocoa powder a darker color . Dutch-processed cocoa powder in baking is usually paired with baking powder because , as mentioned in The Difference Between Baking Soda and Baking Powder , the baking powder takes care of the acid component in leavening our baked goods . <p> Natural cocoa powder- is cocoa that has not had its acid stripped .

It used to be quite easy to get at the super market , but all of a sudden its just gone .

Why is it so hard to find ? <p> Actually I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processed , even if there is n't an alkalizing agent listed in the ingredients ( e.g. Cadbury Bournville only lists cocoa powder in the ingredients but it is actually dutch processed ) which is why people in european countries struggle to make a naturally coloured red velvet cake the pH difference between the mixture made with dutched and natural cocoa powder causes the colouring the in the beetroot to react differently when cooking you can only maintain the red colour if you use natural cocoa powder , which as far as I can tell is really hard to get hold of in the UK . <p> Thanks so much for this , Joy ! In Europe we hardly ever use baking soda in our recipes and I am pretty sure that 's the reason why we use Dutch-processed cocoa most of the time .

In the UK I 'm not sure we have dutch processed cocoa powder , or at least its not common in supermarket , so I just tend to use natural . Now I know why most recipes use baking soda with cocoa powder ! <p> In Ireland you can get dutch processed cocoa in the supermarket organic Green &amp; Blacks . It is visibly much darker than Cadburys ( &amp; much tastier ! ) and not much more expensive . Keep an eye out for that black tub !

@@2115709 <h> Baking 101 : Why We Use Unsalted Butter <p> I 'm not shy about sharing my affection for butter , but you may have noticed in the recipes here that I 'm very specific about how I like my butter . Sometimes melted and browned . Sometimes cold and cubed . Sometimes beaten with sugar and egg . Always though most almost always .. UNSALTED ! Yea , I get opinionated about my butter . We should talk about why . <p> Butter is typically made from cow 's milk and consists of mostly butterfats . Low-fat buttes are suspicious , at best . Butter is generally about 80% fat , with the remaining 20% consisting of water and milk solids . <p> You have a choice when you go to the grocery : salted or unsalted butter . If you 're thinking about slathering your butter on a warm baguette , you 'll want to reach for the salted butter . If you 're baking a cobbler , you 'll most definitely want to reach for the unsalted butter . <p> Here 's why : <p> Most importantly : unsalted butter ensures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your cakes , cookies and Fig and Almond Breakfast Cake . Different companies add different amounts of salt to their butter . How are we to know how salty our butter is , and how we should adjust the salt in the recipe ? It 's too much of a guessing game . Removing the salt from the butter equation puts us in control of salting . Control is very important when it comes to flavor . <p> When a recipe calls for unsalted butter , that means that the salt levels in the recipe account for no other salt source . If all you have salted butter , try cutting the instructed salt amount in half . <p> Also , salt is a preservative . Salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter . That means that unsalted butter is typically fresher . <p> Salt can mask flavors ! We may not be able to taste or smell if our butter is off because clever clever salt can mask funky taste and odors . Tricky . <p> Does butter really go bad ? Heck yes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerator . Salted butter lasts for just over 3 months in the refrigerator ( that 's so long , right ? ) . If you think your butter might be off , give it a good sniff . The nose always knows . Also , slice your butter . Is the inside the same color as the outside or is the outside a darker casing around the butter ? Bad butter is two different colors . <h> Share <h> 121 comments <p> Its like the baking gods read my mind &amp; asked you to write this post . I was standing in the butter section for minutes yesterday pulling out my hair over the salted &amp; unsalted butter &amp; which would be best for my cake experiment . Something told me you would be shaking your head at the salted option so I went for the other . So glad I did &amp; I 'm so glad you posted this . Thank you . <p> Generally there is a little over 1/4 teaspoon of salt in one stick of butter . In one pound of butter there is 1 1/4 teaspoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.26 teaspoons in a pound for those of you who want to get that extreme . I buy salted butter because it last I buy 4 to 5 pounds at a time and I just adjust my salt for my recipes and it works very well . The only time I will buy unsalted butter is when my recipe calls for a lesser amount of salt that is in salted butter . <p> This is a cultural thing though too as in some countries and therefore their traditional recipes salted butter is the answer ! Take France for example , most particularly Brittany and Normandy , they would always use salted butter . I for one always use salted butter ! <p> Love this ! Most people look at me blankly when I tell them about salted vs. unsalted . I always bake with unsalted and I think it makes a big difference in the quality of my baked goods . I did n't  know about the freshness angle , though you 've taught me something today ! <p> Gosh I love this series : ) I actually found some salted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.7% ) , which came in handy when I was just a tad short on my unsalted butter while in the midst of baking !

I still use the same Tupperware stacking measuring cups I got about thirty years ago . My mother never used dry measuring cups and put everything in her Pyrex liquid ones . That is , if she bothered to measure at all . She was one of those cooks who never measured , which is why bread making was always impossible to learn from her because she just knew how much flour was necessary by the feel of the dough . I learned how to properly measure ingredients and follow a baking recipe in my 8th grade " Foods " class . I just loved knowing that I could bake just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerd in me , though , wants that digital scale so I can bake like Jamie Oliver does . <p> Sometimes I use both in the SAME RECIPE . I 'm the confuser . I 'm multi-cultural . Its fusion baking . <p> Cups are so easy for liquids , I love em . Scales are great for throwing everything in the bowl quickly , resetting in between , I love em . The only cup measurement that bothers me is butter who measures butter in cups ? Who is doing that ? <p> I grew up weighing ingredients , and it gives me that exact nostalgia you 're talking about , which is just a lovely feeling . Really enjoying Baking 101 , thank you so much for it ! <p> As an American living in Germany , I have also traveled down both measuring roads . Ca n't say that I have a real preference , but it sure is fun teaching my German friends how to measure dry ingredients in volume when they ask for my American recipes . <p> On the butter issue : 1 cup of butter = about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact weight is 236 grams . ) <p> I 'm with you Joy . I have both but my natural inclination is to reach for my measuring cups .

This is a great post and no doubt the comments will be great ! <p> And I love playing UNO . Havent played in a good 20 years I think though ! Must change that ! <p> I am sorry but I going to have go for team scale here . I love my scale and hate the cup conversion . Maybe because I make macarons and pastries more often than the normal baker . Hehehe .

Either way , I guess it is up the baker to know what suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally use a scale because hey.I got no choice here haha . All the cookies and cakes that my mom made in her German kitchen were made using a scale . But after I had been to America , I could n't live without my chocolate chip cookies any moreand so I bought cups there and took them back home with me . And since the emerging of all those great American food blogs , cups are a necessity anyway . I really love both weighing methods , though : ) <p> I have both measuring cups and a scale . I 'm european and Ive always used grams , but since my baking books are mostly american I have bought measuring cups . It works pretty well specially with liquid measures . But with flour I did n't  know what went wrong And this post has explained a lot of the messes that I made in the past . Sift that flour girl ! ! ! ! I once measured 1 cup of flour and it measured 156 grams which is in fact 1,5 cups so this is brilliant Joy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking some serious cakes . For conversions I use convert-me.com is a brilliant website that has a specific cooking converter and you choose the ingredient and it makes the conversion according to each ingredient . Its specially useful for me for the butter measures , because I do n't  know what the heck a stick of butter is ! ! <p> I love this ! I used to measure by weight until I started reading a bunch of american food blogs and they dragged me over to the dark side . Now measuring using scales seems fussy and I ca n't be bothered , even though it clearly is the more accurate way haha . You 'll never get me with your inches though , centimeters for life : P <p> I 'm team scale all the way simply because there is less washing up . I can measure straight into bowls , saucepans anything I 'm going to use . I do n't  have to keep cleaning the measuring cup every time I use it . I do use a tool called kitchen maths which converts grams to cups and vice versa but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I use the scale as much as possible , nothing worse than peanut butter or honey in a measuring cup . And you only need one bowl , two if you have to keep the wets and drys separate , just by putting it back to zero for every new ingredient . <p> I live in Japan and learned to use scales for baking and cooking in general 40 years ago . They are MUCH better . Its faster and no mistakes are made . I find it easy to use British cookbooks that typically give the recipes in grams . I think America should go digital ! !

The slices , the color , the texture . Its like orange velvet without so much as one singular crumb out of place . You need to be a surgeon with those razor-sharp , perfectly precise slices . Talk about skills . I am not a good slice-of-pie remover . Half the thing gets mutilated . Lol pinned <p> Yesterday I was looking for vitamin A rich foods and sweet potatoes were high up on the list . This morning I open my email and bang , sweet potato pie right there .

@@2115715 <h> Homemade Hot Dog Buns <p> You know that weird question people ask you What would you choose to eat as your last meal ? . Geeeez what a daunting question ! - People ask it so frivolously. - When asked this question ( and I 'm asked this question with weird frequency ) this dialogue runs through my head : <p> You know that 's actually going to happen right ! ? - Were actually all going to have a last meal , because were all going to die . - I think you want me to talk about chocolate chip cookies right now , or prime rib , or I do n't  know but all I 'm thinking about now is my own mortality and all the ridiculous things I have to ask God forgiveness for . - And now I 'm thinking about your mortality how do you like that ? - And now I 'm thinking about- my cats mortality and really , I think that 's a rude thing for your to make me think of . - Why would you do that ? - I thought we were friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Aaaaaaannnyyway . <p> Hot dogs would totally be my last meal . - But since its my last meal , these hot dogs must be exactly perfect . <p> Its really important not to futz with the dough too much during and after its second rise . - You do n't  want to deflate the precious rise you 've created . - A tender hand and a light kitchen towel to cover the dough will do . <p> *King Arthur Flour gives a fairly wide flour measurement variation for a couple of reasons . First , you 'll find in the summer that you 'll need a bit more flour to absorb a given amount of liquid than you will in the winter . This is because its humid and flour acts somewhat like a slightly dampened sponge as a result . - I used 6 1/2 cups flour for my hot dog buns . <p> King Arthur Flour also notes that this particular dough should be quite slack , i.e. , very relaxed in order to make soft and tender buns . So you want to add only enough more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough just kneadable ; sprinkling only enough more to keep it from sticking to you or the board . <p> To mix the dough : - In a large bowl , dissolve the sugar and then the yeast in the warm water . Add the milk , oil , salt and 3 cups of flour to the yeast mixture . Beat vigorously for 2 minutes . <p> Gradually add flour , 1/2 cup at a time , until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl . Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface . <p> To Knead the dough : - - Knead until you have a smooth , elastic dough . Because this dough is so slack , you may find that a bowl scraper or bench knife can be helpful in scooping up the dough and folding it over on itself . <p> To rest and rise the dough : - Put the dough into an oiled bowl . Turn once to coat the entire ball of dough with oil . Cover with a tightly-woven dampened towel and let rise until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buns : - - Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface . Divide into 18 equal pieces . This is done most easily by dividing the dough first into thirds , then those thirds into halves , then the halves into thirds . <p> Roll the dough into cylinders , 4 1/2-inches in length . Flatten the cylinders slightly ; dough rises more in the center so this will give a gently rounded top versus a high top . <p> Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and lightly grease the parchment paper . <p> For soft-sided buns , place them on prepared baking sheets a half inch apart so theyll grow together when they rise . For crisper buns , place them three inches apart . <p> Second Rising : Cover with a towel and let rise until almost doubled , about 45 minutes . - Just drape a towel over the buns for the second rose , a piece of plastic wrap may stick and deflate the buns when the plastic is removed . <p> To Bake : - - Fifteen minutes before you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just before baking , lightly brush the tops of the buns with the egg wash and sprinkle with whatever seeds strike your fancy . <p> Bake for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the bread reaches 190-F . ( A dough thermometer takes the guesswork out of this . ) <p> When the buns are done , remove them from the baking sheet to cool on a wire rack . This will prevent the crust from becoming soggy . <h> 148 comments <p> Its so funny , I was sitting on my moms porch yesterday afternoon , and she said " I 've been seeing a lot of hot dog rolls with poppy seeds on tv lately . They look so good , but I can not find them in the stores " .. <p> Its as if you heard our conversation , because I then replied " I wonder if we could find a recipe for them " <p> And I wake up this morning to find this recipe in my inbox . How cool is that ? I am going to go out and buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my momma with them . She has cancer , so shell only eat about 1/2 of the hot dog , but it will be so worth it . Thank you so much for reading our minds .. : - ) I 'll let you know how it goes <p> How did you just make a hot dog bun sound so darn tasty ! ? I mean really- I never appreciated the sacrafice a bun made for a slab of meat ! Props lady baker for giving some respect to the buns ! ! ! I might actually do this- instead of just eating hot dogs w/ salad ( oh grownupness sucks ) <p> I havent had a really good hot dog in ages ! For some reason , to me hot dogs tasted sooooo good after a long day of swimming in the sun . That 's how I spent my childhood summers and the taste of hot dogs after getting out of the pool is unbeatable . <p> I have often thought about that question too of what my last meal would be . And I always have NO IDEA ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crave changes daily or even by the minute . And my palate is always evolving , so what I love now wont be what I 'll want ten .. twentyfifty years from now . <p> The last meal question is strange . A very very tiny percentage of the people will know they are having a last meal ( those on death row ) . How about asking " what meal would you have if an alien dropped in for dinner on a weeknight " ? If the alien is vegetarian , strike off hot dog from the list ! <p> That is a fun question . Reminds me that we used to ask Mom what she would make if the Queen were to come for dinner . Being a very practical and down to earth woman , she would say , " Just whatever we are having today " . Mom was a very good cook , so I 'm sure the Queen would have loved whatever she served up . I am going to try the buns . I wonder if our Canadian Robin Hood flour is similar to King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I would have no problem eating about 3 buns ! That dough is BEAUTIFUL ! I love big , shaggy , wet , moist doughs like that . That just sort of PUFF into a huge puffball during the first rise . Gosh , I love seeing a big bowl of risen dough . And then the punchdown sound . The best . No , eating one or 3 of these buns truly the best . Pinned !

It took everything in me not to throw colored sprinkles in the mix . Classing it up ! <p> Salted pistachios are shelled and coarsely chopped . Chili-rubbed almonds are ( snacked on ) and coarsely chopped . Cocoa nibs are appreciated for their dark and bitter crunch . Were ready to sprinkle ! <p> Melted chocolate is mandatory otherwise we just have bananas on sticks , and what fun is that ? <p> Dip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messy things are also pretty . I think this only happens when chocolate and pistachios are involved . My kitchen is messy and not so pretty at all . <p> These summer treats are exactly as advertised : chocolate and chilled , sprinkled bananas .

Covered in chocolate and salty nuts , I mean . <p> Melt chocolate over a double boiler ( or in the microwave , if you prefer ) with coconut oil . Stir until smooth , glossy , and entirely melted . <p> Insert a popsicle stick into one end of each banana piece . Dip each banana into the warm melted chocolate . Shake off excess chocolate as best you can . Place dipped bananas on a parchment lined baking sheet . Sprinkle generously with chopped pistachios , chopped almonds , or cocoa nibs . Place in the freezer to harden and set . <p> I 've seen some weird shaped frozen bananas ( crotch-regiony , as mentioned above ) but these look beautiful . I do n't  think I could keep it as classy as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop myself . <p> LOVE these ! And it would have been more than okay if you had thrown a boatload of sprinkles in because I do n't  think they necessarily un-class things too much . Rationalizing here b/c I throw plenty of them in things ! <p> The first vertical picture , with the cream drapes and tabletop shot I love that . The light is gorgeous . And its just so pretty ! If that was my photography corner , I could stand there all day ! What a great space !

@@2115723 <h> Learn To Love Your Cast Iron Skillet <p> I 'll let you in on a little secret . When I 'm not eating the ridiculous baked goods that come out of my oven , I 'm eating eggs . Eggs inside of fried corn tortillas . I eat eggs because , as a baker , I always have eggs in the fridge and they 're super easy to fry up and call dinner . Eggs , always eggs , with salt , pepper and tortillas . There , now you know . <p> I cook my eggs and fry my tortillas in the same cast iron skillet day after day . This skillet is always riddled with the evidence of some sort of cooked egg . But with a little hot oil , some salt and a paper towel , its as good as clean . <p> If you have a cast iron skillet that could use some love , here 's how to season and care for that bad boy . Cast iron skillets are too bad ass to waste away in your cupboard . Get to it ! <p> Cast iron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a nonstick pan . It becomes a nonstick delight through a process called seasoning . Seasoning is basically oiling and baking your cast iron skillet . I 've seen some cast iron pans sold pre-seasoned in stores . These pans already have their shiny black seasoned finish and you can cook in them immediately . You still may need to re-season these beauties as they go . You may also need to re-season your cast iron if you burn something into the pan and have to scrub it out with soap and water . Its certainly not the end of the world . A bit of oil and a hot oven will bring your cast iron right back to life . <p> How to Season Cast Iron <p> 1 . Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Position one rack in the top third of the oven . Position another rack in the bottom third of the oven and place an empty foil lined backing sheet on the bottom rack . This sheet will catch any dripping from the cast iron . <p> 2 . Open your windows or turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , but I 've never had this issue . <p> 3 . Over a medium flame , rub a thin layer ( about 1 Tablespoon ) of vegetable shortening , like Crisco , or oil " bacon grease works great , too " all over the inner bottom and sides of the pan with a paper towel and tongs . <p> 4 . Place the oiled pan upside down in the heated oven over the foil lined baking sheet . <p> 5 . Bake the cast iron for 1 hour . Turn the oven off and allow the cast iron to cool to room temperature in the oven . Repeat this process 3 or 4 times for best results . <p> When the pan is perfectly seasoned , the inside with be smooth and shiny . Sometimes after seasoning my pans come out a bit sticky . This usually clears up with a bit of cooking . I usually make sure that the first few things I cook in a newly seasoned cast iron are either fried or sauteed in a bit of oil . <p> Note : Never cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will break down the seasoned pan . <p> Another Note : Hardcore cast iron people have different cast iron for different purposes . For example , they season their dessert cast iron with vegetable oil , but their savory cast iron with bacon grease . They have certain cast irons they use for cornbread and other they use for fish dishes . I stay safe and just season all of my cast iron with a tasteless oil so they can go either way . <p> How to Clean Cast Iron <p> 1 . When you 're finished cooking in cast iron , scrape out the pan , while still warm , with a wooden spoon . Wipe it down with a bit of oil on a paper towel . I usually use the canola oil I have on hand . <p> 2 . If scraping the pan with a spoon does n't  get off all the grime , melt a tablespoon of vegetable shortening in the pan , turn off the flame and add a tablespoon of salt . Use a paper towel in tongs to scrub the pan . Wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , dry it well , and follow the re-seasoning directions above . <p> 3 . If the wooden spoon and the salt technique werent to your liking you can use a mild , diluted soap and a soft sponge to clean the pan . You just want to avoid strong soaps and super scrub pads . Dry the pan with a clean dry dish towel and set in a warm oven to dry completely . Follow the seasoning directions above to re-season cast iron . <p> I know some people either love cast iron or simply do n't  know what to do with it . Ev- I 'm so glad I saved you from giving away your pans . I know once you get them all seasoned up , you 'll think they 're just glorious ! Sara- a cast iron skillet for your very own house ? Sounds amazing ! Theresa- I 'm so glad you 're enjoying yours ! Lissi- I think what I like most about my cast iron is knowing that they 're from way way way back in my family . It just feels right to have a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its nice to see that someone else loves their cast-iron , too ! Everyone I know is into the non-stick whatever of the moment , but I love the cast-iron skillets I have from my husbands **38;813;TOOLONG knows how far back . Theyre fantastic !

@@2115726 <h> Happy Hour Hot Fudge Milkshake <p> My very first job was in an ice cream shop . That means between the ages of fifteen and seventeen I smelled like a waffle cone and had between three and seven sprinkles scattered throughout my hair at any given moment . Summers were long and hot , but if you made nice with the boys that worked in the pizza place next door you either had a make-out partner for the deep freezer , or someone to trade you obscene amounts of pizza for obscene amounts of ice cream . I opted for the later exchange mostly because I was awkward and did n't  really have a choice . <p> Everyday on my ice cream lunch break I would make myself a giant milkshake and head outside the ice cream shop to sit on a sunny stoop . These were the days before cellphones ( I know , BONKERS ) , so I 'd watch people mill about and think about what the future held for me .

Throw in a shot of bourbon and this Happy Hour escape is just beyond . <p> Ah ! If I could only tell my fifteen year old self what I know now <p> The highlight of this milkshake is the deep dark hot fudge sauce . I used an 86% Intense Dark Chocolate from Ghirardelli .

Tragic . <p> Heres what you 'll need : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went with French Vanilla . <p> Whole milk . Treat yourself . <p> Pure vanilla extract and a swig of bourbon ( if you 're into that sort of thing ) . <p> Dark Chocolate Hot Fudge Sauce .

Because you 're worth it , every bit . <p> Combine all the creamy , boozy , and vanilla elements and blend ( in a milkshake machine or blender ) until smooth and irresistably thick .

And , Oh Lordy . Its awesome and a huge clean-up saver . I use it , probably , for way too many things like french fries and chicken nuggets too . . . . High five right back atcha . I totally agree ! <p> Just a heads upwe use parchment paper a lot on sheet pans at cooking school but chef believes you ca n't roast veggies to perfection with parchement paper . Carmalization is more difficult with parchment paper ( more likely to steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like buying mine in sheets rather than rollsso much easier ! <p> SO true ! Parchment paper is much more for us messy bakers than the tidy , organized Martha types ! ( though oh how I wish I could be tidy too ) Its a life saver , a time saver and also a washing up saver I use it when measuring stuff out on my scales so I do n't  have to wash the bowl between weighing butter and flour . <p> I agree with the re-usability of parchment paper While baking a cake , if it starts browning too fast , cover the cake loosely with parchment paper ; it prevents over-browning and ensures even baking Totally worth having in the kitchen ! <p> I am a pastry professional . Today I showed up at work to find out we out of parchment paper . I was dumbfounded . I looked at my manager with a " you expect me to do my job with out it " face .

I often us it as a plate . <p> My favorite parchment paper is " If You Care " brand . It is unbleached and compostable ! Its made from silicon , which is non toxic and renewable . So I do n't  feel guilty throwing it away , even though I use it about 25 times before I do get rid of it . I love it for roasting sweet potatoes and squash if they ooze out onto the pan it is a huge mess to scrub off , but you can reuse the parchment paper too ! It is very sturdy , and even the cardboard box is recycled materials and biodegradable . Win ! <p> Every roll of parchment paper I ever buy is dedicated to brownies .

I actually have some in my cupboard but have n't even used it . After reading your post , I 'll definitely be pulling it out for the oatmeal-chocolate chip cookies I have planned for tomorrow .

Never be limited by your fears ! <p> Someone gave me some advice once j use before I had to go into a really scary presentation . They said " Remember , you know your work better than anyone else in the room " . It worked and though I was still as nervous as heck , I could swallow it and get on with it . <p> You are right , everyone is afraid . But that 's never a good enough reason to let it stop you from doing something ! <p> This couldnt be more appropriate as I freak out about the 17 ( Ah ! ) people coming to my house tomorrow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into 17 and remember that people are always excited when free dinner is involved <p> So true ! Just started year 2 of med school , and constantly being surrounded by super-smarties can defs take a toll on my self-confidence , especially in the " not smart enough " category . I think sometimes you just have to force yourself to stop , realize whatever you did to get to where you are that day ( baked cookies ! went to the gym ! got into law school ! wrote a blog post ! ) and understand that you 're pretty awesome for accomplishing those things , no matter how small they are . You did those things ! Way to go everybody ! <p> Thanks Joy and Hannah . Man , I do this too I am by far my own worst critic . <p> People are so good at dismissing what they a can do to focus on what did n't  go so well . Killer recipes on a popular blog , getting into med school and making it to your 2nd year these are amazing things ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . I 'm currently working a contract where I 'm feeling out of my depth and I got contacted by not just my boss but the VP of our division today to talk to me about my schedule .

I 'm smart and fast and knowledgeable and I would n't have been chosen for this project if I werent . I need to remember that , address the issues with my client manager factually and calmly , and remember exactly what you said : everyone is scared of something .

Do you know anybody who has the same idea i can get in touch with ? its not that i contacted every food blog in the web , just you , sorry but i have to say it , your ++ber-fan Kristina <p> Liebe Joy , thank you for answering . I want to know if you know of anybody who wants to open a bakery/cafe in LA and needs a ( serious ) partner to team up with . I thought you would probably have some friends/acquaintances in the " baking world of LA " with the intention to do the same . I am aware that contacting you for that matter is a bit crazy . <p> However since i left LA and swapped my easy life as a pilates-teacher with a strenuous job in a german confiserie and an organic bakery to prof. learn how to bake , your blog has been given me encouragement that it was the right decision . <p> Muesli is so gorgeous . I made a large large jar of it some time ago and when it finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wish I had some . I think its probably time . The frozen blueberries is a good idea . They leech out that purple juice just pretty-fies the whole thing . <p> Gah , I love muesli ! This looks particularly brilliant , but anything with coconut it pretty much fantastic . I find that if you want to make muesli that does n't  need to soak , you can use instant oats , much easier to eat straight away . Also , popping it in the microwave for a few seconds can help . Making this very , very soon : ) <p> Well I feel healthier just after reading about your muesli . I do love some hearty , chewy , textured food and muesli is just that . And I love the chia seeds . Better on your floor than mine : ) Those little things are like **26;948;TOOLONG get everywhere ! <p> Hi , as a Swede I eat m++sli alomst everyday . Its a very usual breakfast in Sweden . Your m++sli sounds good till you come to the part of soaking it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filmj+lk that I do not know the english word for but that is a kind of soured milk a bit like youghurt . Never heard of soaking , to me that actually sounds lika eating cold oatmeal . I 've never eaten m++sli in Switzerland but I have eaten it in Austria and Germany and they do not soak it either . Is that something American to soak your m++sli ? My brother do puts milk on his , but he want to eat it fast before it gets soggy . <p> I 'm American and I think the idea of soggy , cold muesli is moderately revolting . I did n't  know that was a thing . That being said , I just made a batch of this and it looks and smells fantastic . I cant wait to have it on yogurt or with milk ( quickly ) in the morning . I threw flax seeds in the mix for good measure . <p> I like raw oats in a bircher muesli . I have with grated apple , and lemon juice . Add yogurt . Let apple soak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soaking part . Good with some nuts , like almonds or hazelnuts . The big oats are best , definitely not the instant kind . <p> In my family we make ours with grated appled and yoghurt too except we add a drizzle of honey or agave syrup instead of the lemon . Its delicious : ) I love the idea of toasting the oats and coconut here , will definitely try it the next time I make muesli !

Add the whiskey/rum or vanilla extract and just whisk it all together . <p> In a medium bowl , whisk together flour , sugar , baking powder , baking soda and salt . - Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir to incorporate . - Do n't  overmix. - Its ok if there are a few lumps . <p> Let the batter rest , untouched for 5 minutes while you heat a griddle or skillet. - Add a tablespoon of canola oil or butter to the hot skillet. - Dollop heaping tablespoonfuls onto heated and oiled skillet and cook until evenly browned , flipping once . - Place cooked pancakes on an oven-proof plate in a warm oven until ready to serve . <p> I do like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this yr I can not have . I will def try these out for a weekend breakfast . Do you think I could replce the buttermilk with anything ? ? My DD can not have dairy .. I do n't  know if non-dairy there is anything as thick as buttermilk . <p> Yum ! Around here , we love eggnog and we love pancakes ! In fact I just made a batch of homemade eggnog since we cant buy it where were living . And i was thinking I wonder if there 's any way to make eggnog pancakes without just replacing the milk with my precious eggnog ! ! ! And here you are to save the day . Thanks ! <p> YUM ! ! I adore pancakes . They 're so filling and warm . And eggnog is so wonderfully wintery ! Ill probably take your advice and use the vanilla extract in place of alcohol , since I do think it should be at LEAST noon before the rum comes out ! <p> omg. joy . you 've outdone yourself yet again .

@@2115809 <h> Lemon-Drenched Lemon Cake <p> For this cake , simple loaf pans just do n't  measure up . After one slice of the perfect , absolutely perfect cake , it became clear that when I next bake this cake ( tomorrow morning ) , I 'll need to devise some sort of pillow shaped cake pan . <p> This cake is going to be my new pillow . Forget goose feathers , cotton fluff , memory foam I want , I need , I 'm not sure how I 'm going to live without a Lemon-Drenched Lemon Cake Pillow . <p> Think of this cake as a classy version of the store bought , chemical filled version of Sara Lee pound cake . The density is only matched by the soft , moist and lemony crumb . Sara Lee ? Yea , I had my suspicions too , but this cake is without a doubt , the best pound-type cake Ive ever encountered . Love . Love . Love . <p> I doubled the ingredients for the syrup and spread them between the two cakes . I liked lots of syrup . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 350 degrees F. Butter two 8 1/2-4 1/2-inch loaf pans , dust the insides with flour and tap out the excess . Even if the pans are nonstick , its a good idea to butter and flour them . Place the pans on an insulated baking sheet or on two regular sheets stacked one on top of the other . <p> Sift together the flour , baking powder and salt . <p> Put the sugar and the lemon zest in a large bowl , working with your fingers , rub them together until the sugar is moist and thoroughly imbued with the fragrance of lemon . Add the vanilla bean seeds and work them into the sugar . If you are using vanilla extract , add it later , after you have added the eggs . <p> Add the eggs and whisk them into the sugar , beating until they are thoroughly incorporated . Whisk in the extract ( if using ) , then whisk in the cream . Continuing with the whisk , or switching to a large rubber spatula , gently stir in the dry ingredients in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thick . Finish by folding in the melted butter in 2 or 3 additions . Pour the batter into the pans , smoothing with a rubber spatula . <p> Bake for 55 to 60 minutes , or until a knife inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean . As soon as the cake goes into the oven , make the syrup . After about 30 minutes in the oven , check the cakes for color- if they are browning too quickly , cover them lightly with foil tents . <p> Making the syrup : <p> Stir the water and sugar together in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar melts , then bring to a boil Remove the pan from heat and stir in the lemon juice . Pour the syrup into a heatproof bowl and let cool . <p> When the cakes test done , transfer them to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes before unmolding them and turning them right side up on the rack . Place the rack over a baking sheet lined with wax paper and , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poke holes all over the cakes . Brush the cakes all over with the syrup , working slowly so that the cakes sop it up . Leave the cakes on the rack to cool to room temperature . <p> I make a very lemon-y lemon glaze cake similar to this , but it calls for far fewer ingredients , key of which being Lemon Jello . It is quite possibly the most moist , squishy , gooey lemon cake ever . I still have friends from my Navy days who drool about it when we talk on the phone . Ahh , the good ol days ! <p> I love the tart and tangy taste of lemon desserts . I finally bought some meyers lemons and have been search for just the right dessert to showcase them perhaps this is just the one . ( Ive never tried meyer lemons so do n't  know how they differ in taste to regular ones ) ingrid <p> Michelle- This cake might just work as a Bundt . Give it a shot and let me know ! <p> Alison- I understand not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , instead use 2 plump vanilla beans to rub into the sugar instead of the zest , or 1 1/2 tablespoon pure vanilla extract . You might also want to add 2 1/2 Tablespoons of dark rum into the batter . You 'll also leave the lemon out of the syrup and instead at 1/4 cup of dark rum after you dissolve the sugar over the fire . Or you could just leave the rum out and go nutty with a pure vanilla cake . <p> OKI will probably say something blasphemousbut I do n't  do lemon baked goods . I do n't  know whythey are just icky to me and I just cant . Would everything be allright if I left out the zest and the syrup ? <p> Okay , so I 'm now drooling on my keyboard ! That looks amazing . Do you think that Meyer lemons would be too subtle in flavor for the cake ? In case you have n't stopped by , I 'm working my way through a big box of them now ! Phoo-D

We do have one last hurrah planned for next weekend involving beer brewing and EVERYTHING ( buns , ketchup , mustard ) homemade burgers . Then onto the pears . <p> It does n't  feel like the end of summer here in Florida yet . It is rainy as ever , hot &amp; humid . Ill bet we do n't  see " Fall " until November . But , I 'll keep doing sunset on the beach with a glass of wine till then !

I kid you not . Of course , there are always the popsicle counterparts of these flavors but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICE CREAM flavors . All so suprisingly and so very perfectly delectable . <p> Picnic food ! I have a tough time finding comprehensive inspiration for a good variety of picnic foods . How about basic beach picnic food , the perfect park picnic , a playdate picnic , a healthy picnic , hiking picnic . Okay , you see where I am going with this . Hope this helps . <p> When I get into a kitchen rut ( which happens more often than I care to admit ) , the easiest way out of it is to start making a whole bunch of ridiculous things from scratch ! When I say ridiculous , I just mean those things which are often or easily purchased from supermarkets . <p> and so on and so forth . Find a few basic items which you might otherwise purchase and have a stab at making them from scratch . : ) <p> As for the giant blemish , crush up an aspirin , add some water to make a sort of paste ( you can do this in a blender or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the redness will fade and it will shrink a bit , too ! : ) <p> I can definitely relate to being in a kitchen rut sometimes ! One of the questions I like to ask my friends ( they put up with my silly questions because they know how much I love food ) is what is your favorite food you ate growing up ? ( Like hearing about your dads buttermilk biscuits ) I always like to hear about childhood favorites because I think those recipes are the ones that comfort us the most and bring back those memories . I was working in the kitchen and was munching on a snack I brought with me the other day when one of the girls asked me , " are you eating GOLDFISH crackers ! ? " I said yes .. yes I am .. ! Yes I know they are snacks for 4 year olds but I grew up with them and still love them ! How bout making a play on a classic and making aged cheddar crackers ? <p> Hi Joy I just recently found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bacon waffles for dinner last night and they were amazing . How about some zucchini muffins or bread ? Whatever you come up with , I am sure it will be delicious ! Thanks so much for sharing your recipes . : ) <p> Hi Joy- To start with , I for one have difficulty imagining a time in the forseeable future when I will not " put up with your baking antics " ! Why not put some standard baking ingredients in a hat and oull out three , then invent something that involves all three ? ( and I do n't  me put in the ingredients themselves- that could get messy ! ) Or ask your readers to suggest their favorite ingredients and use your ingenuity and baking prowess to combine some into something delicious ? Just some thoughts . Your lack of inspiration needs a name- Bakers Block sounds a little too much like a cutting board Good luck finding your muse ! Ill be here to read about it when you do . : )

Lots of love = ) <p> I 'm really glad you put up that list thing below the picture scrolling part ( BTW , I hope my technical computer jargon is n't too much for you to handle ) .

When I read Joy the Baker its like Im actually getting out of it whatever a cupcake does after a tough day at work , and when I read todays post I felt a little guilty like I had been taking this wonderful thing from you and not giving back ( aka commenting/thanking you ) . So , thank you . Its absolutely delicious . xoxo . <p> In this day and age when the internet keeps people separate from one another , you 've proved the opposite to be true .

We do get so emotionally attached to our food blog when the food blog is a mirror of our life . Mine is like that , me and food all wrapped up together as one . But as husband says " Stay focused , do what makes YOU happy and not what you think will make someone else happy . It has to be you , all natural , as you feel .

Your recipes are kind of awesome for my impressing-dates skills and super enjoyable for my distraction from work for a few minutes a day . <p> I 'm coming at this from the other side . I 've spent the last 10 or so years making web pages and learning all about HTML , CSS and programming and blogs .

@@2115822 <h> Oh ! My ! God ! Doughnuts ! <p> Some things I make for the love of others . Ive been known to gaze lovingly at ingredients . Wrap cookies in little bows , and present a friend with box of still warm chocolate chip cookies at just the right moment . <p> Other things I make because I 'm a selfish hungry girl . These doughnuts . Oh my God ! These doughnuts I made because I 'm a selfish girl who loves loves loves doughnuts . <p> Three facts about this , my first doughnut making experience : <p> These puppies took me about 3 hours and 15 minutes from start to finish . I started craving them after my morning run , and sunk my teeth into my first warm doughnut bite around 2pm . Worth every minute ! Seriously . <p> I burned my mouth , yes , four times eating donut balls that were just too fresh from the fryer . Worth it . I 'd do it all over again . <p> If I did n't  get the what was left after the " Joy vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might well have eaten every singe one . Not a joke . Fact . <p> If you 've never made doughnuts before , here is my advice to you : Oh my God ! Take the afternoon off . Turn off your phone . Make these donuts . Eat five to eight , and then promptly walk over to your neighbors house and beg them to take the rest off your hands . If your neighbors are n't  home you might even want to call the cops , theyll be able to stop you from eating the remainder . You 'll need handcuffs . <p> Scrape dough down side of bowl ( all around ) into center , then sprinkle lightly with flour ( to keep a crust from forming ) . Cover bowl with a clean kitchen towel ( not terry cloth ) and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled in bulk , 1 1/2 to 2 hours . ( Alternatively , let dough rise in bowl in refrigerator 8 to 12 hours . ) <p> Turn dough out onto a lightly floured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a 12-inch round ( 1/2 inch thick ) . Cut out as many rounds as possible with 3-inch cutter , then cut a hole in center of each round with 1-inch cutter and transfer doughnuts to a lightly floured large baking sheet . Cover doughnuts with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until slightly puffed , about 30 minutes ( 45 minutes if dough was cold when cutting out doughnuts ) . Do not reroll scraps . <p> Heat 2 1/2 inches oil in a deep 4-quart heavy pot until it registers 350-F on thermometer . Fry doughnuts , 2 at a time , turning occasionally with a wire or mesh skimmer or a slotted spoon , until puffed and golden brown , about 2 minutes per batch . Transfer to paper towels to drain . ( Return oil to 350-F between batches . ) <p> I also fried the doughnut holes for about 1 minute and them tossed them in powdered sugar and cinnamon sugar straight out of the hot grease . <p> Combine butter , milk , corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium heat until butter is melted . Decrease the heat to low , add the chocolate , and whisk until melted . Turn off heat , add the powdered sugar , and whisk until smooth . Place the mixture over a bowl of warm water and dip the doughnuts immediately . Allow glaze to set for 30 minutes before serving . <p> Your donuts look beautiful . And I should know . My job is frying donuts at the local grocery . I 'm not joking . The irony is that Ive never really liked to EAT donuts . I just like to look at them . ( and yours are really pretty ! ) <p> KRYPTONITE ! KRYPTONITE ! ! If I made these , I 'd just lock the doors and stay inside , and then I 'd be on the news , one of those poor people being hauled out of their home by a crane , buried in a piano case .

Your Mocha Rum Cake is currently at the top of my " must bake " list once I begin again and now , my dear , those doughnuts are #2 ! I 'm hoping you can give me some helpful hints on willpower + moderation since I absolutely dread running <p> Its a good thing my son was n't near when I clicked on this post he is a donut FIEND ! ! ! I 've bookmarked this post so I can give these a try in the not-too-distant future . I made my first batch of cinnamon rolls this week and those were pretty dangerous to keep around .

@@2115823 <h> Ice Cream Cupcakes <p> I absolutely LOVE Memorial Day weekend . Its like all the good things in the world come together in one weekend . I look forward to this three day weekend at the start of May . Not only is it my birthday weekend , but its also the unofficial start of summer , the start of outdoor grilling and parties with friends , and just all around good times . <p> If I had a lake anywhere near me , I 'd be down at the lake all the time , just so I could say , " I 'm going down to the lake ! " That feels like an ultra summer thing to say . Lake or no lake , I feel a beautiful summer coming on . <p> And as if I could n't get more excited , I 've discovered I can make ice cream cupcakes ! These little gems are really easy to throw together and you can make them with any flavor combination you can imagine . The only slight downside is that they melt ( as ice cream tends to do ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much of an issue because these do n't  tend to stick around long . I 've already eaten 5 , and the party is n't until Sunday . <p> Start with cupcakes . I made mine mini cupcakes in a tiny muffin pan , making 2 bite ice cream cupcakes . You can use a regular sized cupcake pan if you like ! You 'll just have bigger treats . <p> Make any sort of cupcake batter you like . I used cake mix ( gasp ! ) because I just did . Spray the muffin tins with nonstick spray . Fill the muffin tins only half as full as you normally would . For the mini muffin tins , this means using a little less than a teaspoon of batter . For the regular muffin tins , this means using about 1 Tablespoon of batter . Bake cupcakes at 350 degrees F and check them after 8 minutes . <p> Remove the cupcakes from the oven , let cool in their tins for 15 minutes . Loosen the cupcakes by running a knife along the edges of the muffin cups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan , but keep the cupcakes in the cupcake pan , cover with plastic wrap and put in the freezer for 3 hours , or overnight is best . <p> Remove the cupcakes from the freezer when you 're ready to use them . If some of the cupcakes have domed up while cooking , remove them from their cup and use a small serrated knife to even out the top of the cupcake . Ideally , youd like to have 1/2-inch little cupcake bottoms . <p> Remove the ice cream from the freezer to let soften before filling cupcake tins . Leave on the counter for 10minutes or defrost in the microwave . When ice cream is softened , use a quick hand to spoon and flatten ice cream on top of the cake . Its a little messy , but do n't  worry about that . When all of the cakes are topped with ice cream , return to the freezer to harden . I left my ice cream cupcakes in the freezer over night , but give them at least 4 hours . <p> Be creative and top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate ganache or caramel would be lovely . <p> To remove the ice cream cupcakes from their tins , warm a small sharp knife under hot running water . Run the warm knife along the edges of the ice cream cupcake until its easily lifted out of its tin . This is n't too hard a process , mine practically jumped out . Place the cupcakes on a plate and return to the freezer for 15 minutes . <p> Remove from freezer and apply whatever topping and decoration suits your fancy . I chose chocolate ganache and colored jimmies . Apply the topping and decoration quickly and return to freezer on the dish you 'd like to serve them on . When ready to serve , remove from freezer and eat promptly ! <p> Update : If you 'd like to make ice cream cupcakes in cupcake liners , I wrote another tutorial. - Here it is ! <p> These cupcakes look awesome . I 'm definitely making some of these to start the summer right . Thank you for being such a generous birthday girl and sharing this recipe ; most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thankful that this is n't the case here . Happy Birthday ! <p> ADORABLE ! Seriously , this is going to be like the best party favor ever this summer . I especially enjoy the chocolate ganache topping with the sprinkles . Eating something like this makes you feel like a kid all over again . Have a great birthday and a fantastic holiday weekend : ) <p> Yum ! ! Then again , put chocolate and mint together for me in anything and you have a winner . I bet these would work really well with a brownie base as well . I really like the idea of the mini-muffin size for just the right treat on a hot day . These are on my list to make ! Hope you have an amazing birthday ! <p> Its my birthday weekend too ! = ) Happy birthday ! Oh , and those almond raspberry cupcakes were killer &amp; so easy to make . I made 2 dozen just for the heck of it and sent my hubby off with them to work . Thanks !

Although I certainly did n't  drink the whole bottle ( I checked , its in the fridge ) , champagne is one of those buggers that sneaks up on you in the middle of the night , scrambles your brain around and then makes you demand sweets and coffee just a little harder than usual the next morning . <p> Today I have a funeral to go to and then a birthday party .

These are the kinds of days when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes from somber to celebratory . These are the kinds of days that demand a touch of sweetness first thing in the morning . Thank goodness for Pan Dulce . <p> Pan Dulce is a Mexican sweet bread . The bread itself is a slightly sweet , rich egg bread . The rolls are topped with a patterned sweet dough made out of butter , shortening , sugar and flour . The process takes as much care and patience as any yeasted bread , but the outcome is well worth the effort . <p> This bread recipe probably took me the better part of the afternoon . With the rolls that I did n't  immediately stuff in my face , I wrapped tightly and stuck n the freezer . Now any time I find myself with a rough morning or tricky day before me , I can thaw out a sweet bread , brew some coffee , and instantly make my morning more bearable . <p> OMG !

I live in East Harlem , in New York , sometimes also known as Spanish Harlem , and there 's this little store right next door that sells these .

I 've actually never tried pan dulce with the topping like this but they look like theyd be a lot of fun to make and eat . Also , the topping allows for lots of creativity ! Maybe some orange and black around Halloween time ? <p> I 'm not ashamed to say that champagne is one of my true loves : ) I regard it high up on my go-to list along with chocolate , Johnny Depp , and tomatoes . I know , weird combo but those are my loves . That bread reminds me of jewish challah bread because of the high egg content . I like the eggy breads since they produce such a thick and rich dough minus the loads of butter in brioche . I hope you get through your day ok .

I found the historical piece of it interesting , but I 'm even more interested to hear your thoughts on their recipe advice of chilling the dough for 36 hours . <p> To be honest , when I first started reading my mind rejected the idea of using melted butter in a chocolate chip cookie . But now I 'm thinking I have to try these cookies . They look fabulous and I 'm insanely curious about a light cookie made with melted butter and bread flour . <p> The chocolate chip recipe Ive been using for a few years is similar to this , except the bread flour and they cook at a much lower temperature . I do find chilling the dough makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Your cookies look delicious , and I cant wait to see the next installment of the debate- maybe I can give creamed butter cookies a try ! <p> Joy this is my daughter and sons favorite recipe . They were forever searching for the perfect " soft " cookie . I , on the other hand , enjoy a crispier cookie . I make the soft cookies so that I wo n't eat as many . My daughter made these cookies a few weeks ago and they were as crispy as a toll house cookie , despite having followed the recipe . I think the only explanation is that she overcooked them . Its imperative that you take them out of the oven just when they 're starting to get golden colored otherwise they 're overdone . <p> I use creamed softened butter for my favorite recipe . It did n't  originally call for that , but one time I tried it with non melted butter and sweet mother the cookies became an absolute staple in our house . Now they are the only recipe I will use . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better and finding some confort in all those comments and in your pajama ! Baking is a good therapy I think Anyway , I love Alton and I love CCC ( who does n't  ? ) but I 've never made his cookies . I 've made CCC with bread flour before and the result was very very good ! They get puffy and crunchy outside and chewy inside . I 've tried the same recipe with AP flour and they also get good but a bit more cakey . I found the recipe for them on cookiemadness.com and then made experiments myself with it . I 've even used instant yeast and those were my favorites ! But what I think is that CCC are like steak , one like them rare , other medium rare , or well-done With the cookies everybody had their favourites , so there 's no way of finding " the best " , just the best for you . Keep the experiments I love reading them . <p> I have never tried melted butter chocolate chip cookies . But youve really touched my heart with this one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday , I always get a free dessert at a local coffee shop and I always choose the choc chip cookie . And they always try to talk me into something more extravagant , like turtle cheesecake or tiramisunope , just the cookie please ! I think this is also my next project . Ev <p> AhhhChocolate chip cookies . A topic near and dear to my heartthis is my type of debate ! <p> Ive been eyeing a couple of chocolate chip recipes to try out soon . Firstly , there 's the whole Levain Bakery phenomena that I just became aware of . No , I have n't tried them yet , but they sound dreamyforget dinner and just give me the scone sized cookie , crispy and caramelized on the outside , soft and melted with a heart of goo on the inside . So I found this " Copycat Levain Bakery Throw Down Cookie " recipe and I 'm so keen to see how it lives up to the hype . Have you tried the Levain cookie ? <p> Then there 's Elinor Klivans " chocolate chip-stuffed cookies " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradling a chocolatey heart of goo . I must make these soon ! <p> For chocolate chip cookies , I always go to a Martha Stewart recipe I found years ago in her magazine ( for a brief , maddening moment , I was a subscriber ) that calls for creaming the sugar and butter . And let me tell you , this makes the best chocolate chip cookie Ive ever hadand I made a batch of them to try to cheer me up recently . Baking is always so therapeutic . 
@@2115826 <h> Strawberry and Vanilla Ice Cream Cake <p> Were going back to the beginning with this cake . Ice Cream Cakes- that 's what started it all . Can I tell you a story ? <p> I moved from Los Angeles , California to Burlington , Vermont when I was 18 and straight out of high school . I had it in my head that I did n't  want to go to college right away , and that I wanted to do some soul searching , as far away from my parents as I could get . I landed in Burlington with one suitcase and the phone number to one friend that I knew there . My friend Niki graciously let me stay in her apartment , and her Lisa friend gave me a job at the Ben and Jerrys Ice Cream flagship store . Miraculously , I had it all worked out . I had a place to stay and a job . There was just one small hitch- I was TERRIFIED . I had never been so far away from home and out in the world on my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . I never even cracked the door open . I knew that I was in a strange place , surrounded by people I did n't  know and I , frankly , did n't  want anything to do with any of it . I stayed in that apartment listening to Nikis entire music collection and taking lots of baths . That 's when I discovered I loved Billie Holiday and grapefruit bubble bath . <p> What finally drove me out of my cave ? Food of course , I ran out of food and I 'm no good with hunger pains . <p> Once I was out of the apartment and well fed , I realized that my new surroundings were actually pretty awesome . People acknowledged me as I walked down the street . I lived right around the corner from the most beautiful lake , a glass blowing studio , a picture perfect chapel and a culinary school that fed me samples of their student food every day . It was the most beautiful , friendly , warm and open place Ive ever been . <p> My job scooping ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake decorator position . I could frost and decorate an ice cream cake like maniac . And because were talking about wild and wacky Ben and Jerrys , the flavor combinations and signature tie dye frostings were completely over the top . <p> I loved my job . I loved Vermont . I met some characters that I wo n't soon forget . <p> Once I stepped out of that apartment door , after a week of solitude and regret , I felt that I was blazing forward on the life I knew I wanted for myself . I also learned how to make a killer Ice Cream Cake along the way . Thats was almost ten years ago . wow . <p> Preheat oven to 350 degrees . Butter , flour , and line pans with parchment paper ( optional ) and set aside . <p> In a large bowl , sift together the flours , baking powder , and salt . Set aside . <p> In the bowl of an electric mixer , cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy . Add the vanilla to the eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time , until fully incorporated . Alternate adding the flour mixture and the milk , beginning and ending with the flour . Try to do this as quickly as possible so you do n't  dry out the cake by over mixing . It is okay to add the milk immediately after adding the flour , and vice versa . <p> Divide the batter between your cake pans and bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean . For cupcakes , bake 20-25 minutes . <p> Whipped Cream Frosting <p> 2 cups heavy whipping cream <p> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <p> 1/4 cup powdered sugar <p> In a large bowl of an electric mixer add whipping cream and vanilla extract . Using the whip attachment , begin to beat the mixture on medium speed . Gradually add the powdered sugar , increase the speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form . Refrigerate until ready to use . <p> Assembling the Cake <p> Step One : Grease the two 8-inch round cake pans . Make the vanilla cake batter and add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan . Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean , about 30 minutes . Remove cakes from oven and let cool for 30 minutes . Once cooled , loosen the edges of the baked cake with a butter knife , flip the cake pans over onto a wire rack . Return 1 cake round to one of the 8-inch cakes pans and place the other cake round on a plate . Place both cake pan and plate in the freezer to begin to freeze the cake rounds . <p> Step Two : Freeze the cake rounds for 1 to 2 hours . You 'll need the cakes to be firm enough to spread fairly hard ice cream over them . Take the ice cream out of the freezer about 15 minutes before you 'd like to use it , letting it rest on the counter . <p> Step Three : Remove the cake that 's in the cake pan from the freezer . Using the back of a stiff spatula , spoon the strawberry ice cream into the 8-inch cake round , on top of the first layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half gallon of ice cream . Leave about 1-inch of space from the top of the 3-inch deep cake pan . At this point you 've got a vanilla cake bottom layer topped with strawberry ice cream , leaving about 1 inch of empty space at the top of the pan . <p> Step Four : Remove the plated vanilla cake layer from the freezer . Place the second layer of vanilla cake inside the 8-inch round , on top of the strawberry ice cream . Return pan to the freezer to set for about an hour , depending on how soft your ice cream became while you were shaping the cake . <p> Step Five : Make Whipped Cream Frosting and store in the refrigerator until ready to use . <p> Step Six : After 1 to 2 hours in the freezer , remove the cake pan . Run a butter knife under hot water and run the knife along the cake , in between the cake pan and the ice cream cake to loosen the sides . Flip pan over onto a serving plate or cardboard cake round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft . <p> Step Seven : Quickly frost Ice Cream Cake with Whipped Cream Frosting . Return to the freezer to chill . Decorate the cake as you like . I used fondant to make a layered heart topper . <p> Ah my first job was at a Ben &amp; Jerrys Scoop Shop when I was just fifteen . While I was often on waffle cone duty cause I was the fastest wrist around I relished when I got to sit back and decorate our customers cakes . My favorite was helping a co-worker construct a six layer ice cream wedding cake . Oh memories ! <p> Great story well told , too . Makes me sigh and wish I 'd had the nerve to make a similar move early in my life . Clearly , that has made all the difference to you . The cake is fabulous . I 've always wondered how to put one of these together without making a huge mess . Thanks ! <p> As a girl who is struggling to figure out where she is going after college and trying to fight her way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks for reminding me that sometimes the scary things turn out to the best things ever .

Also having a job in Ben n Jerrys must have been so cool , would love to try that out one time ! <p> Wow ! Our stories are so similar ! I left home at 18 as well , without any intention of going to college . I moved to Gatlinburg in the Great Smokey Mountains where I had a friend that worked at the aquarium there .

The Lake is magical , the city vibrant , the night life is crazy and the food is to die for . The people are warm and friendly and there 's always a hello even from people you do n't  know .

I might just have to abscond with one or two of those jars to take this sugar to work . It might make my coworkers jealous , but I 'm willing to take that risk . <p> Joy , Im interested to hear the answer to Penelopes question : Does the moisture affect the shelf life of the sugar ? Also , you mentioned making citrus sugar what ratios of zest to sugar do you use there ? Does the fact that the zest comes from fresh fruit affect the shelf life of the sugar ? I only ask because I think your idea of giving the flavored sugars and coffee as a gift is fantastic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for it . : ) <p> the moisture from the vanilla bean should not at all affect the shelf life of the sugar . the vanilla bean may harden a bit but that 's just fine . <p> for citrus sugars , i would say 2 teaspoons per 2 cups . just rub the zest in until its beautifully fragrant . the zest wont make the sugar go bad buuuut , you can sift the zest out with a mesh strainer if you 're worried . <p> does the little bit of moisture in the vanilla bean / blossom oils affect the shelf life of the sugar at all ? im guessing its not supposed to last long enough to find out . but i tend to save lots of nice ingredients til they go bad : ( <p> hey penelope ! no , the moisture in the vanilla bean will not affect the shelf life of the sugar . if anything , the bean will start to dry out a little which is totally fine . not to worry . you can try to save this stuff but itll be gone in a jiff !

Let defrost overnight in the fridge , roll , rise , bake in the morning . Drizzle with a light almond icing . Now I want one . : ( <p> Kinda like Evan up there , I 'll often use whop biscuit dough for my homemade cinnamon rolls ( I 've also used Bisquick dough and crescent roll dough ) . I mush them all together , though , instead of doing individuals . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except we always used a round cake pan and not a muffin tin for baking . <p> A lot of times , I use a pastry brush to apply melted butter to the inside not too much , just enough to give the cinnamon-sugar something to stick to , and brush the tops after they 've been put in the pan . The round pan thing might work , too , since if the butter melts in a round pan versus the muffin tin , it might bake differently ? <p> My favorite is an overnight roll you make the yeast dough , let it rise once , cover the bottom of the pan in a caramely goop , then roll , butter &amp; cinnamon and slice the dough and put in the pans , then cover and put in fridge overnight . Then in the morning take it out for 30 min and bake for 30 min . It takes night-time work but its great in the morning ! I use recipes from http : //www.allrecipes.com although I 'm sure there are others out there . Good luck ! You pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a professional baker , but cinnamon roles are one of my specialties ! Based on what you have shared , I have a couple of suggestions ( if I may be so bold ) : lower the oven temp and cook on a rack in the middle of the oven ; decrease the amount of butter in the filling or cook for a shorter amount of time . <p> My cinnamon roll method is good , but takes a lot of work for something not completely made from scratch . I use refrigerated biscuit dough , which means that I have to roll out each one separately , fill it , and roll it back up . I think its worth it . They 're pretty good , but I never put enough butter . Is it possible that you put too much butter and that 's why it all oozed out ? ( I know , too much butter ? Never ! ) I do n't  knowI feel for ya on this one . Ev <p> I must confess I often cheat by using pizza dough to make cinnamon rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just roll it out thin , butter it up , sprinkle liberally with brown sugar and cinnamon , roll and slice . I put them on a buttered sheet pan a few inches apart , then I let them rise for about 30 minutes . I bake them in a 350ish oven until they are golden which usually seems to take around 20 minutes . *shrug* And then the cooks have a delicious snack and make all the front of house people envious . When I 'm at home and I have more time , I really like the recipe for yeasted coffee cake/ sticky buns in the Joy Of Cooking . When I do n't  feel like waiting for multiple rises I usually make biscuit dough and roll that up with the goodness , and bake it in muffin tins- completely different texture , but equally yummy

@@2115832 <h> Six Rules to Bake By <p> Preheat . Why ? Because it says so ! If a recipe asks you to preheat the oven to a certain temperature . Well you should . What the recipe is trying to tell you is that your cupcakes , or loaf of zucchini bread , or blackberry muffins need to combine with a certain temperature to do their thing . And we all know , we want out baked goods to do their thing . Even if they do n't  , well probably still nibble on them on their way from the oven to the trash bin . But everything seems to work out like sunshine and roses if our baked goods do their thing . Right ? <p> You Do n't  Need Gadgets . You might want them but you do n't  need them . Is it just me or has baking become kind of trendy lately ? I 've noticed all sorts of intricate , multi layered whisks , and scrapers , and bumper stickers for your Kitchen Aid mixer . It turns out that you do n't  really need any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need some stainless steel bowls and a fantastic candy thermometer but really , stick with the basics . <p> Yeast- You Can do It ! I know , yeast is a little intimidating . But really- you can do it ! There are a few things yeast needs to get going- warm water and sugar . Simple as that . You have live yeast . These cinnamon rolls were some of the first yeasted breads I mastered . They were more approachable to me because the dough has creamed butter , sugar and eggs . It starts off like and cake and finishes as a bread . If you 're scared of yeast , please give this recipe a go ! <p> Oil up This tip is n't really a baking tip . If you 're dicing up peppers , before you handle the peppers rub your hands with vegetable oil . This will help make sure that the hot pepper juice does n't  soak into your hands for you to find later when you brings your hands up to your mouth and nose . Ouch ! <p> Butter is butter . Margarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just really need you to understand that margarine is not butter . Butter is fat , milk solids , water and sometimes salt . Margarine is hydrogenated yellow . And you know what ! ? They ( margarine makers ) have to dye it yellow ! Margarine is really a dull grey color that they bleach white and then dye yellow to make it look more like butter . Not kidding . Not cool . Google it . Use butter . It tastes good and we know where it comes from . If you 're a vegan- please do n't  yell at me , because I like tofu and I 'm not listening . <p> Cool To Room Temperature . Translation- Wait . I tend to be a bit of a rule breaker , which has produced some pretty disastrous baking results .

The closest thing Ive made is something we call " Snails " which is flat pastry dough ( actually the 99cent pizza dough from TJs works great ) that we sprinkle with lots of sugar and cinnamon , roll up and cut into spirals and bake . One more thing I got ta say : the links to the suggested tools is fantastic ! ! It instantly provides me with the pricing and if I get out my ccard I can buy online also instantly !

I just ca n't in good conscience let this continue . <p> Let 's talk about nutmeg . I have The Internets- so I know everything I need to know . <p> Nutmeg comes from a type of evergreen tree in southeast Asia and Australasia . Now , before I continue , am I the only one that did n't  know what Australasia was ? Australasia includes Australia , New Zealand and Papua New Ginuea . True . Fun fact ! <p> So two important culinary items come from this magical evergreen type tree : - nutmeg and mace. - Nutmeg is actually the seed of the tree. - Its slightly smaller than an egg , solid and hard , but when grated , has an interesting lace like design. - Mace is the dried , reddish covering of the arillus seed . Huh ? - Yea . Pay attention , were still learning. - Mace has a slightly more delicate flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like orange glow . <p> The beauty of nutmeg is that its so versatile. - Its an integral part of a spice cake like carrot cake , or my beloved Sugar and Spice Cinnamon Rolls , but also shines when sprinkled over sauteed spinach or mixed into cheese sauces. - The key to nutmeg is to always ( always ! always ! ) go for the fresh stuff. - Its easy. - I promise. - Its not a pain in the ass. - All you 'll need is a jar of the nutmeg seeds ( they often come in a jar with between 6 and 8 ) and a microplane. - Microplanes are just about the handiest zester/grater ever ! <p> When a recipe calls for freshly grated nutmeg , you 're good to go. - If a recipe simply calls for 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg , you might want to use a dash less. - Go for 3/4 teaspoon of the fresh stuff instead . - Fresh nutmeg is stronger , more aromatic and more forward that the pre-ground , dusty nutmeg . <p> Pre-ground nutmeg is a poor excuse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its the only way to go . <h> Share <h> 35 comments <p> Thanks so much for the great info . I do have a couple of questions : Where is a good place to purchase fresh nutmeg . I am not sure where to look . And second , what is the self life of the seeds ? When is fresh not considered " fresh " anymore ? Again , thanks for the nutmeg lesson . <p> Last year around this time I bought this " Nutmeg Mill , " which has chunks of nutmeg ( but not the whole seed ) and a little grinder at the top . Something tells me this is not the fresh nutmeg you are going for : ) <p> Ive been using fresh nutmeg for a while now , only because I did n't  read the jar closely enough and accidentally got them whole when I wanted to get them ground . Its good to know my lack of attention in the grocery store is paying off ! <p> Hear hear ! ! ! I could n't agree more ! I love my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , so they 're always handy . Did you know if you use a lot of ( and I mean a lot ! ) you 'll start hallicinating ? ! <p> I 've read up on the hallucination it can cause a while back . it takes something like 16 hours to kick in and the hangover from it has been said to be " like god has taken a dump on your soul " .. not exactly something fun to try lol <p> The best thing about fresh nutmeg is that you get a sufficient amount in a very short amount of time . It REALLY does n't  take much more time than measuring out the pre-ground stuff but it makes an incredible difference . In a hurry ? Just store the microplane ( or a nutmeg grater like I have ) right next to the nutmeg . <p> I converted to fresh this year ! I actually bought enough for me , my mom and my stepmother as welland the microplanes to match ! I have to say , it has made a really serious difference in some of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that I mostly use pre-ground spices because its hard for me to find time ( with an 8 month old ) to bake at all , let alone grind my own spices . But I know you 're right- I can always tell the difference when I do use fresh- so I need to bite the bullet and do it ! ! 
@@2115837 <p> Do n't  have a bench knife ? - Well you should ! - A bench knife is a 3-inch by 6- inch smooth piece of metal topped with a molded plastic or wood gripping handle . Do n't  be fooled by the name , the edge of this piece of metal is n't sharp like a - cutting knife , but it can still work its way around the kitchen . - Its great for dividing dough , slicing refrigerator cookies and leveling off measured ingredients like flour and baking soda . - Some bench knives have measurements in inches along the cutting edge . - How handy is that ! ? - Its also great for cleaning off counters and tables that might have bits of dough or flour on them . - Its a simple and efficient tool that can be used as many ways as you can think up ! - Its a real gem ! <p> Kitchen Aid mixer is where its at ! I adore mine ! Sure beats standing there like a chump with a hand mixer and does a much better job too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen aid makes themin black to match my mixer <p> Hi Joylove your bench knife . I wish I had just a clutch of things like you &amp; was a minimalist too . My 2 fave kitchen gadgets at the moment are a microplaner , which grates ginger garlic in a hurry too , &amp; my santuko knife . Now a bench knife seems like the next thing on my list ! What a great post ! ! The pictures are beautiful toowhat camera do you use
