" Ian Tattersall , Curator Emeritus , American Museum of Natural History , and author of The Strange Case of the Rickety Cossack <p> For centuries scientists have written off cannibalism as a bizarre phenomenon with little biological significance . Its presence in nature was dismissed as a desperate response to starvation or other life-threatening circumstances , and few spent time studying it . A taboo subject in our culture , the behavior was portrayed mostly through horror movies or tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life flesh-eaters . But the true nature of cannibalism--the role it plays in evolution as well as human history--is even more intriguing ( and more normal ) than the misconceptions weve come to accept as fact . <p> In Cannibalism : A Perfectly Natural History , zoologist Bill Schutt sets the record straight , debunking common myths and investigating our new understanding of cannibalisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fascinating account yet written on this complex topic . Schutt takes readers from Arizonas Chiricahua Mountains , where he wades through ponds full of tadpoles devouring their siblings , to the Sierra Nevadas , where he joins researchers who are shedding new light on what happened to the Donner Party--the most infamous episode of cannibalism in American history . He even meets with an expert on the preparation and consumption of human placenta ( and , yes , it goes well with Chianti ) . <p> Bringing together the latest cutting-edge science , Schutt answers questions such as why some amphibians consume their mothers skin ; why certain insects bite the heads off their partners after sex ; why , up until the end of the twentieth century , Europeans regularly ate human body parts as medical curatives ; and how cannibalism might be linked to the extinction of the Neanderthals .
