I would even have them start it with a tiny cornrow around the front so that more hair would be in the braid to prevent alot of pulling when it would go into a ponytail . If the hair was too short in the back I did not braid it up , the braid would have came loose anyway and drop out so I did not feel like wasting my time .

Do n't use a strong relaxer , do n't leave it in too long , if it 's bone straight when your done , you may have done serious damage , so get the relaxer in asap .

@@22470490 @2470490/ <p> I have been using affirm relaxer in regular strength for years now and it seems as of late that my hair has been taking a very long time to process especially in the crown area . I did my relaxer today and it took about an hour . I know that some of my hair is probably overprocessed because of this . The last time I went to the hair dresser she used a hair dryer to speed up the relaxer processing . By the way , I relaxed at about 11 weeks in both cases . <p> So should I switch relaxers ? What should I do about my overprocessed strands ? <p> I think so . My friend ( who is my hair-growth buddy and does very healthy things for her hair ) recently went natural because her hair was starting not to take relaxers very well . Her hair still looked nice , but no matter how long she left a relaxer on for it would still end up looking texlaxed , so she decided she would rather be natural . As for your overprocessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should and yes my hair will feel dry and off balance for a period of time , but I usually just do protein/moisture DC 's twice a week until my hair feels balanced again . <p> Good question ! This case was the same for me- I was using Beautiful beginnings for years and then one day it just did n't work like before so I switched . I know that with time as hair ages it changes colour ( turns grey ) , thins and gets drier in some cases but in terms of genes your hair should be the same as it is always . Are you taking supplements now ? this could be the reason that your hair is taking longer to process in that it 's stronger . OR maybe you got a bad batch of relaxer . Is this the first time this has happened with Affirm ? In any case when relaxing less is always more IMO- UNDERprocessing for me is better than OVERprocessing . Regarding your strands- I would use a good reconstructor or protein treatment . <p> I may be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can . Since our hair is dead--how can it build up a tolerance ? I belive it 's possible for our scalp to build a tolerance for some things , but then again--we are n't trying to relax our scalps . Maybe they changed the formulations on the relaxer and your hair did n't like it , maybe the relaxer was out of date , maybe the relaxer had been left open too long , or not mixed correctly by you or the company that made it ( so many possibilities ) ? I 've had a relaxer " not take " before and my hair is medium/fine ; so this is unheard of for me ; I tried the same relaxer again 5 months later , and it took just fine . Sometimes things may " spoil " even if the date does n't say it is expired--like some milk I bought from Walmart awhile back . I will say that our body and hair can change .

Now i have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3-4 inches of bone straight mid shaft , and the rest is frizzy/curly ! The only thing that has helped me from experiencing demarcation breakage is my deep conditioning rituals .... I 'm done with correcting tho i 'll jus claim texlaxed ..... <p> Yes this can happen ... you new growth can certainly become resistant to relaxers because your body chemistry can change and/or the chemistry of the product you 're using . Body chemistry plays a bit role in how YOUR body will handle any product . 
@@22470491 @2470491/ <p> i was apl in december , started locking in february and when i took down my locs a few weeks ago my hair was past my brastrap. because i was locked i have no idea when it happened so i 'll say about 6 months . <p> Wow those do seem like fast results ladies ! For me , I ca n't even claim full BSL yet , and I started claiming APL in Jan So I 'll come back in a month or two and hopefully have a real answer . Right now , I 'd say it 's taking me 9 or 10 months ! <p> I 've been lurking this thread and I 'm glad to see people say 10 months ! Those 4-5 months are super quick and I wish ! I claimed APL ( just grazing ) back in April and since then its just been a slow fill in . I 'm not even close to BSL yet , I am hoping to be grazing by December but who knows , it may take me a year ! <p> Not to highjack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I just wanted to request that when you ladies respond , that you also please mention your height and/or vaguely mention your body proportions ( long torso , short torso , high waist , etc ) . And if you 're a fast grower , slow grower , etc , please toss that in as well ? I just think it 's important in these threads , because it does help put things in perspective .

I grow a bit less than .5 a month ... maybe .45 lol I have long legs and a short torso ( relative to my legs ) . And I wear my bra right bsb so they are essentially the same measurement . <p> Most important factor in my length retention is low manipulation and making sure my hair is never thirsty . Neither growth aides nor supplements have ever helped me . I am anemic , I take a multi-vitamin , b-complex and an iron supplement . I 've tried biotin , msm , sulfur , and various oils that are supposed to encourage growth and I workout . And I only trim when I use heat so last year , my trims were in June , August ( made apl ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made bsl in January . <p> ETA : I WILL say that I think my hair is growing slower this year but I 'm not sure exactly why . This year , I 've determined my growth rate to be .5 a month . I do n't know what it was last year but I know it was more than .5 a month and closer to an .75 a month . I 'm still working on figuring out how to get back to that rate . <p> I 'm gon na say 4 months . I 'm 5 ' 8 " , average torso . I used a homemade sulfur mix and kept my ends on lockdown . Felt like a quick trip from apl to bsl . But I was mostly relaxed then . Seems like this texlaxing makes me feel like growth is slowing but it 's not . Does seem that way tho . Not complaining . I 'm loving the thickness . <p> Oh wow so I thought it would take a much longer to reach BSL from APL .... I was grazing or right at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length i 'm at by DEC ..... thank you ladies for answering ! ! 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Me , too . I am grazing APL and I keep lightly pulling the few hair strands down that can touch my breasts , wondering if this is real . I got ta stop obsessing and just let the process happen . But it 's hard not to check everyday - LOL ! <p> But you are right - this is encouraging . Wondering minds want to know . Thanks to everyone who answered . <p> I have promised myself to do a length check only once every 4 weeks . I think I can stick to it since I wear my hair in twists , so I really do n't know the length until I take my hair out and stretch it . 
@@22470492 @2470492/ <p> When I joined this website , I looked around at all the Feature of the Month articles and these ladies obviously had already perfected their healthy hair regimes and DO have healthy hair since it 's all long and stuff . Of course though , it did n't  ' start out this way for nearly ALL of us . <p> So , my question is , all of you who have achieved healthy hair ( long or not , Feature of the Month or not ) HOW DID YOU DO IT ? and HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU ? The reason I 'm asking is this . My hair is not as damaged as certain ppl on here when they started out *please do n't take offense* but it 's pretty DRY . It 's not in tip-top shape but it 's not SUFFERING , except from the dryness , which causes more breakage than I would like to see . So far , I 've only been on LHCF for 31 days and my hair is doing better . Out of the 31 days , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 30 hairs at the most ) .

I 'm just wondering how long it will take to get really healthy hair and how will I finally know that I have it . So please , do post your thoughts on this ... I 'm sure all other newcomers would like to know too <p> when i started , my hair was damaged from the use of a product with silicones and also from using of too much heat and not taking care of it in general . The main culprit was silicones though . And the first thing i learned was to clarify . I think it took my hair about 4 months to become healthy once again . I had to trim off my damaged ends gradually . I think ive been on here for six months now . <p> 1 . using heat everyday 2. not wrapping my hair up with a scarf ' 3. washing whenever 4. using products that were drying up my hair 5. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not maipulate my hair from July to September , because i did not work and school was out , so i usually just had my hair in a doobie , and it thrived .... <p> I would say it took my hair about 3 months to show signs of improvement , and 4 months for other people to compliment on how good my hair was looking <p> I had lapsed from taking care of my hair for the past year . That 's why I came back to the board . Recently , my hair was extremely dry , crunching every time I combed , and losing a ton of hair when it was wet . And I tell you , what I have been doing for the past three weeks has made a huge difference . People have noticed the difference it has made in such a short time . <p> It took me about 4 months to get better hair ...

I started daily CO washing , using protein once a week , using hot oil treatments everyday ( no longer works on my hair ) , and doing overnight oil treatments once a week before my weekly shampoo . It did n't take a month for the dryness to be completely gone , but the new growth became much more manageable , and my hair was shiny and soft . <p> I look at my hair as a work in progress . Since February of 2004 , I have come a long way , but I have a long way to go as well . My main problem is dryness .

After 9 months my hair is shinier , fuller , and more moist . For me , it was learning the techniques ( rollersetting , flat ironing , wrapping and washing ) that has helped me on the road to healthy hair . <p> A good thing is not to get caught up in all the raves about products . Hair care can be overwhelming . The key is to find out what has worked on your hair and go with that . Find out what makes your hair too dry , or what strips it then find something that adds moisture .

It took 2-3 months for it to be healthy , but even now it is still improving and getting shiner and curlier . <p> I was just about to cut my hair prior to getting it flatironed because I thought I did n't make any progress ( long story ) .

It was always thick and was pretty long when I was a child , but I did everything wrong to it you could guess . <p> - greased my hair with low quality and mineral oil products ? Check . - permed every 4 weeks using no-lye relaxer ? Check . - washed my hair every few weeks with poor quality shampoo ? Check . - sleeping on cotton pillowcase without silk or satin scarf ?

Good luck in getting the breakage under control . 
@@22470493 @2470493/ <p> I have n't searched , so I 'm not sure if there is a thread like this already . If there is , this will just count as a refresher for those of you that are new to the world of weaves . <p> I think that I 'm qualified to pass on what I 've learned over the years because I started wearing glue in weaves when I was about 12 . Then , I graduated to sew-ins at about 16 . To think , I probably could have have WL hair by now . <p> Anyway , these are my lessons learned that I hope will be helpful to someone else . If anyone else has other tips , please list them , I 'll compile it all to make a huge list . <p> After you take out your sew-in , DO NOT WASH YOUR HAIR before you properly detangle and get out ALL shed hair . ( Trust me , you will have a MAJOR setback if you do not listen to that one rule ) . I learned the hard way . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have that ' good ' hair , so my hair will surely not tangle . Well let me tell you ... as soon as water hit my hair , it formed locs and got really matted . I had to chop out huge chunks of hair . <p> Do not let the stylist braid your hair or sew in the weave too tight . You 'll know because aside from the major migraine that you 'll experience , you 'll see a lot of white bulbs on the tip of many strands along your hairline . This means that hair has been pulled out because of the tension . Also , tiny bumps will form in the back of your head . Silly me ... I already know this , but I 'm suffering from this right now . I need to listen to my own advice . I have two months to nurture my hairline . <p> It is not recommended that you wear your install for more than three months . I wore an install for four months this year , and thankfully I took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't lose any hair . The longer your leave the install coupled with the frequent washing + airdrying , shed hair , etc. will cause your hair to matt up over time . <p> Do not trust just ANYONE to take out your install . I always take out my installs by myself . I ca n't say that I do n't trust her , but I do n't even let my sister take it out . This way , if I happen to mistakenly cut my hair ... oh well ... at least I was the one that did it . Also , I 'm much more patient , and can afford to take the extra 2+ hours to carefully take it down . I doubt a stylist will be that careful . <p> If you are planning to leave your install in for three months , you might want to rethink frequent washing and cowashing . I usually wash once per week , but sometimes I change it up to once every two weeks . Again , frequent washing and airdrying , product buildup , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of caution . ( this is especially true for those with natural hair ) <p> If you are getting a full sew-in with no hair left out , ask your stylist not to braid the baby hairs or the really short strands around your hairline . Trust me .. this is the first time that I 've had a full head sew-in with everything braided , and my hairline is missing . She braided every strand , and now I " m having to baby that area . <p> It is normal for you to see lots of hair in your comb after you take out your sew-in . Remember , you did have your hair braided for x time , and what you 're seeing is most likely shed hair . <p> Try to do a protein treatment prior to the sew-in , and when you take it down . This helps to strengthen your hair . <p> It 's also recommended that you at least wait 1-2 weeks before you reinstall another sew-in . This gives you an opportunity to give your real hair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Remember there are so many different styles that you can achieve with a weave without damaging your real hair . Do you want some blonde highlights , a curly or wet n ' wavy look , or perhaps a pixie cut ? Go ahead , and weave it up ! Um .. you might want to stick with something that will look more natural though . If you 're 4a or 4b , you might want to stay about from silky straight hair . <p> 12 . If you 're relaxed , this is a good way to stretch your relaxers . You do n't have to keep relaxing your entire head when you take down an install . If it 's going to be braided up anyway , what 's the point ? <p> 13 . Do NOT use hair glue unless you want to be permanently bald , hair glue is a no no.

If you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary steps in taking it out so you do n't lose hair in the process . <p> 14 . Tips on washing hair while you have a weave : I picked up this great tip from someone on BHM . Put your shampoo , conditioner , deep conditioner in separate water/applicator bottles . Dilute it with water , and pour it over your head so it reaches your braids . Gently massage your scalp , and rinse thoroughly . This works great ! <p> 15 . This is the regimen that I follow when I have my sew-in . Remember I switch it up , and sometimes only wash every two weeks . Wash 1x week with Creme of Nature ( white bottle with green cap ) Condition w/ Mane N Tail DC 1x week Pantene Pro V relaxed and natural dc mask ( really good slip ) Leave in conditioner - Infusium 23 Moisturize every day by spraying a glyercin and water mix to by braids and to the hair that 's left out . I also seal the ends of the hair that 's left out with castor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more Expensive , but very worth it ( You can reuse these . Google them to find them on the net ) <p> Extensions Plus relaxed texture <p> Halleys Curls relaxed texture <p> Wagmans <p> Indique <p> Belle Noir <p> 17 . If you ca n't ( or wo n't ) spend the time DAILY to blend your real hair and the weave hair ............ get a FULL HEAD weave ( where all of your real hair to tuck out of sight ) ! Walking around with two different textures or colors ... not only scream WEAVE it also is just plain tacky ! ( Tip by CurliDiva ) <p> 18 . Buy vent brush or comb with you and USE IT regularly ! A weave needs to be styled ( either with a comb , brush or my your hands ) . Do not walk around with a tangled head of yaki hair that looks like you have n't touch it since you rolled out of bed . ( Tip by CurliDiva ) <p> 19 . It is possible to wear a " glued " weave without losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty black glue ( grey bottle with red tip ) . If you want a glued weave use Liquid Gold with Airflex strips . I did that with no problem at all . ( Tip by Soulie ) <p> 20 . To remove a sewn weave - do n't use scissors - use a seam ripper to break the thread , then use a bobby pin , comb tail , or fingernail to pick the thread out . It takes a little longer , but there is no cut hair . ( Tip by Soulie ) <p> 21 . Invest in quality hair such as Extensions Plus , Nature Girl or Wagmans . All of them maintain their quality over time ( even can be reused ) . This will reduce the amount of tugging against your own braids from attempting to detangle . ( Tip by Soulie ) <p> 22 . Excellent Post ! Another thing I would personally like to add is wait at least 7-10 days after taking out your install before geting a touch up relaxer . For the same reason as number 9 . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural/transitioning hair with weave . If you bought a curly/kinky weave and you 're natural , you might want to try using flexi rods or trying a braidout on the hair that you left out . That will help blend your hair with the weave . If you bought a straight weave , you 'll more than likely have to constantly straighten it so that it blends in with the weave . <p> Ediese is 110% right on all of those , and although i did n't have to experience most of those setbacks first hand , I always kept ALL of those tips in mind from just dealing with hair in general , I just learned as I went along . I am so happy she posted these , because ladies , I 'm telling y'all , she is absolutely right with those tips . as far as the washing of the weave , i only washed once every two weeks for those purposes that she mentioned , plus washing a weave is more work than your real hair ! ! Again , thanks Ediese for those pointers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to chime in . <p> Very useful ! Any advice for itching ? That 's the main reason why I ca n't do weaves/ braids . 8146 @qwx208146 <p> One thing that cuts down on the weave itchies is taking the base off of the weave hair . First you fill a basin/sink/big pot with warm water and add a few cups of white vinegar . Then you submerge the weave hair and gently swish it about . Let it sit in there for a while , especially if there 's no rush to get it out . Wait until you see a whitish scum on the surface of the water . Then take the weave hair out and rinse it off . Let it drip dry and give it a good combing before installing it . <p> I notice a HUGE difference in itchiness when I do this . I do it with braiding hair , too . <p> thanks so much for this I have kinky twists in now and I plan to keep them in till sometime in December and then get some more in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na get a full sew in instead of relaxing my hair so I can have straight hair without a press that will sweat out and without relaxing my hair ....

If so I agree 1000% with what you wrote . I lost a lot of hair in my crown &amp; nape area last year from leaving a net weave in for 3 months . when I took that thing off my hair underneath had COMPLETELY matted up . It took about an hour to pry my hair from my scalp and detangle . Thank God I only had half of my hair under the net and not a full head weave <p> good post , halfway through my natural journey this year I broke down and put in a glue in weave which I ABSOLUTELY HATED . I put a ton of oil in my hair when I took it out but towards the bottom I guess the glue clumped up so I lost about 2 inches on the right side of my head I 'm glad that it happened early on in the process but still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is possible to wear a " glued " weave without losing hair - but I definitely would not recommend using that nasty black glue ( grey bottle with red tip ) .

@@22470495 @2470495/ <h> Braids back to back <p> I was wondering if any of you guys do that ? Meaning , do you get braids back to back or have u seen people like that where you will see them saturday in cornrows , about a month or 2 old so its time to take them out , but then by sunday u see them in a whole new doo . basically i 'm saying for about 6-12 months u do not see their hair EVER cause it is always in braids . I almost did that but did n't  have the money and now i feel that maybe its a good thing i did n't  do that . I think its kinda bad to have your hair constantly being pulled like that . I think its good to let the hair rest and breath . Give it 2 weeks at the least and at the most a month or so . Any1 else does/seen this <p> I am living proof that that is not a good thing . Most of my life I had very thick hair . A few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( just getting them redone ) , And I tell you it has really ruined my hair . My hair was paper thin when I decided to stop getting braids . Since I have been getting advice from the ladies on this board and taking care of my hair , I do see a significant difference in the health of my hair . I am now using follicle booster for a bald spot that I still have due to braiding . HTH <p> my best friend wore individual braids back to back for about a year , despite my objections . when she stopped , her hair was really healthy . i think it 's because she was doing what i told her to ... well almost everything besides braid back to back . <p> anyway , she used curl activator to moisture them and washed them every other week . she 's Neet in my picture trail . i just updated her photo . it did n't result in a disaster for her , but everyone is different . <p> I braid back to back sometimes . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the individual . Some women 's hair do n't suffer . This year I had braids from April to August back to back , then I took a break in September and now I have braids again . I do it because I am lazy and because I do n't even want to try to style my hair in between relaxers . I am going to leave this set of braids in until December , then rebraid and keep the braids in until March . So far , my hair has n't suffered . I do conditioner washes in between time to strengthen my hair for the next round . <p> I think I wear my braids ( micro extensions ) back to back ... No wait ... I wear them ... uhmm ... ... ( what do you call it if you keep them in all the time and redo one at a time ? Sort of like 24/7 for a year or more ... till everyone 's so bored and sick and tired of seeing you in braids ? ? ? ) Yep , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this practice and my hair was doing OK before I found this board and is still doing OK , so I have no plans of changing my ways . I 'll admit that I believe the secret to my success is I am constantly redoing my braids so no section of my hair gets over-strained by the weight of the extension hair . <p> Now if we are talking just braiding your own hair over and over with no extensions , then braiding back to back TO ME is as healthy as going to bathroom when nature calls . It 's the easiest way I can think of for growing and taking care of natural hair , and it 's the way that all the kids in my neighborhood wore their hair . Granted we did n't all have " bra-strap " length hair . But that had nothing to do with the back-to-back braids . We just did n't know the harm heat causes ( We could n't wait to press our hair when it was out of braids ) . We did n't know about the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that ? ) ... The list is endless . But if you wan na cornrow you hair back to back with no extensions , as long as your hair is n't being pulled so tight that you induce alopecia , then I see no harm whatsoever in doing it . <p> Extensions are a different story . I think they have to not only be light ( weightwise ) enough so as not to break your hair ( the size of the braids being important ) , but you ca n't have them sitting in your head untouched for months on end with the same part of your hair bearing their weight . And micros especially are more of a headache to undo so unless one is very patient , you could cause your hair undue stress . <p> I get braids a lot but I also wear my own hair out a lot too(pressed) to give each one a break and my hair 's still thick . It always has been . sometimes I wonder why b/c I use to do some bad things to my hair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as now , where I do " back to back " braiding in cornrows . One reason I think I do n't experience damage and I achieve massive hair growth is because I braid them myself and I DO N'T pull them tight , so as to break my hair . Becauuse of my hair texture , I simply put on a creamy conditioning leave in on each sectins before adding extentions and breading it . I do put beads on my hair and always have , however , at night , I have to use 2 satin scarves to tie my hair up . The first , I tie on my head , leaving the braids hanging out the back . Then , I wrapt the beads in the second scarf , and then slightly lift it and securly tie it to my head too . I guess I should take pics of this and post it on my site so you can see what I mean . But , by doing this , I do n't stress my hair and it grows really well . <p> Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I do , I put on hot oil and sit under the dryer , then wash it with CON , use a protein conditioner ( without heat ) , and rinse it completely out . I then put in serum , followed by letting my hair dry until just slightly damp , to which I add biosilk . I let it thoroughly dry and I try to go one complete day without the braids or doing anything to my hair . Once I braid my hair , if I feel any pulling , I take it down and redo it . Because I use large beads and " washers " I have to make sure when they 're added I still do n't feel any stress on my scalp . I plan to continue braiding my hair until summer of next year ... then I 'll probably relax it again and take more pics so you can see the amount of growth . <p> BTW , I have seen people get braids back to back and have their hair thin , so I know it 's possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does n't experience this ... not yet ( she says as she knocks on wood ) <p> Exactly , Serei . That 's my HIH disease . If I am not using my hands for anything , then I 'm looking for a braid that I have n't got to that has some growth or is just in need of redoing . Who needs popcorn during a movie when I can indulge in " spot retouching " ? ( You notice I 've fallen for your nice way of phrasing my habit . ) <p> well i sort of do this ... last yr i wore braids , took them out for a week and had them put back in for a whole and my hair did n't  seem to suffer a lot . like chimunk said , it all depends on hair type , how you take care of your braids , and how you wear your braids . <p> I was thinking about doing this just to extend relaxer time . I was wondering has anyones child hood hair line ever came back with braids ? Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old childhood hairline ( widow 's peak ) is coming back . I have never experienced this and to tell the truth I thought that it was gone for good . <p> I braided my hair back to back for the first time this year without any problems to extend my relaxer time and my hairline grew back in to my surprise but I was also using nioxin follice booster and doing scalp massages daily . <p> I do know somebody who wears her braids back to back . There is a time when she went for two months without washing her hair . When she took out her cornrows , she had a lot of dandruff and itches which I believe were caused by the dryness on her scalp . The day after she took out her cornrows , she came to my house and asked me to relax her hair . I told her that I was not into relaxing but caring for our natural God given hair . Anyway , I ended up just oil treating her hair with olive oil , shampooing , deep conditioning etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . It was tearing all the time . She combed her hair as though she was brushing a horse ready to compete . To cut a long story short , the next time I saw her , she was in braids again . At that point I felt like her . On top of all this , she gets her braids done so tight all the time and has a receding hair line . I personally think that braiding back to back braids are not bad as long as they are not braided too tight and when you take care of your hair before , during and after braiding . <p> That 's me , I do that all the time I have been braiding my hair back to back for about 8 years . Now I know how to take care of my hair , so It 's growing , plus I love to get new hairstyles and keep my hair looking neat . <p> Hey Nonie , I do the spot retouching aswell when I have braids . I once wore braids for a whole year straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see my real hair . I would take out one braid and wash it and moisturize it and leave it out oohing and aahing over it and then put the braid back in . This was when I was natural . I never had a hairline or breakage problem . I also removed all the braids and put a fresh braid style in 3 times during the 12 months . That was me , raggedy old head on saturday , fresh new braids on Sunday . <p> Allandra , did she use it more than once a day ? did she make sure it was really covering all of her head and did she use anything else on her hair while using it ? Cause i only use the s-curl and at night the s-curl w/water , that 's all i use unless i feel soreness then i put on some S-8 or some ORS carrot oil <p> so serei , you had your hair permed and then put braids in them ? Hmm wow . i hear that some women can get away w/it and some cant so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it at having my hair natural cause i wan na go that route for now and see how things go . I know of one lady who i 've seen for like i du n no 8-10 years and she has always had braids in her hair the whole time , like Brandy who is now in2 wearin weave . I guess the rumor bout her having some kinda hair disease is true . <p> well yes i see what every1 is saying about how u can do that and still have nice hair and it IS on how u do your hait. since i have finally learned how to lock the hair in2 my own hair i 'm going to start some things on myself . I dsont use 2 strands of fake hair to lock it in just one and that 's it and i 'm braiding it . I guess it would be ok , i 'll try that , maybe after these rows are out . <p> I think i 'm going to get me some thai zillions again , curly kind or so if i get the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esp from allandra bout her friend , keeping it in like that and using s-curl in it worked out good for her . I 'll only keep it in about 2 months or maybe less . <p> i currently have braids and plan to keep them for 3 months , then unbraid and rebraid for another 3 months . I 'm transitioning and this is the best way for me to do it . <p> Three important things for me when having braids are : <p> Braids must not be tight ( when i go to bed on the night after i have had my braids , i should have no pain , maybe just a stiff neck from sitting down for 10 hours to get my braids in ! ! ) Leave hairline unbraided Moisturise daily . <p> I always insist on the lady who does my hair to not put them in tight and i also ask her to leave about 1/4 ( quarter inch ) of my hairline unbraid .

I have been working steadily for3- 6 hours hours a day for almost a week and I am still not finished . Everything I read has ladies talking about how they only spent 6 hours take down and were done . Is there a secret I am missing ? I use a detangler , soak the twist then take it down . It is not difficult but I am not done yet and it is taking to long . I can not devote more time than I already have apportioned . Can anyone give me some advice ? Also I plan to wash and protien treat after take down but if anyone has a regimen they use afterctake down I would appreciate it . <p> First of all , how long did you have them in ? I never had to soak or detangle to take out my twists . I kept them in for 2-3 months . At 3 months it was a lil bit more difficult but nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I typically cut my twists a few inches below where my hair starts and unravel , then with 1/2 " left I slide the hair out . <p> If I want to go even faster I do n't watch TV/movies like some women do .

In fact , as my hair has gotten longer I just cut and the very bottom where they knot the ends to avoid cutting any bit of hair . once you get to the top you have to be a bit careful of how you unravel it and then make sure to detangle your hair a bit . <p> I was hand condition my hair every week when in braids/twist so my hair is moisturized which helps . I do n't need to get ALL the shed hairs out before I wash but that is just my hair ( 4a ) . I do need to make sure all the hair is separated and being in the braid/twist it can clump together . <p> I do n't know why you need to put in detangler or soak the hair before you take it down .

I 've only hennaed three times but I never liked the idea of putting lemon juice on my hair so I just used hot water .

If you are not using the henna for the color to cover greys then you can use the henna and let it sit for how ever long you want it for the conditioning properties . and for the best properties I have found that Nupur saves me a lot of time because I get the other herbs that I would to put in my hair all at one time . <p> but I let my henna sit over night when I mix it and I stop using lemon because it is drying .

Lol I DO think it WILL leave some sort of tint on my black hair , since it already managed to stain parts of my hand a light orange .

If I henna every two weeks , does them mean I have to indigo every two weeks to ? You know , to maintain the black color .

@@22470503 @2470503/ <p> It 'll probably take me an eon . I refuse to PS coz I 'm too lazy to be bothered and my belief is that once your hair gets acquainted with your shoulders , the ends become more susceptible to damage from friction with your clothes , so retention becomes a tall order . Hence PSing is one way to lessen the time it takes to get to APL . So is sealing your ends to keep them " safe " . I do n't do that either . So check back with me in about ten years . <p> I am just at APL right now and I have been anticipating like crazy and now it does n't even look like anything has happened ...

I took biotin for the first 2 months ( i had to stop ' cause my skin broke out ) , i did not trim , DC 'd with every wash ( i ca n't remember the last time i did that ) and only wore my hair in protective styles . it was winter so i used castor oil a lot and baggied. that may also have contributed to retention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be posting a " How long did it take you to go from APL to BSL ?

Mainly cos your reg should be on lock by then and you can do a wider range of protective styles , plus no-ones gon na notice all the regrowth from stretches cos you have all the length to draw attention away from it . <p> For the ladies that reached APL in 6 months , were you grazing or were you full APL ?

How long did it take you ? <p> I wonder as well , I am currently almost full shoulder length roughly 2 inches to get there , my next goal will be arm pit length , and ultimately bra strap length . I want to know many months is needed to go from full shoulder length to arm pit length . <p> I 've been a member here since sept 06 and i made apl april 07 . So it took me 7months with maybe 3 or 4 major trims . I 've been shoulder length basicly all my life . I think it depends on the person and how their hair grows . Average growth is .5in a month .

I hope that helped . <p> I 'm at full shoulder length right now and it took me less than a year to reach this length from above ear length .

It was only taken down every 6 weeks to be washed and deep conditioned and I had my stylist gradually snip off the old relaxed ends . I ended up being 99% natural and my hair was very healthy . I had little breakage . Every time my stylist took it down it was just blooming like wild flowers . <p> I 'm thinking it depends on the individual basically ... your genetics ( hair grows fast in my family but I damaged my own hair with excessive heat before deciding to give my hair a much needed break/rest ) , your routine--how you care for your hair ... how you care for yourself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may take one person 6 months and another person a year to reach the same goal . <p> I 'm shooting for BSL myself but I 'm not going to compare .

Bmore , I know you are wearing your hair in weaves and low manipulation styles a lot so it might not take your hair a full year .

I have n't had a weave since June . And I have n't been to the salon to get one since my birthday the first week of March . The last two I did myself . And I had a set of Senegalese Twists back in March too . Once it gets cooler I might start wearing it straight more often . <p> I do n't know how long it will take you . But , I made a chart using a ruler since I know that my hair grows 0.5 " per month , I think I will reach APL by January 2008 . If you know your growth rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did on this picture to see how long it will take for you to reach APL . HTH ! <p> Yeah this is what I did . I know I get like .5 in of growth a month . So once I knew how many more inches I needed to go from SL to APL , I was able to calculate the month in which I 'd reach APL . I calculated how many more months to go for BSL and MBL and wrote them down . If you trim you have to account for the trims as well . After that just follow your regimen consistently . When you know round about which month you were meant to reach a certain goal , you can look forward to reaching it and if you do n't you can reevaluate your regimen and progress to see what might have gone wrong and take the steps to correct it in the next few months . This method is quite simple so you always know where you are and where you are supposed to be . This is what I have been doing for the last year . Hope this helps !

@@22470510 @2470510/ <p> I wore wigs day in and day out for about a year and half ; grew out my relaxer all the way to SL ( making my way to APL now ) with no problem . I now switch it up with wearing wigs , a beanie , or phony puff . When I get bored I wear a braid out in an updo or loose for a day or two . It works but you have to make sure to take care of your own hair underneath the wig . That 's one reason why I prefer wigs over weaves because a wig can be taken off making it easier to care for your real hair . <p> I started wearing wigs when I began interviewing hardcore for jobs about a year ago . I was wearing cornrows and did n't think it was the most professional looking style so I got a short wig for when I was called on short notice for an interview . I liked the way it looked and continued to wearing them as a protective style . I went from using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to natural , and now again as a protective style after I BC'ed . I like them MUCH better than braids or weaves because as Meritamen mentioned , you can take it off nightly and care for your hair . My only goal in a weave was keeping my hair straight and silky to match the weave . In a wig , I can cowash every night and I pretty much never use heat . My hair is finally thriving . <p> Check out this thread on ladypanialo ' s reggie and the links to her own threads . <p> yorkpatties I 'm intrigued by the frequent cowashing .

From shoulder ... that was a year and 2 months to almost waist ( I was about an inch to two inches from waist and cut to shoulder ... I was leaning I 'll admit lol because I was so upset I just cut my hair back to shoulder . Second pic no leaning , straight up ) . Also that growth included small one inch cuts ( about two inches of cuts ) in that time frame as I was trying to get out layers . <p> Currently at hip if I 'll stop using my scissors I can get to my next goal lol . <p> BTW I 'd like to add it 's not a race . Get there in your own time . I could say two years is acceptable for some ( but it may not be for a slow grower ) . Also you have to take into account height ( though I 've found there 's very little difference between average height and tall women unless they have long torsos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was one thread where people compared the length to their waists and the taller women were close to the 5 ' 4-5 ' 5 women when someone concluded that point ( that seems so obvious now but at the time , everyone was baffled ) . <p> I 'm 5 ' 5 ( or 5 ' 4 3/4 in reality ) with average waist ( I thought I was short until I measured ) . So it 's best to just gauge your growth ( and retaining ) rate in order to find out your time frame . If you 're a fast grower you 're going to get there faster than most . <p> For instance if you started your hhj when you were SL , how long did it take to get to WL ? <p> I 'm just guessing but ... 2 years ?

I think from SL to WL on me at 5 " 11 " tall would be like 12 to 15 inches , I 'm jus guessin .

It just seemed to affect my scalp though . Not my face and also not internally . When I would apply the aloe it would result in a burning sensation all over my scalp and was unbearable , especially if I used Aloe Vera Oil where the extract is concentrated . <p> However , I found out that the Aloe Vera plant contains a natural yellow latex substance ( called aloin ) that it produces and I also have a latex allergy . So I wanted to know if a used a brand where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction to it . I used the Lily of the Desert brand . I got the one that said " inner fillet " and not " whole leaf " because the aloin and gel are separate inside of the plant and taking the inner fillet minimizes the aloin that ends up in the final extract . Also that brand said it had less than 1 part per million of aloin . <p> So I started using their gel on my hair and scalp and I have n't had any more issues with a burning , stinging scalp . In my case it was an aloin allergy , but I know from looking it up that people can also have a bad reaction to the polysaccharides in the gel , which ca n't be helped by removing aloin . If you really like using AVG try the " inner fillet " kind and see if , like me , it 's just the aloin or if you have to stop using the gel completely .

There are a few solutions I see : 1 . Texlax you know how to handle your hair and it looks pretty healthy in the pics Judy know you ca n't stretch for 6mo 2 . Wear roller sets and the like with your natural hair . Just pin curl at night and snatch out the pins in the morning shake and go 3 . Wear the bun lol if it ai n't broke do n't fix it <p> I texturized with Linange Shea Butter Texturizer . It 's mild , did n't cause any burns , did n't kill my curls , and did n't damage my hair either ( have n't noticed any breakage , or excess shedding ) . It 's easier to style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but WnG 's , and easier to detangle . I do n't wear my hair straight , but I imagine it 's easier to straighten as well . <p> Before you pick up the chemicals , really think about how you want your hair to look . Do n't worry about anything else , because it 's YOUR hair . I wrestled with texturizing for a while , because I was worried about what people would say about me not being natural anymore , but I am so much happier with my hair now ! I hated how frizzy it was , and how it took a lot more effort to make it look like how I wanted it to look .... now it does , and I have no regrets . <p> I luv your natural hair but I do know what you mean as far as the amount of time it takes to do natural hair . I was natural for almost 6yrs and my hairdresser suggested using a texturizer and I have been luving it ever since . For me , I feel like I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles that I 'm doing now I 've done them when I was natural , but w/ less time . I have less tangles and matting and I do n't  feel like its a chore to do my hair . Even though I luv my natural hair , I was becoming frustrated at the amount of time and energy it took to do my hair and just really hated my hair . But on the flip side I luv the fact that it was natural and I was n't using any chemicals or needed a hair dresser per say . <p> I do luv the results of my texlax hair , I do n't  luv the chemical process . I just had an experience where my hairdresser burned my scalp really bad ; as a result I will be doing my own texturizers . I texlax 1-2x 's a year and sometimes longer . I have been contemplating on going back to natural but I have n't decided yet . <p> Do what works for you and remember it 's just hair . You can always cut &amp; grow again <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; I 'm not going to lie ... it is the best of both worlds . I was natural for 8 years . My texlaxed hair takes to moisture better , has thick healthy ends &amp; has never been longer . <p> I Texlax 3 times per year &amp; it does wonders . I know ppl like to sing the " relaxers are damaging " song .... But the fact is , my hair has never been healthier nor longer . Everyone is different . My hair responds better to the work that I put into it with the Texlax . <p> However ... To me ( and maybe this is just because I 'm thorough with my reggie ) ... Texlaxed hair is not easier to care for than natural hair . I only Texlax 3 times per year , so I 'm dealing wit 2 textures most of the time . That takes A LOT of patience &amp; hard work ... Just as much ( if not more ) time as I put into my natural hair . <p> The answers thus far are a bit confusing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone so long ( almost 2 yrs ) without chems ? What is a " texlaxed style " ? <p> Everybody that texlax 's ends up transitioning to natural eventually or going bone str8. 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Really ? ? What is this based on ? Or is this just your opinion/assumption ? <p> In my case ... Texlaxing is hands down the best thing that ever happened to my hair . Bone straight hair is boring to me ... plus the relaxer strength is harsher on my hair . I was natural for 8 years . It was nice ... but I love being able to show my length while STILL having thick beautiful hair ... I never say never , but I ca n't see myself changing . <p> Anyway , you 're entitled to your opinion . I do n't have a problem with it . I just think it 's hilarious that you feel so strongly without anything to back it up lol . <p> I have said that I would never , ever relax again but lately I have been seriously considering texlaxing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 years it seems like the Linange is new and exciting and I love the reviews on it . <p> I truly do love my natural hair but ssk 's are the death of it . No matter what I use or do nothing helps with those so I am constantly dusting , trimming or cutting . My hair in 8 years has not gotten any longer than APL . I 'm a type 4a/b so I 'm not seeking WSL at all but I would love a nice , full BSL . <p> I do a lot of protective styles . I co-wash for now . I 've tried all kinds of routines and now on a K.I.S.S . mission . My hair is in mini-twists now and I do henna and I seal the ends with shea butter , Hair growth trigger elixir and coconut oil but I can feel the ssk 's on the ends of some twists . <p> This may get lost in the thread but does anyone remember the poster that has a blog about how she texturized her hair and she had a tutorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think her hair was a different type than mine but I liked her technique . <p> When she did her update everyone was complimenting her on her hair and her figure . I 've searched for it but not remembering her name makes it difficult <p> I think your natural hair looks great but if you 're really feeling the itch to texturize , why do n't you try a keratin treatment instead ? I 've had the Coppola keratin smoothing treatment and unlike a relaxer/texturizer , it does n't break the bonds in your hair it strengthens it , it 's temporary , and will make your hair much smoother . You mentioned that time constraints during the week are also a concern , and I know that for me , the keratin cut down my styling time significantly . When I wanted to wear it straight , I could blow dry it in 5-10mins flat ( or just let it air dry ) instead of 30mins-1hr that it 'd normally take . <p> I know everyone says to do what works best for you , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back ? It may seem weird , especially for styling , but you will be able to compare and contrast the texlaxed portion with your natural hair . <p> What styles do you usually wear your hair in ? . i relaxed my hair for the first time in a long time almost a year ago and i do not miss my fro whatsoever . My hair is more predictable with the relaxer which i prefer . <p> I am currently looking into temporary straighteners to see if i can get the control without having to permanently break the bonds in my hair.maybe that 's something you would be interested in too ? 8146 @qwx208146 <p> My hair is in buns majority of the time . I feel like now that I know more about my natural and relaxed hair this will make things a lot easier . <p> Have you ever tried BKT ? I 've gotten mixed reviews on it . Some say the chemicals are dangerous while others say it 's the best thing since sliced bread . <p> I texturized with Linange Shea Butter Texturizer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't kill my curls , and did n't damage my hair either ( have n't noticed any breakage , or excess shedding ) .

HTH ! <p> lwilliams1922 , you 're not doing anything wrong . I do n't know anyone who braids firmly with extensions the first time they do it .

( #6 ) I then use the fingers of the other hand to pull out 1/3 of my hair to match it with one arm of the extension hair .

You need to do it like #10 shows .

Any tips ? 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Royalq you 're probably twirling in the wrong direction . You 're supposed to twirl both strands one way , and then wrap them around each other in the opposite way . So if you twirl them both clockwise , then you must wrap them anticlockwise , and vice versa . In fact what you will find is they will automatically wrap around each other the opposite way when you twirl them one way--which helps with speed . And because it 's a natural response to the twirling for them to wrap around each other , they hold well . <p> I 've been braiding since I was 14 .

@@22470520 @2470520/ <p> I do it similarly , but my suggestions for the future as a person whose worn braids for most of my life . Make a detangling mix which should include aloe vera juice , a conditioner with a ton of slip such as HE Hello Hydration , olive oil , and a tbsp of ACV . Put the mix in a spray bottle and saturate your hair from scalp to most of the braid , wrap your hair and leave it overnight . In the morning removing shed hair will be a BREEZE , all the dirt will just slide out . <p> Also , NEVER take out all of the braids then detangle .

I 've had setbacks due to bad braiders in the past . When you are done your head should not hurt one bit . Ask if they braid with a technique where they braid around the hair instead of picking at it . Ask for larger parts around your edges .

So , I decided to mist water on the section I was working on and then gently separate the matted hair to get the dirt to come apart . <p> After that , I used a combination of water , Trader Joe 's Tea Tree Tingle conditioner ( for slip ) , and organic apple cider vinegar to finger detangle my little sister 's hair . I added the ACV because it acts as a natural detangler . It also helps to melt much of the dirt/buildup away . <p> After all sections were fully detangled , I trimmed her ends and applied coconut oil to each section for an overnight pre-poo to prep her hair for wash day in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the braid removal took a total of approximately 3 hours " and no combs were needed .

I hope this helps ! <p> So , I 'm finished taking my braids out and I have a lot of build up in my hair . I kept my braids in for four months , the longest I 've ever worn one install and I do n't know how to remove all this dirt . <p> Any suggestions ?

I then applied a deep conditioner and protein on the ends . I went under the dryer . I rinsed it out and braided my hair and wore it in a nappy bun .

I use SSI moisture mist to moisturize my hair while in my cornrows , I use a little JBCO or Liquid gold on a small breakage area that I have had for a few years . I have not been real consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afroveda ACV . I forgot to mention that I did use some of that SM purification mask during my first treatment . I also used some come clean shampoo . I am sure that my scalp is absolutely free of any buildup . What about you ladies ? ! ! <p> @LBoogie85 Yup my real hair is extremely healthy , but I 've picked up so many tips and tricks over the years . <p> My braid regimen consist of moisturizing with a mix of Infusium 23 ( old formula can find at Sallys ) mixed with African Pride Olive Miracle Braid Spray , and a little Aloe Vera Juice . I moisturize every other day . I find moisturizing daily to be excessive when I 've done it in the past . I put the mix in a spray bottle and focus on saturating the length of my real hair in the braid , I will then squeeze the braids to make sure the moisture mix gets inside . I was my hair every 10 days with a sulfate free tea tree based shampoo such as Trader Joes Tingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undiluted shampoo in my finger tips and massage my scalp to get it clean . Then I dilute the shampoo in bottle of water to wash the length of my braids . Then I rinse and condition with Suave Tropical Coconut and leave it in for softness . I also apply Njoy Oil on my scalp every other day . <p> Then as soon as you take out the braids prepoo with coconut oil and clarify . I need to strip my hair of the dirt and oils . Afterward , I do a hard protein treatment , I mix Aphogee 2 step with Neutral Protein Filler . I suggest that this step is mandatory especially if you are doing a back to back braid regimen . Your hair needs to be at it 's best . Then I DC and apply a moisturizing leave in . Then back in braids in about week . <p> ETA : Make sure you go to a great braider . I 've had setbacks due to bad braiders in the past . When you are done your head should not hurt one bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braid around the hair instead of picking at it . Ask for larger parts around your edges . Also , if you are using synthetic hair I suggest X-Pressions because the hair is very smooth and light . DO NOT blow dry your hair before you get it done . It should be soft , moisturized , and detangled . Also , DO NOT let her bring a rattail comb near your head unless it 's for parting . That will do so much damage to your hair . 8146 @qwx208146 <p> I took your suggestion and purchased the xpressions kankelon hair . Gee whiz , it was pricey . It was 4.99 a pack . I usually buy Vivica 's hair for 1.99 . However , once I compared the two I immediately noticed the difference in quality . So my plan is to use the Xpressions hair in the front and if I do n't  have enough hair I will use the Vivica hair in the back .

She has a bunch of videos on braiding that may be helpful . <p> @sj10460 I think your build up was from using the conditioner everyday . If you massaged your scalp regularly and washed scalp every 10 days it was n't necessary to also spritz daily with conditioner that you were not washing out . Unless you 're doing extremes like swimming where you need to get the chlorine out , when in braids you do n't have to do all of the maintenance steps you 'd do as if hair is out . You can always do a hard protein/moisturizing treatment when you remove the braids . <p> @sj10460 I think your build up was from using the conditioner everyday .

@@22470522 @2470522/ <h> Is It Possible to Change Your Hair Type/Texture ? <p> I just did an extremely big chop , and as my hair grows back , I 'm trying to figure out the very best oils , vitamins , and treatments for healthy hair . I was wondering if anyone thinks it is possible to alter your hair type through diet and supplements . Has this ever been done in history do you think ? I 'm talking about a small change like from a 4c to a 4b for instance , or from a 3c to a 3b ? <p> many black ppl are surprised by their actual texture cause most times its was n't as kinky , hard , or dry as they thought it would be , especially with proper care . <p> you have to do trail and error as even if 2 ppl have the same hair type their may be a difference in thickness , density , porosity , <p> for starters i would try a sulfate free poo from companies like shea moisture or giovanni and conditioner from aubreys , giovanni , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evco , sweet almond , grapeseed , saffllower , walnut , sunflower are all good ones . pick 3 of these and mix them . one of the oils should contain cermides , so do a search on ceramides . <p> for creams i would purchase from claudies reviatlizer or try shea moisture . <p> you should deep condition often and when you mositurize and seal try the loc method ... i do it in the sequence of lco . Do a search on the Loc method for more details . <p> Curl pattern is n't definite . Hair growth and haircuts can alter the pattern , as well as hair styles and products . Texture is n't as come-and-go though , fine hair ca n't really become thick although some products/hairstyles can make appear so . I think density can be improved by supplements and vitamins . <p> Thank you for this thread . I thought I had ruined my hair=heat damage ( dang tourmaline Chi ) ! I started wearing wash and goes more to see if my curl pattern had changed ( still forms curls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to age and stress ( thought my hair was thinning ) . I think it may be still because of age ( thickness ) but the texture is just different ( wanted to post a thread but I do n't always have the best success with conveying what I mean without being perceived ' wrong ' ) : <p> Hairtype is supposed to be an objective thing based on the size of the curl . So other than changes from aging , disease , etc. , theoretically , no . Curl pattern is determined by the shape of the hair follicle , so nothing short of the aforementioned is going to change that . <p> However , most people are not objective and take lack of shrinkage into account . In some of the big raging debates over hairtypes of very long-haired ladies , a lot of type 4s get considered type 2s because if you stretch a curl enough ( happens naturally as hair gets longer ) , it becomes a wave . This is essentially what texlaxing does- loosens the curl , not changes it all together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will get someone voted down to a lower hair type . Also , hair clumping ( if it 's meant to do so ) will get it voted down , so look for washing/styling methods/products for clumping curls .

Both of those times while I enjoyed my short hair I do not want to revisit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 months post and would like to continue transitioning until I get my NG to be APL which is when i was happiest with my natural hair length whether curly or straight . Ive cut my hair from around BSL to SL gradually over the last few months and it has made things much easier to handle although I miss my length a bit right now . <p> 2 years , 7 months , or 31 months . Yes , I was a long transitioner . I choose to do so because I was a straight punk about the big chop . Besides , it was a blessing because I learned about patience and my hair . I really appreciate my hair now . It 's really a personal journey either via big chop or long transition . But , it 's well worth it . <p> The first time I transitioned I lasted only 6 months before I BC 'd . With all that I have learned here on LHCF , if I decided to go natural again I could easily transition for the 3 years it would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . <p> I transitioned for a long time .... like 3 years because I did n't want my hair to ever be shorter than collar bone length . I transitioned with the assistance of braid/twist outs and bunning ... but mostly by bunning . <p> When i started transitioning in September 2010 my relaxed hair was about neck length . I started cutting a little bit and sometimes a lot off each month . I think April 2011 was the point where all the relaxed hair was gone and there was no noticeable difference in length . 
@@22470527 @2470527/ <h> Is it good to wear your weaves back to back . <p> I saw on here where some members say that they wore their hair weaves back to back for over a year . I was wondering is this good practice or should you give your hair a break from time to time . If you wore your weave back to back were you satisfied with the growth after you decided to wear your own hair out . Also , is it more common for those who are fully natural to wear them back to back then from those who are relaxed . <p> I wore weaves back to back ( take down , wash , DC , install a day or 2 later ) all of 2008 and in the end my hair was a mess , which lead me here . I must also add that I was n't taking good care of my hair under the weave . <p> I would give myself at least a 2 - 3 week break . I 'm natural and I think that helps more than those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the day the tke out their weave , they 're back in the stylist 's seat getting a new one and they have thin edges ( but they 're the ones who do n't  take care of their hair anyways ) <p> IMO , I think that one should give the hair a break of at least a week .

I give my hair a weeks break to rejuvenate by cowashing and to check on the overall health and progress that my hair is making ( and to trim/dust if needed ) . <p> i wore weaves to grow my hair out . i wore them back to back for a year . <p> i had no issues with breakage or anything and my hair grew alot. i was ablt to go from neck length to below shoulder length , but you got ta take care of the hair underneath . shampoo , condition , moisturize. every week or two . <p> if you are relaxed , i would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it down and do n't plan on putting it back up again for at least 3-4 weeks . relaxed hair is weaker so the stress of the braids is not good . <p> I wear my weaves back to back because for one , I have n't had a relaxer since Feb 08 , so right now , about 90% of my hair is natural . It 's super thick because I take aminos , and other weight lifting supplements ( I lift 5 days a week ) so I think that has helped with the thickness , although I do not take them for that purpose . <p> Meanwhile , I moisturize my edges morning and night .

However , I still take care of it underneath with no problems at all . <p> I am currently transitioning and have n't had a perm for 10 months but for 7 months of transitioning i wore my hair in sew-ins , micro 's and Senegalese twists the whole time with only a day in between installs .

By Month 12 I was well past SL .... <p> My only regrets were two things : <p> 1 . I should have given my hair a longer break ... I 'd go less than a week and the pulling was painful ! But no thinning .... no balding THANK GOD ! <p> 2 . The KIND of weaves I was getting was not very helpful ... I was getting my hair in micros in the front and a sew-in in the back , so the front is a couple inches shorter than the back .... So I have nice layers , but I understand what happened ..... <p> I wear my weaves back to back because for one , I have n't had a relaxer since Feb 08 , so right now , about 90% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take aminos , and other weight lifting supplements ( I lift 5 days a week ) so I think that has helped with the thickness , although I do not take them for that purpose . <p> Meanwhile , I moisturize my edges morning and night .

@@22470529 @2470529/ <p> I 'm assuming you straighten them also , but what I 'm really wondering is how ? <p> I 'm transitioning and will straighten my hair in December for the first time in 6 months yay . My edges are almost completely natural . I think I will do my first rollerset , so I am just looking for tips on how to get the edges in particular straight and how you maintain them . If you rollerset , do you use little rollers just for the edges ( really , I 've never done this before . Sorry if that 's a dumb question . ) ? If you only flat iron , do you have a special technique for getting the edges straight ? <p> And , of course , how do you maintain the straight edges until you wet your hair again ? <p> I usually flat iron my hair and skip other methods . If you prefer to skip heat , I find good smoothing gel really works . A little gel and a scarf are always great to lay down those edges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small brush to lay down the edges and wrap a scarf around the hairline and let it dry . <p> I use a mini flat iron for my edges , to make sure they get super straight to begin with . when I work out , I tie a bandana tightly around them , and if i leave it alone until it dries , it remains fairly straight . If I am going somewhere fancy , I 'm not above a small touch up with the flatiron. after a while , when they just get fuzzy , i do n't bother with heat , and i whip out my ORS edge control , which smooths them out . by then my flatiron job is in a ponytail and i 'm ready to wash anyways . <p> Thanks , everyone , for the responses so far . You 've definitely given me some ideas . <p> My edges do n't sit down for anything right now . The only way I can get them to lie down is to spray them with avj/water so they 're moist , slick some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scarf .

That 's supposed to be shampoo 'd off before you leave the salon . <p> I 've had a sew in that felt really " uncomfortable " for 1 or 2 days . But it never was painful .

If it feels stiff , the weave is too tight . If you feel raised skin ( like the scalp between the braids is not flat , but kind of lumpy ) then the braids were probably too tight , and I suggest u either take it down yourself or politely ask her to re-install it a lot less tightly because you are afraid of the braids ripping your hair from your scalp . <p> One time I asked my mom 's friend to braid my hair .

Good luck girlie ! 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Concuring with this post ..... you can call me the queen of weaves until i reacently decided to take a break to wear wigs because my edges were thinning . Yes its not the best thing for your hair , your braids being tight that is but i have never had an issue where it breaks my hair or makes it fall out . I do experience itching to 100 degrees and what i did to relieve that was wash my sewin ... that 's right , even if it was done a day or two ago . It really helps . What you can do if you would like too is to mositurise your scalp between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thightness of the braids faster . It may also give you faster growth too . <p> The tightness of weaves can be an awful thing but if you find that it is unbearable for you ..... do what is best for you and for the health of your hair . OP i have had the same symptoms that you are experiencing and even once i had to remove the dreaded thing because it was so unbearale but like i said .... do what is beast for you and the health of your hair . <p> I 'm gon na just take it out , let my scalp rest for a week , and then put in my boring old minitwists . It has been a while since I 've done them though so maybe now they 're long enough for me to play with . <p> Sounds like she either braided it to tight , or sew it really tightly with the thread . The thread can pull on your braid if pulled to tightly and then the track just adds added weight to it . When I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling the thread to tight . Like I was sewing a button on a coat , super tight . Now I do n't pull the thread so tightly and do smaller loops . <p> Plus you are adding extra weight on your scalp that was n't present before , that will cause soreness too . <p> So I took it down last night . As I was taking down the braids I was feeling like my hair was a lot shorter than it was before I got it done ... like , 2 or 3 inches shorter , and I JUST made APL right before the sew-in . I 'm trying to convince myself that I 'm just imagining things and it 's because my hair is n't stretched . <p> I 'm gon na comb my hair out thoroughly and length check . But I 'm about to cry at this point . It took me an hour and a half last night to take out the braids ALONE . It seems like she sewed my braids together too . I had to stop so many times just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ugh . This will be my last and final sew-in . It 's not worth the headache . <p> Curiously , it 's only in the back half . I 'm now a full inch away from APL again at my longest layer . So now the back half of my hair is a struggling 9 inches ( it was just past 10 ) and the front is a thriving 10.5 inches . <p> ( -- ) <p> Needless to say , friend or not , she 'll never be doing my hair again . This Nioxin better do its thing . <p> Weaves should NEVER be tight or painful . As a weavologist , I see no reason why most stylist think the tighter the better . You can get a good , solid and secure weave that last a long time without your hair being braided too tight and your scalp feeling sore . <p> There is a lot more to doing weaves than just braiding hair down and sewing wefts on . It is an art . Everything should be done to make the weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see progress not a setback ! ! <p> I am glad that you took your weave out before it caused any further damage . <p> I do n't understand , why is it shorter ? Thinner maybe , but shorter ? Did she have scissors ? Anyway , way to go for taking initiative and taking the hair out . 8146 @qwx208146 <p> I do n't know . I just know how long it was and which line it hit on my length check tee after I trimmed a couple of days before . My hair was not 1-1.5 inches shorter in the back like it is now . I measure my hair with both a length tee and a ruler , so I know I 'm accurate on this . <p> I know the hair back there can be very tangly after I 've had my hair pinned up all day so the only thing I can think of is her ripping through it and snatching it apart trying to part it . I 'm thinking I would have felt that though ... I du n no . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . I 'm also wondering why you lost length in the back . I 'm glad that you took it out . I had braids once ( took 6 hours ) and I ended up taking them out the next day because my scalp was really sore the next day . The braids were not actually tight . I was allergic to the hair <p> Whn i tried a sew in , it was sooooo tight my scalp ( near my temples ) bled for a couple of days . I evn took some leftover lortab ( from wisdom tooth removal ) and it still hurt ... needless to say the i had to take that ish out ! ! Lol 
@@22470533 @2470533/ <p> I 've had my hair blowdried and straightened three weeks ago roughly . I have still not wash it because I had been planning on getting single braids done . Later I decided to get a lacewig instead to save my edges ... anyway I have noticed of all this time my scalp is not really oily . Now I wonder if some afro textured people produce less sebum or none at all . Also if my hypothesis is correct if there are anything currently on the market that can help you produce sebum . <p> Yes , we do produce sebum ; the hair strands we produce tend to not to be coated in this sebum because of the kinks , coils , waves , and squiggles in the texture of the hair . <p> I believe you can only supplement the sebum through topical oil application . Even if you were to produce more sebum , you would have to work to distribute it along the hair strand <p> Think of it like water slides : <p> Which one takes more water , time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slide A : <p> Or Slide B : <p> And I 'm sure there are some ladies that need to shampoo to get rid of the sebum they are producing because it 's too much for their hair . When I was relaxed and had very little new growth , that was one of my problems ... yucky , oily , scalp . lol <p> Yepp what NappyNelle said . Even those with straight hair brush their hair to make it shiny because it helps spread the sebum . Eating foods rich in omega-3s ( avocado , flax seeds ) I believe can help the quality of sebum your scalp produces , but you still have to help it distribute . <p> Yes we most definitely do ! That 's one of the reasons why I ca n't go too long between shampoos . I have very oily skin , my scalp included , and because I have 4a-4b hair , the sebum does not have a chance to travel down my hair shaft and so gets trapped on my scalp , especially deep into a stretch . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sebum , but I have heard of several types of oils that mimic the qualities of it ( coconut , jojoba , and of all things , liquified beeswax ! ) , so try to find some of these and see what works best for you . <p> African hair produces plenty of protective oils , called sebum . In fact , African hair actually produces more oils than Caucasian and Asian hair . However , due to the tight curls , the oil fails to spread evenly along the hair fiber . <p> Without lubrication , the fibers become very dry . This causes the brittle strands to flake and roughen , resulting in hair that is coarse to the touch . Very curly hair from all ethnic groups often lacks the silky smoothness of straight hair . This may due to the same reason , but to a lesser extent . <p> Some black people actually have very oily scalps and oily hair . It 's assumed that all black people have dry scalp/hair but that 's not true . In many cases hair/scalp seems dry because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes you have leave your hair in it 's natural state and cut way back on products as well to see the true nature of your scalp . <p> People always say we produce plenty but it does not go down our strands . While I do believe this is true for some , I do n't believe that it is true for most . If it was so , most of us would have very oily scalps . If that was true , it would not be general practice to grease your scalp because it is dry . This practice started long before relaxers and the numerous things people do to their hair . <p> If i did n't know any better i would say that i do n't produce ANY or very little . My hair and scalp are always lacking moisture and is never greasy unless i supplement with oils . But than again i am a certified type 4b . <p> what she said . Most of " us " do not produce enough oil to lubricate our hair , contrary to this myth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strand . Take it from someone who shampoos hair for living . <p> I had this exact same question but i was to shy I guess to post it . Do you think we produce as much sebum as white people ? My DH 's hair gets super oily ( and stringy ) if it 's been a long day ... like someone poored baby oil on his head . *I know that 's not nice but I 've told him this so I do n't feel bad. * I have a very oily face but I never feel like my hair is oily . I notice other white people get the stringy oily hair if they do n't wash their hair frequently . Why is that ? <p> NEVERMIND . I should have read the entire thread , you already answered my questions ! <p> My face gets very oily , too . If I do n't use an oil-absorbent face wash , I often have to wash my face during the day or use oil-absorbent blotting cloths . My hair never gets like that . <p> About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I have spent most of my life straightening my hair . 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Well , for some people , it 's not always the case that they have oily skin and scalp . My scalp became very oily once I stopped using shampoos with sulfates ; before that , it would be itchy and flake badly . As for straightening the hair , for many black women ( especially those of us with type 4 hair ) straightening it does not mean it acts like straight non-kinky hair . Even when I relax it bone straight , it is still very porous and dry , so my natural sebum will have trouble traveling down my shaft to the root ( it gets absorbed in the first couple of inches ) unless I moisturize and seal the hair properly . Kinky hair was designed by nature to be worn shrunken and close to the head or picked out in a halo ( to allow for proper airflow and cooling of the scalp in the typically hot African weather ) , and so the qualities that make it great for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without assistance ) are not conducive to the other styles modern black women opt for these days . We just have to understand and work around it . <p> I produce too much ... Even before my scalp issue ... My mom used grease thinking my scalp was dry it was really built up sebum and grease was making me flake . Now I agree it ca n't travel down for me its not a myth when straight I can go a week or 2 and not shampoo just brush and my hair is great but natural no way it has to be washed because it will build on my scalp because it ca n't slide down . I also agree its genetics . I get oily scalp from my dad . I wash every 3-5 days in warm months . Now massaging your scalp with fingers only or a little oil should help you produce more sebum . <p> Yes we produce sebum . That is why I have n't needed to oil my scalp since 1980 and my scalp is never dry . Also because I baggy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used a leave-in for years . The GHE helps sebum spread to the hair as it evaporates and then gets trapped and condenses back on the hair . <p> I do believe that if we smother our skin with products , we stop it behaving normally . Before 1980 , my scalp would itch something awful if I did n't " grease " my scalp . I would get dandruff and I was sure I could not live w/o applying something to my scalp . But then I was dared by a teacher to not apply anything . I itched for a day or so and then nothing . I 've never looked back . I use shampoo twice a week and my hair and scalp do n't feel dry . <p> The same thing happened with my skin . I used to have dry combination skin . If I washed my face , it felt tight in the dry spots and I 'd have to moisturize or I 'd itch like mad . I stopped using water-based moisturizer and even go bare ( all over sometimes ) and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face I only use a sunblock that has no water on it . On my body , in the winter I use coconut oil . In the summer I go bare . My skin does n't look dry at all . <p> So you may find going bare scalp and maybe adding the GHE allows your scalp to normalize and your sebum production to become optimum . A diet that includes healthy oils ( EFAs ) and water also helps with the moisturizing of skin including scalp . 
@@22470534 @2470534/ <p> For my net weave i let the hairdresser cut it out . As for combing you can saturate your hair with conditioner and some oil put on a processing cap so that in can have time to penetrate and then comb through your hair . <p> As far as the net , I would either get someone that I REALLY trust to cut it out or go back to the stylist . <p> Most of the time with my sew-ins , I would saturate my braids with some type of oil after removing the weave and let it sit for a bit . That way when I take the braids down and detangle with a wide tooth comb , there would be minimal breakage or totally unnecessary shedding . <p> I would remove as much thread , dirt and whatever from the braid removal before washing .

Good luck ! <p> I concur w/the ladies . 1 . Have someone you trust take down your weave . 2 . Detangle your hair w/ a wide tooth comb or a shower comb . If it 's really dry ( which it should n't be if you moisturised daily during the weave ) then lightly put a detangler in your hair , then detangle your hair fully . 3. once it 's fully detangled , shampoo your hair .

I love to wear my hair straight and am wondering if I can continue to do this without having major breaking Most of the ladies I see that are doing transitions are doing a ps , I simply want to prepoo every 10 days , wash , deep condition , roller set and flat iron my new growth then wear my hair in a pony or bun until I wash again ... I 'm already 14 weeks post textlax and do n't have trouble stretching so I figured I could cut a little every month to maintain my length until my textlaxed ends are gone in about 2 years lol If anyone has any tips , or comments or can point me in the direction of a hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would really appreciate it = ) 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Check out kikicouture10 on you tube . She documented her entire journey on transitioning . <p> HairQueen thanks for the suggestion , I already apply my deep condition like that but is there a specific reason your using the keracare pressing cream ? I was just using chi heat protectant ? And that sounds great ! Transitioning buddies = ) <p> Hi <p> I wanted a good quality product that would keep my hair from reverting whilst wearing a straight press so I thought I would try the keracare pressing creme . I love the keracare line anyway having used many of their other products so I thought it would n't hurt to try . <p> So far I love it but I am still experimenting with this whole natural thing - I 'm only 7 months into my transititon and have not yet been wearing my hair straight on a regular basis . For that past 7 months I have been wearing half weaves and phony pony 's and have just taken out some braids I wore for a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start wearing straight hair whilst transitioning so I will be keeping an eye on this thread for tips from others ! <p> I flat ironed during my transition and the key to avoid heat damage was to make sure my hair was infused with moisture before flat ironing . Wen products help me make it to 15 months post before the BC . <p> @BostonMaria do you have any tips ? How was roller setting once you get to 6months+ ? Why did you bc at 10 months ? Did you experience breakage where your relaxed and natural hair met ? Eta : also do you still flat iron your hair regularly ? 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Sorry I did n't respond sooner <p> Once I got to the 6 month+ mark I have to admit it was a bit more challenging to detangle my hair . The two textures ( especially the relaxed part ) was a pain in the butt . I would make sure to deep condition for 1 hour minimum , make sure I detangled with a wide tooth comb , then I would use a rattail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once my hair was dry I would use a heat protectant spray before flatironing . I was able to hide the two textures easily once I did this . Otherwise it was just a hot mess on my head <p> Actually this is the same process I use now when I straighten my hair . The only difference is I was more delicate with the 2 textures because I did n't want to mess up my natural hair . So my advice to you is buy a deep conditioner with lots of slip . If your hair is dry like mine , then try adding olive oil or coconut oil ( or both ) in the DC . <p> I did n't experience any breakage , split ends , nothing . I was amazed at how nicely my hair grew out . I did get a nice trim prior to transitioning so that helped . <p> Yes I flatiron my hair regularly . I DC , rollerset , flatiron at least 2x a month in the winter . In the summer not as much because my hair reverts quickly so its not worth it . 
@@22470545 @2470545/ <p> This time last year I was full APL ( just shy of BSB ) and I am about an inch shy of WL now . I get about the average growth per year . However , I have a really long neck so APL on me is longer than it seems to be on others that I seen . There is also quite a bit of space between APL and BSL so at full APL when the majority of my hair is actually grazing the top of my bra strap my hair looks really long . The flip side to that though is that I am high waisted so the distance between BSL and WL on me is relatively short . BSL on me is pretty much the same as MBL , and WL is only a few inches ( about 3 ) past that .

Finger comb but do use a comb occasionally to remove shed hairs and to stretch the hair a bit 13 . Use moisturizer and oil/grease on my ends daily 14 . Use a silk or satin scarf nightly and when I am going out into the hot sun 15 . Once I wash my hair I do light flat twists using olive oil when it dries within five hours or so , I then use my fingers to stretch my hair and then do my cornrows but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will redo my cornrows twice a week but I do not do them tight . My hair texture is fine , dense and frizzy so they always look like my hair is n't even braided which means I can brush the front nicely . In doing my hair twice a week only I am not doing over manipulation to my hair . <p> I was doing water only before , the method helped me a lot but if you have fine hair you must do your protein treatments to prevent limp hydra fatigued hair . Washing once a week works for me and my schedule but I make that wash day count . <p> I was in love with my hair when I bc . I transitioned for a while so bc left me with 4 inches of hair . It started with finding lhcf and learning about cowashing which I did daily or every few days . And moisturizing and sealing . After I m/s I put about 4-6 Bantu knots and tie with silk scarf . Take out next day to moisturized , loose curls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My hair would look dry if I slept in an wash n go style . For my hair , the only way to wake up to moisturized healthy looking hair , I must stretch protective style the night before . <p> When I went natural over 5 years ago , I cut it to only a few inches . I had hand in hair disease for sure lol , but I found that moisture was so important , I would co-wash about every few days or when it got dry ; and because my hair is thick and sorta course in areas , I used castor oil mixed with olive oil to moisturize . ( So the castor oil challenge may be a great idea ) I only did it at night because the oils was slightly heavy , but then after using a silk scarf overnight , my hair was the perfect balance by morning . ( I did n't use too much to saturate pillows lol , my hair would drink the stuff ) . <p> As it grew , I would put it in twists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid manipulation . I remember I was at shoulder length in an year ( did a couple of trims ) and I believe it was because of the low manipulation .

@@22470550 @2470550/ <p> Is it due to not detangling hair ? If so is it better to detangle while hair is dry or wet . I 'm hearing both . Some say wet because that 's when it has slip and some says no wet because that makes breakage . For me it 's easier while wet but I do get more breakage from it . <p> Ca n't answer what causes the hair 2 dread . I would think it would be product buildup or its dirty but I dk . As far as detangling I would also think if you are detangling hair while wet as long as you have conditioner in it then it should n't cause breakage . I would never detangle dry bc you would totally rip your hair out but again these are my opinions ! HTH <p> For my hair what seems to cause my hair to dred/matt is allowing shed hairs to remain in the hair too long . This varies from person to person . In my hair 's curly state , the shed hairs begin to wrap around the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a weeks period these hairs have started to take over . <p> I do n't detangle really which means I do n't use a comb and I also rarely rake my fingers through my hair . I take sections of my hair and slide it through my hands or fingers and the shed hairs come out . I do this on either wet or dry hair . On dry hair I am usually retwisting my hair so I remove them then . But I will also do it on wet hair while I am in the shower . <p> I saturate my hair with creamy DC then detangle no water just conditioner . once it 's detangles I section my hair into 9 braids three on each side 3 down the middle then I rinse it out while it 's in the braids . I let it either airdry or I sit under the dry to let it dry while still in the braids and once it 's dry it is stretched and tangle free . <p> I have dreads . All hair will dread eventually if you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dreads are nothing but tangled mats of hair . <p> Movement causes dreads. when the hair moves around , it tangles . When you wet it , it stretches it out , but then , especially curly kinky hair , it will then start to shrink up as it dries , if you leave it to do what it does . the shrinking up causes tangles and mats , the beginnings of dreads. constant wetting and drying wetting and drying and never combing makes for dreads . That 's why it 's good to wash your hair/wet your hair regularly when you 're growing dreads , because it makes it dread up faster . <p> depending on your hair texture , you can get dreads faster with less effort than other hair textures . so some people will wash their hair and get " dreading " faster than some other people . <p> summerof1990 Hey , I wanted to suggest using Aloe juice to help your hair . My hair liked to dred for some reason and I am stretching while finding a stylist so it exacerbates the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from using the recipe in this thread : <p> For me its shed hair not being thoroughly removed . Its wraps around the other hairs and causes a knot . Then it will eventually caused dreads . If I leave my hair braided up for more than 3 weeks it will start to dread . <p> My relaxed hair would dread when it was n't getting enough protein . It would stick together in clumps after I washed it . It was one of the most frustrating parts of having a relaxer for me . <p> As a new natural , my hair dreads when I do n't remove shed hair , I see this is very common . For a few days I was cowashing and not even combing my hair , manipulating my hair with my fingers , air drying , and wearing a wig . After a few days I felt sections of my hair beginning to get friendly with each other . Now I make sure to detangle with lots of conditioner during every cowash. 
@@22470551 @2470551/ <p> I 'm interested in getting a full head weave . What do you ladies do to your hair before a sew-in besides wash and condition . For example do you deep condition , use protein treatments , leave-in conditioner , oils , cremes or leave your hair bare ? ? ? I want my hair to be soft and moisturized under my weave without buildup . I 'm also afraid that my hair may dread . Any suggestions would be appreciated ... thanks ! ! ! <p> All I normally do is wash and deep condition . Depending on how my hair feels after that I MAY use a watery leave-in but that 's usually it . If you think you 're prone to breakage then maybe you could do a light protein treatment . Depending on how your scalp is you can apply a light oil so that it does n't seep out into the extensions making them greasy . You 'll only have a problem with dreading if you leave the install in for too long . When I wore installs I 'd wear them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 2 break then put it back in . I always installed with a net so that the tracks did n't put stress on my hair and I used a polyester type silk thread ( they sell it at Sally 's ) instead of the regular cotton thread because it did n't swell when wet and it did n't snag my hair . When I wear my u-parts I take my hair down every 2 weeks and do a good wash and condition , but in between the 2 weeks I just cowash my hair . <p> If needed , trim your ends if they are damaged before you get your weave . Make sure your hair is not braided too tightly .... And if possible you should leave your edges out some so they wo n't get thin while you have your weave in . <p> I love full head weaves for hair growth ! I live in what I consider a super sized steam room , so I have n't had one recently ... However , when I did , I would engage in a full on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I shampoo , protein ( I usually do a light protein , as heavy proteins require too much work to return the balance back to my hair ) , deep condition ( like I am about to go to visit an old friend in hell and do n't want the flames to sear my tresses ) , regular condition and moisturize ( I always air dry ) . <p> For moisture , it is done over 1- 2 days . I usually rinse out my conditioner , then spray with the Aveeno liquid leave in ( My hair must be wet , and I run my fingers down the length of it to smooth the cuticle ) . I then get some creamy leave in , apply that , and seal with something heavier ( and less slippery ) than an oil . I put my hair in plaits , and take them down the next day to check to see how they ' feel ' . Depending on a variety of things ( whether I have been diving/swimming/drinking sufficient water/out in the sun all day/sleeping well/wearing my hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add more moisture , or co-wash and use something different . <p> I also second ( third or whatever number I am ! ) other who say do n't let them braid too tight . Also , I always use a net ( even though people often think it is only for those that have problem areas ) to distribute the weight and stress evenly . I also always have the stylist use additional hair to braid mine ( even though mine is long enough ) , but the skill level of the stylist might dictate whether you want to do this ( if they are n't good , it could look bulky ) . <p> i usually do a protein treatment and deep conditioner the week before since i wo n't have access to my hair for a few weeks . <p> i also take tylenol right before the appointment . my stylist DOES NOT braid my hair tight , but i am very tender headed and all that manipulation - blow drying , moisturizing , braiding , sewing gives me a headache . it usually takes 4 hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time she 's done i 'm hungry , evil and have a headache . LOL <p> ALSO , make sure to wash and condition the hair by diluting your shampoo and conditioning products in an applicator bottle with water . use these mixtures to squirt into the braids under the weave to keep your hair clean and conditioned while it is weaved up . please make sure you do n't ignore your own hair while in the weave . <p> I clarify , do a light protein treatment and a deep condition . I blowdry my hair and also heavily moisturize plus seal my hair ( they usually do n't like it but I do n't give a **** about it ) . The same steps I do before my sew-ins is the same as for my take down ( except fot the blowdrying ) . <p> If needed , trim your ends if they are damaged before you get your weave . Make sure your hair is not braided too tightly .... And if possible you should leave your edges out some so they wo n't get thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> Beforehand , I 'd just give my hair a really good wash and deep condition . Do n't make your hair too greasy . You want your leave out to be airy and flowy when it 's flat ironed and blended w/ the weave .

My advice is to use a few drops . Really do n't even change the color of the water . Like put a drop so if you tasted the water the sourness would be very slight . Even the slightest acidity is better than none . <p> Alternatively , since your hair sounds porous ( that 's why it absorbs color fast--cuticle open to soak it in ) and that 's why it dries fast ( cuticle open to release moisture ) ... you should probably consider Roux Porosity Control . You might find with it you do n't need ACV . Another thing to consider is using a filter &amp; softener in your shower or using distilled water for your final rinse . Hardness in water can make it alkaline which would cause your hair cuticle to open more . So after using Roux PC , you do n't want then to rinse with a product that could undo its benefits . So distilled water might be a good thing to use . <p> SND411 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water if I am doing my math right ( I use 1/4 cup to 2 gallons of water . There are 16 cups to a gallon .

In terms of ratios , 1/4 cup to 2 gallons is 1/4 cup to 32 cups which if I 'm working this out right is 1 part ACV to 128 parts water . <p> As you can see , I go very dilute which is why I have no problem with doing this twice a week every week ... and even in between if I feel like spritzing my hair . <p> About a year ago I had serious problems retaining moisture and it was n't until I read one of your posts , Nonie , that I started adding drops of ACV in my leave ins until my hair returned to normal THANK YOU ! <p> Well I have scalp issues as I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youtuber about acv rinses ...

If my hair did n't have internal moisture locked in after conditioning , then sebum would be all the moisture baggying would be providing which I doubt would leave my hair feeling as good as it does .

I do cut mine in half but my hair is still on the short side . <p> Not sure if this helps but whether twists or braids , I do n't think you should use more hair than your own hair 's pony tail would make otherwise it just look so obviously " extra " . More than 2 packs IMO is would be too much for me , especially if folding the hair like Mook 's Hair does . Even when using human hair , whose packs are smaller than synthetic , I use a little more than one pack--and I have fine strands--but I do fold ... so I suppose that makes a difference . 2 packs is what was used on my hair when I had kinky twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braids done at the salon in Kenya ... which is how the number 2 became my guide . <p> ETA : 2.5 packs may be enough as before , OP . But like faithVA said , you can take back what is n't used . If your stylist has you divide the hair as she 's twisting , you wo n't waste a lot of the hair so may just use the same as before . <p> If you are not doing them long I could n't imagine you using more than 3 packs . I ALWAYS do long kinky twists and I use no more than 6 packs at full length which is a little past waist length on me . So if you want it to be half the length it would only be 3 . <p> It depends on the braider . I have been wearing Kinky Twists for years now and I have been to 3 people ... One uses 6+ , the second ( a stylist in some LA shop ) used 1.5 ( and I HATED it ) and the last person ( my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Honestly , the braiders technique combined with the size and desired length of the twists and your actual hair length and density . <p> Take what she asks for , but make sure you let her know what you want ( I am not a fan of heavy hair ... but everyone is different ) 
@@22470555 @2470555/ <p> Over a year ago the Lord revealed my " future husband " to me ; I did n't give the intel too much of a second thought . About a month ago he brought that intel back to my rememberance ; I acknowledged it , but decided against saying anything about it to anyone . Surprisingly , later that week someone provided confirmation ( unbeknowst to them ) that this gentleman would be my husband &amp; also addressed concerns I had regarding being with him that I 'd only expressed to the Lord . <p> Although the confirmation was exciting , I 'm at a loss for what to do with the information now &amp; it 's starting to make me a little uncomfortable . <p> This man is a good friend , we work in ministry together , I love him in Christ , but I do n't really see us together in a romantic sense &amp; being around him is starting to spurn anxiety . Knowing &amp; not knowing ( as some prophecies are conditional upon free will &amp; such ) is bugging me . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no idea how to proceed . Part of me wants to run &amp; refute the word , the pther part of me wants to become sappy &amp; attached . <p> Next time someone tells me they 've been given a word for me , but I 'm not ready to receive it I will take their word for it . <p> I would say continue to pray and seek God 's will about the situation and then wait . . . <p> Journal about what you think God is saying to you . Over the summer I heard some " crazy " things that I thought was coming from God . I just wrote them down and kept right on moving . Occasionally they come back to my mind but I do n't dwellon them . If it was truly from God , them it will happen . Period . Sometimes God will talk to us about a future promise and then make us wait for a long time ( hello Abraham ? ! ? ! ) . You wo n't know until he approaches you or ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're hearing your own voice . The fact that you do n't see this guy like that makes me think it 's less likely coming from you ( i.e. you saw this man and decided he would be the one ) but it 's still possible . . . <p> If it is truly God 's voice , then He will also reveal it to the man . The beautiful thing is you do n't have to do anything . Do n't approach him . Do n't ask him out . Do n't ask him if he heard from God about you . Like you said , " chill . " Only time will tell if it really was from God . One more thing : keep this revelation to yourself and fight the urge to share it . Be like Mary and " ponder it in your heart . " Good luck and God bless ! <p> Incredible ! Take one day at a time . Do n't see him as the future wedding date . Do n't think about how he does n't give you the gushy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Just get to know him but do n't push . Just keep doing what you are doing in your ministry . G-d can take it there . <p> There were at least two other women and a hopeful mother in law that claimed God showed them my husband was " their " husband . One mother went out and purchased a ring and gave it to him ... hoping he would give it to their daughter . <p> Continue about The Lord 's business ... if it truly was a word from him no further action will be needed on your end . <p> I would say continue to pray and seek God 's will about the situation and then wait . . . 8146 @qwx208146 <p> After posting this thread I could no longer ignore the fact that this situation is really bugging me so I went into prayer about it &amp; God gave me peace .

Has he ever expressed romantic interest ( subtle or not so subtle ) in the past ? 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Him &amp; I are good friends &amp;&amp; he treats me as such . He has expressed interest in subtle ways in the past ( moreso recently ) , but I 've never read much into his comments/questions , behaviors or body language ; I 've taken most things people would label as flirting as friendliness because I was n't checking for him , did n't think he was checking for me &amp; assumed that since he 's generally open about many other things that he 'd just spill the beans if he wanted to pursue me . <p> There were at least two other women and a hopeful mother in law that claimed God showed them my husband was " their " husband . *One mother went out and purchased a ring and gave it to him ... hoping he would give it to their daughter . <p> Continue about The Lord 's business ... if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be needed on your end . 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Thank you . Feeling the need to act is purely the result of my uncertainty ; I 've never been in this spot before so I was wondering if there was a certain response pattern I should have adapted &amp; then in knowing I was n't to chase , pursue or drop hints I was terribly confused as to why God would tell me this then &amp; bring it back now . <p> I 'm working on making a mental note of the prophecy ( + confirmation ) &amp; moving on ; there 's no need to fret over something I ca n't control . Prayerfully it gets easier soon . <p> Just wait , but do n't let other people 's bad experiences cause you to write it off - God does speak regarding our future spouses .

As the Bishop prophesied he began speaking about this man 's future wife &amp; all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a check in my spirit , but I brushed it off &amp; started thinking up all the women it could be &amp; then just as plain as day the Holy Spirit said no , it 's you . <p> Now at the time , me &amp; this fellow had a hi &amp; bye type of relationship so despite knowing what I heard I ignored it . <p> Fast forward to a month ago , this guy is one of my best friends . The Holy Spirit brings back to my remembrance the first time he told me this man would be my husband &amp; tells me again ; despite how we went from being barely acquaintances to busom buddies I still brushed it off , because of a bunch ot things ( ex : being afraid of dating someone from my church because if things do n't work it could cause awkwardness , etc ) . <p> Fast forward a week &amp; I find myself in an unexpected conversation within which I 'm being told by a loved one that the personage of my husband has been revealed to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course I prod &amp; lo &amp; behold it 's him . Then they go on to dispel all the concerns I had about even potentially having a future with him &amp; the ONLY person I went to with thosee concerns was the Lord . <p> I know that was semi-longwinded , but I figured I 'd share my experience then express that if you want to know something that only the Lord knows , ask him ( Matthew 7:7-8 ) then be careful to listen for the answer . Once you receive your answer make sure it lines up with the word of God . ( ex : If you 're asking the Lord who your husband is &amp; you believe the Lord says BillyBob is to be your husband , but BillyBob is happily married to SallyAnn , you may want to reconsider the source ) . If the answer lines up with the Bible then wait for the manifestation &amp; do n't grow weary . Also , if two or three people come &amp; give you a word that lines up with or is the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God for it , but other than that you ca n't force it to come . <p> I 'm so sorry for you loss , but I 'm ever so grateful that you 're able to share your story &amp; that you recognize God 's purpose behind your circumstances . I pray that God keeps the eyes &amp; ears or your understanding open so as he sends you signs &amp; dreams &amp; visions you 're well aware on how &amp; when to move as well as when to be still . I pray that he heals your heart from any pain or frustration that would try to creep in &amp; that as you focus on him , do his work &amp; remain in his will that he blesses you greatly for your obedience . I pray that his desires for you become your desires &amp; you receive all that he has for you in life &amp; in your mate . &amp; it is so , in Jesus name , Amen . 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Thank you so very much .

Easily . <p> Also , it sheds at the bottom alot , I 'll see alittle bit of hairs , pull it , and alot will come out- ( So i had just start cutting the hairs I saw instead of pulling , but its still a mess IMO ) <p> So I need to know what are people doing to keep the knot tight ?

I double tie the hair after lopping it through my cornrow , then I take a small strand from the piece I just lopped through and create a knot under where I have tied the hair . It 's hard to explain but the African 's up in Harlem do it all the time when you have braids that have hair out to secure it . Maybe someone has a Youtube vid of that or can better explain the method . <p> 2 . To minimize shedding , I try to not play with the hair too much . If I see some frizzed out looking hair or towards my ends , I just trim or cut off that piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try the witch hazel to see if that works . Apparently you put witch hazel on a cotton ball and rub it inbetween the braids on your scalp and it cleanses your scalp . Sounds a lot easier then washing with all this DIANA ROSS hair I got up in here <p> 4 . At night I use an XL satin bonnet . I just gather it into a ponytail , twist it once so the hair ends are toward my forehead and them slip the bonnet on with one hand . Every other day , I spray the hair down with Bonfi Oil Free Wig Spray . I say every other day becuase I want to minimize the amount of product buildup on the hair . <p> 5 . How long is your hair ?

I do think though to use a long length , you do n't want too much weight on your head . When I do extensions , I fold the additional hair in half so I need the hair to extend at least 2-4 inches longer than my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary to fold hair in half so I suppose as long as you can get hair that is several inches longer than your own , you can do just a small fold up top . Only thing with not folding hair fully in half is the base of the twist where the doubling is occurring will be thicker than the rest where it 's not . It 's not really noticeable with micros though . <p> But if getting micros , whether twists or braids , make sure you attach less extension hair per section of your own . Not a chunk of extension hair to two strands of your own . That 's what will determine whether micros make ( your hair grow ) or break your hair .

I think it 's how you apply it and also I believe that if you use it along with other products , you will not get the adhesion that would protect the hair as well ... plus those products that are not meant for use with heat will burn and add to the smell . <p> Before April 2009 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any noticeable heat damage . But in April 2009 , I took precautions and decided to use heat protectants for the first time ever , and that was the first time ever not to have that smell . I do n't know if it was the combo of products or just my meticulous application but I do think not using anything else helped . <p> After shampooing , I conditioned with CHI Intra Treatment Thermal Protecting Treatment . After rinsing out ( including an ACV rinse ) I airdried in Curlformers to stretch my hair . I do not use any moisturizer after the wash because I try to get my moisture during the conditioning . <p> I then used John Frieda Heat Defeat Spray on each dry Curlformer section at a time ( the sections were so narrow BTW , that I used 80 or so CFs ! ) : I would spray a narrow section till it was wet , pass the iron over it once ... then move on to another and repeat ... till all sections were done . By letting my hair dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to ensure that the Heat Defeat Spray was the only thing making my hair wet . Meaning if every inch I was working on was wet , then it was well covered by the protectant . <p> Next applied John Frieda Thermal Protection Serum on narrow sections again meticulously--the idea was to use ENOUGH not a lot , but to ensure every inch of my hair was covered . I then passed the iron over it ONCE before doing the same to another narrow section till all were done . <p> No burnt hair smell at all during the press , or after or even a week later when I wet my hair to wash it . <p> Conclusion : heat protectants do indeed work and I 'll never flatiron without them ! Also I think not using anything else but them ensured nothing else got cooked by the iron so nothing would have a burned smell--which I think is part of the smell you get . Also making sure the hair was well covered prevented the iron from coming into direct contact with my hair and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What if the flat-iron itself has a smell ?

I always clean my iron so even when I used to get the burned smell , my iron would be cleaned so well it 'd not have the smell on it . I am sure there 's a " proper way " to do this , but I just used whatever soap or cloth/sponge I had handy ... till the flatiron was clean and free of smells . I never stored it with a smell on it . In fact , the iron I used in April 2009 is the same one I always used when I used to get the smell .

@@22470563 @2470563/ <p> I 'm currently in cornrows and I 'm hoping they will last for 4 weeks . When I was a natural , I would n't last 2 weeks because of fuzzy overload . I am now permed and ive had my cornrows for exactly 1 week ... I wonder how long its gon na take for the fuzzies to appear .... <p> Cornrows can be just as damaging as anything else . The last time I had cornrows I was maybe 3 months post relaxer and had them installed with synthetic ( kanekalon ) hair . I left them in for probably 3 weeks and had major breakage . People tend to think that the only damage comes from the pulling on your edges and nape , while that could be an issue if they 're very tight , it 's not the only issue . The synthetic hair does not agree with my hair , it basically slices right through my own hair . Just something you should be aware of before you get them done . I knew this was true from younger experiences with synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be true for cornrows . I personally ca n't have it done . I could get cornrows with human hair extensions , while that may not last as long and is more expensive , it is another option . <p> My hair is natural and I had Ghana braids in for 5 weeks . I scarfed my hair down every night and moisturized daily . When it was time to take them down , I did a hot oil treatment with the braids still in before I took them down . My hair had no breakage and I saw little shedding . I will say I was very anal with the braider and was very clear on what I wanted her to do ( no tight braids , do n't hold my edges , etc ) . I ca n't do single braids because it just does n't agree with my fine hair , but the cornrows were just fine . <p> I 'm natural and my hair is fuzzy by default so I have never worn them over 2 weeks . I would never get them as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them somewhere just past shoulder . I did n't get breakage and no problem with my edges . But I do have a hard time keeping moisture in my hair with extensions in . <p> The cornrows in the pic look really pretty however , they look to be very harsh on the hairline because they seem to be braided too tight IMO . I wear cornrows sometime but I do them myself and when they start to get fuzzy I add a very small amount of gel and wrap with a scarf . Works great and I was able to wear them for about a month . I did not add extensions though . <p> I used Shea Moisture curl and style milk because that 's what I had and alternated between that and plain water . Then I 'd seal with whatever oil I had on hand . I would use a soft-bristle brush after applying the moisturizer and then tie down with a scarf every night . <p> I agree with the other ladies . This style can be harsh on your edges . You may want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " friendly . As for moisture , try Scurl ( white &amp; blue bottle ) , its easy to use and basically has no smell . Keep in mind synthetic hair can pull moisture from your hair so you may have to moisturize at least daily especially in the winter . <p> Cornrows done with my own hair can last 3 months maybe even 4 with weekly washes . When I do cornrows though , its typically just as a foundation for a protective style like crochet braids and are n't meant to be seen . My braids underneath get very frizzy but my hair is still detangled and moisturized , they just do n't look very pretty . I have no issues with my hair when I take them down and it helps my hair thrive . I feel cornrows are healthiest when done with ones own hair . 
@@22470564 @2470564/ <p> Soo I know most people scream and run away at the sight or thought of the classic ole hair bonding glue , but I saw the most interesting thing that made me want to post this thread ..... so on to explaining . A friend of mine had cut her hair into the very short crop cut ( tapered in the back ) about 7 months ago and she hated it , so she started wearing weaves til it grew back . Well her hair is about neck length now and over this past weekend I went with her to her hair appointment and I noticed the stylist was giving her the classic invisible part weave but she molded her hair down and started gluing the tracks down . So when we left I asked her about it and she said that that 's what her stylist has been doing since she first started getting weaves . She said that it stays in for a good 3 weeks , and when it 's time to take it out her stylist uses some kind of organic shampoo ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slips right out as she combs her hair while shampooing , and she has n't had any problems as far as serious breakage or hair getting ripped out . She said that she had worse experiences with sew-ins than she does with glue and she did n't see why people hated it so much . She was n't saying that the glue promoted hair growth or anything but she found it to be easier to install and she was still getting the same results as someone wearing wigs , braids , and sew-ins . So I 'm beginning to wonder is the reason hair bonding glue so badly looked upon because we never really knew how to remove it ? I know I 've had serious breakage and shedding from sew-ins as well , but it was n't until I got better at them and knew what I was doing that I started to see better results with my real hair . What do you ladies think ? I know most of you will never go back to glue lol , but I 'm wondering is this another great protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the removal technique as down pact as we think we do ? Thoughts ? <p> When I used to get weaves my stylist used special mold that when water hit it the glue would melt it . I liked it . Overall I 'm over weaves and am determined to grow my hair without the aid of them but if I ever did weaves again I 'd probably do that before a sew-in . <p> Your friend is not removing the tracks herself . Hair is coming out with the glue . She just ca n't see it . Over time , her hair will thin out from the glue . It 's inevitable . Glue may not be the devil for everyone , but you could n't pay me to put that mess in my hair . <p> I used to glue in tracks here and there and I used the remover oil and shampoo . There would always be at least some hair sticking to the track , even if it was one strand . I stopped using it even BEFORE I found LHCF . I felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another thing is ... how is her hair being molded ? With gel ? That can cause a whole other set of problems . <p> Eta : Like LittleLuxe , I am growing my hair out without weaves or wigs . The only thing I have used is a phony pony , to get to shoulder length . <p> I used to use glue to put in pieces for thickness back in the day . I used oil and the glue remover to take mine out . I rarely lost any hair . But I have a cousin who used to rip her hair out improperly using them . I do n't see myself ever returning to glue .. especially as a natural . If I want extra thickness when I straighten I will either use sew in pieces or clip on tracks . <p> My problem is just having glue on skin .

I have n't used glue in years , but I 'm relaxed now and remembered that once I knew how to properly remove the tracks , I stopped having problems with it . My hair flourished when my stylist glued my tracks in . I took my one track out yesterday with no casualties . <p> That being said , I still probably wo n't do it again for another five years .

That way when the tracks are glued on you have a wig now and that glue is n't seeping through the stocking cap onto your hair . <p> That 's an old fashioned quick weave . I do n't think it 's strange to have hair on a bonded track . It 's likely shed hair . If you lost hair from the root that was not shed hair , trust me you 'd feel it .

So after a long battle and decision with my natural hair I have decided at this point in my life I trully need the ease of texlaxing my hair . <p> I know it wo n't be 100% easier but even if it loosens my texture a little that will have to do . Ok my question is I 'm about a 4a/4b in texture and I was wondering did any of you self texlaxers comb or stretch your hair out ( or blow dry etc .. ) prior to your texlax or did you just texlax on clean hair with no product ? If you did it either way what was your experience and would you do it differently . <p> So for my method I plan on using Mizani butter blend in fine/color treated and adding saa , Derm org argan oil and a little Lekair Cholest .

I would do it differently if I had the chance because after 6 days my scalp was itching like crazy ( it 's use to shampoo every 3-4 days ) but I could n't scratch for fear of irritating my scalp before the relaxer ) . I 'd probably shampoo 3-4 beforehand , not 6 . <p> As for the protein ahead of time , I did a treatment that same day I shampooed so 6 days ahead . Also , the reconstructor/protein treatment I used after was very helpful . The phyto comes with this " Milky restructurer " that was good with stopping any breakage from occuring after relaxing . I actually used that about 3 times during the week following the process . <p> I did that in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scalp . The result was a texlax simply because he ran out of time . I went to him with week old straightened hair so it would take less time to part through . <p> It takes a lot of time to work through my hair and he quickly realized that I was not going to be bone straight and he was n't going to overprocess me . It 's cook because a blowdry straightens me out just fine and I get to keep the volume . <p> He did n't do any protein treatment or whatnot until AFTER relaxer was rinsed out .

I was more than perplexed it put me on hyper alert . <p> What I may say may offended my apologizes in advance . In my viewpoint I feel like they are doing it for show . Show off how much money you have , show of oh look at Sis such and such , or like in the bible God spoke about those who would fast or pray out loud to get recognition but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm going to be real blunt . It looks like they tipping the pastor and well the only person I have tipped is a waiter and a stripper just saying . And if my eyes are good the pastor ai n't no stripper or waiter and I see no poles so I have mad issue about that .

I think people do it to show off their flesh and their so call wallet . The money is suppose to go the poor , but it does n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . My church is on TBN and they never show it happening on camera and that 's very telling . They discourage walking around during service , but do n't  stop you if you are sowing a seed at the alter . Chile please ! I could go on and on , but I 'm trying to be respectful . <p> My church does n't do this but I recently went to a revival where folks , of their own accord , came down during the sermon and placed money on the steps . The Prophet said they were sowing seeds of faith . <p> I must say that I do n't  believe that ( all ) the people were doing it for show ( and it was men and women ) ... but I 'm really not sure how I feel about this . I would not do it ... but is it wrong in and of itself ( " no tipping allowed " ) or is it wrong because of the way its being done ( distracting ) ? Would it be more acceptable to take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side ? Wait until the " Pastors anniversary " ? LOL ( only Black churches-in my experience-have this celebration and some think it honorable and others think its rediculous ) . <p> Sidenote : I do think that we should refrain from making negative assumptions about what Pastors do with the money . All pastors are not selfish crooks , not even the majority are . And if its given to them it is their business what they do with it ( whether its keeping it or giving it away ) . Pastors are the only people that we seem to put this heavy burden on to take a vow of visible poverty . And of course I am not condoning flamboyance or an abuse of money or power etc . <p> Some do it for show and some out of stuff they 've been taught . They are going off of the Book of Acts , where the people laid all things at the apostles feet and everything was distributed , so that everyone had what they needed . Most of these pastors do not use that money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes right into their pockets . Today it 's **26;243;TOOLONG , which I just can not stand . <p> My church does n't do this but I recently went to a revival where folks , of their own accord , came down during the sermon and placed money on the steps .

In my experience they take the money and it is never distributed . And these pastors were not poor , they had more money than most of the congregation . <p> Well my church does not do this , but I have seen it done before . I ca n't speak on the individuals in this situation because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from God . But I do n't  agree on the whole " sow a seed " theology that being taught today either , but that 's a different thread . <p> I am not against blessing the pastor , I believe the man that labors in the Gospel , should receive blessings , but it 's the whole " showiness " of it all .

I 'm not against blessing the pastor but it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not directing this statement at you , just saying . <p> Why not just put it in the offering or give it to the pastor personally ? God will see it regardless . <p> Great question OP . This question recently came up for me . I just left my church for this reason ( and many others ) . They practiced this ( money at the feet of the pastors ) at my church too . This was n't being done at this church when I first joined . This was a newly adopted practice and I do n't know why . When I asked about it , I got many of the same answers as above : sowing a seed , blessing the word or blessing the pastor , yada , yada , yada . It still never seemed right . I also thought it had a strip club feeling ( not that I 've ever been to one . I just heard about it . Lolololo ) I do n't think pastors should be poor and do believe in blessing the pastor ( when warranted ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , especially when there is a giant imbalance between pastors and their flocks . There is a huge problem when the pastors are driving around in a Lexxus and a Mercedes , living in a big new house with a pool and paid landscapers and half the flock is struggling , taking 3 buses to get to church or driving around with duct tape on their car to hold it together . It is a churchy practice done for show a lot ( not always ) and it is extremely distracting . Lots of times I had to force myself to focus on the message than on the people taking the money to the pulpit . At this church , there was always a birthday or an anniversary for either of the pastors where money was always requested and this was above and beyond tithing and offering . SMH <p> I know God knows the hearts of His people way more than I do . He knows who has the right motives and who does n't . I pray constantly for those He has placed to lead His people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path but I pray they remain on the narrow road , follow God 's commands and stay in His will for our sakes . We need good godly leaders who truly care for our souls . <p> Yes , I do n't see anything wrong with blessing your Pastor . If he is sacrificing his time and life for the flock , then I do n't see the problem .. but the whole laying it at his feet while he is preaching ... ummm ... to each its own I guess , I would n't do it . <p> I do n't  like when they ask for certain amounts of money either , or when they have like 2-3 different offering times ... <p> So your objection is to the " showiness " of it , not necessarily with the idea of giving the Pastor money for whatever reason ? <p> I know your question wasnt directed at me but when the folks did this at the revival , the prophet had just said something really profound ...

I self install so I can re-do the fuzzy ones . I use shampoo on them ( senegalese twists ) about once every two weeks . <p> At night I wear a satin scarf if my twists are not too long , or a satin bonnet if they happen to be longer . <p> For my hair line I massage with castor oil about 5 times a week , and I make sure the twists are not so small that they snatch out my edges . I 've gotten good retention with Senegalese twists , and i hope these tips can help you too <p> When I wore braided extensions there were a few things I did for easy/regular maintenance that did n't involve completely taking the braids down : <p> Moisturize scalp and braids by spritzing from a bottle - do n't forget the braid undersides . <p> Seal by dabbing a fingertip in oil/grease , rub together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't braid right to the absolute edge of your hair - leave a few millimeters of hair loose round the perimeter to help save your fragile edges . The hairs can be smoothed down with pomade or sth . <p> To wash the hair with the braids in , I would put the hair into a loose ponytail and get either hubby or daughter to hold the ends upright to the ceiling so that the water from the shower head only ran down down my scalp from neck to forehead and not down the hair . <p> Alternatively if I was just tidying up section-by-section I would unbraid that whole section , wash the scalp with poo applied to fingertips and then scwunch the hair with my hands to work the shampoo into it . To rinse I would rub the scalp with water as much as poss , then hold that section of hair and try and stick it under the running tap . <p> Thanks ladies , I got my twists a couple days ago , and I really like them . I think I may take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my edges are already thin . I 've been oiling the edges &amp; spraying them with braid spray . But I 'm still trying to figure out my routine . <p> If I have any products that I do n't really like I use them while in braids diluted in water , oil or aloe vera juice . If not I just use my regular products . I use something on my scalp ( right now that is castor oil , I use a braid spray , right now that is the silk dreams leave in cream mixed with aloe vera juice ) . <p> I only shampoo my scalp . I co wash the length every 2 weeks . <p> I use a scarf to tie up my braids most of the I have to use 2.

When my braids start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just take the braid out . I do n't rebraid it I just remove it ( unless I am doing back to back braid sets ) . <p> Other tips ? I braid the perimeter braids really loose . When those are tight that areas has the potential to loose the most hair . I just keep my scalp clean and the braids moist . Unwashed braids look neater , but washed hair is in better condition so the better deal in the long run . Unless you hair is short do n't cut off your ends . How long your hair is can be surprising . Always braid the full length of your hair do n't leave any out .

I do apply shampoo directly to scalp and focus on massaging it clean after wetting my head .

When I use a smaller curling iron it last longer , oh and I use no holding sprays or products so it wo n't mess up , that 's prob why ....... <p> If you 're curling with an iron , then pincurl each curl while they are still hot . Once they cool in about 10 min , remove the clips and spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , i just use flexirods the night before and when i remove them i spray some flexible hair spray on them . My curls will drop slightly during the day because i wear relaxed texture hair but nothing major . I 'm out of the house for at least 9 hrs mostly <p> Am I the only one who does n't use any product on additional hair ? While I did n't have a weave , I had human hair extensions and would curl the hair w/o any product and my curls would hold all day . This was done with a curling iron on braids--which you 'd expect to drop coz they 're heavier than loose hair , but they did n't : <p> In fact , I could 've worn the curls the next day but coz I do n't do anything to protect the style for the night and love baggying , the curls had dropped from the moisture of the baggy <p> And the do below was done with Curlformers and no heat ; just airdrying : <p> Thanks everyone ! ! ! I ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bouncy , and held all day with the help of my wand curling iron . The next day I woke and the curls dropped a bit but was still beautiful to wear again ! ! ! !

@@22470580 @2470580/ <h> Sew-iners ... do you dry your braids after a cowash ? <p> Is it ok to let the braids air dry now that it 's cold outside and they do n't dry as quickly ? I just do n't want to be doing anything that is going to make it worse when I take the sew in down . I have only had it in for a couple of weeks so it has n't been very long . I wanted to find out the answer to this question early in the process just in case I was doing something wrong . <p> I use my hooded dryer on low to medium heat to dry my braids underneath . It worked out really well for me as I took down my weave the other day and I had no matting ( AFTER thoroughly detangling ) when I washed my hair . I washed my hair EVERY week that the weave was in my hair ( 5 weeks in total ) . So you could try that ? <p> I agree with the hooded dryer because it takes a loooong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sour ( mildew ) if not fully dry , plus I do n't  want you to get sick . There are alot of sales going on for the holidays so I would suggest being on the lookout for one ; even when i go to the salon with a sew in they put me under the dryer for awhile . Otherwise do n't  wash as often and only do it when you have at least 12 hours to be in the house . Also since you have kinky hair that i 'm guessing is thick try to separate it into like four ponytails to help the air get into the braids instead of the hair blocking the drying process . <p> Well that 's the thing ... in order to style the hair , it works best if the hair is wet before putting on any products . Otherwise I ca n't define the curls and it 's just a big poofy mess ! I 'm not worried about gettin sick ... I wore my hair wet all the time in the winter and it 's never been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood ) . <p> I guess I will have to dry the braids under my bonnet dryer or with the hand held and then re-wet the length of the hair to style it . I have washed once and co-washed once and I did n't dry the braids first , and I did n't have a nasty smell or anything . The braids were wet for a long time , but there was no smell ... my SO hates bad smelling hair ! I 'm not so concerned with the smell because that does not seem to be a problem for me . I am more concerned with whether or not the constant dampness of the hair will weaken it or cause it to become unhealthy ? I use Infusium 23 leave in spray on the braids a few times a week and it seems to be doing fine . I just do n't want to take out this install in 2 months and find matted hair ! <p> It would take at least an hour for the braids to dry under a hooded dryer BIA ... ( this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have a hooded dryer either ( i 'm working on getting one ) but a great sub . is a Gold ' N Hot Professional Conditioning Heat Cap i think they are about 20 or 30 dollars ... I sit under mine for about 30-40 minutes and my braids are dry . I would n't suggest air drying either ... especially in the winter time when there 's very little moisture in the air . It will most likely dry out your actual hair ... <p> I 've always been confused about this . I thought heat was a no-no , so for all of the co-washing and shampooing/DC-ing I do , I thought it was better to just dry my weave and let the braids airdry . <p> Is it ok for me to use the hooded dryer 3 times per week to dry my braids ? 8146 @qwx208146 <p> Direct heat is a no no ( flat ironing , blow drying ... etc ) but hooded dryers are really touching your actual hair/braids ... but as far as the part that I leave out , I braided them after moisturizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let that air dry .

I thought I had to co-wash a lot in addition to my weekly shampoo and dc . <p> I only co-wash because it makes it sooo much easier to wear this kinky curly hair . How do I dry the braids and then style the hair . I use Knot today and KCCC , which you are supposed to put on soaking wet hair and then let the hair air dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I guess I 'll have to go back to the drawing board and try the drying the braids first and then re-wetting the hair without soaking the braids again . <p> I wanted to add that EXTREME direct heat is a no-no . Using a hand held dryer on cool or medium to dry your hair ( unlike using a hand held on high hot heat right on the scalp and hair ) should be ok . Just make sure that hair is dry ..... <p> This is the main reason I ca n't mess with sew-ins any more . My hair is so thick and getting pretty long , so the cornrows are very thick no matter how small I part them . It 's almost impossible to get them all the way dry without being a slave to the blowdrier . And my cornrows end up getting loose so quickly from all the jostling around to get to the scalp . <p> And I did get a sour weave that I tried to correct with vinegar ... with disasterous results <p> I wanted to add that EXTREME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dryer on cool or medium to dry your hair ( unlike using a hand held on high hot heat right on the scalp and hair ) should be ok .

I also only use the " cool " setting on my blow dryer for my leave-out . I 'll just need to remember to dry these braids !

And since I rinse bent over in the shower , that rash was not localized to my scalp but on the places that got wet while rinsing it out . <p> I have not changed relaxers in the last year and half that I have been relaxing but I did notice the rash this time .

It only processed for 15 min and it was regular strength . and the first one I had trouble with I waited 24 weeks ( which was Shea butter version ) and the second that I was still having trouble with was 8 weeks ( the olive oil version ) . <p> it 's possible that you are allergic to relaxers . My mom has had allergic reactions to 2 different kinds and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful . I remember one time my mom having such a severe reaction that her eyes watered and her face started to swell . <p> A rash is an area of irritated or swollen skin .

Maybe just something in that one . <p> I talked to some family members regarding my problem with relaxers. and it turns out that I am not the only one in the family . Apparently , other members of the family who have had the same issue and continued usage ended up major facial swelling each application . <p> So I think it would definitely be safest to say that I will go ahead and transition to natural
