I think I could do that every time now . The problem I have is a knight and a bishop . I can mate maybe 2 out of 3 or 4 tries . If I can get the king on the side of the board with my pieces close to the right position , I can run his king to the corner and mate , but getting it set up is my main problem . I will look to see if you have a video on that . <p> I 'm planning to make a video on mating with a Bishop and Knight vs . King . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishop and knight is so rare as to almost never arise in tournament games ( professional chess players may only need to use this mate once or twice in their chess careers ) . <p> I 'm planning to make a video on mating with a Bishop and Knight vs . King . Although it is instructive , the need to mate with bishop and knight is so rare as to almost never arise in tournament games ( professional chess players may only need to use this mate once or twice in their chess careers ) . <p> Then why make a video of mating with two bishops ? K+B+N vs . K is certainly not more rare than K+B+B vs . K , and mating with two bishops is certainly alot more trivial than mating with knight and bishop <p> That 's probably true . Mating with two bishops is not more rare , but it 's also much easier to explain , which is why I made the instructional video . Explaining how to mate with bishop and knight in an instructional video would be pretty difficult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured my time would be better spent working on other videos and annotating games for people . <p> That 's probably true .

K ( just the king and bishops you started with and the king he started with ) , but for K+B+N vs . K , you have four combinations ( **26;0;TOOLONG bishop plus b1/g1 knight ) . Although it 's not something you can calculate easily like that , it 's not complete nonsense either <p> Anyway I understand that mating with two bishops is easier to explain , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people than when you explain mating with bishop and knight . <p> How about learning this not for the fact that you need to know how to mate with two bishops or with a bishop and a knight , but for the fact that learning this will teach you in the most rudimentary way how the pieces cooperate with one another in every way and the fact that though they are different colors they can defend each other ( well from a king who ca n't put himself in check , but it 's still valid ) and control huge portions of the board ? Learning it in an endgame makes it all that much more valuable as you are not distracted by the other nuances of the game and learn the " bare bones " approach that can then be used in your middle game tactics and strategies and such . <p> " ... the French wages outright warfare over the entire board , calls for stronger nerves , and demands a soul that finds joy whenever the lust for battle is stoked .

I supposedly " mastered " this ending years ago and thought it would be a snap however with 60 seconds left on my clock I got flustered made a carelss move that allowed him to slip out and I eventually ended up stalemating him . So it showed me that learning something and pulling that knowledge out of the hat under pressure are two different things .

@@27600124 @1300124/ <p> There are some of you in here who say the Black Lion system is rubbish . Well , you 're entitled to your opinions ... but just for the fun of it I decided to play it as Black against Rybka . Here 's the result ... <p> Well OK- good for you ! I 'm curious as to what settings you had for Rybka ( was it playing at full 3000 ELO ) and the time control . Also , its early g4 thrust looked a bit dodgy to me . <p> First off ... the version of Rybka I have was the 2.2 Demo . Anybody can download it off their site . So ... no it 's not playing at full strength . I also was playing the engine at 6 seconds a move . <p> The early g4 is an idea recommended by the authors of the book by New in Chess publishers called The Black Lion . I 've read the insulting review on Chessvibes on the Black Lion and looked carefully at the lines the reviewer was trashing . It turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Hiarcs 9 and Shredder 8 I was able to find some interesting improvements for Black . <p> Normally the g4 lunge is only made after White castles on the queen side . I decided why not use it regardless of which side White castles ? One interesting comment I read about the Black Lion suggests it has much in common with the Sicilian Dragon Chinese variation . When I looked at the similarities between them ... I realized the g4 lunge could be a dangerous weapon as Black using the Black Lion ( Philidor/Pirc/Modern ) line . <p> It 's always a nice feeling to beat a comp for the first time ... so good for you ! <p> Got ta admit though to really disliking that Lion book . The guys who wrote it , put in very little effort in my opinion . It has a nice cover , but the paper would have been put to better use for loo roll . <p> From what I 've read , the book is a labor of love by a couple of under-2000 players from the Netherlands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 've gone through a couple of editions and now have translated it into English too . Their problem might be more a lack of chess skill than effort ... <p> I know you believe you understand what you think I just said , but you may not realize what I implied is not what you inferred . <p> Sorry Wildman , but I 've read it . It 's true that as a club player you would have a good chance of getting one of your games put in this book , or the next one ... Sad to say , I think that 's it for why the Dutch buy it , for the rest of the world I would guess hype . What NIC are doing is beyond me , even the front cover comes close to lying to you . Most of the book is a database dump based on club player games , often five minute games . You get a bit of text here and there but very little guidance . This is a lazy work by the authors . There 's another club player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as obvious a labor of love , so no , it is not lack of rating but effort . New title - The Lazy Lion . <p> Sadly I boaght this thing as a xmas prez for a freind who always plays 1 ... d6 <p> Not to have a dig at you or anything , but ehm ... I 'd change the title to ' I beat a patzer with it ' . I mean : 12 ... Ba6 or 16 ... c3 is something every decent player sees , let alone a computer . You know this is n't even close to a normal computer level . And as such , every opening is playable . Against much weaker opponents you just have to make moves untill you get your chance cause they miss some tactical idea , aka give their pieces away . <p> And seeing the beauty of the Dragon-variation , the cosmos re-aligned its stars and immortalised it . For even now , we call that constellation the Dragon constellation . <p> Not to have a dig at you or anything , but ehm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patzer with it ' . I mean : 12 ...

Against much weaker opponents you just have to make moves untill you get your chance cause they miss some tactical idea , aka give their pieces away . <p> To be fair ... I did n't realize I had lowered Rybka 's playing strength . It 's one of the only free chess engines out there that let 's you fiddle the playing ELO level . So without knowing I played it at lower levels ... I thought I had played a good game nevertheless . I guess I should have seen something wrong when Rybka allowed g4 without blocking it . <p> I 'll play Rybka at full strength and post the result ... either way regardless of the result . Should be educational . I 'm wondering if we can play chess engines in correspondence mode ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demo and it 's impressive . Almost like Chess Assistant . For some reason my copy of Chess Assistant died on my computer ... do n't know why ( I paid for the CD legally , so I 'm legit ) .

@@27600144 @1300144/ <h> Book Review : Elements of Chess Strategy , Alexei Kosikov <p> It 's so nice to see something different . These days the chess publishing formula seems to be 75% opening manuals , 10% endgame guides , 10% game collections and odds and ends , and 5% experimental books like Rowson 's fantastic The Seven Deadly Chess Sins . Kosikov 's Elements of Chess Strategy falls into this all too marginal category . Elements is a guide for forming a chess plan in the Jeremy Silman ( How to Reassess Your Chess ) or Jonathan Tisdall ( Improve Your Chess Now ! ) vein . Kosikov strikes a nice balance between overall planning advice and useful strategy nuggets on topics like passed pawns or the principle of two weaknesses . <p> One thing that I especially like is that Kosikov 's guide is very practical . Starting on page 109 , for example , he discusses the concept of " serial errors . " Since I 'm writing this review a day after being in this situation I found it especially relevant . How many times have we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake moments later that allows equality and then a further mistake that costs us the game . The tables can turn so quickly in chess ! But Kosikov reminds us : " do n't castigate yourself ! " and " start again from the beginning !

Now I 'm a lazy reader so I found myself skipping straight to the solutions ( misses the point I suppose ) , but if you 're looking to improve , this is going to be great . I enjoyed them if only because I was a glutton for the kinds of problems presented in Silman 's How to Reassess Your Chess Workbook and the problems here are very similar . <p> Despite my perpetual delusion that the newest opening manual will finally get me my master title , I 've only ever used two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middlegame planning books .

@@27600147 @1300147/ <h> Improve your Chess with Tactics Training <p> " Chess is 99 percent tactics . " - Teichmann <p> As a developing scholastic chess player , I was always fascinated with opening theory . If I could just learn the right line against the exchange Ruy Lopez or memorize just a few moves more of Grunfeld theory , I would reach 2000 USCF . My view was not unique , and it never ceases to amaze me how much beginning chess players spend on opening books . Chess trainers , who see many beginner games , know this is a waste of money . Some have suggested that a player has no need to study openings below the expert level . My view is even more radical . Buying and even occasionally reading opening books may be fun , but unless you 're approaching 2200 fide , your time is better spent studying tactics . <p> While opening books may only be good for the first dozen or so moves you memorize , you can reap the benefits of tactical training in every phase of the game . Tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king ; the vast majority of long-term positional advantages are gained tactically . I 've had games where I had been outplayed positionally from the start of the game , but because I hunkered down and waited for a tactical opportunity , I managed to draw or even win . <p> The nice thing about tactics training is that it does not require opening books or expensive chess coaches . Learning chess tactics does not even need to be time consuming . Do not get me wrong , dramatically improving your tactical ability is grueling work , but even 30 minutes of tactics training a day can keep your chess skills honed . So next time you 're waiting in the doctor 's office , or sitting on the subway , do n't puzzle over a crossword or waste your time on a Sudoku puzzle , solve some chess problems . <p> Tactics training is all about solving chess problems , and lots of them . I 'll discuss various sources of these problems , but the important point is that tactics training revolves around one activity-doing chess problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve a problem within a minute or two , look up the answer and move on . But , make sure to look at the problem again in a couple days ; repetition helps . The point of solving these puzzles is to build pattern recognition . You 're unlikely to see any of the positions you study in a tournament game , but once you 've solved one- to two-hundred problems involving back-rank mate or clearance sacrifices , you 'll quickly recognize those possibilities in your games . <p> There are many different sources for chess puzzles , both online and in print . I prefer using tactics books and I 've primarily used Anatoly Lein 's Sharpen Your Tactics ! and John Hall 's Endgame Challenge . Other quality tactics training books include Combination Challenge ! And 1001 Chess Sacrifices and Combinations . Another great book , and one that focuses on the endgame is Van Perlo 's Endgame Tactics . I enjoy using books because I can take them wherever I go ; if I have a few extra minutes before class I open up a puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying a book that is n't on this list , look for one that arranges the puzzles either thematically or by increasing difficulty . You also want a wide range of problem difficulty . In my experience , if problems are too easy I get bored and if they 're too hard I get discouraged . <p> Another great source of tactics training is the Internet . I 've used the Internet Chess Club 's training-bot a great deal . I enjoy the interactivity . The bot has a collection of problems of increasing difficulty and it always plays the opposing side . Instead of simply visualizing the moves , I actually get to make them . The Internet Chess Club , however , is not the only source of tactics training . Although I never really got into the Chess Tactics Server , I 've heard great things about it . You can also hone your tactics by solving chess problems like the Chess-videos.com puzzle of the day . <p> Once you have your source of chess problems , the question is how many to solve or for how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to play chess actively , as few as 15 minutes a day ( every day ) kept me in decent shape . This of course , is not ideal , and at the very least for an active tournament player I would recommend 30 minutes a day . If you 're looking for serious improvement , however , I suggest an hour or 100 problems per day , whichever is shorter . Make this a routine ; tactics training should be a habit . Also keep in mind that you want a good mix of problems . Too many players focus on checkmate puzzles or middle-game combinations . Buy an endgame tactics book . <p> Studying chess tactics is not only one of the best ways to improve your chess but it 's also the easiest method to learn . The keys are consistency and hard work . Perhaps that 's why many chess authors focus on churning out opening books ... there is n't that much that can be said about the real road to chess improvement-tactics training .

@@27600212 @1300212/ <p> In the endgame , the rooks come out to play . During the opening and middlegame , they usually stay home , protecting the king and avoiding the nimble knights and bishops . As a result , rooks are often the last pieces to be traded , making rook endings one of the most common types of endgames . According to GM John Emms , one in ten chess games lead to rook endings . That means that there are a lot of opportunities to save and steal half-points in these positions . To help players navigate these endgames , English Grandmater John Emms wrote The Survival Guide to Rook Endings . Emms eschews theoretically significant , but practically useless positions in favor of examples taken from real games . <p> For this review , I read Gambit Publishing 's most recent edition of Emms ' book . In the evaluation of endgames , ever more powerful chess engines are constantly finding tiny inaccuracies and changing the evaluations of complex positions . For this newest edition , Gambit has made a few " analytical corrections . " Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On an unimportant note , the reissue does have a new cover , and it 's one I like ( unlike the recent reissue of Secrets of Pawn Endings , which has a cheesy fighting pawns cover ... but the material is still amazing ! ) . Anyways , back to things about the book that actually matter . <p> Emms ' book , like most ( all ? ) endgame texts , starts with the simplest endings and presents increasingly complex positions in each succeeding chapter . This means that the first chapter is fairly theoretical , as it covers the key rook and pawn vs. rook endings . But , since Emms focuses on the practical aspect of rook endings , he keeps the analysis lively and avoids drowning us in variations . That being said , the book does convey the subtleties of rook endings . Many of the examples illustrate the importance of seemingly minor features of the position . See below : <p> As you may have noticed , the only difference between these positions is the placement of the a-pawns . This may seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Emms affectionately calls his readers , knows that everything matters . Regarding the different location of the a-pawn in the right hand diagram , Emms explains that " oddly enough , this little wrinkle helps white . " The position on the left led to a draw , while the one on the right ended in a win for white . Of course the win was n't entirely because of the a-pawn 's placement , but it made a difference . <p> Beyond these relatively barren positions , Emms includes a great discussion of double rook endings . Here Emms distills very complex material into ten pages of engaging discussion . That might seems short for such a complicated subject , but Emms does a fantastic job . Similarly , the book as a whole is relatively short , at about 160 pages . This , however , is a virtue , as any reader who has tried to wind his or her way through Reuben Fine 's Basic Chess Endings could tell you .

While in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill , merely a collection of 1,000 chess puzzles , the presentation is original and the samples are well chosen .

Chapters five ( on Anderssen and Morphy ) and eleven ( on Capablance , Alekhine , and Euwe ) are particularly enjoyable . Sukhin even includes a chapter on Shatranj . <p> Each chapter includes a brief historical overview alongside a number of examples with text explanations and analysis .

I have only one caution and that is to be very careful if White carries out his suicidal plan of Nxf7 early on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be on his toes , but if he is , it 's all good . <p> Like I said , I am not studying the opening per se ( although I will prob make myself familiar with most of the common variations ) I came across it in a game in the book and thought it was interesting and did my best to figure it out which is what the video is , along with some of the mainline and general ideas . <p> facebook : LONG ...

If you are interested in seeing a forum members defence of the fried liver attack " live and direct " lol , waparker4 has a great video in the intermediate forum where his opponent tries to " fried liver " him and you can see how he gets out of it . I studied the video myself until I had memorized his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was quite nice . He has quite a few videos there , but it 's the waparker4 vs Konigsberg vid that goes into the fried liver defence . H.G. <p> Interesting video . I am a fan of this b5 too . The complications are vast . I 've been cross checking with both Chessgames.com opening explorer and Rybka . <p> My personal conclusion is that the Ne4 line is not great . But the follow up recommended with Qh4 is okay , but not Bg4 IMHO . Bg4 is slightly unsound as white has f3 . But it helps to be Rybka playing White to try and neutralise black 's counterplay with total precision . Not the easiest thing to play as White . <p> and White has a crushing position . This path looks quite scary for white after Bb7 with the threat of Nf4/e3/b4 but I think it is the best path for White for advantage . Here is a key game with this variation in chessgames.com : <p> Thanks for watching my video and providing some analysis . As I mention briefly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cpu assistance , so I was fairly certain there were problems there ! My purpose was to reinforce my own learning by regurgitating some of my thoughts and giving other intermediate players like myself a defense that offers practical chances over the board etc .

Is it unlucky to play black and have to play for the win when your opponent plays the Colle exclusively ? When there 's a miracle defense to your sacrifice , is that luck ? Is the fact that a volcano affected Anand 's preparation luck ? <p> Well , the case where you have to play for a win with black and your opponent plays the colle Is luck since you have no control over whether you are assigned the black or white pieces . In the other cases I would call that luck too . Chess is not a game of chance but luck can be involved when you are guessing which one of many moves is the best move . That is why the rating system is based on the probabilities of certain players beating other players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think luck contributes to results in chess ?

Maybe going into a 4th round with 3/3 you would n't have gotten 3/3 without your two whites , etc . <p> But in some cases , is it unlucky when your opponent plays the best move ? Or is chess all skill ? Everything can be explained away to be sure , but at some point , I think luck does factor in too . <p> For example , one of my unluckiest experiences in chess:I had this position in a long game ( 40/2 , SD/50 ) : <p> It was black to move and I had about a minute to make my 40th move . I had seen this position when I played a forcing combination leading to it and assessed it as winning for black . With seconds left to make my move , I played Rf8 , cutting off the white king . White sealed his 41st move ( who still does adjournments ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead lost after he sealed Ra5+ to play for a perpetual . Black has the simple plan of marching his king to d3 and then winning the white rook for the pawn . <p> But there 's a miraculous defense . After 41 . Ra5+ , 42 . Rxg5 is playable because of c4 then c5+ chasing the king away from the defense of the e5 square . Neither me nor my opponent ( an FM ) nor my IM friend saw this plan , but of course a computer saw it instantly . How unlucky was it that this move , the only chance for this saving ( and even winning ! ) plan , was the sealed move ? Now my opponent would put it on his computer and see it . Of course in the position e3 wins , but it 's not as clean as cutting off the king , so in my time pressure I played the simple move . <p> As a footnote , the game was agreed drawn because my opponent did n't analyze with a computer before he talked to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see there is only one scene in chess where luck can be claimed . <p> During a game both players make the same assessment and it is the same realization.Player ' A ' tries to prevent the plan/idea/move . Player ' B ' is obviously trying to get it to happen on the board . This tussle continues for some or many moves . Eventually with inspired play ' B ' manages to outwit his opponent and force the plan/idea/move to appear on the board . Player ' A ' is unhappy . Player ' B ' is happy . But something strange thing has happened , as the plan/idea/move turns out to be better/winning once it appears for player ' A ' , with everything else being equel with regards to the original assessment ! <p> There are " variations " from the desired/expected result in most areas of life . Even with some sort of an automated manufacturing process where widgets are assembled by some sort of machine ( or an assembly line of machines ) , there will be defective units . The defects may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but keeping X as low as possible ( and X = 0 is never possible ) is part of keeping the operation profitable . It 's the same story if you have an assembly line of humans assembling widgets with each person doing one simple step before passing the widget down the line to the next person doing the next simple step . There will be some value of X defective PPM at each step and some value of X overall for the entire assembly line , and X will not be zero over a statistically significant sample size . <p> So , for some value of X how much of it is " luck " and how much of it is " skill " ? In general , I think you would have to say that lower values of X correspond to higher levels of skill on the part of the factory workers and management , but there is an element of " luck " in there since ultimately X is a statistic that corresponds to the probability of all the things or combinations of things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Staying on top of all those things will keep X low , but it will never go to zero . <p> For example , consider a " simple " manufacturing step like , for example , " attach part A to part B with screw C. " Someone might sit down for an entire shift and assemble ABC 1,000 times and get it right an average of 999.736 times ( meaning X = 264 PPM or 264 improper assemblies of ABC over 1,000 working days = 4 man years ) . <p> So , what does this have to do with chess ? Generally speaking , most chess moves are more complicated than a manufacturing task like " attach part A to part B with screw C , " so it reasonable to ask the question , " What is X for any given chess move by any particular player ? " I 'm not proposing we try and calculate X , I 'm just suggesting that X is present , X is non-zero , and X is lower the more skilled a chess player is . One might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternate way of indirectly measuring X over a large number of games ( rather than individual moves ) . <p> However , if games are the end units , then games are " manufactured " by performing a series of steps . Because of the complexity of chess and the failability of humans ( and sometimes even computers ) , the quality is likely to vary considerably from move to move , even with GM level players ( or chess engines , which do sometimes make a strategic mistake and lose ) . And as we all know , it only takes one bad move to ruin an otherwise very good game . <p> I 'm suggesting that any player , if faced with the same game situation multiple times , would not always make the same move ( if we could do the experiment a statistically significant number of times and somehow keep the player from learing from earlier tries ) . We all know this is true , because we all have missed things in a position that " we should have seen . " The different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that overall the results would be the chess equivalent of X. And since X is never 0 , there is some element of " luck " inherent in chess itself ( or at least as played by humans and human-written computer programs ) . <p> I know you believe you understand what you think I just said , but you may not realize what I implied is not what you inferred . <p> But in some cases , is it unlucky when your opponent plays the best move ? Or is chess all skill ? Everything can be explained away to be sure , but at some point , I think luck does factor in too . <p> It sounds like Ra5+ was a combination of experience/intuition and chance . If there 's 19 legal moves for white in the position then he had about a 5 1/4% chance of guessing correctly by picking a move off a list without ever seeing the board . <p> He 's a titled player which raises the odds of guessing the correct move . He would not play a move like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it definitely was n't all skill on his part but it definitely was n't a completely random guess . On that particular move he did not play an incorrect move which was the probably the unlikeliest outcome . <p> If you play him 1000 more times in positions where he has the same likelihood of failing I bet you 'd win the majority ( a problem inherent to small sets of data ) . <p> I know , chance is exactly synonymous with luck in your example . I think Pobble and Wildman brought up two other instances where luck is involved in chess . Whenever there is a net-unfavorable outcome expected ( as mentioned above ) in a situation for your opponent and he manages to produce a favorable result anyway , that is luck . The opposite can be said too . <p> Well I mean Ra5+ is the only reasonable move in that position . I more meant that it was unlucky that the adjournment fell right in that position , rather than 2 moves down the road when it was too late for white 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have found the saving theme and avoided it . <p> Well I mean Ra5+ is the only reasonable move in that position . I more meant that it was unlucky that the adjournment fell right in that position , rather than 2 moves down the road when it was too late for white 's defensive plan , or one move earlier , when I could have found the saving theme and avoided it . <p> Hm , okay I misunderstood . This was a pretty cool thread , in my opinion . It seems there is luck in everything I watch from MMA to the stock market .

I felt comfortable with 1 &amp; 2 to make the initial moves without too much calculation and would have aimed for them quickly in a otb situation , but in #3 should I have really slowed down to calculate things more clearly ? Seemed too heavy for just a five minute thought , but it still looked ' good ' to me . I was wondering if you agreed with me that in principle the decision to make these moves should n't take too much pure calculation . While in #3 my gut instinct was correct , but I know that in an otb situation I would have chewed up about 20 minutes if I had it available . Do you feel #3 was of the same ilk and that not much time should be wasted on what , on the surface , is an obvious continuation ?

( Btw , he 's before my time , too . ) It 's a crazy expression , like many of his horrible neologisms , but I 'm not aware of anything better to take its place . <p> I think you found the third one more challenging simply because for a player of your level and experience , you 've probably seen the first two sac types pretty regularly , while the Chernin-Miles model was far less familiar . I do agree that these sacs will almost always have an intuitive component to them . Some calculation should be made , when possible , but they rarely lead to a position where the compensation is so tangible that intuition becomes unnecessary . <p> Re : Penrose-Soderborg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , but according to the notes given in the Bulletin ( reproduced in the Mega database , but probably not computer checked ) Black was just fine until 24 ...

@@27600328 @1300328/ <p> Does anyone know any good openings against 1 . d4 that keep the position relatively open , offer black good chances for equality and also give black space ( that 's kind of a consequence of an open position ) ? <p> I saw against 1 . d4 black has a few serious choices if he wishes to avoid a d4-d5 pawn front in the center : there are some relatively less played openings like the Chigorin , the Albin Countergambit , the Benko Gambit , the Dutch and maybe even the Budapest gambit , and also some heavy theoretical openings like the Nimzo Indian , Grunfeld , KID , Benoni ... <p> I prefer not too difficult openings ( so you can actually start playing it with confidence in a while , instead of having to memorize a dozen of lines before being able to play it without losing all games ) , I accept a certain dubiousness for an opening ( like the Scandinavian , but an opening should n't be too bad for black in the main lines ) , and I especially prefer open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I limit it to that , I guess that leaves me with the Chigorin , Dutch , maybe Benko Gambit , Nimzo-Indian and Grunfeld ... Which would you advise me ? <p> I think you 'd like the Benko . There 's a lot of theory , but one can get the hang of it pretty quick by studying instructive games . Also black gets great play on the queenside and gains the initiative ( at the cost of the pawn ) . <p> There was a really great quote by IM John Cox in Starting Out : 1 d4 ! in his chapter on what White should do against the Nimzo which goes : <p> " The Nimzowitsch-Indian Defense . When the great day comes when the World 's grandmasters are challenged to a consultation game by the grandmasters of some as yet undiscovered world , and the Other World send over 1 d4 as their first move , you can be fairly sure that the world 's grandmasters will select in reply either this or the Tartakower variation of the Queen 's Gambit Declined . " <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the QGD is very sound , theory moves slowly , and it leads to a good variety of positions some of them reasonably open . ( Remember , you are playing Black , after all ! ) The Tartakower in particular is fairly open if you do n't mind playing with a couple of hanging pawns on c5 and d5 . Now you ca n't always get a Tartakower ( or a Lasker or Clasical or whatever ) because White can opt for the Exchange variation or one of the 5 . Bf4 lines , but those seem to be OK for Black too as long as you play actively . I 'm speaking as someone who 's almost finished reading the book , not as someone who 's waded into combat with it , so take what I 'm saying with a huge block of salt . <p> Since I 'm looking at returning to tournament chess after 30 years of inactivity , picking the QGD against 1 . d4 was a very pragmatic choice . I took a look at the Tartakower because of the Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black to seek active play or get into trouble . I 've noticed that passive play is a serious disease when you 've been inactive for so long . ( I just hope my cure is n't worse than my disease ! ) Longer term I want to play the Nimzo , but if I started there I 'd need to learn both the Nimzo and a partner opening at the same time ( typically one of QID , Bogo-Indian , or QGD ) for when White avoids the Nimzo with 3 Nf3 and that seemed like it was too ambitious a place to start . So in part I picked the QGD with an eye to when I do decide to take up the Nimzo , then I 'll already have a suitable partner opening ready to go with it . <p> Now if only I could figure out what to do when I 'm White and as Black against 1 . e4 ... <p> L8erz ... =bill= <p> I know you believe you understand what you think I just said , but you may not realize what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd like the Benko . There 's a lot of theory , but one can get the hang of it pretty quick by studying instructive games . Also black gets great play on the queenside and gains the initiative ( at the cost of the pawn ) . <p> What have you played in the past against 1. d4 ? <p> I have one book about the Benko Gambit , and against lower rated players it 's probably quite easy to play . But unlike the Scandinavian , you need to know alot of variations to be able to play it with confidence against , say , 2200+ players . Move orders do matter in the Benko . Also , as far as I know , in the main lines of the Benko white can usually consolidate his queenside pawns and just get a reasonable advantage . <p> And what I also do n't like of the Benko Gambit is that black is supposed to " make " the game . He has to create chances on the queenside to get a chance at equalizing and getting compensation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalized unless white does something . Black just has to play simple developing moves to equalize . <p> In the past I 've played the Budapest for a while ( without knowing too much theory , but usually white can get an advantage if he can push through c5 ) , and the KID , where both sides have straightforward plans , but I prefer white in most lines . <p> Maybe the Dutch then . It gives some pretty fun positions , although if white knows theory it can be pretty tough . I think the problem is that you 're looking for something that is not heavily theoretical but also that you can play against FIDE 2200+ players . I 'm not sure if there is a line out there like that .

It 's quite playable i think and the nicest thing about it is you get lots of pressure and it really teaches you how to use that . Just my two cents on it anyway . <p> What i would suggest you try out is a bit of a hybrid move order . <p> You play 1 . d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 and now if white plays 3 . Nc3 then you can play the Nimzo-Indian which is probably the best of all black defenses ( against 1 . e4 or 1 . d4 ) , offers black nearly instant equality with a solid position and good prospects , also you need to know very little if no theory , i myself have never studied the NID but get along perfectly with it . Because of that most people will instead play 3 . Nf3 and now you can either <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taimanov Attack ( aka Flick Knife variation ) . This is what i personally play ( or am learning to play ) , i find it gives black active counterplay , and good positional ideas . White has slightly more space , but really it 's black on the attack , and black will get his own space on the q-side . <p> 2 . Play the QID , this is pretty drawish but relatively solid , and can sometimes transpose into a variety of openings ( such as the Dutche Stonewall ) . In general if you 're okay with a draw it 's a fine variation to play . <p> 3 . Play the Bogo-Indian , I do n't really know very much about this , but it 's supposed to be a fine variation . <p> If you want even more transposability , you can play 1 . d4 e6 and now if they play 2. c4 then just Nf6 and it 's the previously stated position with white to choose . On the other hand if they instead play 2. e4 then you have transposed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , you are like a pin , but without either its head or its point . -- Douglas Jerrold <p> Is n't there some universal opening that works against any c4 or d4 opening ? That would also be nice ... <p> That 's another reason why I do n't really like the Benko . White can also play 1 . d4 , 2 . Nf3 , and only then 3. c4 , or first 3. g3 , 4 . Bg2 , 5 . O-O etc. before playing in the center . <p> That 's also one of the main reasons why I like the Scandinavian so much . After 1 . e4 d5 white really has no choice but to take on d5 ( after 2. e5 c5 black gets a good version of the French , and after 2 . Nc3 dxe4 black also gets a version of the French where he is n't committed to e6 yet ) . That 's also why I started with the KID , since it can be used against any white system . Whether white fianchettoes , gets a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter . Black just has to know a few systems , and the rest is all basically the same . <p> Josh , I was actually looking at 1 . d4 d6 2. c4 e5 today , which also seems like a good opening for me ( endgame genius , opening rookie ) . Do you or anyone else even know what that opening is called , and if there are books about it ? ( And how dubious it is etc . ) <p> The Noteboom is really cool . But , it 's very very theoretical .

The variation that scares me the most is the Marshall gambit which if more people chose to play I 'd be forced to give up the opening . <p> I think if you start out with 1 . d4 d6 2. e4 e5 you either end up with a queenless middle game or you 've transposed into some sort of Philodor 's Defense .

I played this for both colors with reasonable success . <p> Black gets good chances in an endgame ( surprisingly ) if he can direct a knight at c5 and keep the center of the board under control when d5 or e5 happens . White has great chances as well because of the extra bishop and the extra center pawn , even though it can be a liability . <p> I still play the Nimzo as black , but no longer as white since I found that black could get too easy a game when I was white . The lines that Reshevsky played ( and indeed , that all the candidates played in the 1950 's ) are no longer as good as they were . The surprises have been used up , and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be honest , if I were to go back to the Nimzo as white now , I would consider 4 . Qc2 as it seems to be the most promising line currently , even though black can force the position into chaotic waters . <p> I started out trying 4. a3 but lots of Black players seem to really know what they are doing like clockwork with the whole Nf6-e8 and f7-f5 maneuver . But when White does win after 4. a3 , it is a total and complete wipeout . The Samisch lines with f3 seem fantastic for White in the mainlines , but Black has tons of dangerous ( somehow unpopular ) sidelines where White 's king is stuck ( even the juvenile early Nh5 and Qh4 ideas are rather effective ) . <p> So i guess my plan is according to Shereshevsky 's Soviet Chess Conveyor:Start out playing 4. e3 and 5 . Ne2 just to get your bearings . Emphasis is on simplicity-- also i think it 's good for one 's classical chess education . Then , eventually change over to more unbalanced and ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , like against early castles .

Qc2 is a very good way to meet the Nimzo . I have switched to 1. d4 myself recently and have been learning about 4 . Qc2 with the help of Vigorito 's excellent book " Challenging the Nimzo-Indian " . If you want to attack the king you should probably play something else , but if you want the two bishops and more space , at the cost of sometimes having to defend against early black attacks I recommend 4 . Qc2 . Often you will get a slight but enduring edge in the middle and/or endgame . Black can play some very aggressive tactical lines , but with careful defence I think white usually comes out on top . Lots of theory though ... <p> Just to say something regarding 1. d4 in general . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradict it'self , sounds obvious I know , but many players make the mistake of not thinking this through . This is very important concideration regarding the QGD , which Nimzo systems can and often do transpose into . simple example 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3 . Nc3 Nf6 4 . Bg5 Bb4 . Also 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3 . Nc3 Bb4 Most of these problems can be solved if you choose the QGD exchange variation , but that is rather limiting for white .

My friend Tim Wall basically jumped 200 elo points after reading it , getting all his norms for the IM title . This book completly changed his game .

Select either one or more games and simply play through them slowly or if you prefer at a more rapid pace but in this instance each game a number of times . Your just trying to get a ' sense ' of the game - to develop a feel for it . When the times comes when you are confident you have pretty much forgotten the game ; be it a day or a week later ( an hour ? Oops ) , then you are ready to try playing one side in the chosen game(s) . <p> Titled players have a big advantage regarding memory of openings and positions which they do not even play , for which most of you do not .

Random means after each move a new random position from the profile is chosen.Random+Sequential : A random position/game is chosen and you go move by move until the end of the game/line . Then a new random position/game is chosen.Sequential means you go from position/game 1 move by move position by position until the end of the profile . <p> In the " basic " tab you can chose the move to begin with . This is only useful when looking at full games to skip the opening phase . In that case you should create a profile which contains *. pgn files with games only.Here you can also chose if you want to guess the moves of the winner/loser/both/colour or chose a player . 95675 @qwx295675 95676 @qwx295676 95677 @qwx295677

" <p> With Secrets of Pawn Endings and their subsequent Fundamental Chess Endings , Karsten Muller and Frank Lamprecht secured their place alongside Reuben Fine , Mikhail Shereshevsky , and Yuri Averbakh on the short list of great endgame writers . While it might be blasphemous to suggest that Muller and Lamprecht 's books are better than the works of these other authors , Muller and Lamprecht do have one distinct advantage : their works have benefited enormously from chess ' computer age .

However , the book 's theoretical importance is not its only value . Muller and Lamprecht provide accessible tips for practical play as well . <p> Secrets of Pawn Endings begins with a theoretical overview of the fundamental pawn endgame positions . The first chapter discusses King and Pawn(s) vs . King while each succeeding section addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader to use the earlier chapters to inform later discussion .

Sections like " Thinking Methods to Find the Right Move " and " Complicated Cases " provide strategies for playing complex endings .

The effect of these later chapters is that the thorough reader , having developed a grasp of theoretical pawn endings , can now harness that knowledge to improve his or her play . <p> Secrets of Pawn Endings is excellent for all readers , whether the expert level player seeking to ascend into the master ranks ( or beyond ) or the casual player hoping to gain a deeper appreciation of pawn endings ' beauty .

@@27600499 @1300499/ <p> I still have Chessbase 9 and have no intention of upgrading to Version 10 or beyond . Why ? Activation technology for one thing and the pricing of Chessbase products is ridiculously expensive . Since discovering SCID ... I 've learned I can have a chess database program that does most of what Chessbase does at zero cost to my wallet . <p> Katar 's video primer on the SCID program in the video library here convinced me I made the right choice . The other thing that SCID does besides what Katar showed in his video is that it 's configured with an engine that allows you to play chess games for tactical training . I think it does as good a job as Chessbase does on this score . Chessbase 9 does n't have this feature . I would have to launch a separate Chessbase product which I do have to play chess games from positions found in the database program shell . One of the best features of SCID is there 's no need for drag and drop of chess pieces when moving on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which allows far quicker inputting of moves on the chessboard . Chessbase has something similar to SCID 's offering but it 's more primitive . <p> Just about the only downside to SCID is that it does n't remember databases you keep open and you have to reload all the databases over again to use them . Chessbase gets around this problem by having a pretty good database manager which allows you to easily select bases for opening and studying from . I believe this is one area I think SCID can improve on . The other thing I think Chessbase still has over SCID is a better comment dialog editor when annotating games . You can change the fonts here and also use algebraic figurine notation ... something SCID currently still does n't support . I do n't know why SCID ca n't do this ... but maybe licensing fees for the chess fonts could be an issue ? The only other annoyance from SCID is that it does n't support CBH read only files . You need to convert CBH files to PGN for SCID to read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The one area that both Chessbase 9 and SCID 4.2.2. currently ca n't do that only Chess Assistant 10 does is input chess diagrams visually in the chess notation for viewing . I hope SCID gets this feature some day as it would be great to see diagrams in chess notation onscreen without printing . <p> So in terms of features I think SCID is just about equal to Chessbase 9 and best of all it 's free for download and use . <p> SCID can input diagrams . It ca n't use CBH because it 's proprietary . It does remember databases , just use the file dropdown menu .

It had several other advantages , too . First , I gave those facing the French an interesting line they can use with a semi-clear conscience , at least for a week .

I 've never heard of him before this game with Dominguez , but two people told me about this game feeling this is a way for Black to get a good game against the Maroczy Bind . <p> I have to admit that his demolition on the h1-a8 diagonal was impressive , but it seems that Dominquez gave this too little importance Black 's plan . White 's a4 move did n't make much sense to me , I thought b4 right away was better and seemed to fit the position better . It is strange that you mentioned that you had this positon with White in blitz games , me , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hedgehog is a difficult nut to crack and taking away b6-b5 as one of the breaks seems logical , but there 's a little voice in my head saying " do n't you touch that a-pawn ... do n't do it ! " <p> Very good game for those looking for a way to battle against the Maroczy Bind , then again , look for improvements by White ( 14 . Rac1 and b4 ideas are very common as you mentioned ) . <p> The move 22 ... d5 ! was a brilliant idea by Anreikin , this sort of move is one played by seasoned players , a ' Petrosian ' move , if you will . This is why I was wondering if you knew anything more about Anreikin . Something tells me we 'll be seeing more of him in the near future . <p> I 've heard of him , saw him play in youtube videos too , he is pretty strong , you can tell that he is not too much into theory so his games are refreshing with new stuff . Another game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan is alternative , like I said , dominguez tried to make it work , but it ussually comes from a2 saving tempos . <p> Hold your horses fellas ! my investigation of this idea found a pleasant surprise , I 'd like to refer you to two games : <p> Zvjaginsev - Fedorov 1998 - this shows the plan when it works , for all of you who are not familiar with the idea <p> Andreikin - Khismatullin 2007 - This is where Andreikin got it from ! This was a very pleasant discovery at this hour of the night . <p> Check your databases <p> PS If anyone can link these games here to an external online databse would be appreciated . <p> Hi all , here is the game by Andreikin , this is where the orignal idea of a5 came from . I was thinking that this idea can be prevented if white instead of Rfc1 plays Rfd1 , however that leaves c4 a little bit soft so there might be a chance for counterplay against that pawn , i 'm just think out loud , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm almost 100% sure that this is a relay mistake or something , the rook on e1 does n't do anything , and I watched the game live online and the move was Rfc1 ( logical , besides Dominguez has another game in wich he continued the same way ) So I think it does n't make much difference , if anything maybe is black who can exploit whites move by attacking c4. 95675 @qwx295675 <p> Users browsing this forum : No registered users and 1 guest 95677 @qwx295677

@@27600534 @1300534/ <p> It took way longer than expected , but I finally transcribed Katar 's e4-e5 complete repertoire into Chess Position Trainer format . See the link at the end of this post . <p> Please note that for my ease in transcription , I divided the repertoire into several sub-repertoires however many transpositions exist from one opening to another that are not addressed by this method of organization . Fortunately , CPT allows one to merge the sub-repertoires ( discrete sub-reps or altogether ) to create one super-repertoire that does address the transposition issue . If you do this ( and you probably should for training purposes ) , first make a copy of the original in case you want to split off any of the sub-repertoires at a later date . <p> Also , databases are very tricky to proofread and Katar did n't speak the moves aloud at many points as he whizzed through variations making transcription a real challenge at times , so undoubtedly there will errors and oversights . Please let me know when you discover these as I will continue to update the repertoire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos including comments ( though often condensed ) and evaluations is included . I also drew on other sources- articles , books and computer analysis in places where I thought it was useful to flesh out the lines or investigate obvious looking replies that were not originally covered in the videos . The only video of his 9-part series not included is the Main Line Berlin Defense ( " The Berlin Wall " ) as the types of positions that arise ( i.e. based on ideas rather than variations ) do not lend themselves to a database treatment very successfully . You should watch his video for the ideas involved as well as Dennis Monokroussos ' two excellent videos ( albeit with a different approach to the opening than Katar 's recommendations ) and Cox 's book ( The Berlin Wall ) . <p> Many thanks to katar for his hard work and diligent research and also a big shoutout to Wildman whose PGN transcriptions proved invaluable at times . <p> groovy . Congrats for compiling everything , which is quite a big project in its own right . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the basic themes and ideas . My biggest critique is that the videos get buried in details and miss the forest for the trees sometimes . There really are some basic concepts that make learning this defense a breeze : <p> I think you 'd get lots of views for that video , katar . At the same time , aside from the helpful summary you posted above- is there a whole lot more you can say ? These types of positions seem more tactical in nature than d4 openings ( for example ) so I would think they would resist being reduced to a verbal summary of ideas somewhat without getting variation-specific . Of course , I guess Fine did this successfully in " Ideas Behind the Chess Openings " already , though that work is ripe for an update ( obviously not from Fine ! ) . <p> I think that Curtains is on to something with his suggestion that opening books as currently constituted are ridiculous with the amount of material they present . His idea of an opening book ideally being limited to a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key variations and pertinent tactical devices/traps to be aware of is an excellent one . When I think of what I know about openings , I 'm guessing that my " knowledge " about most of my openings could easily fit on one page ! I have read several books ( cover to cover ) on the Smith-Morra but my takeaway is considerably less- as in tiny . Still , whatever little I retained has served me pretty well . The openings I probably learned the best , are ones that I did n't learn from a book but were from a few lines and ideas shown to me other players . The point is , I think your idea is a good one in principle and I look forward to seeing the resulting video . <p> illigetimi non carborundum . <p> Mon Jun 13 , 2011 10:19 am <p> stryder67 <p> Rook <p> Joined : Fri Oct 03 , 2008 3:41 pmPosts : 111 <p> Re : Katar 's e4-e5 repertoire finally available for CPT ! <p> I wanted to give a thank you to the guys who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found katar 's on using this program and after downloading it , I made a simple rep for me to play as white .

I transcribed 5 books on the Morra ( there may have been more ) into a giant database as well as books on the Latvian , the BDG and others during my " gambit phase " . <p> Did this help , or do you end up suffering from the aforementioned point of a ludicrous amount of material ? I once created a ' comprehensive ' ( ) main line pgn for the Ruy , using the reference db and computer ... in main lines I 'd take the top two options , and in side lines I 'd just take the first pick . In both cases , I 'd try to find a novelty as soon as possible to take the game into unknown waters where I do n't have to learn theory , just to know a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to focus on , and even then I 'm kind of intimidated about learning it ! The idea of a huge database , while tempting , I always felt could do more harm than good , unless you have a great memory or you 're a pro with all the time in the world to go over it . A think it 's better to have little knowledge of theory rather than an extensive yet imprecise knowledge . It 's all to easy to think ' ah I 'm pretty sure this weird move is right in this position because I remember it somehow ' , but more often than not it was for another , similar variation , then you get caught out . In this situation you 're better off on your own resources , I think . <p> I also tried the same with the a6 Slav , but jesus ... the amount of possible move orders and subtelties just freaked me out and I gave up . <p> Anyway sorry if this is kind of OT , but since you brought the subject of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work has benefited you a great deal , or whether th time would have been better spent on something more generally applicable such as tactics training , endgame studies , etc <p> Was it helpful ? Well yes , sorta . I did learn more about the Morra than I would have if had n't done it but the benefit was really not worth the hours of drudgery involved . As a learning tool , databases like this have limited utility but it does come in handy for reference 's sake . Many openings are better learned through understanding the position types/structures but sharp openings like the Morra rely on the player 's memory often times and having it in database form is good for beefing up hazy variations etc. from time to time . That said , I do n't recommend anyone doing this ! <p> Please note that for my ease in transcription , I divided the repertoire into several sub-repertoires however many transpositions exist from one opening to another that are not addressed by this method of organization .

I was actually googeling for a Katar video I saw in the past about how to create a repertoire with CPT and just found out there even exists a CPT database for one of his videos - great ! <p> Just a quick note : in the latest CPT version you can create a database with one repertoire and many openings and unlike CPT 3.3 the program will detect any transpositions between the openings . No need to create a super-repertoire anymore . 95675 @qwx295675 <p> Users browsing this forum : No registered users and 1 guest 95677 @qwx295677

@@27600548 @1300548/ <h> Book Review : Understanding Chess Endgames by John Nunn <p> In the pantheon of endgame writers , John Nunn certainly has a distinguished place . Beyond his immense skill as a chess writer , Nunn 's love for technology has allowed him to bring endgame writing into the computer age . While in some cases this has led to the esoteric--his wonderful if not a little impractical Secrets of Pawnless Endings being a prime example--he has also used his powers for good , mostly recently in Gambit Publishing 's Understanding Chess Endgames . <p> The book might better be called 100 Endgame Themes John Nunn Thinks You Should Know . An offshoot of a ( planned ? ) larger book on endings , Understanding Chess Endgames is a collection of essential endgame themes that features Nunn 's usual mix of clear writing and laser precision . The layout is a little strange ; in the introduction Nunn even suggests that the best way to read his book is " sections 1-15 , then a glance at sections 76 and 77 , back to section 16 and then straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd , but I 'm not going to argue . <p> As with all endgame manuals I read , my personal preference shapes my enjoyment of the material . The coverage of bishop endings was useful , but a bit dry . In contrast , my love for the weirdness of knight endings meant I particularly enjoyed that section . The section on rook endings is n't much different from what you 'll get elsewhere , but the introduction to that section does tie everything together nicely . Also , the discussion of tactics at the end of the book was fun . <p> Nunn stresses that his book is about instruction and is not an encyclopedia . I agree . If you want complete coverage , consult Lamprecht and Muller . But that is what 's refreshing about Understanding Chess Endgames . It straddles a weird space on the spectrum ranging from the traditionally linear and engaging instructional manual like Yasser Seirawan 's Winning Chess Endgames to the mind-numbingly thorough Basic Chess Endings . Understanding Chess Endgames is n't a book that you 're going to read in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go down like cough syrup ( my apologies to Mr. Fine ) . If the strength of Mr. Nunn 's previous work alone does n't get you to check out this book , consider my endorsement the clincher.

Instead of going by some rating , take out a chessboard and try composing a four or five move problem . <p> I have trouble believing that annotating sharp games by masters could be considered repeated problem solving . Firstly , in any given position yout would n't have a ' x to play and win ' clue , and secondly you are furthering your development based on understanding how tactics arise , and how to avoid them , rather than on solving an already won position . However , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . <p> It is an action for practised repeated learning based on re ' enforcement . You can wriggle as much as you like but that is what you are trying to do when you undertake it - cos you want to compare ! <p> Repeated learning based on reinforcement is very different from repeated problem solving though . The former is basically just a long-winded way of saying ' learning ' , while the latter is a very specific means of learning . Any learning requires repeition and reinforcement , no matter what particular strategy you use . Your suggestion is also repeated learning based on reinforcement , unless one composes only a single puzzle <p> I agree with BKildahl that having a long time to calculate every variation is important . However , I also think pattern recognition is really important as with unlimited time , you 're bound to eventually spot the tactic . Unfortunately , we do n't always have such a luxury in real games . I do need to make sure my calculation skills are at the point where I can find most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard mode is a definite must for my tactics training . <p> gentlewhisper and jtixs , thanks for the book reccomendations. actually I already had 5334 problems , but never looked at it . your reccomendation convinced me that it 's worth some time . also , i like the idea behind 600 lessons ; it seems like its problems would be more useful in simulating a game situation . <p> finally , i really like pobble 's idea of composing problems . It definitely sound like it would help . Furthermore , it might be useful when teaching others tactics . <p> Repeated learning based on reinforcement is very different from repeated problem solving though .

You want to sit in a classroom and learn everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the water . Going over games is a very good thing for learning strategy , but regarding tactics it comes as a poor second to composing . <p> To support the method of hands on properties manipulation ( long winded but I seem to need to point out the difference ) I can cite myself as proof . All the world champions as far as I know . My kids I coached were all excellent at tactics . Many strong players I know . We are talking about gaining a skill and getting it to stick . Once you possess this skill , you can do with it whatever you want - solve as many puzzles , work through games , but you need a firm grasp of tactics first . <p> There are some things which limit each player even when they have gained a skill . Someone with a better short term memory will always be able to calculate better than you . Some things just suck . <p> People do not like composing because-1.You got to do it yourself.2.It is testing.3.Demands thought.4.It is difficult to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Going over games can be fun and often done just on the spur of the moment . Puzzles are fun . But both lack a personnel touch which hinders learning in my opinion . <p> My observation regarding going through games as a method of learning and puzzles.Most people are not willing to spend enough time on one game . Invest enough of themselves.Puzzles slowly teach short term tactics but need constant repeating for life . Yuck . <p> Well I will give it a go , for sure Although I still think there is more to annotating games than just learning strategy . You get tactical insight as to why moves are made as well . For instance , when you look at a game and see a weird move . You spend some time trying to figure out the point of it , and eventually realise it was to defend against some tactic . Having the tactical awareness to avoid tactics is just as important as being able to seize on the opportunity when you 're on the other side of a tactical melee . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider annotating games to be better than composing puzzles , just that I consider it to be more worthwhile than solving puzzles . I can completely see why you consider composition to be better on the whole , but just think that lumping together ' mate in 3 ' type puzzles with a deep annotation and study of a sharp GM game is n't really accurate . 95675 @qwx295675 95676 @qwx295676 95677 @qwx295677 
@@27600567 @1300567/ <p> Here 's an interesting one . I remember reading a comment about certain chessplayers who like to confuse their opponents by setting up their knights facing straight so that the pieces resemble the bishops . <p> I 'm wondering if this issue with the knights and how they get placed on their starting squares is something that has been addressed by chess rules ? I ask because I recently reinstalled Chessbase Shredder 7 on my computer and I noticed the 3D graphics were great ... except the knights were lined up facing straight ahead . This has since been addressed by the newer releases ... as there is now an option to change the way the knights are facing on the chessboard . <p> But OTB play this issue with the knights could be problematic . I 've played OTB and noticed this issue with the knights and this has actually caused me some calculating problems . I think there 's even a famous chess game played by a GM which had the player blunder in the ending because he thought he had a bishop on a square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a real problem OTB , you should run , not walk , to your opthalmologist and have him/her do a thorough evaluation of your vision ... I have trouble imagining this being a problem -- except maybe on one of those tiny little travel chess sets where the pawns are almost as tall as the bishops . I can imagine it being very hard to play with a 3D chess board on a computer screen with the knights facing forward , though , because of the lousy resolution on the screen relative to the human eye at that distance . <p> I also do n't buy the story about the GM mistaking a knight for a bishop and blundering because of it -- he may have blundered and made an excuse , but I do n't buy it as a real vision problem ( unless his uncorrected vision is something like 20/400 ... ) . GMs are just too good to screw up that way . ( FWIW , I also do n't buy the story about the two 19th century GMs sitting and staring at the board for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look from the other , " Oh , is it my move ? " He may have used that as a psychological ploy , but a GM calibure player will understand what 's going on too deeply to lose track of whose move it is . <p> Just my opinion for what it 's worth ... ( Possibly not a lot ... ) <p> I know you believe you understand what you think I just said , but you may not realize what I implied is not what you inferred . <p> I always set my knights up facing towards my opponent 's king , it keeps their minds on the job ! I ca n't see how someone could mistake a knight for another piece because of the direction it 's facing though , unless it 's a weird set . <p> I always turn the knights sideways like 2d graphics would have them sit . They look better that way than they do facing forward to me . I do n't mistake them for other pieces either way , nor does it bother me psychologically which direction they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I always turn the knights sideways like 2d graphics would have them sit . They look better that way than they do facing forward to me . I do n't mistake them for other pieces either way , nor does it bother me psychologically which direction they sit . I just like the way they look sideways . <p> This is one of the reasons why I would prefer knights facing sideways . This way I can tell it 's a knight and not a bishop . This issue with the knight is not an idle one . I 've heard complaints about this problem on other sites discussing this . Plus it 's the one piece that 's not symmetrical in appearance which would n't be an issue no matter how you place it on the square , like the bishop , rook , pawn , or queen . <p> There have been discussions on how to solve this problem with some people suggesting they change the appearance of the knight to make it more symmetrical to avoid accusations of players wanting to annoy their opponents with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . One idea I 've heard was to make the knight four headed , with the snout facing in four directions . This would solve the issue with the piece nicely as it makes this piece symmetrical . It would look weird but I think people would be able to adjust to the new look . On 2D chess software it would be ridiculous ... but on 3D software ... not a bad idea . <p> I would stop playing competitive chess if they changed the appearance of the knight . It 's ridiculous that you can mistake a knight for a bishop . You do n't mistake a queen for a king do you ? ( unless you have a really bad chess set , I 've seen it sometimes ) . But how could you mistake a bishop for a knight ? They look totally different . <p> I do n't buy that story of that GM . A grandmaster does n't just look at a position and see ; " Oh , I have a bishop there , and a pawn there and a king there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . So a mistake like that is impossible for a grandmaster . <p> This is the first time I 've heard anyone mention this problem with the knights facing to a certain direction . And even if someone would put them in a certain position to confuse the opponent , there 's nothing you can do about . That 's bad sportsmanship on their part . You ca n't force a player to put his pieces in exactly the middle of the squares , how could you force them to point the pieces in a certain direction when they move them ? If anyone ever get 's confused with a normal chess set then your either 1. ) really old or 2. ) almost blind or 3. ) a really bad player/beginner who was n't paying attention . <p> I keep ' em straight but this seems a rather trivial issue . I 've played chess for over 40 years and I do n't recall me or any other player mistaking a knight for a bishop or vice versa and that includes playing on some strange sets . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicapped novice but really , if you are a half way serious player , you ought to know where your pieces are without even looking at the board . <p> I think it 's too much of a non-issue to change the traditional " horse 's head " knight design . The four way idea is n't as crazy as it sounds , if done properly . I once saw a very stylized chess set that was Staunton-like enough to be usable in a serious OTB game , but had many little touches that were really cool like the cross on the king pointing four ways instead of only two . The problem with doing that to the knight is that four snouts would be awkward to handle -- especially when playing blitz . I would have to be highly stylized to look good and to be easy to handle . <p> I confess I always turn my knights sidways pointing in towards the king and queen -- and I leave them that way whenever I move them throughout the game . Except when I 'm playing gentlewhisper , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I really gets him going ... <p> I know you believe you understand what you think I just said , but you may not realize what I implied is not what you inferred . 95675 @qwx295675 95676 @qwx295676 95677 @qwx295677

@@27600572 @1300572/ <p> I regard myself as a pretty good endgame player but these terms are new to me . They read ( sound ) pretty artificial . I would guess that Anti-Anti-opposition = You have the opposition , as two negatives make a ... but you already know that . A really good book on pawn endings is ' The Final Countdown ' , which uses the tool of key squares- easing the conceptualization of concepts like triangulation ( losing a move ) ect . Key squares are a kind of targeted thinking . Sorry I can not help more , as my endgame books tend to be old . <p> I think by rectangular opposition you mean distant opposition as the idea is that your King can have the opposition when you are farther away . <p> Basically think of it like this . We 'll pretend the enemy King is on a Black square . If you can then move to a square that would cause a rectangle made out of your King at one far corner and his King at another with your King on Black then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's Kings would cause you to end with having the opposition . Easier to see it than to explain it . In this example I 'm only showing the idea of the Kings . O=Black and X=White . K is White king and k is Black King . <p> kOXOXOXOXOXOXOK If it 's Black to move than White has the opposition . White to move than Black has it . ( This idea is only mostly true though as whoever is moving can actually move to a square to keep the distant opposition , it just might not be in the direction that the player wants to go . There 's an interesting example of this in Silman 's Endgame book where White has to make some really odd looking moves to gain the opposition and win . ) <p> Hope this made some resemblance of sense .

In other words , Watson is right : it 's a damn good opening ! " - Jeremy Silman <p> opposition is when two kings have an odd number of squares between them . anti-opposition basically means not-the-opposition. kinda stupid i know . i suggest reading up on Corresponding Squares . concepts like opposition , mined squares , and triangulation fall under corresponding squares . i 'm sure you 've heard that in endgames , getting the opposition is important , but sometimes if you get the opposition , you lose . obtaining the opposition is n't the goal of endgames. in some situations , ceding the opposition to your opponent is the right move . <p> asking yourself " how can i get the opposition " is not the most important question to ask . asking yourself " where does my king need to be " should be #1 and then use the principles of opposition , triangulation as tools to reach your objective . the only way to know where your king needs to be is by concrete analysis ! you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may or may not be the right move ! <p> I always think of kings like magnets with the same polarity , so they sort of ' push ' each other away . Opposition is like holding two +s together then they ca n't get past each other . Or you can use opposition to your advantage to ' slide ' around another king by making him get out of the way .

@@27600590 @1300590/ <p> In this new series , we 'll be profiling a forum member each week . We 'll include an interview , along with some of the member 's most memorable posts . <p> Wildman was a natural choice for the first member of the week because of his thoughtful posts and willingness to help other forum members . This can be seen in posts like his contribution to our discussion of reasons for controlling the center and his discussion of his personal history with the Sicilian . One of my favorite posts of his was " Wildman strolls down memory lane , " an analysis of a game he played back in the 1970 's . He 's also been an active participant in our group correspondence games , serving as informal captain of the white team in our latest game . He has also contributed a great deal of analysis for our correspondence match against the Cumnor Chess Club . <p> Here 's our interview : <p> How did you get into chess ? <p> Wildman : I was six years old and I saw a YMCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera angle was sort of low and it showed one of the players moving this odd looking piece diagonally across the board amongst a bunch of other looking pieces making a dramatic capture at the end . I just thought that was so cool . So I asked my parents if they knew how to play " chest " which is what I thought the game was called . Turns out that my father was about as strong a player as you can be ( effective strength 1300 UCSF ) without studying the game or playing against serious players , and he taught me how to play and was my primary opponent for the next six years . <p> How long have you been playing ? <p> W : At the risk of sounding Clintonesque , it depends on what you mean by " playing . " Since I 'm going to turn 50 in a couple of weeks , the literal answer is 44 years but the reality is a bit more complicated . From ages 6-12 chess was primarily a way to get my dad to spend time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know how to relate to children very well . From ages 12-16 I was a complete fanatic , both playing and studying any chess book I could get my hands on . During those years I probably played 5,000 games ( including a lot of blitz ) and pushed my effective playing strength from 1200 to 1950 UCSF , though my highest rating was only 1713 UCSF since I never played in enough tournaments for my rating to catch up to my ability . From ages 16-47 I was retired and only played the occasional game when some friend or acquaintance challenged me . Over the last three years , I 've been reading and studying again but playing very little . Part not playing has to do with being an older dad who has a 2.5 year old son ; it 's a lot easier to read a chess book holding a sleeping child than it is to set up the pieces and actually study something or go on the Internet . Part of it is has to do with not having fully exorcised the old psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What do you play generally with white ? <p> W : I 've been a 1 . e4 player all my life , though if I start playing seriously again that 's likely going to change to 1 . d4 ( followed by a quick c4 ) . Hanging around CV.TV though , it 's hard not to have a little guy in red tights and a pitch fork sitting on your shoulder saying , " Play Bird 's opening ... " : ) <p> What do you play with Black ? <p> W : Back in the early 1970s I played the Sicilian Dragon against 1 . e4 and the Grunfeld against 1 . d4 -- and you never saw anything else . ( OK , I had one tournament game where White played 1 . c4 , but that was it in four years of tournament play . ) Today , things are so much more complicated since off-beat openings are so much more common . If I start playing seriously again , it 'll probably be either the Sicilian Sveshnikov or the Sicilian Najdorf against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 ... c5 against 1 . Nf3 or 1 . c4 , and I have n't figured out what to do against most of the others yet . <p> Bishop or Knight ? <p> W : Is the position open or closed ? <p> If you had a choice between studying an endgame or going over an opening variation , which would you choose ? <p> W : These days I 'd have to say opening variation , though it would probably be better for my game if I studied endgames . <p> Do you have any favorite players ? <p> W : Kramnik and Anand . Both of them seem to be gentlemen as well as great players . I had to remove Topalov from my list after Toiletgate , even though I really like the way he plays chess . <p> W : Born and raised in Los Angeles , CA ; married seven years ; one son ; went to school at Stanford ; was an electrical engineer for 26 years with 52 patents to my credit ; currently work as a patent agent at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results : equal first in the 1973 Los Angeles County Junior High School Championship , 5th in the 1974 Western US High School Championship , once drew a tournament game as Black against a player rated 2450 USCF . <p> That 's it for this edition of ChessVideos.TV forum member of the week .
