@@28358085 @2058085/ <h> Q&amp;A <h> Benefits of Donating Retirement Assets to Charity <p> The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 contained several provisions that may affect your clients ' charitable giving strategies in 2013 . Among the changes , the current law allows direct donations to charities from IRAs1 . But , it is important to note that private foundations , supporting organizations , and donor-advised funds such as the Giving Account at Fidelity Charitable do not qualify to receive tax-free distributions from IRAs . However , these entities can accept donations of the assets in an IRA at death , either through an IRA beneficiary designation or through a will . <p> This article focuses on inheritances from traditional IRAs , 401(k)s or 403(b)s that consist only of pre-tax contributions and associated earning . Withdrawals from these accounts are subject to income taxes2 . ( For simplicity 's sake , we will use the shorthand " IRA " when discussing these accounts . ) <h> IRA inheritors may lose a lot to taxes <p> Together , estate taxes and income taxes may substantially diminish an inheritance from a traditional IRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxable estate is free from federal estate taxes this is called the " basic exclusion " . ( A surviving spouse can also claim the unused portion of a deceased spouse 's basic exclusion , for a combined exclusion of $10.5 million for a married couple . To claim the unused spouse 's portion , an estate tax return for the decedent spouse must have been filed , even if no taxes were owed . ) <p> Additionally , income attributable to the decedent is not only included in the decedent 's estate , but often subject to income taxes : <p> Income attributable to a decedent that is received after his or her death is considered " income in respect of a decedent " ( IRD ) . IRD includes withdrawals after death from a decedent 's IRA , 401(k) , 403(b) or similar retirement account . <p> Typically the person(s) receiving the IRD must include the income on their own tax return and pay income taxes on it at their own income tax rate . <p> As of 2013 , the maximum federal estate tax is 40% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A client may be able to eliminate or reduce these taxes by strategically giving assets based on the type of asset and the type of beneficiary . <h> Planning wisely <p> Note which assets can be easily liquidated to pay estate and other taxes . You clients could consider not leaving these assets to specific individuals so the estate can have them available to pay taxes <p> To help reduce the income tax burden to individual recipients , consider leaving individuals assets that have tax-free income ( e.g. , a Roth IRA ) or whose basis can be stepped up at your death ( e.g. , real estate or appreciated securities in a taxable account ) <p> Consider donating assets that will be subject to income taxes to qualified charities : <p> A tax-exempt public charity can withdraw pre-tax monies from non-Roth retirement accounts , such as Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s without paying income taxes . <p> In addition , an estate could take a charitable deduction which would reduce the size of the taxable estate . For example , if your client has a taxable estate of $8 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified charity , your client 's taxable estate would drop to $7 million . <h> Hypothetical case study <p> Assume your client is a 75-year-old widow who has a net worth of $8 million . <p> Her assets include : <p> A $1 million Traditional IRA ( all pre-tax monies ) <p> Real estate valued at $3 million <p> Long-term appreciated securities with a current market value of $4 million <p> She asks you to compare the consequences of leaving her entire IRA to charity or dividing it between her two grandchildren equally . <p> Your answer will depend on how quickly the grandchildren withdraw funds from the IRA , but base your calculations on the worse case scenario : that the client passes away in 2013 with an estate worth $8 million and that the grandchildren withdraw all the IRA assets this year . <p> The first $5.25 million would be exempt from federal estate taxes under her basic exclusion . ( We will assume her deceased spouse used up his entire $5.25 million basic exclusion , so nothing more can be excluded . ) As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million of the estate . The rates are graduated , but they rise fairly quickly to the top rate of 40% . <p> Each grandchild is married , files jointly , and has an adjusted gross income ( AGI ) of $960,000 , including the $500,000 withdrawal from the inherited IRA . The withdrawal should be considered IRD . <p> Under Internal Revenue Code Sec. 691(c) , if they itemize their deductions , each grandchild should be able to claim an estate tax deduction on their own federal income tax returns for the federal estate tax attributed to their portion of the IRD , even though the estate taxes may have been paid by the grandmother 's estate out of other estate assets . <p> The estate tax deduction they could claim would be slightly reduced ( referred to as a " haircut " ) because their AGI puts them in an income bracket subject to the limitation on itemized deductions that was reinstated in 2013 . <p> The following chart shows how federal estate and income taxes can significantly reduce an inheritance compared to leaving the entire IRA to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA after federal income and estate taxes <p> $243,259 <p> n/a <p> Total available to give to charity <p> $486,518 <p> $1 million <p> This is a hypothetical example for illustrative purposes only . It assumes both grandchildren are in highest federal income tax bracket of 39.6%* , claim itemized deductions and pay a portion of the decedent 's estate taxes from the IRA . It does not take into account state and local income or estate taxes , the federal alternative minimum tax or other limitations and adjustments beyond the Pease " haircut " limitation on deductions . <p> * As of the publication date , the 2013 federal estate tax rate schedule had not been issued by the IRS . Estate taxes were estimated using the 2012 schedule for the first $500,000 of taxable estate assets beyond the basic exclusion of $5.25 million , 36% for the next $250,000 , 38% for the next $250,000 and 40% for taxable estate assets over $1 million , for total federal estate taxes of $1,040,800 on the whole $8 million estate . It was further assumed the estate taxes were paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1M ) and securities ( $3M ) . $1,040,800/$4M = 26.02% effective rate on assets used to pay federal estate taxes . <p> ** To claim the estate tax deduction , the taxpayer must itemize deductions and take it in the same year he is required to report the income in respect of a decedent ( IRD ) . This example assumes the estate had no IRD other than the IRA and had no expenses in respect of a decedent . The estate tax without income or expenses in respect of a decedent was estimated to be $640,800 , for a deductible estate tax of $400,000 ( $1,040,800 - $640,800 ) . The deduction for each grandchild was $200,000 before the " haircut " of $19,800 . <p> If her goal is to maximize the after-tax assets left to charity and her grandchildren , this client is better off giving her IRA to charity , and leaving her children and grandchildren other property . <p> Estate taxes , together with income tax on the IRD , would consume $243,259 or 49% of each child 's inheritance <p> The result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the IRA beneficiary is that $513,482 ( $256,741 times two ) that otherwise would have gone to taxes would go to charity instead . <p> By leaving other long-term appreciated property , like stock and real estate to non-tax exempt beneficiaries , such as individual relatives , those heirs will often be able to get a stepped up basis at her death3 , reducing the capital gains tax they would have to pay on the assets if they decided to sell them . <h> Naming beneficiaries on IRAs and other retirement accounts <p> If an IRA or similar retirement account has designated beneficiaries , the assets in it will generally pass directly to those beneficiaries without going through probate . Most banks and financial services firms have beneficiary forms you can use , or they can provide you with suggested language for naming beneficiaries to these accounts . <p> If you are thinking of leaving money to a charity , consider using non-Roth retirement accounts for that purpose since inherited Roth assets are generally tax-free to recipients , provided certain conditions are met . Some options to consider : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Roth account <p> Indicating that the charity is a beneficiary of a certain percentage of the account , and that the rest should go to individual beneficiaries in particular percentages <p> Specifying a qualified charity as a contingent beneficiary , so that if the primary beneficiary disclaims it , it will go the charity <h> Advantages of making a donor-advised fund4 a non-Roth IRA beneficiary <p> Although designating any qualified charity as a beneficiary usually allows an estate to claim a charitable contribution deduction , naming a public charity with a donor-advised fund program such as the Giving Account at Fidelity Charitable as beneficiary of a non-Roth IRA gives clients and heirs more flexibility . ( As mentioned above , Roth assets are generally tax-exempt to any recipient provided certain requirements are met , so these assets provide a better tax benefit to non-charitable beneficiaries . ) <p> When clients are not sure which causes they ultimately want to support after death , instead of naming charitable beneficiaries to their Giving Account , they may choose to name an individual successor(s) <p> Upon the donor 's death , the IRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor can then make grant recommendations over time to the charities they would like to support . <p> The donor may also specify that the IRA be allocated across multiple Giving Accounts , with individual successors having their own Giving Account5 <p> 1 This provision will expire on 12/31/13 unless extended by U.S. Congress . <p> 2 Traditional IRAs , 401(k)s and 403(b)s may contain after-tax contributions that are not subject to income taxes . If they do , there are special tax rules to determine what portion of a withdrawal is attributable to after-tax contributions . Withdrawals from Roth IRAs , Roth 401(k)s and Roth 403(b)s , along with their associated earnings , are generally free from income taxes if certain conditions are met . <p> 3 Under IRC Sec. 1014 , someone who inherits appreciated property can generally use as its income tax basis the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent 's death . <p> 4 At a public charity with a donor-advised fund program <p> 5 Check with the charity sponsoring the donor-advised fund program to make sure you understand all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any minimum investments . <p> Fidelity Charitable is the brand name for Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund , an independent public charity with a donor-advised fund program .

@@28358087 @2058087/ <h> What is a donor-advised fund ? <p> A simple , flexible and tax-efficient way to give to your favorite charities . <p> A donor-advised fund , or DAF , is a charitable giving vehicle sponsored by a public charity that allows you to make a contribution to that charity and be eligible for an immediate tax deduction , and then recommend grants over time to any IRS-qualified public charity . <p> When you give , you want your charitable contributions to be as effective as possible . Donor-advised funds are the fastest-growing charitable giving vehicle in the United States because they are one of the easiest and most tax-advantageous ways to give to charity . When you donate to your donor-advised fund , you 're making a tax-deductible donation to the organization sponsoring the fund .

A CLT is an irrevocable trust that provides a fixed amount or a percentage of the trust assets paid to a charity , which can sometimes include a private foundation , for a term of years or for the life of an individual or individuals . The remainder interest is either retained by the donor or given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLT is often created for lifetime giving and for estate planning purposes . Generally , the income tax benefits of a CLT may not be as significant as the estate and gift tax benefits , as described below . <p> The tax benefits of a CLT vary depending on its precise form . For income tax purposes , a CLT can be structured as either a grantor trust , meaning the income earned by the trust is taxable to the grantor , or a non-grantor trust , meaning the income earned by the trust is taxable to the trust . <p> In a grantor CLT , the grantor can take an immediate charitable contribution deduction for the present value of the future income stream , subject to applicable percentage limitations depending on whether a public charity or a private foundation is the beneficiary .

So long as the trust 's investments outperform the IRS-assumed rate of return in place at the time the CLT was established , then with carefully calculated lead interest payments , the donor can effectively transfer wealth to his or her heirs with minimal or no gift tax consequence . <p> Although there can be significant tax benefits to establishing a CLT , the donor should be aware of the potential implications of the generation-skipping transfer tax .

@@28358106 @2058106/ <h> Charitable Giving for Procrastinators <h> Anticipatory Assignment of Income <h> Issues for donors after Rauenhorst <p> Although the Rauenhorsts won their case , there is a serious issue buried in the dicta that may affect other donors . The court stated : <p> However , we have indicated our reluctance to elevate the question of donee control to a talisman for resolving anticipatory assignment of income issues . For example , in Allen v. Commissioner Dec. 33,837 , 66 T.C. 340 , 347-348 ( 1976 ) , we stated that the donee 's power to reverse the donor 's anticipated course of disposition was " only one factor to be considered in ascertaining the ' realities and substance ' of the transaction . " Cf. Jones v. United States 76-1 USTC -9247 , 531 F.2d 1343 , 1346 ( 6th Cir. 1976 ) . In a more recent opinion , we further extrapolated our position as follows : <p> In determining the reality and substance of a transfer , the ability , or the lack thereof , of the transferee to alter a prearranged course of disposition with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there existed a fixed right to income at the time of transfer . Although control over the disposition of the transferred property is significant to the assignment of income analysis , the ultimate question is whether the transferor , considering the reality and substance of all the circumstances , had a fixed right to income in the property at the time of transfer . Ferguson v. Commissioner Dec. 52,007 , 108 T.C. at 259 ; citations omitted . <p> This Court has not adopted the " bright- line " test stated in Rev. Rul. 78-197 , supra , as the test for resolving anticipatory assignment of income issues , and instead we have considered the donee 's control to be merely a factor , albeit an important factor . <p> So , the Rauenhorsts won their case under an easier analysis than they might have absent the Service 's acquiescence in Palmer . Were it not for that deemed concession , they would have had to argue under the standard set forth above : the ultimate question is whether the transferor , considering the reality and substance of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property at the time of transfer . <p> For stock held in street name , Ferguson is a reminder that the regulation under Treas . Reg. -1.170A-1(b) still applies , and is especially relevant today where most publicly traded securities are indeed held in book entry form . The regulation reads : <p> Ordinarily , a contribution is made at the time delivery is effected . . . . If a taxpayer unconditionally delivers or mails a properly endorsed stock certificate to a charitable donee or the donee 's agent , the gift is completed on the date of delivery or , if such certificate is received in the ordinary course of the mails , on the date of mailing . If the donor delivers the stock certificate to his bank or broker as the donor 's agent , or to the issuing corporation or its agent , for transfer into the name of the donee , the gift is completed on the date the stock is transferred on the books of the corporation . emphasis added <p> In cases such as Ferguson , Londen , 21 and Morrison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the gift is not effective until the stock transfer is recorded on the books on the corporation . Apparently the courts interpret the last word " corporation " in the regulation to mean either the corporation itself only in the case of delivery to the issuing corporation , but means the brokerage firm if the delivery is to a broker acting as donee 's agent . In Morrison the issue was the value of the stock on the date of the donation , in Londen the issue was the year of the contribution , and in Ferguson the court used this regulation to determine whether the transfer occurred before the gain " ripened " under the assignment of income doctrine . It is worth noting that in Morrison , the donee had actually sold the shares that Mrs. Morrison donated before her gift was deemed complete for her income tax purposes . Again , there was brokerage firm paperwork that was required before the broker could transfer the shares on their books . That was provided several days after the stock was sold . The brokerage firm policy allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as long as the customer 's account executive was satisfied that the customer would be able to deliver the stock . " Although not frequently litigated , this section is a trap for the unwary donor and their advisor . <p> So , when we receive excited that phone call , how do we advise our family member ? What will keep us from being Number Five on the list of leading donation cases above ? <p> If you still have time before the deal closes , and the potential donor is nervous about giving stock to a charity because " the deal might fall through and then I 'd be stuck with the charity as a shareholder , " try this : either set up a right of first refusal agreement , or give the charity a put right . The put right can either be back to the company or to the donor . Charities never want to keep closely held stock they always want cash . ( This works equally well for partnerships and LLCs . ) Having either of those agreements in place does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discount for closely held stock . Unfortunately , neither the donor nor the company can retain a call right on the stock , since that would make the donation incomplete ( and therefore invalidate the deduction ) . <p> If the stock is closely held , review the merger and acquisition documents , comparing them to the ones discussed in Rauenhorst . Assuming that Rev. Rul. 78-197 is still in place , then the test is the one described in it : can the donee be compelled , or are they legally bound , to surrender the shares ? If the Ruling has been withdrawn or modified , then the standard reverts to that discussed in Ferguson above : " Although control over the disposition of the transferred property is significant to the assignment of income analysis , the ultimate question is whether the transferor , considering the reality and substance of all the circumstances , had a fixed right to income in the property at the time of transfer . " This is a much less of a bright-line test , and therefore more likely to give rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rauenhorst and the cases cited in Palmer , and apply professional judgment . <p> If the stock is publicly traded , then review the Ferguson case , with one eye on Treas . Reg. -1.170A-1(b) and the other on the brokerage firm paperwork . If you are dealing with restricted stock or other physical stock certificates , consider delivery of " a properly endorsed certificate to the charitable donee or the donee 's agent " rather than converting the stock to book entry first . This will bring your client clearly within the regulation sooner rather than later . <p> Although there were no law changes recommended by the Senate Finance Committee in its white paper on charitable giving , it is always wise to keep one eye on Washington , since Congress has expressed a great deal of interest lately in the charitable sector . One change under discussion is to tie the donor 's deduction to the amount received by the charity for selling the donated item . This , if enacted , would not be an impediment to last-minute donations , and might even increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the proceeds , then any discount for the possibility of the deal falling through would be eliminated , thus possibly giving a greater deduction than under current law . <p> Above all , move fast .

In March 1992 , Arbeit and NMG , Inc. entered into an agreement whereby Arbeit surrendered preferred stock , a subordinated promissory note and certain previously issued NMG warrants and received in exchange a senior subordinated promissory note , a junior subordinated promissory note , and a warrant which gave Arbeit the right to purchase 772.14 shares of NMG Class A common stock at an exercise price of $1 per share . <p> On September 28 , 1993 , World Color Press , Inc .

The charitable institutions were collectively given the right to purchase 770 shares of NMG .

The letters requested that the agreements be returned by November 18 , 1993 . The donees each signed an agreement dated November 19 , 1993 in which they agreed to sell their warrants to WCP on or before December 31 , 1993 . <p> On November 22 , 1993 , NMG , NMG 's shareholders , and WCP executed an agreement for the purchase of all the issued and outstanding stock of NMG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrants to purchase stock of NMG in a transaction that was closed on December 22 , 1993 . <p> The IRS contended that the donations of warrants to the charitable organizations was an anticipatory assignment of income , and that the Rauenhorsts should have reported capital gain income on the sale of the warrants by the charitable organizations to WCP . <p> The Court held that at the time that Arbeit transferred warrants to the charitable donees , there was no legally operative offer for the purchase of all the issued and outstanding shares of NMG . The letter of intent sent by WCP to NMG did not bind NMG 's stockholders and warrantholders to sell their shares and warrants , and they could not be compelled to do so based on this letter . Therefore , pursuant to Rev. Rul. 78-197 , there was no anticipatory assignment of income and the Rauenhorsts were not required to recognize capital gain income upon the sale of warrants by the charitable donee organizations to WCP . <p> The Tax Court found that the IRS was arguing contrary to its published position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Palmer decision and had stated that it would treat proceeds of a stock redemption under facts similar to those in Palmer as income to the donor only if the donee is legally bound or can be compelled by the corporation to surrender the shares for redemption . The Court found that since the IRS had neither revoked nor modified Rev. Rul. 78-197 , and had continued to rely on this ruling in issuing private letter rulings , the IRS must rely on its own revenue rulings in Tax Court proceedings . Also , the Court found that IRS counsel may not choose to litigate against the officially published rulings of the Commissioner without first withdrawing or modifying those rulings . The IRS has not taken any action on this Revenue Ruling in the two years since this case was decided . <p> So the Rauenhorsts escaped the assignment of income doctrine , and made an effective donation . <p> Notice that the donation took place between the signing of the letter of intent and the agreement to sell the warrants . The letter of intent stated : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for paragraphs 4 , 6 and 7 , does not purport to be and does not constitute a binding agreement among the Buyer , Sellers and the Company , and except as set forth in paragraphs 4 , 6 and 7 , none of us will have any legal obligation to any other hereunder until and unless the Agreement is executed by the Exclusivity Date . <p> This is the last possible safe time to make a donation , since once the agreement to sell was executed , it would not have been possible to transfer anything to charity other than the right to receive cash .

As a result , millions of previously ineligible individuals can now convert assets held in Traditional IRAs , SEP IRAs , SIMPLE IRAs , and workplace savings plans to a Roth IRA . A recent Fidelity Investments survey3 of nearly 500 tax advisors found that advisors believe 43 percent of their clients would benefit from a Roth IRA conversion . <p> While Roth IRAs offer unique benefits , the decision to convert requires careful analysis of an individual 's time horizon , taxable income , and the potential cost of converting . A Roth conversion is a taxable event , therefore , your clients may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they have sufficient funds available in a non-retirement account to pay the associated tax cost . Using proceeds from the conversion to pay taxes reduces the amount available to potentially grow federally tax free and could offset the benefits of converting . <p> Estate planning and charitable giving considerations may also come into play when discussing the pros and cons of a Roth IRA conversion . As you review these issues with your clients , be sure to factor the following charitable planning considerations into the discussion . <h> Offsetting Roth Conversion Income <p> Assets converted to a Roth IRA are considered taxable income in the year of the conversion . While there is a special provision that allows your clients to spread the taxable income from a 2010 Roth conversion over 2011 and 2012 , they should understand there is an upfront cost to a partial or full Roth conversion . In essence , clients are accelerating the payment of future taxes in return for tax-free income later . <p> To reduce the impact of this taxable income , you may want to suggest clients make an offsetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get deductions you would have had in future years and accelerate them into the Roth conversion year , " suggests Professor Chris Hoyt of the University of Missouri ( Kansas City ) Law School . " The easiest way to do that is to be a philanthropist . " Charitable contribution offsets may provide the added benefit of allowing clients to convert a larger percentage of their IRA balance without being bumped into a higher tax bracket . <h> Consider A Donor-Advised Fund <p> While donating to any nonprofit organization will help offset taxable income , one potentially more effective way to achieve federal tax deductions and support charitable causes is by contributing to a public charity that offers a donor-advised fund program . <p> A donor-advised fund ( DAF ) allows clients to make an irrevocable charitable contribution , take an immediate tax deduction , and support their favorite causes in future years . Rather than making a large , one-time donation to a charity , a DAF allows your clients to establish a " ready reserve " of charitable dollars that can be used to recommend grants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Donations can be in the form of cash , publicly traded securities , even private C-corp shares and S-corp shares , depending on the specific DAF program . Donors may be eligible for an immediate federal income tax deduction of up to 50% of adjusted gross income ( AGI ) for cash contributions , or a deduction of up to 30% of AGI for contributions of securities . Donating long-term appreciated securities can be particularly advantageous as capital gains taxation is avoided , resulting in more money for the charity . <p> Making a donation to a charity with a DAF program to offset the tax impact of a Roth conversion benefits both your clients and the charities they support . Clients may be able to convert a larger percentage of their retirement assets to a Roth IRA while remaining in their same tax bracket . As an end result , they minimize the tax cost of their conversion , and secure a pool of money to fund their ongoing charitable giving . <h> Maximizing the Tax Benefits of Previous Donations <p> Certain clients , often times retirees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ways to increase their taxable income . These clients may find they are not getting the full tax benefit of previous charitable contributions because their current income is too low . In such cases , clients can carry forward their unused charitable deductions for five years , after which time they lose the ability to deduct unused donations . <p> A Roth conversion can help clients whose income is too low , claim their unused carryforward deductions or claim other favorable tax attributes . These include net operating loss carryforwards , deductions and exemptions in excess of income , and non-refundable tax credits . In essence , a Roth conversion can help clients " free up " a favorable tax attribute benefit while paying little or no income tax . <p> " Most people who have a charitable contribution carryforward that 's going to expire will find they 'll pay less tax on a Roth conversion , " says Hoyt . <h> Naming a Charitable Organization as an IRA Beneficiary <p> Clients with significant IRA balances may want to consider naming a charity , including a charity with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate planning strategy allows the assets to pass tax-free to a charitable organization at death and effectively removes the assets from the taxable estate . <p> Clients who have already named a charity as a beneficiary on their IRA or who plan to do so may not be good candidates for a Roth conversion . There is no benefit to be gained from paying taxes upfront on assets that would pass tax-free to a charitable organization . <p> " Anyone with a large IRA and charitable bequest intent should likely target their IRA to charity and not worry about a Roth IRA conversion , " says Robert S. Keebler , a partner at Baker Tilly Virchow Krause LLP in Appleton , Wisconsin . <p> In some cases , clients who hold appreciated securities outside of an IRA along with large IRA balances may want to leave money to their children , as well as charity . These clients may consider naming a charity as beneficiary of their IRA , while leaving the appreciated securities to their children . By doing so , their children would receive a step-up in cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $1.3 million of inherited stock is eligible for an immediate step-up . As a result , the inheriting heirs may have a reduced capital gains tax at the time they sell the securities . <p> It 's important to note that distributions from an IRA with a charitable beneficiary will be based on a single-life expectancy , rather than a joint-life expectancy . This means that distributions at death will be accelerated . If a client lists charities as well as a spouse or children as beneficiaries , this would result in higher taxable income for the non-charity beneficiaries . Dividing the assets into two separate IRAs one with a charity as beneficiary and the other with children or other named beneficiaries may avoid this problem . <h> Tread Carefully <p> The potential benefits of Roth conversions are fueling a surge in investor interest .

The other good news is that they have suddenly realized that they have charitable inclination . The bad news is that the liquidity event is next week . The question they always ask is " Can I still make a charitable donation ? " What they mean is " Can I still make a charitable contribution and not pay income tax on the gain included in the value of what I 'm giving ?

The Gold Standard of " effective " 1 donations is Palmer:2 <p> A taxpayer with voting control of a corporation and an exempt private foundation who donates shares of the corporation 's stock to the foundation and , pursuant to a prearranged plan , causes the corporation to redeem the shares from the foundation does not realize income as a result of the redemption . The Service will treat the proceeds as income to the donor under facts similar to those in the Palmer decision only if the donee is legally bound , or can be compelled by the corporation , to surrender the shares for redemption . emphasis added <p> Taxpayers and their advisors rely on this acquiescence in doing " prearranged " charitable planning before redemptions ( or sales ) , often without giving any thought to how extraordinary it is .

Fidelity Charitable , an independent public charity , today released its latest study , The Future of Philanthropy , showing important shifts in how donors look at philanthropy and , ultimately , how giving will change over time . The study is based on a survey of more than 3,200 people who give to charity.2 <p> " The desire to give back and make the world better is an inherent part of American culture and consistent with our values , " said Pamela Norley , president of Fidelity Charitable . <p> " The vast majority of Americans give to charity . Because of this generosity and the dedication of people working to effect change , the nonprofit community is a powerful force for good . What we see in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their giving " with changes that will pick up speed as the giving power of Millennials increases in the years ahead , " Norley continued . <h> Donors identify a wide range of pressing issues , but are not particularly optimistic that their giving alone will solve them . <p> Health and hunger are among the top priorities among a wide range of problems Americans identify as important , and they increasingly think it will take more than just investment in traditional nonprofits to solve them . Less than one-fifth ( 17% ) say that they are " strongly optimistic " that giving alone will lead to fixes for the issues they care most about . They view partnerships between government , business and nonprofits as equally key to developing these solutions . They also think individuals and businesses alike should step up and fund solutions for society 's challenges . <p> " Donors give for a variety of reasons , some of which are deeply personal , " Norley said . " However , to tackle the issues they care about , they increasingly believe in the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government , universities , and religious institutions will all need to evolve to meet those changing expectations if they want to keep the support of these individuals . " <p> The past 20 years have been a time of rapid change for philanthropy , with 60% of donors citing at least one way that their giving has changed . Donors are more results-focused , with 41% saying they have changed their giving due to increased knowledge about nonprofit effectiveness . <p> Nearly a third of donors ( 27% ) say that technological advances have changed their giving by providing convenient tools to research , find and fund organizations . <p> About a fifth ( 21% ) say their giving has been affected by changing views on generational wealth or increased access to charitable planning services or giving vehicles ( 18% ) . <h> Millennials and Baby Boomers are both significant forces in giving today " but as Millennials grow in influence , they will likely transform giving . <p> Millennials and Baby Boomers agree on the challenges society should address " both prioritize health and hunger issues " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more likely to focus on issues in the U.S. , while Millennials focus on challenges both at home and abroad . <p> Millennials also approach giving in fundamentally different ways . Compared to Baby Boomers , Millennials have more readily embraced the trends that define their generation " the adoption of technology , a social approach to donations , and viewing giving more broadly than just traditional donations to charity . <p> " We see Baby Boomers and Millennials defining two very different approaches to living generously , " Norley said . " One is more traditional and locally focused , and the other takes a more expansive view . " <h> Key differences between generations : <p> Global focus : 47% of Millennials are equally concerned about domestic and international issues , compared with 36% of Baby Boomers . <p> Adoption of technology in giving : Compared to Baby Boomers , Millennials are more than twice as likely to have changed their giving approach due to technological advances in giving ( 49% to 23% ) . <p> Social giving : A third of Millennials have been influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twice the number of Boomers ( 30% to 11% ) . <p> Giving differently : Millennials are three times more likely than Boomers to have tried alternative forms of giving , such as choosing to purchase from a company with a social mission or investing for social impact ( 32% to 14% ) . <p> " As we look to the future , all of these trends point to donors becoming more hands on with their giving , not less , " Norley said . " Americans will continue to prioritize giving and integrate their approach to philanthropy even more fully into their daily lives . With this focus on effectiveness , they 'll become even more thoughtful about where and how they give , driving a need and demand for resources to help them .

@@28358145 @2058145/ <h> Donating Complex Assets to Charity <h> An Effective and Tax-Efficient Way to Make More of a Difference <p> Americans have always been known for their generosity and devotion to giving . But most Americans donate cash when there are more tax-advantageous assets to give assets that will enable individuals to make a larger charitable impact . That 's why it may be helpful to think outside the box when it comes to putting together a personal giving plan . <p> Typically , cash and appreciated publicly traded securities such as stocks , bonds , and mutual funds are the two types of assets used in individual charitable giving , but that is n't always the case . Increasingly , donors are leveraging a broader spectrum of their assets , such as restricted stock and privately held securities , for charitable purposes . In addition , continued strength in the mergers and acquisitions market also is a sign of more strategic charitable planning on the part of donors and their advisors . This is exciting , as these types of assets have powerful tax advantages . <p> For many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , restricted stock , limited partnership interests , and other privately held assets may be an effective and tax-efficient method of giving . These types of assets , also referred to as complex assets , often have a relatively low cost basis ( i.e. , original cost ) for the donor and in the cases of entrepreneurs who have founded companies , the cost basis may effectively be zero and a significant current market value that would result in large capital gains taxes if sold . When such an asset is donated to a public charity in the correct and optimal manner , the donor not only minimizes any potential capital gains exposure , but is also generally entitled to claim a tax deduction of the full current market value1 ( and not just the original cost basis ) . This tax treatment offers significant benefits at the federal level , and frequently at the state and local levels as well . <p> Contributing complex assets to charity , however , can be complicated and is fraught with technical requirements and potential pitfalls . Fortunately , there are organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , as well as offer valuable planning and technical assistance . One of the largest of these organizations and one offering several unique advantages is Fidelity Charitable , an independent public charity with a donor-advised fund program ( " DAF " ) . Donating complex assets to a DAF , like Fidelity Charitable offers , makes the process easy and typically more financially advantageous for the receiving charities . <h> Options for Donating Complex Assets <p> Once the privately held assets to be donated have been identified ( see the call-out box below for a list of assets in this category ) , donors and their advisors typically devise a detailed plan outlining immediate and long-term charitable goals , and then consider what would be the best method for donating the assets to realize these goals . <p> They often quickly find that their options are limited . Many nonprofit organizations , being primarily mission- and program-focused , are not well equipped to handle this type of contribution , and therefore might require that a donor first sell the assets and contribute the proceeds . A donor in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most cases , choose to donate the entire amount of the proceeds , but rather would deduct his/her " cost " to liquidate ( including both selling costs and the tax incurred ) and then donate the net proceeds thereby reducing the total amount of the charitable contribution . In this situation , the donor would also only be able to claim a deduction for the amount of the resulting cash contribution , rather than the fair market value of the contributed asset prior to liquidation . Furthermore , while some charitable organizations might have some limited experience in handling contributions of complex assets , the cost to the charity to outsource the compliance and liquidation work can be considerable . Although the donor would still be eligible to claim a fair market value deduction , the net result to the charity would once again be significantly reduced . <p> Some donors also consider creating a private foundation , but find even greater complexity , even more obstacles , and higher costs similarly reducing the amount of money that eventually reaches the donor 's chosen charities . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally limited to the original cost basis for deduction purposes , rather than the current market value . Donating these types of assets to private foundations is further complicated by IRS rules and regulations related to " self-dealing , " " jeopardizing investments , " and " excess business holdings . " <p> In many cases , an optimal method for donating complex assets to charity measured by cost , flexibility , simplicity , and tax benefits to the donor , as well as by maximizing the net proceeds ultimately made available to charitable organizations is to make the contribution to a charity that offers donoradvised funds . Most of the larger donor-advised fund programs in the United States , including the one offered by Fidelity Charitable , have the requisite expertise and dedicated professional resources to work with donors and their advisors directly to maximize the giving power of these assets . Most acceptance decisions can be made within a few days once the necessary information is received . <h> How a DAF Works <p> For those who may not be familiar with the concept , some public charities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make irrevocable contributions to the charity , and the charity then establishes an account from which the donor is able to recommend grants to other eligible charities generally speaking , IRS-qualified 501(c) ( 3 ) public charities from the balance in their DAF account . <p> The benefits of the donor-advised fund are numerous . First , donors are able to make a charitable contribution and are eligible for a tax deduction on that contribution , in a specific year , while spacing out their grants over a period of years2 . Donors are permitted , of course , to make further contributions at any time , but having the balance in place in their DAF means that they can engage in longer-term charitable giving , allowing them to maintain a certain level of giving regardless of changing financial circumstances a critical point for both donors and their recommended charities during challenging economic times . <h> Types of Complex Assets that Can Be Donated to Charity <p> Private Company Stock <p> S-Corp <p> C-Corp <p> Restricted Stock <p> LLC and Limited Partnership Interests <p> Real Estate <p> Pre-IPO Shares <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capital Assets <p> Certain Alternative Investments <p> Second , individuals who create a donor-advised fund are typically also able to recommend how those funds should be invested . Many DAFs offer a variety of investment pools that allow donors to recommend the investment style that fits best with their time horizon for recommending charitable grants Growth , Fixed Income , Money Market , or Blended investments . The funds that have been contributed to the DAF have the opportunity thereafter to grow tax free4 . In addition , DAF programs provide consolidated tax reporting for the year 's contributions , eliminating paperwork for the donor and simplifying and improving compliance with IRS requirements . <p> DAFs are simple , fl exible , and cost effective . They help donors achieve strategic , thoughtful giving for themselves and , in many cases , for their entire family . Often , in fact , donor-advised funds are established in the name of a donor 's family ; by planning for charitable contributions and grants over a period of time one year , five years , ten years , or more families can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a DAF <p> In the specific case of donating complex assets , once they are contributed , the sponsoring charity of the DAF , as the legal owner of the assets , has the responsibility for liquidating the complex assets in compliance with IRS rules and regulations including handling all legal review of documents and IRS reporting . This enables the grant-receiving charitable organizations to focus on what they do best fulfilling the organization 's charitable mission rather than overseeing an often-complicated financial and legal process and being responsible for " getting it right " both for the donor and for themselves . Also , and as previously mentioned , the donation of complex assets to a public charity means that donors themselves realize no capital gain , and thus pay no capital gains tax5 . This helps ensure that the highest possible percentage of the funds from the sale of the asset or assets actually goes to the chosen charitable organizations . <p> Perhaps best of all , by donating complex assets to establish a DAF , these donors are able to diversify their giving with one asset in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different charities , as opposed to donating the asset ( or assets ) to one nonprofit organization or going through a transfer agent to break up the asset to facilitate multiple gifts . The experienced charitable giving professionals at the DAF program are able to do this work for the donor . <h> Fidelity Charitable and Its Mission <p> Fidelity Charitable offers the nation 's largest donor-advised fund program and is one of the nation 's largest public charities6 . <p> The Fidelity Charitable mission is to further the American tradition of philanthropy by providing programs that make charitable giving simple and effective . Among DAF providers , Fidelity Charitable has one of the lowest annual fees ( currently 0.6 percent ) and one of the lowest minimum initial contribution requirements ( currently $5,000 , though it can be higher for complex asset donations ) . Fidelity Charitable does not charge a direct fee7 for helping its donors contribute complex assets ( only unrelated business income tax , if applicable , actual carrying and maintenance costs , and certain tax preparation consultancy costs are taken from the proceeds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees , however , Fidelity Charitable offers a level of expertise in this area matched by few organizations in the United States . <p> The goal of Fidelity Charitable is to make charitable giving as easy and painless as possible , both for the donor and for the donor 's lawyers and/or advisors . This is especially relevant in connection with contributions of complex assets and , according to our donors and their advisors , we are succeeding at this goal . <h> What Fidelity Charitable Donors and Their Advisors Say8 <p> One of these advisors is Joseph Crocker , CFP , CIMA , and Managing Director of Chess Financial Corporation , who worked with Fidelity Charitable to help accept a donation of private S-Corp stock on behalf of his entrepreneur client . According to Crocker , " This was my and Chess 's first foray into this type of transaction and , working with Fidelity Charitable , it was a smooth process from beginning to end smooth , above all , because of the follow-through at every step of the way by Fidelity Charitable . Nothing fell through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table helped turn a transaction that I think can be a nine or a ten , in terms of difficulty , into about a three . " <p> Steven C.

In his words , as he prepared to sell his interest in the privately held company , " I wanted to create an ongoing charitable concern , something to serve as a legacy for me and my whole family . I thought first of establishing a private foundation , but found there were two problems : one , that donating privately held stock to a private foundation is not a tax-efficient option ; and two , that the administrative challenges were considerable and expensive .

For a more lasting effect , a better approach may be to focus on long-term assistance , such as emergency risk prevention and disaster preparedness . <p> Nevertheless , many people give aid in disaster situations , unsure of where or even when they can make the greatest difference . As with any charitable objective , planning begins with some advance thinking about when and where to give and how to have the most impact . <h> When To Give <p> Particularly with disaster relief , it 's important to remember that the opportunity to make a difference does not end when media coverage dies down . Rather , there are four phases of relief work : From the first , which begins as soon as disaster strikes , through the fourth , continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each phase is characterized by specific goals and requires varying amounts of support in terms of both dollars and time . Phase 1 begins immediately , focusing on restoring order to the area . Phase 2 quickly follows as residents work toward stabilization and a return to daily activities . Phases 3 and 4 are marked by community-led rebuilding and ongoing preparedness education in order to mitigate future catastrophe by building better and creating an informed population . <h> The Four Phases of Disaster Relief <p> Phase 1 : Immediate <p> Phase 2 : Intermediate <p> Phase 3 : Long term <p> Phase 4 : Disaster preparedness <p> Time frame <p> Day of disaster 6 months after <p> Days after disaster 1 to 2 years after <p> Weeks/months after disaster 5 to 15 years after <p> Ongoing/continuous <p> Goal <p> Short term triage to establish order <p> Stabilization <p> Rebuilding for a better future <p> Emergency risk reduction and prevention <p> Services provided <p> Rescue , medical attention , food , water , temporary shelter <p> Food , water , long-term shelter , sanitation , healthcare , return to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstruction of communities <p> Training , policy and procedure creation , relationship building among service providers and communities <p> Media <p> Extensive coverage ; high emotional pull <p> Coverage declines as first emergency efforts dissipate <p> Coverage continues to decline <p> Little coverage ; no emotional pull <h> Where To Give <p> Perhaps the most challenging question facing donors looking to contribute to any cause is that of which organization to support . This is especially important in disaster relief , and is often a decision made with little research due to the immediacy of the need and the overwhelming number of charities that spring up in the days following the event . <p> Even without investing a lot of time , donors can still make educated choices . It 's important that a charity have demonstrated expertise and a track record of success in the affected region . Donors can look through the organization 's web site , consult third party philanthropic media , or contact the organization 's staff for information about its work in the affected area . <p> Inherent to the question of where to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is local , national , or international . One approach is to think about the phase in which the donor is giving . <p> Phase 1 support may be better implemented by national or international organizations able to assemble resources from unaffected areas and those that have the knowledge and capacity to act immediately and with impact . More often than not , local relief groups are immobilized along with the rest of the population , making national or international charities more effective beneficiaries of donations in the early days after a disaster . <p> Donors may wish to reevaluate their giving once local organizations are up and running , which typically begins in Phase 2 . These indigenous groups have valuable relationships and a unique understanding of the affected area in which they operate , enabling them to offer applicable and efficient solutions . Their operation is also a source of job creation for the region as many are staffed by residents of the community . <p> Other donors wishing to avoid this level of additional research may prefer to continue directing their support to the national or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations that provide programs directly , look for a track record of success in the affected area and staffing by locals . For indirect program providers that function as intermediary charities , donors should understand the funding relationship between the organizations . It 's not unusual for the intermediate charity to retain a percentage of each gift . While this may be acceptable , it 's worth investigating as the percentages can vary widely . <h> How To Have More Impact <p> Taking the time to become educated and make informed decisions about when and where to lend support is the first step in making a powerful impact in the area of disaster relief . <p> Another important consideration is the ultimate end use of charitable gifts . When supporting Phase 1 relief through large organizations operating in many regions , donors should specify their intent in order to ensure that monies are directed to work related to a particular disaster . <p> As relief work continues and becomes less focused on triage , the need for flexible funds arises , ideally in the form of unrestricted gifts . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . In Phases 2 and 3 , unrestricted gifts may be more helpful to the organization 's ability to provide ongoing support to the affected region . <p> Even if a donor refocuses their support to local organizations , it may be appropriate to make unrestricted gifts . These groups typically have a narrower focus to their missions and these flexible funds allow strong management teams to put the money where it 's most needed . <p> Flexibility is also desirable when contributing to national and international organizations . Donors should consider designating their gifts for work in a specific region rather than for a particular disaster . For instance , a gift earmarked for the Gulf Coast instead of for Hurricane Katrina aid allows charities to use the money toward activities like community rebuilding , disaster preparedness training , or in case another disaster strikes the area . <p> Studies show that many disasters are recurring the Gulf Coast will be hit time and again by hurricanes , California will be plagued by earthquakes and wildfires , and Southern Asia will experience monsoonal rain . While donors can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the timing , recipients , and designations of contributions , donors can make a lasting impact on the lives of those affected . 107110 @qwx307110 107111 @qwx307111

@@28358166 @2058166/ <h> Can I make a pledge with a donor-advised fund ? <p> Q : In honor of our 25th reunion , my former classmates are organizing a class gift to fund financial aid scholarships at our university . They are asking for a 5-year pledge of support , and I 'd like to contribute . Can I use my donor-advised fund ? <p> A : What a wonderful opportunity to make a difference for the next generation of students at your alma mater ! The good news is that , while a donor-advised fund grant can not be used to fulfill your legally binding pledge , you can still support your reunion class gift with your Giving Account , said Stephanie Young , a leader on Fidelity Charitable 's grants team . Young and the other members of the grants team work with donors and nonprofits to ensure that more than 830,000 grant recommendations annually are appropriately reviewed and that the funds are distributed for charitable purposes . <p> Why a pledge is off the tableand what to do instead <p> The Internal Revenue Code prohibits donor-advised fund grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donors or related parties , which can trigger penalty taxes on donors and others , Young explained . Fidelity Charitable does not make grants that would relieve a donor 's ( or another party 's ) financial obligation , such as a legally enforceable pledge . But if you have n't made a legally binding commitment , you can certainly recommend a grant in support of your non-binding " pledge . " Simply select the category " Pledge ( non-binding ) " from the menu of options when you are recommending the grant , Young said . You will have the option to describe the purpose of the grantin this case , to support your class reunion 's scholarship project . <p> It 's also a good idea to keep verbal communications vague ; do n't promise a particular amount , as in some states , a verbal commitment is considered binding . If you or the nonprofits you support have questions about what you can or can not do with a donor-advised fund , the Fidelity Charitable service team is happy to help . <p> Q : But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee wants something in writing ? <p> A : In that case , Young said , you can supply them with a non-binding letter of intent . This way , you can indicate your plans to recommend a grant over the next five years without making a formal legal commitment . <p> Even if the nonprofit does n't specifically request something in writing , it 's always a nice idea to tell them of your intentions , Young added . Knowing how much donors intend to contribute in the future , for what purpose and for how long helps nonprofits budget appropriately . <p> Here is sample language that can be used any time this issue comes up : <p> SAMPLE LANGUAGE FOR A NON-BINDGING LETTER OF INTENTI/We intend to recommend a grant from the name of donor-advised fund , a donor-advised fund , in the amount of $ during the year 20 /annually for the years 20-20 . Grant recommendations are subject to the approval of name of public charity sponsoring the donor-advised fund . This expression of intent does not create a legally enforceable obligation . <p> Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contributions <p> Sometimes , Young advised , if you plan to support a charity or project over a period of years , it may be helpful to take advantage of some of the other features of a Fidelity Charitable donor-advised fund . You can set up a recurring grant recommendation so the funds get distributed to your alma mater on a regular schedule . You can choose whether this is monthly , quarterly , twice a year or on an annual basis . <p> Similarly , you can set up recurring contributions to your donor-advised fund from a checking or brokerage account . This is an easy way to spread the funding of your charitable contributions over time . <p> Supporting education-related charities , including universities , is one of the most popular ways that Fidelity Charitable donors make a difference , Young said .

@@28358176 @2058176/ <p> A Roth conversion may make sense for an individual who expects higher taxes in the future , has a long investment timeframe ( more than 5 years ) , and can pay the tax cost of the conversion with non-retirement dollars . <p> While the rules for Roth IRA conversions were changed several years ago to make most taxpayers eligible to convert IRAs and other retirement assets to Roth IRAs , the ability to convert assets in 401(k)s , 403(b)s , thrift savings plans and 457(b) plans to their Roth counterpart was very limited . However , provisions in The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 now permit these plans to allow in-plan Roth conversions at any age . Within this article , the term " Roth conversion " refers to converting an IRA to a Roth IRA , as well as in-plan Roth conversions in 401(k)s , 403(b)s , thrift savings plans and 457(b) plans . <p> With all the factors to weigh , often times , the very first question asked by an individual considering a conversion is , " What is this going to cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion can be overwhelming and people want to know what actions they can take to reduce it . <p> One possible strategy to reducing the tax cost of a Roth conversion is to make an offsetting charitable donation .

Recently , CARE also began support to refugees in Europe .

Amid this chaos , the specific challenges and needs of refugee women and girls are often overlooked . Women and girls often leave Syria because of gender-based violence , such as rape , abuse , and trafficking , but then experience it en route to and within the countries to which they have fled . Services such as gender-neutral toilets and washing facilities at refugee transit sites often are unsafe for women , particularly after dark , causing many to refrain from eating and drinking . <p> To address this issue , organizations such as the Women 's Refugee Commission provide guidance for nations bordering Syria , refugee transit sites , and European countries on the specific protection needs of women .

' " Esmark v. Commissioner.4 However , in Esmark and other cases , the courts have indicated that the step transaction doctrine is limited to combining " individually meaningless steps . " It can not be used to invent steps that never occurred or reorder actual steps , merely because a different transaction or different order might result in a greater amount of tax . These principles are illustrated in the following leading cases . <p> The Court of Claims stated in Sheppard v. United States5 ( a case in which the taxpayer donated two-thirds interest in a horse to charity , with the plan that his closely held corporation would purchase the interests from the charities as soon as possible ) : <p> Defendant asks too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the reality of plaintiff 's gifts and the subsequent purchase by The Farms , there was nonetheless a sale by plaintiff to The Farms of his entire interest in Star 's Pride . Such an application of the doctrine would twist two actual transactions into two transactions which never in fact occurred , a sort of " let 's pretend " approach . But , as Mr. Justice Holmes once remarked , " a fiction is not a satisfactory reason for changing men 's rights or liabilities . " Holmes , Collected Legal Papers , 49 ( 1921 ) . Useful as the step transaction doctrine may be in the interpretation of equivocal contracts and ambiguous events , it can not generate events that never took place just so an additional tax liability might be asserted . <p> This holding was cited with approval in another charitable donation case , Grove v. Commissioner , 6 in which a taxpayer donated shares of his wholly owned company , and then had his company redeem them from the charity . <p> We are not so naive as to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But foresight and planning do not transform a non-taxable event into one that is taxable . Were we to adopt the Commissioner 's view , we would be required to recast two actual transactions a gift by Grove to RPI and a redemption from RPI by the Corporation into two completely fictional transactions " a redemption from Grove by the Corporation and a gift by Grove to RPI . Based upon the facts as found by the Tax Court , we can discover no basis for elevating the Commissioner 's " form " over that employed by the taxpayer in good faith . " Useful as the step transaction doctrine may be in the interpretation of equivocal contracts and ambiguous events , it can not generate events which never took place just so an additional tax liability might be asserted . " Sheppard v. United States66-1 USTC -9461 , 386 Ct . Cl. 982 , 361 F.2d 972 supra , at 987 1966. 490 F.2d at 247-248 . <p> In Esmark , the IRS sought to recharacterize a tender offer by Mobil and a redemption by Esmark for shares of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vickers stock to Mobil , followed by a self-tender by Esmark for its own stock . The Tax Court rejected that approach because it did not attempt to combine meaningless steps , but instead attempted to invent new ones . Citing Grove , the court concluded that the step transaction doctrine could n't be applied to create fictional steps just so an additional tax liability may be asserted . The IRS and Tax Court again took the same approaches in Tracinda Corporation v. Commissioner , 7 the Service attempted to add steps to the transaction , and the Tax Court held that they could not do so . <p> In Palmer v. Commissioner , 8 the Tax Court addressed whether a corporation 's redemption of stock from a foundation immediately after a donation was an illusory transaction and an intermediary step of a single , integrated transaction . ( The detailed steps are outlined below in the " assignment of income " section . ) The Tax Court held : <p> ... If the entire interest in the property is transferred and the assignor retains no incidence of either direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests on the assignee .... Even though the donor anticipated or was aware that the redemption was imminent , the presence of an actual gift and the absence of an obligation to have the stock redeemed have been sufficient to give such gifts independent significance .... We have found that the foundation was not a sham , was not an alter ego of the petitioner , and that it received their entire interest in the 238 shares of the corporation stock .... Thereafter , the foundation voted for the redemption . It did so because the redemption was in its interest . At the time of the gift , that vote had not yet been taken , and by the afternoon of August 31 , 1966 , the foundation had the voting power to prevent the redemption , if it wished to do so . In these circumstances , at the time of the gift , the redemption had not proceeded far enough along for us to conclude that the foundation was powerless to reverse the plans of the petitioner . In light of the presence of an actual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we hold that the gift of stock was not in substance a gift of the proceeds of redemption . <p> From the cases above , we can determine that if we do our paperwork correctly , donating the shares and having the donee independently sell them to the purchaser or in the public market , an attack by the Service under the step transaction doctrine can be rebutted . The same would apply if the shares were to be submitted to the issuing company for redemption . Of course , the more steps that are necessary to accomplish the transaction , the more risk that the Service could successfully convince a court to delete some of them , assuming that would give rise to a tax liability . <p> However , many last minute donations are not at risk from the application of the step transaction doctrine , especially if they are simply a donation of stock followed by a public sale of the stock by the charitable donee .

Compared with donating cash , or selling your appreciated securities and contributing the after-tax proceeds , you may be able to automatically increase your gift and your tax deduction . <h> How does it work ? <p> It 's simple and easy .

And because you are donating stock , your contribution and tax deduction may instantly increase over 20%1 . Would you prefer to donate bonds or mutual funds ? The same benefits apply . <h> A larger gift and a larger deduction <p> Consider this example of donating stock to charity with a Giving Account at Fidelity Charitable : <p> 1This assumes all realized gains are subject to the maximum federal long-term capital gains tax rate of 20% and the Medicare surtax of 3.8% , and that the donor originally planned to sell the stock and contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare surtax ) to charity . <p> 2Total Cost Basis of Shares is the amount of money you have invested in the shares of a particular fund or individual security .

@@28358203 @2058203/ <h> CREATING A CHARITABLE MISSION STATEMENT <h> Four ways a mission statement can help you give with greater impact <p> What inspires you to give ? How do you want to make a difference in the world ? Answering questions like these is the first step toward writing a charitable mission statement . Doing so can be a powerful way to make your giving more meaningful " both for your personal fulfillment and for the people and communities you 're working to support . <h> What is a charitable mission statement ? <p> A charitable mission statement is typically one to three sentences that puts the purpose of your giving into words . Your values , life experiences , interests , and close relationships can all play a role in helping you decide what your mission is . " A charitable mission statement is designed to crystallize what is most important to you in your giving , " says Elaine Martyn , vice president of the Private Donor Group at Fidelity Charitable . " It 's one of the best and easiest ways to make giving more fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four reasons why a creating a charitable mission statement is important . <p> It gives your giving focus <p> We all have many things that we care about , and there are many charities that we could potentially support . But by identifying what you care about most , you are better able to decide where to focus your time and financial support . " Just like any other aspect of your life , prioritizing helps you be more successful , " Martyn says . Rather than scattering resources across many areas , which dilutes the impact of your support , you can achieve something meaningful . <h> Having a mission is energizing <p> Putting your mission into words can strengthen your connection to it , says Martyn . " It 's much more fun to give when you know you are actually doing something purposeful with your giving . " Having a purpose is motivating and inspires you to take concrete steps to achieve your vision . For example , if your top priority is to help the homeless , perhaps you 'll contact the local homeless shelter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more informed about what is the most effective way to help homeless people . <h> It helps you decide when to say " no " <p> With so many year-end appeals , mailed solicitations , and requests from friends and colleagues , there 's always another worthy cause to give to . Your mission statement can help you filter these requests through the lens of what 's really important to you . Martyn recommends following an 80/20 rule for requests from friends , families , or other situations that just come up . " You can set aside some funds to support the things that are important to others you care about or to respond to a situation that really moves you , " she says . " But reserve the bulk of your giving for the things that really matter to you . " <h> You can make a greater impact over time <p> With your mission statement as your guide , it becomes possible to set actionable goals for what you would like your giving to accomplish over the next five years , ten years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the organizations you truly want to support , but also how you might want to support them . For example , if your mission is to advance the arts , instead of sending general support to your university , you might support the studio arts program or a project that brings visiting artists to campus to meet with students and create new work . <p> Over time , you 'll start to see your vision being realized . And giving is always more rewarding when you know your contributions are producing real results , both for the organizations you care about and the problem or issue you want your giving to help solve . <h> Taking the first step <p> Ultimately , a charitable mission statement is intended to help you make the most of your giving . It 's a reflection of your values that can anchor your efforts and keep you on track toward your goals . " The important thing is to just get something down in writing , " Martyn says . " You can always evolve it over time . But most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise really transforms how they feel about their giving for the better . " <h> Share This : <p> " Our primary interest in giving is to ensure that we are taking care of the veterans who have served our country .

@@28358207 @2058207/ <h> Getting Started : Evaluating Charities <p> The needs of veterans and their families are vast and complex . Government departments such as Defense and Veterans Affairs , while providing a tremendous amount of support to veterans and their families , have been challenged in recent years to meet the enormous needs of this sector . Philanthropy is a key resource to complement government efforts and address unmet needs to improve services to veteran-related causes . <p> When I first approached this space , I had heard that giving to veteran-related charities is not straightforward , but did not know why . To learn more , I reached out to experts on veterans and military philanthropy for their advice . <p> We know all good grant making has its challenges , but through my conversations with these experts , I discovered that veterans philanthropy is extremely challenging . Let me explain : donors to this sector , unlike in many other types of philanthropy , must account for the " double heart . " The desire to help individuals ( one heart ) is compounded by feelings of patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less critical donor decision-making , which also supports numbers of charities flourishing despite less effective programs and management . Only when we strip away much of the emotion and look at the complex problems veterans face with a critical eye can we as donors make the lasting difference we seek . <p> Below are four of the most important things I have learned about veterans philanthropy. <h> 1 . Focus on reintegration . <p> Veterans returning home from service face a range of issues , from cultural reintegration to adjusting to life with a serious medical issue . However , veterans philanthropy often focuses on thanking veterans for their service , and does not address the more pressing challenge of helping veterans successfully and sustainably transition back into civilian life . <p> To address reintegration , experts recommend stepping back to take a holistic view , determining whether the organization focuses on short-term needs or solves for the long-term issues that affect veterans . <p> " Consider the incentives that programs create . Much of veterans philanthropy is sentimental in nature , thanking veterans for their service . This feel-good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy reintegration . Philanthropists should ultimately ask themselves if their grants empower veterans to realize their potential and give veterans the tools to succeed as self-reliant civilians . " <p> Thomas Meyer , The Philanthropy Roundtable <p> " We need to spend more time focusing on engagement strategies that prevent and intervene early rather than focusing on the end result like homelessness and residential treatment programs . While these services are needed , more effort and attention needs to be placed on the front end so that we can have an impact on homelessness , substance abuse , and other issues that disproportionately affect veterans . " <p> " The challenges veterans facewhether finding meaningful employment , reentering formal education , accessing medical care , or reconnecting with family and communityshould be addressed in ways that recognize their tremendous potential , and develop their significant talents . " <p> Thomas Meyer , The Philanthropy Roundtable <h> 2 . Act locally . <p> Reintegration is about supporting these well trained individuals in the communities where they live . While veterans receive support from the federal government , some of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in collaboration with other groups . It is best to approach veterans philanthropy by focusing on issues you know best , with solutions that are implemented locally , in your target community . <p> " When thinking about veterans philanthropy , consider collective impact groupssmall groups of stakeholders who have the resources and existing relationships to work well together and play to the strengths of the community . These groups are flexible and dynamic , and use data to refine their strategies to become effective agents for community change . Collective impact initiatives can help guide community practitioners , build networks , inform policy , and identify broadly applicable and effective solutions that rely on promising preventive strategies . " <p> " Start with what you know and bring that expertise to bear on the challenges and opportunities facing veterans and military families . Rather than considering veterans a wholly separate category of grant making , think about how your overall giving strategy might benefit from adding a veterans component . <p> In areas where veterans are disproportionately affected by certain challenges , smart giving can allow service providers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking advantage of preexisting human service infrastructure can make for more effective and inexpensive interventions . <p> Recognizing your niche and built-in expertise as a funder can also help narrow what may seem like an overwhelming field .

" <p> Thomas Meyer , The Philanthropy Roundtable <h> 3 . Give with heartand head . <p> With any philanthropy , it is sometimes difficult to cut through emotion and assess causes with a critical eye . With veteran-related issues , assessment is even more challenging : donors give to veterans issues not only because we care about the cause , but also because it demonstrates our patriotism and gratitude for veterans service the " double heart " challenge that I mentioned . <p> However , it is crucial that donors assess this space with the same clear head with which they assess other charitable causes , looking for a charitys impact and outcomes . <p> " Focus on outcomes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophistication , particularly around evaluation . For this reason , donors should pay particular attention to measurement not only of the services delivered , but the outcomes achieved by the programs they support . Beyond ensuring their own dollars are well spent , donors understanding of which programs work for what reasons will be tremendously helpful to peers and service providers in this fast-developing space . " <p> Thomas Meyer , The Philanthropy Roundtable <p> " There is a critical need to develop a new and coordinated set of policies , practices , and programs to create a comprehensive , effective , and efficient system that empowers all constituents to deliver extraordinary services to our veterans and their families . Veterans philanthropy would benefit from investment in a stable and trusted collective impact group that plays a catalytic role in building a supportive environment , acting as the touchstone for creating more efficient and coordinated community support systems , focused on prevention and early intervention for veterans and their families .

Contributions for the year totaled $3.3 billion , with over 62,000 contributions received . <p> As we reflect on this activity , three factors stand out . First , there is a growing awareness and use of donor-advised funds among philanthropically-minded households . A growing trend of donors choosing donor-advised funds in place of or as a complement to private foundations has driven an increasing number of large contributions . <p> At the same time , our complex assets team has been working actively to build understanding among advisors and donors on how to monetize assets they may not have previously thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million of complex asset contributions which are now available for grant recommendations .

Recognizing the expanding role advisors play in developing philanthropic strategies , we established a dedicated service team for advisors , and we continue to provide educational seminars to advisors across the country . Our support for donors is focused on grantmaking and includes educational seminars , access to nonprofit research , and online options such as grant designations , establishing recurring grants and state-of-the-art grant history functionality . <p> We are very fortunate to have a base of active and generous donors , and truly appreciate the opportunity to support you in your philanthropic efforts .

This vision will guide your decisions regarding the organizations you support and provide a benchmark for measuring your success . <h> Step 1 : Determine Your Giving Goals <h> Review Your Giving History <p> Begin by reflecting on why and how you have given in the past . Understanding your charitable history can give you valuable insights into your own giving patterns and practices . As you assess your history and articulate your goals for the future , you can decide what practices you wish to continue and which , if any , you would like to change . <p> Some questions to consider : <p> How frequently do you give ?

@@28358269 @2058269/ <h> Fidelity Charitable Releases First-Time Report on Donor Activity <h> Offers Insight into DAF Donors ' Giving , Approach to Philanthropy <p> BOSTON , June 10 , 2013 A new report offers the first detailed view into the demographics and giving patterns of more than 94,000 individuals who advise on donor-advised funds at Fidelity Charitable , an independent public charity that operates a national donor-advised fund ( DAF ) program . While the organization 's donor base is diverse hailing from all 50 states and ranging in age from under 25 to over 95 a picture of the typical donor emerges as a mature individual living in a major metropolitan area who actively supports philanthropic causes . <p> " Our donors are active and engaged supporters of philanthropy , " said Sarah Libbey , president of Fidelity Charitable . " A key driver behind releasing the Fidelity Charitable Giving Report is to provide the nonprofit organizations we support with an inside look at how these donors approach philanthropy . That insight can help them tap the growing popularity of DAFs . " <h> DAFs Averaged Seven Outgoing Grants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 57,000 Giving Accounts , many of which have more than one individual with advisory privileges , Fidelity Charitable 's donors have a wide range of philanthropic priorities , personal styles , and time horizons . The common thread is that their donor-advised funds help them make more of a difference to the causes that matter to them . <p> To provide insight into how donors use their accounts over time , one dataset reviewed is Giving Accounts established prior to 2007 . In this dataset , nearly 22 percent of donors recommended grants totaling almost the entire balance of their account , leaving a balance of $200 or less , by the end of 2012 . Of the remaining 78 percent of donors , 70 percent recommended grants in at least five of the past seven years and the other 30 percent still actively supported their favorite charities , recommending grants amounting to 69 percent of their total contributions by year-end 2012 . <p> In 2012 , the average number of grants per Giving Account continued a steady rise , reaching nearly seven grants per year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million was granted in amounts of $50,000 or more . <p> Over the past decade , the total volume of grants has grown each year , nearly tripling from 154,000 in 2003 to 429,000 in 2012 . Even during the worst years of the financial crisis ( 2008-2009 ) , there was still a slight increase in grant volume and over $1 billion was granted out each year . The consistent number of outgoing grants through the financial crisis demonstrates that donors use their accounts as a " ready reserve " of funds to maintain their charitable impact during challenging economic times . <p> The number of scheduled grant recommendations grants recommended in advance and/or recommended for distribution on a recurring basis has risen at an even faster clip than overall grants , showing donors ' planned-giving approach . In 2012 , scheduled grant recommendations accounted for 21 percent of all grants , up from 17 percent in 2008 . <p> While donors support a wide range of nonprofits Fidelity Charitable has made grants to more than 160,000 public charities one trend the majority follow is supporting charities close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the primary account holder 's home state . <p> By sector , religious organizations accounted for the largest proportion of grants made at 27 percent , but education attracted the largest proportion of grant dollars at 26 percent in 2012 . <p> When Giving Accounts are analyzed by size , the proportion of grants made to religious organizations decreases dramatically as the size of the account increases . The proportion of grants to nonprofit organizations in the education , human services , society benefit , and health shows the opposite trend , increasing as the account size grows . Grants to three sectors environment and animals , arts and culture , and international affairs are steady regardless of account size . <p> The average primary account holder is 62 years old and sets up an account at 54 , likely attributable to the mid-50s being the age at which people tend to begin to approach charitable giving and legacy planning in a more thoughtful and forward-looking manner . <p> Donors often use a donor-advised fund to facilitate their giving over a period of many years . Forty percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and more than 13 percent have had an account at least 15 years . <p> " The flexibility of donor-advised funds appeals to a wide range of people , but most gravitate to a DAF because of their desire to be thoughtful and systematic about their giving , " said Libbey .

@@28358274 @2058274/ <h> Ways to Help Make Giving a Family Effort <p> By Nancy Opiela <h> Donor-Advised Fund <p> To facilitate charitable giving in your family , consider establishing a donor-advised fund , often referred to as a DAF . A donor-advised fund is an account you establish at a sponsoring organization , which is a public charity . Donors may be eligible for an immediate tax deduction for amounts they contribute to the sponsoring organization , while enjoying the freedom to recommend grants to eligible charities on their own timetable . <p> For example , Fidelity Charitable , an independent public charity , created in 1991 , offers a donor-advised fund program . The Fidelity Charitable DAF is called a Giving Account . To establish a Giving Account , you make an initial irrevocable contribution to Fidelity Charitable of at least $5,000 in cash , securities , or other complex assets . You and your family can then recommend grants to qualified charities when it will benefit them the most . In the meantime , the assets you contributed are invested , professionally managed , and have the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will assume all Giving Account privileges after your death , recommend charitable organizations to receive the Giving Account assets , or choose a combination of the two . <p> A DAF offers a convenient way to pass your charitable giving values on to your children or grandchildren . Johnne Syverson suggests giving young children the power to recommend charities to receive grants of $100 to $500 from the family 's DAF account . " The kids can recommend a charity that they care about based on knowledge that they 've gained on their own , " he says . " It 's essential to involve children in the process . Simply seeing Mom and Dad sitting down and writing checks during the holiday season does n't teach core philanthropic values . " <h> Private Family Foundations <p> Families with substantial financial resources sometimes establish a private family foundation . The administrative responsibilities in maintaining a private foundation are more complex than those of a donor-advised fund . However , they also present a different kind of opportunity to involve teens and young adults , allowing you and your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a junior board of family members , ages 12 to 21 , as an ad hoc charitable committee , with the authority to disburse a subset of the foundation 's total grants each year , says Philip Flynn III , of Philanthropic Focus , a Vero Beach , Fla. , company specializing in private foundation governance and legacy planning . <p> " It 's not the size of the gift that is important , but rather that the kids have control and responsibility , " Flynn says . " In addition to feeling part of the philanthropy , kids learn valuable skills , from how to read an annual report to how to set disbursement policies and benchmarks.

While times like these can be unsettling , it is important to remember that market swings are normal and are typically resolved over time . We continue to remain confident that our client accounts are appropriately positioned for continued economic growth . As a managed account client , you can trust that we have your best interests in mind and are working each and every day to help you reach your financial goals no matter if the markets are rising , falling , or holding steady . <p> In addition to slowing growth in China , stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and the future direction of interest rates . As a result , stocks were challenged , while high-quality bonds saw gains . <p> Despite weaker stock returns , we believe that much of the developed world , led by the United States , continues to show positive signs of economic expansion . Based on this view , we broadly continue to favor stocks in the U.S. and Europe in client accounts . It is important to note that there will be modest shifts away from your account 's long-term asset allocation mix from time to time . Moreover , our primary goal continues to be to maintain proper alignment between your account and your financial goals . <p> As markets have become more volatile , we have looked for opportunities to buy investments that have recently fallen , while selling those investments that have held steady . This process , known as rebalancing , can help keep the mix of stocks and bonds in your account in line with your financial goals . <p> U.S. Stocks : Weak Returns , But Economic Growth Continues <p> U.S. stocks were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well when compared with the rest of the world . U.S. stocks declined 7.3%1 during the quarter , with larger companies faring better than smaller ones . Growth stocks outperformed value stocks by a wide margin . Defensive stocks like utilities companies were the only sector to post positive returns for the quarter . In contrast , commodities fell due to slowing global growth , which , in turn , hurt energy and materials companies . Both sectors dropped approximately 17% . <p> We believe a slowdown in China will not affect the United States as much as other international economies . In fact , a changing Chinese economy may benefit American consumers . For example , as China transitions from a low-wage , export-driven economy to a consumer-driven one , it may have less need for natural resources like copper , oil , and steel . This trend , combined with a stronger U.S. dollar , may help keep U.S. consumer prices flat , or perhaps even decline . This means that a host of goods , from electronics to gas , could be more affordable for the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small percentage of direct sales for U.S. companies . Additionally , much of corporate America maintains healthy balance sheets and positive profit margins . Low interest rates , which help support job creation and a steady housing recovery , have been further bolstering the domestic economy . While our decision to own more stocks than the benchmark weighed on returns , we firmly believe both our positioning and this backdrop remain supportive for more growth-oriented areas of the market , including technology and consumer discretionary stocks . Historically , these types of stocks have benefited from slow economic expansion . <p> International Stocks : Markets Closely Connected to China Declined the Most <p> International stocks fell 12.2%2 , with emerging market stocks declining the most . Developed markets , like those in Europe , held up better , but still declined . In fact , the Eurozone continued to show signs of modest economic growth , given improving credit conditions and rising consumer confidence . Support has also come from the European Central Bank 's ( ECB 's ) bond-buying program , which began in March 2015 , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to its trading relationship with China . Although signs of inflation and improving business conditions in Japan resulted in increased economic growth , areas like wages and consumer spending have room for improvement . Year to date , Japanese stocks led many developed markets , with a return of 0.5%3 . <p> With China at the center of the quarter 's increased volatility , emerging market stocks were hardest hit , falling 17.8%4 for the period . For much of the past two decades , the Chinese economy has grown 10% per year , on average . This growth helped drive booms in real estate and stock markets in China . As a result , the nation became one of the largest consumers of natural resources like copper , iron ore , and coal . China used these raw materials to build cities and roads and to generate electricity . This meant that resource-rich regions of the world like Australia and Latin Americaas well as other areas of the market , such as commoditiesalso experienced robust growth . As the world 's second-largest economy now shifts to one powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads , bridges , and buildings as a way to spur growth . We believe this transition will be bumpy and that many economies , like those noted above , will be affected . <p> Despite the potential repercussions of a slowing Chinese economy , we maintain a positive long-term view on emerging markets as a whole . Therefore , we have maintained a modest investment in emerging market stocks in most client accounts , and have avoided direct investments in commodities . In the near term , we believe that both types of investments may continue to experience pressure . <p> Bonds : High Quality Investment-Grade Bonds Were a Relative Safe Haven <p> Late in the third quarter , much of the world turned its attention to the Federal Reserve Board ( the Fed ) in anticipation of the first possible U.S. interest rate hike in the United States in almost 10 years . While the outcome of the Fed 's September meeting resulted in no change to interest rates for the time being , the anticipation of this potential movein combination with China 's related sell-offcaused an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third quarter , the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note , which began the quarter at 2.36% , fell to 2.04% . Given that bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates , investment-grade bonds returned 1.2%5 Performance was especially strong for high-quality bonds with longer maturities , such as U.S. Treasuries . High yield bonds declined 4.9%6 by quarter-end due to weakness in the debt of energy and materials companies , which make up roughly 18% of the market . <p> Bond positioning within your account remained consistent over the course of the quarter . However , less exposure to high-quality , longer maturity bonds , like U.S. Treasuries , weighed on performance , with the exception of clients in more conservative portfolios . We continue to favor corporate credit as businesses maintain healthy balance sheets and interest rates remain low . Given the current environment , we continue to prefer short-duration bonds to money market funds because they may offer you a higher yield on your investment . Regardless of the future direction of interest rates , bonds play a vital role within a diversified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Alternative investment strategies posted modest losses , but fulfilled their role of adding resiliency to client accounts during down market conditions . Only investment-grade and short-term bonds fared better , as alternatives provided diversified sources of returns during the period . On a year-to-date basis , the performance of alternative investments remains differentiated from traditional stocks and bonds . <p> More specifically , both global macro and multi-strategy alternative investments performed in-line with expectations during the volatile third quarter by declining considerably than less than most other asset classes . Given their defensive nature , real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) returns were also favorable after a period of underperformance in the second quarter . Commodities and natural resources proved to be the most significant drag on performance , stemming from the China related fallout impacting emerging markets . <p> In Conclusion <p> Thank you for the trust you have placed in us .

Poor nutrition early in life can permanently affect a child 's ability to learn , grow , and provide for his or her family in the future . One way to improve health outcomes in poor communities is through the Care Group model .

In 2015 , the United States economy grew and remained on solid footing . Reinforcing this was the fact that the U.S. Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in nearly a decade following six straight years of economic growth and solid employment gains . At the same time , other global economies have been more challenged due to slower global growth . In fact , developed market economies , like Europe and Japan , showed signs of improvement . Both , however , continue to require the support of central banks to boost growth . Additional pressure overseas were driven by emerging markets , such as China and Brazil , which continued to slow and adjust to lower commodity prices . <p> The overall impact of these factors resulted in stock returns that ranged from slightly positive in the U.S. to sharply negative abroad . Gains in U.S. stocks for the year were nearly the same as returns of investment grade bonds . Other areas of the bond market , like high yield , came under pressure as lower oil prices weighed on returns . <p> At Strategic Advisers , an important aspect of our investment process is to think carefully about where we are in the economic cycle , which is often long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stock and bond market may perform the best for your account based on your financial goals . Today , we believe that the United States is in a mid-cycle expansion . Mid-cycle is the longest phase of the economic cycle and is usually characterized by rising corporate profits , employment , and stock prices . Given this perspective , we continue to favor developed market stocks , like those in the United States and Europe . Within bonds , we are seeking investment grade corporate and high yield bonds , which have less interest rate risk and are more closely tied to the success of U.S. businesses . <p> After three straight years of double-digit gains , U.S. stocks posted a more modest return of 0.4%1 for the year . Large company stocks outperformed their small-cap counterparts , which fell 4% , while growth led value by more than 9% . Traditional growth areas of the U.S. market , like consumer discretionary and health care stocks , were the top performing sectors during the year . These areas of the market were supported by a healthy U.S. consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conversely , global growth and commodity-related sectors , such as energy and materials , suffered from a sharp decline in prices , as the global oil supply outpaced demand and key emerging markets , like China , slowed . In fact , these same factors contributed to a sharp 11% market correction in U.S stocks during August . U.S. stocks quickly recovered in October , however , as markets refocused on the long-term and the underlying strength of the U.S. economy . This rapid up and down market movement highlights why we do not let short-term market events drive our long-term investment decisions . <p> We believe the U.S. economy remains stable despite the earnings pressure that slowing growth in emerging markets has exuded on multinational corporations , and the effect that low oil prices have had on the energy sector . In fact , except for energy companies , corporate America continues to maintain healthy balance sheets and profit growth has remained positive . Based on our analysis and views , we continued to broadly favor U.S. stocks over bonds in your account throughout the year . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically benefited from slow economic expansion , such as consumer discretionary and technology companies . In contrast , we had less exposure to more defensive dividend oriented areas of the market " such as utility company stocks " which typically perform better during declining economic environments . <p> Overseas , the performance of emerging markets weighed heavily on international stocks , which fell 5.5%2 over the course of the year . Despite these weaker returns , several developed market economies continued to show signs of positive growth . For example , the returns of Japanese stocks , which gained nearly 10%3 for the year , outpaced most international markets , given improved consumer and business sentiment as well as a supportive central bank . Like the United States , Europe is also in a mid-cycle expansion . Consumers in the region stand to benefit from both lower oil prices and interest rates , while the European Central Bank has extended policies aimed at promoting growth and boosting inflation . Nonetheless , export-oriented companies , as well as energy and mining firms , were negatively impacted by slowing demand from emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add value to your account versus a developed market stock index . Active management proved to be crucial over the course of the year as investments that focused on developed markets , like Europe and Japan , avoided some of the weaker areas of the market such as energy and materials companies . <p> Emerging market stocks were hardest hit in 2015 , finishing the year down 14.6%4 , as a slowing Chinese economy hindered returns . After nearly two decades of double-digit growth helped facilitate booms in real estate , stocks , and other markets , China has sought to transition from an economy powered by infrastructure and manufacturing to one instead driven by consumers . This transition has not only led to slowing economic growth in China , but also less need for raw materials and natural resources , like copper , iron ore , and coal . For other nations , such as Brazil and Australia that are rich in these resources , it means much less demand for the commodities they export . This dynamic was a headwind for emerging market stocks during the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to emerging markets in your account . Despite these short-term challenges , the case for emerging markets as part of a broadly diversified portfolio remains compelling , except for more conservative accounts . The reason being is that their economies are growing at a faster rate than developed markets and their populations are generally younger , helping to drive future growth through an expanding middle class . <p> Bonds : Higher Quality Bonds Delivered Positive Returns <p> For much of the year , investors and news media alike closely watched for changes in Fed policy and the future direction of interest rates . During the month of December , after much anticipation , the Fed increased the federal funds rate by 0.25% . This rate hike , the first since June 2006 , effectively ended the Fed 's long-standing zero interest rate policy and sent a signal that it believed the U.S. economy is growing and no longer needs as much monetary support . In spite of this increase , inflation and interest rates remain low " factors that are typically beneficial for both consumers and businesses . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which began the year at 2.17% , ended the year at 2.27% . While still near historic lows , high-quality U.S. bonds , like U.S. Treasuries , remain attractive to foreign investors whose own government bonds offer even lower interest rates . By comparison , similar 10-Year government bonds in nations like Germany and Japan remain well below 1% . We believe this demand dynamic , coupled with low inflation has the potential to keep U.S. bond yields from rising significantly in the near future . <p> All told , investment grade bonds produced annual returns of 0.6%5 for the year . Higher-quality bonds provided investors a safe haven , particularly during August 's turbulent market conditions when stocks declined . High-yield bonds struggled during 2015 , falling 4.6%6 as the steep drop in oil prices weighed down energy companies , which represent approximately 10 to 15% of the high-yield bond market . Similar to emerging markets , we have maintained a modest allocation to high yield bonds with the exception of more conservative accounts that have little to no exposure to these investments . Given positive U.S. economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies ) , we continue to believe that corporate bonds offer compelling opportunities . The more recent challenges in the high yield market highlight why we maintain a highly diversified approach for the fixed income portion of your account , including investments in a wide array of sectors and maturities . For example , exposure to short duration bonds helped outpace traditional money market investments , which continue to provide returns that are near zero , and helped add value to your account in 2015 . <p> The performance of extended asset classes was largely mixed in 2015 . Real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) , which benefitted from a growing U.S. economy , ended the year as of one of the top performing extended asset classes . Collectively , multi-strategy alternative investment strategies posted small positive returns , as did global macro strategies during the year . In contrast , slowing global growth , lower demand for raw materials , and falling oil prices weighed heavily on commodity related investment strategies in 2015 . <p> Given low interest rates , slower global growth , and accommodative monetary policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibility in 2016 . Therefore , we continue to believe that alternative investment strategies may provide more resilience during challenging markets . This further underscores the role of alternative investments and their ability to provide differentiated sources of returns beyond traditional stock and bond mutual funds . <p> In Conclusion <p> Thank you for the trust you have placed in us .

Indeed , thesimple act of parents talking about giving with their children makes it 20 percent more likely thatthose children will also give to charity.16 So how has family shaped the giving behavior of FidelityCharitable donors ? How do family and friends influence choices about what causes and organizations to support ? This special section of the Giving Report , which is based on a survey of FidelityCharitable donors , 17 examines these questions and others . <h> SHAPING THE VALUES OF A NEW GENERATION <p> Fidelity Charitable donors are committed givers , and they are equally committed to passing those values along to the next generation . <p> Most Fidelity Charitabledonors say they are activelyteaching or have taughttheir children to give . <p> Donors at all levels areteaching their children togive .

@@28358356 @2058356/ <h> Giving tips <p> Learn to integrate high-impact giving into all of your donations , at year-end and year-round . <h> Tips for year-round impact <p> All donors have a " philanthropic portfolio " that includes gifts that are n't necessarily aimed at maximizing social impact . This includes impromptu donations to support our friends ' interests , thank you gifts to our alma mater or hospital , or aid to support a church or temple where we belong . Increasingly , donors are also asking , " How can my money do more good ? " As you think about the part of your portfolio aimed at creating more social impact , here 's what to remember : <h> Focus on the goal <p> As the saying goes , " if you do n't know where you 're going , any road will get you there . " High impact philanthropy starts first by asking , " What is the philanthropic goal of this donation ? " That goal could be feeding the hungry , teaching kids to read , reducing addiction and mental illness , preventing child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes . Personal experiences often lead donors to want to help a particular community or address a particular cause . It is fine to let the heart choose the goal . Once you are clear about the goal , your head can then help you find the organizations to reach it . <h> A little research goes a long way <p> Unlike a decade ago , donors no longer need to spend days doing their own due diligence or trying to interpret tax returns in the hope of identifying a nonprofit worthy of their gift . Organizations like the Center for High Impact Philanthropy now exist to do the legwork so that individual donors can get to impact faster and with more confidence . The high impact opportunities profiled in this guide " and many more on our website " offer specific options that our team has analyzed for program efficacy and cost-effectiveness . We 've also provided a list of additional resources to help you better understand the causes you care about and identify nonprofits to support . Still ca n't find what you 're looking for ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Think bang for your buck <p> Not even the Gates Foundation has enough money to solve the problems it seeks to address . To do more good , every donor needs to ask , " How can my money go the farthest ? " Comparing nonprofit organizations can help answer that question , but do n't just look at their expenses . That 's literally , only half the equation . Instead , compare what the organization spends overall , to what it achieves . For example , it can cost approximately $2 to protect a child from measles in Mozambique , $1,400 to prevent newborn deaths in India , and about $2,500 to help an at-risk student in the U.S. finish college . Another way to think of bang-for-buck is to compare costs with societal benefits : For every $1 spent on a nurse visitation program , as a society we receive over $5 back from improved health , education , and employment outcomes . That 's bang for buck thinking where the ' buck ' is the money a nonprofit has to spend and the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that money . <p> By focusing on the goal , doing a little research , and thinking bang for buck , donors can make sure their annual giving reflects more than generosity and good intentions . It allows for year-round impact . <h> Tips for avoiding fraud <p> It 's your right as a philanthropist to practice some due diligence ( and even some healthy skepticism ) before committing your funds to a particular organization . The nonprofits that see more funding are n't just doing impressive work . They 're also transparent about how they 're doing it . Just because someone asks you to support a worthy effort , does n't mean you ca n't take some time to consider it " just like you would if someone was selling you an investment or a new product . <p> Here are some things you can do to avoid charitable fraud : <h> A simple Google search <p> If a nonprofit , its staff , or board have been the subject of negative press or an official investigation , that is a clear red flag to proceed with caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , a cancer charity can generate so much goodwill is that many people have been affected by cancer . So , if you 're interested in supporting cancer ( or other ) charities in honor of friends and family who have been affected , ask those individuals , " Are there any nonprofit organizations that really helped you and your family ? " <h> Remember the difference between a worthy cause and a worthy charity <p> Just because you want to support a great cause , does n't mean that every charity addressing that cause is just as great .

@@28358368 @2058368/ <h> Disaster Relief <p> Earthquakes , war , lead-poisoning . The scale of human suffering seems overwhelming these days with all sorts of natural and man-made disasters calling for humanitarian aid . The Center for Disaster Philanthropy categorizes catastrophes into three types : Complex Humanitarian Emergencies ( think Syrian refugees ) , Natural Disasters ( Nepal earthquake ) , and Man-made ( Flint water crisis ) . <p> All disasters prompt many of us to want to " do something . " But different crises bring different needs . And , the only thing for certain is that the needs not only vary by crisis , but are continuously changing . What 's more , there are different phases of relief . While media and donor attention is highest early on , needs remain long after the camera crews are gone . <p> For philanthropists , it 's crucial to remember that disaster relief involves four distinct phases : Response , Recovery , Preparedness , and Risk Mitigation . Funding is needed well beyond the initial phase , and offers a huge opportunity for philanthropists looking to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters <p> Initially , when a disaster hits , our first instinct is to mobilize " usually with collections of goods . However , such collections of food , water , or clothing may not be the most effective way to provide support . Large donations can create added transportation costs , complicate logistics , and use up volunteer time moving and storing goods that are n't a priority . If there 's an efficient way to get specific necessary goods to victims in your local community , do it . In most cases , though , the most effective way to help is to donate money to organizations that are on the ground providing relief . <p> Still , however , the desire to organize collections remains strong for some . In such cases , at least work with a relief group with direct ties to the affected areas " organizations that can verify the need for certain goods and provide deadlines for delivery . <h> Disaster relief accountability <p> Keeping track of organizations and their effectiveness is challenging . Therefore funders should support groups with systems to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption and misuse of donor funds . The Disaster Accountability Project ( DAP ) and Accountability Lab are two nonprofits working to make sure aid groups and governments are being held accountable for serving affected communities . <p> Accountability Lab partners with local NGOs around the world to promote greater accountability and responsiveness of government and other institutions . ( See description in Nepal section ) . DAP has various reports investigating the effectiveness of agencies operating in a range of locations including Haiti , Nepal , and New York after Superstorm Sandy . <p> DAP also offers several resources , including the Disaster Policy Wiki , which has more than 1,000 post-disaster policy recommendations designed to improve management systems . And , DAP 's Relief Oversight Initiative focuses on improving the transparency of the humanitarian aid community . More on CHIP 's disaster relief guidance here . <p> Disaster relief is an especially difficult area for giving partly due to the inherent chaos in the immediate aftermath . Here are three examples of disasters and relief agencies working in the specific areas . <h> Disaster type : complex humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has led to the worst refugee crisis since World War II . An estimated 4.8 million Syrians have fled the country , and another 8.7 million are estimated to be internally displaced . More than 7.5 million Syrian children need humanitarian aid , and 2.6 million are no longer in school . Life expectancies in the country have fallen dramatically , and an estimated 60% of Syria 's public hospitals are damaged or out of service due to targeting of physicians and medical facilities . Though media attention has focused primarily on refugees entering Europe , neighboring countries have taken in the most refugees . Turkey now has over 2.7 million Syrian refugees , and Lebanon has over 1 million . <p> While the scale of the crisis requires the intervention of governments and international agencies , philanthropy can play a critical role in key areas that larger public funders can not easily address . Funds donated by governments sometimes do n't reach on-the-ground nonprofits that are often better able to support their local communities . <p> Private philanthropy can fill this gap . There are a number of organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in countries where refugees have fled . A sampling of those groups is below . You can donate any amount via the groups ' website addresses listed : <p> Mercy Corps provides food , water , sanitation , hygiene , and shelter . It also builds playgrounds , sports fields , and other places for children to play and provides psychosocial support programs to help kids deal with trauma . <p> Oxfam International provides clean drinking water , cash , relief supplies , and connection to medical , legal , and support services . Oxfam has also built shower and toilet blocks in refugee camps , informal settlements , and on deserted routes used by refugees . <p> World Food Programme provides food for approximately four million people monthly within Syria and is also providing cash for food for refugees in Turkey , Lebanon , Egypt , Jordan , and Iraq . <p> The White helmets ( Syria Civil Defence ) 1are 2,900 volunteers from local communities who provide search and rescue services and medical aid in response to daily bomb and mortar explosions " often risking their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees from working , starting businesses , and supporting themselves . Therefore , the amount of humanitarian aid needed is great.er because countries taking in refugees have done little to help them rebuild their lives . For donors interested in investing in more sustainable long-term solutions , a few groups are working to change laws . <p> Asylum Access works to change legal frameworks in refugee-hosting countries so refugees can meet their own needs . It provides assistance to help refugees gain legal status and work permits . The International Refugee Assistance Project provides legal aid to refugees who wish to resettle from their first countries of refuge to the U.S. Refugee Rights Turkey2 , which U.S. donors can support via the US-based refugee Solidarity Network , provides legal aid to refugees seeking asylum in Turkey , and advocates to improve Turkey 's laws so refugees there can access their rights . <h> Disaster type : natural <h> Nepal earthquake <p> More than a year after a devastating series of earthquakes killed almost 9,000 people , Nepal is still struggling to rebuild . Before December 2015 , when Nepal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no progress was made towards long-term recovery by either the Nepalese government or humanitarian NGOs . In March 2016 , the NRA started signing housing reconstruction grants with displaced families , and continues to expand its presence in the 14 most affected districts to begin distributing government-announced funds . In August 2016 , the government released a small first payment of grants to survivors who lost their homes . However , a lot still has to be done , as the NRA has only spent about 10% of its total budget to date . Currently , more than 200,000 families are still internally displaced . <p> Recovery and reconstruction have been hindered by the lack of concrete government policy , and exacerbated by factors such as lack of access to banking and difficult geography . As a result , a key challenge has been the inadequate and uneven distribution of aid to those who need it most . Organizations on the ground have pointed to a need for involving earthquake survivors more closely in the recovery process and , ultimately , improving public accountability in a country where corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebuilding in Nepal should look for organizations with strong community ties . You should also seek out reliable data on the status of recovery , and support activities that contribute to sustained development , such as training and technologies for local organizations . Several organizations are addressing the need for transparency in Nepal and promoting the use of data and information to rebuild responsibly and effectively . In addition to those mentioned below , Global Giving has a helpful list of funds and organizations for Nepal : <p> Accountability Lab helped set up citizen " help desks " to coordinate relief efforts and serve as a conduit for on-the-ground information about what was and was not working . <p> Maiti Nepal2 is working to stop trafficking of displaced women and girls . <h> Disaster type : man-made <h> Flint , MI water crisis <p> The water crisis in Flint , Michigan has renewed national interest in lead poisoning and its harmful effects to humans , especially children . The Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) estimates that more than 500,000 children in the U.S. between the ages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their health . States , however , are not required to submit lead surveillance data to the CDC , and not all states mandate testing lead levels in kids . Therefore , the full scope of the problem nationwide is difficult to gauge . <p> Yet , even brief exposure to lead can have profound detrimental effects , especially among children . There is , in fact , no such thing as a " safe " blood lead level . Decades of research have linked lead exposure to brain damage in children , resulting in ADHD , learning disabilities , conduct disorders , behavioral deficits , impairments in vision and hearing loss , plus lowered IQ . <p> Flint 's story illustrates how vital nonprofits and philanthropies can be when government systems fail to protect the public 's health . Flint residents are still struggling to access clean water . The day-to-day reality is that affected families need water for the cooking , bathing , and general consumption that most of us take for granted . As with most crises , the human reaction is to help by purchasing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies and confirm what 's needed , the best way to help is to give money to organizations that can bulk-purchase water or other goods according to need and available space to house it .
