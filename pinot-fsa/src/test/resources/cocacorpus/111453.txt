" As you can imagine by listening to the sounds , the Doppler effect was of paramount importance for adding a sense of speed and realism to this library . Apart from that , granular synthesis and re-synthesis are some of my favourite techniques to create interesting sonic textures and take the original recordings to a whole new level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment a lot with complex effects chains and signal routing , to enhance a sound or completely mangle it . Convolution and morphing are other techniques that were useful to twist the sounds in exotic and unpredictable ways . Once I am happy with a sound , I finalise it by tuning a mastering chain that includes different compressors , enhancers and limiters that I activate and change on a case by case basis . <p> WHO IS IT FOR ? <p> Producers of movie soundtracks and trailers will love the ease with which they can create an incredibly high quality rush of sound to add drama , anticipation and intense excitement to their productions . <p> Creating sound for video games ?

Instead , all instruments were created from organic sources such as found sounds , sonic manipulations inspired by classic Musique Concrete , Experimental and Avant Garde Music compositions , prepared or heavily processed musical instruments , and audio recordings subjected to extreme sound design techniques . <p> Zodiac features over 200 patches and Multis ( over 8GB of uncompressed wav data ) , divided into six categories : <p> Zodiac 's instruments range from beautiful and ethereal soundscapes to wildly inventive percussion and mysterious , haunting , atonal and experimental sounds that defy easy categorization .

Play an instrument one way and it has a percussive quality ; play it another , and the notes expand into a pad or atmosphere . Play a patch in one octave and it sounds dreamy and surreal ; play it in another octave and it behaves and sounds quite differently . <p> No matter what soft synths , sound modules , or VIs you already own , Zodiac will expand the palette of sounds in your sonic tool box and add a unique character to your music . <p> ON either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levers .

Inspired by legendary groups like Tower of Power and the big bands of decades past , MOJO is capable of emulating everything from a sultry sax solo to a screaming full big band playing at the top of their lungs . <p> Pushing the boundaries of sampling and scripting technology far beyond traditional sample libraries , MOJO offers a simple but feature-packed interface . No need to decide in advance which articulation you want to play . Simply load the instrument , turn the Ensemble knob to specify how many players you want playing that instrument ( from a soloist to a dectet ) and begin controlling the instrument from the keyboard . More than a dozen articulations are instantly loaded and intelligently handled via performance features and keyswitches . Behind the scenes , a humanizing function , smart release layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reproducing the ultimate dimensions in realism . Crescendos and swells sync instantly to host tempos and can be triggered in real time . <p> Included in the instrument collection are : soprano , alto , tenor , and baritone saxophones , trumpet ( open , muted , and piccolo ) , flugelhorn , trombone ( open and muted ) , bass trombone , and clarinet . The articulation list varies for each instrument , but generally includes sustains , stabs , staccatos , trills , slurs , shakes , octave runs , rise to hits , falls ( including four different lengths ) , doits , bends , stylistic riffs , special effects , and tempo-synced swells and crescendos . All samples are recorded in 24-bit stereo using the finest preamps in the world , including a vintage Neve 1073 and a LaChapell Audio 992EG , and mics by AKG , Neumann , and Coles . <p> MOJO is powered by the popular Kontakt engine , offering total integration into all major sequencers via its AudioUnit , VST , and RTAS plug-ins , as well as standalone operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Trumpet , Trombone , Trumpet Muted , Trombone Muted , Piccolo Trumpet , Bass Trombone , Soprano Sax , Alto Sax , Tenor Sax , Bari Sax , Clarinet , and Flugelhorn .

MOJO makes it as easy and straightforward as possible to begin playing without having to make too many decisions or sifting through dozens of patches . <p> When any of the twelve core instruments are loaded , this interface is displayed . ( Click to magnify . ) <p> The first two knobs allow you to control how many players should be playing this instrument ( from one to ten ) and which mode they should be playing in ( polyphonic , monophonic , or legato ) .

Using these features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then switch to a solo trumpet , then return to the section , all within one MIDI track or performance . <p> As you add players to the ensemble , MOJO intelligently spreads the ensemble around the stereo field and gives you control over their spread , tuning variation , and other aspects of the group : <p> The onscreen display shows you which articulation and release type is active at any given time . Each instrument includes various articulations and release layers which are triggered via keyswitches , such as bends , runs , crescendos , swells , doits , falls , staccatos , stabs , and more . <p> This video shows how each articulation can be triggered via keyswitch triggers and shows a typical set of articulations for each instrument in MOJO : <p> Doits , falls of various speeds , and up-slurs are available as releases and are also triggerable via keyswitches .

@@22020842 @2020842/ <h> Product Review MOJO : Horn Section <p> If you 're looking for great-sounding brass and reeds for pop , funk , and big-band arrangements , Vir2 's Mojo is a great place to start . The compilation of brass and reeds is dripping with attitude and a very human touch- which is to say that the samples appear to favor realism over slavish consistency . Artifacts come and go from one keystroke to the next , so for example , one sustained trumpet note sounds ever so slightly more tremulous then the next round-robin sample of that note . It pays off , producing ensembles which seem to have different musicians rather than the same player cloned several times . <p> Instruments <p> Mojo let 's you work practically any way you want . You can create solo instruments and set them up for legato performance - an essential way to avoid the note overlap and retriggering that tips your hand as a keyboardist and not a real horn section . You can build multi patches out of individual horns , which is great for complex , individually articulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batch of multis that already have ensembles laid out across consecutive MIDI channels . If RAM is low , or you 're in a hurry and just want a single brass-section patch , Mojo has you covered with a bunch of single-MIDI-channel instruments comprising different combinations of brass and woodwinds . As with most sample-based brass sections , the most realistic way to recreate an ensemble is one instrument at a time , each on its own MIDI track , and add bends and other articulations in a separate recording pass . Mojo - which loads into Native Instruments Kontakt or uses the included Kontakt Player- you can load instruments in just this way . On offer are trumpet ( including Harmon mute and cup mute ) , piccolo trumpet , flugelhorn , trombone , bass trombone , clarinet , and baritone , tenor , alto , and soprano saxes . The neat trick for both single instruments and multis is the ability to specify the number of players for a given instrument , so if you want to thicken up the horn section , a turn of the dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a multi , this let 's you set up , for instance , two trombones , four trumpets , two alto saxes and a baritone sax , or any other combination . With a single patch , you simply get more of that instrument , whether solo piece or ensemble . If you 're expecting a simple replication of voices to sound keyboard-like or mechanical , you 'll be happily wrong : From one keystroke to the next , instruments evidence subtle tonal differences , and you can humanize note onsets and tuning . More so than most humanizing features I 've heard , the results can be subtle or even create the sound of a downright amateur section if that 's your goal . <p> In Use <p> Mojo offers " lite " patches of its single instruments to help you conserve CPU resources . With 14GB RAM in my 2.83GHz , eight-core Mac Pro , I put Mojo through its paces on a dense , big-band , horn-section MIDI file that consisted of five saxes ( two altos , two tenors , and one bari ) , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file of all MIDI control changes except for pitch-bend . Using the full-sized patches in MOTU Digital Performer 7.24 , tracks played back at the high end of the CPU meter , occasionally straying into the red , and causing DP to bring up overload messages with a buffer setting of 64 samples . After a bit of futzing with Kontakt 's memory management , and setting a buffer of 256 in DP , the track sailed along without a hiccup , never reaching into the red . Playing a solo horn against that track - even from my MIDI guitar - felt comfortable and musical.In Apple Logic , CPU load did n't seem to lighten appreciably when I used larger buffers , and the instruments felt quite playable at settings as high as 512 samples . Driving Mojo from a MIDI track of funk-brass parts from Twiddly Bits yielded equally slick results , albeit with only a single alto sax , tenor sax , trumpet , and trombone . That provided a good opportunity to crank that knob I mentioned , doubling the reed players and quadrupling the trumpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Articulations <p> Simply playing back my recorded tracks with just notes and velocity sounded terrific . Effective round-robin programming literally keeps it real . The generous supply of key-switched articulations can be a bit daunting for playing live , especially when you consider that Mojo uses MIDI continuous controllers quite a bit as well . For example , you could key-switch to engage legato mode , then alter the legato time or other qualities with series of consecutive CC numbers . That 's a lot to remember . If you 've ever felt like you 've forsaken your keyboard for the cockpit of an alien spacecraft with more controls than you have digits , you 're not alone . Fortunately , Mojo conveniently let 's you assign your own key-switching scheme . Just select an articulation , hit the Learn button , and hit the key to which you want to remap that articulation.For the most part , Vir2 's programmers have done an excellent job of providing realistic articulations . Switching directly from a relatively " straight " sound to an affected technique can often sound abrupt and contrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time - trumpet doits , subtle crescendos , realistic , one-finger trills , falls , glissandos , and more.There are also folders of instrument effects , full phrases and riffs , and even a folder of patches optimized for wind controllers . With all that , there are still a few instruments I 'd like to see : tuba , euphonium , and French horn are missing . I 'd also like to see a wider variety of mutes for trumpet and trombone . Nonetheless , Vir2 Mojo presents a solid , great sounding pallet for pop , jazz , and funk styles . 
@@22020846 @2020846/ 2586 @qwx202586 <p> The Clavi D9 is based on the well known clavinet D6 by hohner.It is probably one of the most " funky " instruments ever invented , despite the fact that it was originally intended for classical music as its sound is close to the hapsichord . It turns out that it was very well suited to replace or double a rhythmic guitar and was used in many Funk and Disco hits . <p> The clavinet has 5 octaves ( 60 keys ) and works in a simple way , when you press a note , the string is pressed against a bridge just like a hammer-on on a guitar , the non muted part of the string vibrates and the pickups amplify the sound . <p> The D6 has very few controls , 4 eq switches and 2 pickup switches to choose which pickup has to be used plus a global volume.We recorded both pickups and we modeled precisely the eqs , as a result you can use the whites switches exactly like on the real instrument.We sampled every possible aspect of the instrument , normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sympathetic resonances and more to give you the most authentic Clavinet sound possible . <h> Real Staccatos and resonance <p> The Clavinet is often used to replace the guitars in Funk music , this is why most players mostly use very short notes . We thought of that when sampling the instrument and can reproduce it very accurately using a combination of staccato samples and longer releases.You can also control the amount of release in the preferences panel to get more or less bite for short notes . <p> Every mechanical instruments has sympathetic resonances and the Clavinet is no exception , but due to the proximity of the strings , it is a different kind than on a piano . The sympathetic resonance we modeled is sample based and very close to the real instrument . <p> You can add more or less of that resonance to control how much body you want to add to your sound . <h> Pickups <p> The Clavinet originally has two pickups , one next to the bridge that has a very bright sound and another one closer to the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them using the switches just like on the real instrument . We even added a possibility that is not in the original instrument , you can control the volume of each pickup separately in the preferences to really reach every possible sound when mixing both pickups . <p> Here are the microphone switches positions : <p> A+C is the bridge pickup , B+C is the bass pickup , A+D is for both pickups enabled , B+D is for both pickups but the Bass pickup has the phase reversed <h> Advanced Wah <p> A Clavinet is very often played with a Wah on it , this is why the Clavi D6 has an included Wah effect that you can control with any controller . It is by default set on the expression pedal , but you can change that by changing the CC value.The Wah effects are not unique and usually depends on the brands , so we added a list of Wah models to choose from . <p> What if you do n't have any continuous controller on your keyboard ? Well , we thought of that and modeled an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attack , ours was designed after what really happens on a real one . Its frequency can be changed and also synched to the tempo if needed . <h> Built in FX selection <p> The four switches ( which could be named 4 band EQ ) named " Brilliant " , " Treble " , " Medium " , and " Soft " have been carefully modeled to be as close as possible to the original ones . <p> Aside from the Wah , we also included the most common effects used with a clavinet.First a Spring Reverb from which you can control the length and amount.Then a distortion , a tremolo , a flanger , a chorus and a phaser , eachof these effects have two controls on the interface.With all of these , you wo n't need any other plugin to play the Clavi D9 live . <h> Amp simulation <p> We have been looking for the most widely used amps with Clavinets and we created advanced impulse responses of them . Here is a list of the Amps that you can choose from : <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amp simulation software . <h> MIDI controls <p> As always with our libraries , you have a complete control over the response of the library.The Velocity Sensitivity changes the volume curve of the library.The Velocity Threshold is simply the minimum velocity that you will have to play to hear a sound.The Dynamics will set the minimum volume for velocity 1 and give you access to all the dynamics that you want.The velocity curve remaps MIDI input and will give it a concave or convex shape thus changing some sort of a " MIDI sensitivity " . <h> Details <p> Clavi D9 now comes with its own sample player , the UVI Workstation 2 ( requires v2.0.10 or later ) . We provide it for free with every library that you buy , you do n't need to buy an expensive sampler to use our products .

@@22020882 @2020882/ <h> Sunbird 2586 @qwx202586 <p> The Sunbird library is based on a 1962 Gibson Humming acoustic guitar . <p> We recorded it with a pair of DPA microphones to get a detailed stereo perspective , with a U87 to capture the Bass and a precise mono perspective and using a contact pickup in case you want to put the library through an amp simulation plugin . <p> We sampled it very deeply , all frets of all strings with upstrokes , downstrokes , round robins , releases , staccatos , mutes , palm mutes , hand blocks , slides , hammer ons , pull offs , retriggers , fretnoises , percussions other articulations . All of these details allow us to reproduce the real playing of a guitar player , and easily . <p> There are basically 4 modes ( that you can choose using keyswitches , G5 to C6 ) , the solo mode that allows to play melodies , the chord mode that helps playing strums or picking very easily , the patterns mode that does all of the strumming or picking for you and the MIDI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controler . <h> Strumming Machine <p> The Sunbird can strum , in various ways , up , down , muted , in legato and allows finger picking . Everything is modeled after meticulously analyzing thousands of real chords played by guitarist . Every aspect of the strumming engine can be tweaked to achieve the sound you want . <p> The chord recognition engine helps converting any chord you play on your keyboard to a real guitar voicing . Recognizing a chord is made through a database of thousands of standard chords , and you can edit every chord or even add new ones . <p> The chord hammers feature let 's you play left hand hammer ons and pull offs while strumming or picking . <h> Realist Patterns <p> The patterns mode is very similar to the chord mode , the chord recognition engine works the same way , but this time the triggers are not simple strums anymore , they are a set of patterns that you can loop , adapt to the tempo or the metrics , change the velocity in real time using a controller , synch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from a large selection of patterns or create your using the pattern maker and assign them to each trigger to create a full song in a few clicks . <h> Pattern Maker <p> Creating realistic guitar patterns has never been easier . You can create strumming , picking , or finger picking patterns in seconds and even make them of an infinite size . <p> We even made the sharing of these patterns easy , just save them and send them to other users , the database can only grow ! <h> Song Builder <p> The song builder panel is the feature that will let you compose songs extremely quickly . Sometimes playing a series of chords can be complicated , especially if you are not an advanced keyboardist . The song builder allows you to decide which chord will be triggered when selecting only one note . For example pressing only the C will be recognized as a C Major . You can repeat the operation for the whole 12 notes of the octave and this way construct your songs and play them easily . <p> We included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressions , modes or chord types . <p> Combine this with the patterns and pressing two keys at the same time is enough to play a song . <h> Solo mode , automatic hand position <p> The solo mode is very simple , and is suited to play melodies . It uses a smart hand position system that decides for you where a real guitarist would put his hand and which string he would play . A piano only has one middle C for example , but a guitar offers a few different options and our script will decide it for you . You can of course deactivate it and use only the first hand position if you want . <p> The Sunbird features our powerful legato engine that will automatically trigger legato , hammer ons , pull offs , or slides and the legato distance will define the maximum interval in which the legato will apply . <p> You also have access to key switches to play palm mutes , harmonics ( flageolets ) or even percussion sounds and control the legato engine . <h> Preferences and Microphone Mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stereo pair of DPA and you can adjust the volume of each of them.Every aspect of the library can be tweaked , the release , fret and pre-notes volumes , as well as the midi response of your keyboard . <p> A three band EQ and a reverb module can be adjusted from the preferences panel , and you can enable and load/unload the pickup or the microphones . <h> MIDI Guitar <p> If you own a MIDI guitar and want to expand its sound capabilities , then the MIDI mode is for you , all you need to do is select the 7 different MIDI chanels your guitar outputs and you are ready to play . 2587 @qwx202587 <p> Version 2590 @qwx202590 <p> Plug-in/UVI Download includes <p> Installation Instructions : 737 KB <p> Sunbird FLAC : 1.42 GB 2589 @qwx202589 2588 @qwx202588 <p> The Following End User License and lawfully made copy of Sunbird from a dealer or distributor authorized by Big Fish Audio . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the following License Agreement before using any of these audio samples .
