Even as a child , Salvatore showed a great passion for shoes : at the age of 11 he was apprenticed to a shoemaker in Naples and at 13 he opened his own shop in Bonito . When he was 16 , he travelled to America to join one of his brothers who was working for a large shoe factory in Boston .

When the movie industry moved to Hollywood , Salvatore Ferragamo went with it . In 1923 he opened the Hollywood Boot Shop ' , which marked the start of his career as shoemaker to the stars ' , as he was defined by the local press . In 1927 Ferragamo decided to return to his native Italy and chose to settle in Florence , a city known for its many skilled craftsmen . From his Florentine workshop " in which he adapted the assembly line system to his workers ' highly specialised and strictly manual work " Salvatore launched a constant flow of exports to the United States .

In 1938 these successful creations enabled him to pay the first instalment for the purchase of all of Palazzo Spini Feroni , which has been the company 's headquarters ever since . In 1940 he married the young daughter of the local doctor in Bonito , Wanda Miletti , who joined him in Florence and would bear him six children : three sons ( Ferruccio , Leonardo and Massimo ) and three daughters ( Fiamma , Giovanna and Fulvia ) .
