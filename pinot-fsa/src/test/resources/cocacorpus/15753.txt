You 're welcome . @qwx11771 @qwx11783 @qwx11776 <p> Disclaimer : I hate Burnett 's . Well , hate is probably a strong word considering that Burnett 's has been my vodka brand of choice for my entire college career . However , it feels wrong to say that I like Burnett 's considering it is the nastiest brand of vodka in the game. - <p> Whatever , I digress . Burnett 's . Where I go to school , Burnett 's is present at every pregame , from the classic Citrus flavor ( bearable ) to Hot Cinnamon ( dear God , it 's bad ) . I decided to rank every flavor of Burnett 's from worst to best to try and steer any brave soul who decides to take a risk and go for it. - <h> 40 . Pumpkin Spice <p> Aside from Pumpkin Spice being pretty basic , I wo n't ever say no to a PSL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst thing I 've ever choked down . AVOID . <h> 29 . Blue Raspberry <h> 28 . Strawberry Banana <p> Kacie Saar <p> Strawberry Banana is n't necessarily bad , but it 's one of these " what the heck do I chase this with ? ! " sort of thing . I would say your best bet is a smoothie , and if your best bet is a smoothie maybe just choose a different flavor. - <h> 27 . Blackberry <p> Rachel Dean <p> Out of all of the berries ( aside from fake blue raspberry ) , blackberries are my least favorite . Therefore , it 's no surprise that I think blackberry Burnett 's is underwhelming at best ( really bad , at worst ) . <h> 26 . Watermelon <p> Kacie Saar <p> Someone once left Watermelon Burnett 's at my house after a pregame and I decided to try a small sip . I immediately spat it out all over my counter and poured the rest down the drain . <h> 25 . Peach <p> The only issue I have with peach Burnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're into that , go for it. - <h> 24 . Strawberry <p> It tastes like candy in like , the absolute worst way possible .

Sour Apple <p> Kacie Saar <p> I already balk at taking shots ( let 's say I went a little overboard freshman year ) , and the fact that this makes me pucker even more than usual grosses me out. - <h> 22 . Pineapple <p> Kacie Saar <p> Pineapple Burnett 's is a fairly average flavor . It 's neither good nor bad . Pro : It can really be mixed in any sort of juice . Con : It 's pineapple-flavored vodka , so you really ca n't expect much . <h> 21 . Whipped Cream <p> I feel like there was a period of time where I enjoyed Pinnacle Whipped Cream vodka and this is pretty similar . I 've outgrown the flavor because I realized there were better things out there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 20 . Red Berry <p> Back at it again with the ambiguous flavor profile .

Candy Cane <p> You 're probably surprised that Candy Cane made it this far down the list , but I do n't mind it . It 's like a worse version of Peppermint Schnapps ( think Peppermint Patty shots ) but if you 're trying to ball on a budget , it 's not bad. - <h> 18 . Mango <p> Meh . Out of all the different fruit-flavored Burnett 's , it 's okay . But , if I had the choice between mango and mango pineapple , I would always pick mango pineapple . <h> 17 . Blueberry <p> Hannah Giardina <p> Through a series of random events , I once did a ziptie- with blueberry Burnett 's . It was surprisingly easy to down and even easier for it to come back up. - <h> 16 . Vanilla <h> 15 . Sweet Tea <p> Going to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available anytime , anywhere . Sweet Tea Burnett 's tastes pretty similar , but if you prefer your iced tea unsweetened , avoid at all costs . <h> 14 . Mango Pineapple <p> Kacie Saar <p> Like I was saying earlier , if you like mango and you like pineapple , I would go for the hybrid mango pineapple . As Hannah Montana once eloquently put it , " You get the best of both worlds . " <h> 13 . Raspberry <p> I have friends who swear by raspberry . Though it 's not my absolute favorite , I have found myself picking up a fifth for a little diversity in my vodka drinking. - <h> 12 . Coconut <h> 11 . Hot Cinnamon <p> If you 're a fan of Fireball , hot cinnamon is your friend . Though I ca n't drink a ton of this at one time , it 's pretty delightful as a shot .

Cherry Cola <p> A solid choice if you like drinking with Coke or Diet Coke . Make a mixed drink and be prepared to be wowed. <h> 7/6/5 . Lime , Limeade , &amp; Cucumber Lime <p> I honestly ca n't tell the difference between these three , so they get to share a spot . I like a little lime Burnett 's and cranberry juice .

" Well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be mixed with more things . Therefore , it gets the higher ranking . <h> 3 . Fruit Punch <p> YAS . Fruit Punch is damn good .

Tap some cinnamon , cloves , and nutmeg over the top to add a little more depth. - <h> 17 .

It 's crunchy , sweet and perfect to satisfy those midnight cravings . Plus , it 's super quick to make and literally does not require any cooking skills , aka a college kid 's dream . Having said that , it does n't take much to take your cereal to the next level . For those days when you 're feeling a little fancy , but not fancy enough to actually cook anything , - here are the steps to making the perfect bowl of cereal . <p> What you need : A bowl , cereal , toppings , milk and a spoon . <h> Not all bowls are created equally . <p> Shelby Cohron <p> When it comes to making the perfect bowl of cereal , it makes sense that the first step should be finding the right bowl . I suggest using a light-colored ceramic bowl . I find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience while also sucking up some of the milk and giving the cereal a strange flavor . The bowl should also be light-colored . There 's just something about eating cereal out of a dark-colored bowl that just is n't as refreshing . As far as size goes , it depends on how much cereal you think you can eat . Generally , the bigger the better . <h> Choose your cereal(s) wisely. - <p> Shelby Cohron <p> This step will make or break your final product . The key to finding the perfect cereal is to focus on the following four factors : crunch , sweetness , diversity and level of satiation . <p> The perfect cereal will be crunchy and stay crunchy , but it should soften up just a little bit with the milk. - As far as sweetness goes , yes , every once in a while it is great to have super sweet cereal , but that will only take away from the taste of the milk and your toppings . It is best to choose a cereal with a little bit of sweetness but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereal is to stay under 10 grams of sugar . <p> The next factor to consider is diversity , meaning you want a cereal with a few different elements to it , or you can combine two or three cereals with different textures . My favorite combination is Cheerios , Corn Flakes and some granola . <p> Lastly , your cereal should be heavy enough to satiate you . There is nothing worse than eating a ton of cereal and still feeling like you could eat a cheeseburger afterward. - <h> Toppings galore ! - <p> Shelby Cohron <p> A way to really take your cereal above and beyond is to add toppings . You can be creative here and add anything your little heart desires , from extra granola to chia seeds and even peanut butter and jelly . My favorite topping is fresh fruit , especially bananas and strawberries , because it 's classy , healthy and not too overwhelming . Plus , the texture of fruit " dried or fresh " is a great compliment to crunchy cereal . <h> Got milk ? <p> Shelby Cohron <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really thinks about as being important , but it definitely is . I am not a fan of cow 's milk personally , so I opt for some kind of plant milk instead . Whether it is almond milk , soy milk , coconut milk or even oat milk , I find that plant milk creates a better flavor when paired with cereal , and most of the time it has less calories than cow 's milk . My favorite milk for cereal is unsweetened vanilla almond milk . It adds the perfect hint of vanilla to the cereal , bringing the whole thing together . <p> #SpoonTip : Experiment with different milk and cereal combinations to find your favorite . Do n't be scared to try a new kind of plant milk . It could completely transform your cereal. - <h> Time to assemble . <p> Shelby Cohron <p> Begin by pouring the cereal ( duh ) . If you are using more than one kind of cereal , be sure to mix them all together in the bowl . Next , add your toppings . Make your bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to line my toppings along the side of the bowl , leaving the center empty so the cereal is still visible . Now that the cereal and toppings are in place , pour in your choice of milk . Make sure to pour over the entire surface area of the cereal and toppings to cover the whole thing with a layer of milk . Lastly , place your spoon in the bowl , and you 're done ! Enjoy your cereal with a glass of OJ and a newspaper for best results .

My friend Zach described this aftertaste as tasting like " Chinese food .

You head to the cupboard , looking for food . Your stash of mac n ' cheese is dangerously low and you 've been living the ramen life for three consecutive days " it 's time to explore other options . You stare blankly at the shelves , waiting for something to catch your eye . What 's that , behind the half empty bag of Cool Ranch Doritos ? A can of soup . <p> Now that the polar vortex is back , it 's time for soup to reclaim its place in our hearts as a favorite go-to meal . Most college students do n't have extra time to slave over a pot of homemade soup every week , yet not everyone is a fan of canned soup . The- mystery meat and slimy vegetables in canned soup can be questionable , so here are six quick and simple ways to turn your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haugh <h> 1 ) Protein <p> I 'll be the first person to admit that the canned chicken in chicken noodle soup is a little iffy . A simple solution to overcome the protein in canned soup is to add your own . Cook some extra chicken next time you 're making dinner , save it , and add it to your soup . This works with beef , bacon , sausage , and other proteins as well , depending on the flavor profile you 're looking for . <h> 2 ) Cheese <p> Cheese is an easy fix to add some flavor and creaminess to your soup . Try sprinkling feta on top of tomato soup or adding spicy pepper jack to chicken noodle . You can stir cheese into your soup or just add some to the top . The flavor combinations are limitless . <h> 3 ) Herbs/Spices <p> Sometimes all a soup needs is a little extra salt or pepper , but usually it needs more . Try adding minced garlic or fresh basil , parsley , or rosemary to your soup " whatever 's available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canned soup more gourmet , squeeze in some lemon juice or top it with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar . <h> 4 ) Cream/Milk <p> While I do n't recommend adding cream to brothy soups , it makes a great addition to tomato soups and chowders . Cream or milk not only makes your soup smoother , it 'll also add a fresh taste to a food that 's been sitting on a shelf for several weeks ( or months ) . <h> 5 ) Veggies <p> Fresh veggies are always preferred , but frozen vegetables work just as well and will still add a fresh component to a not-so-fresh dish . Any hearty vegetable works . Pick your favorite , pick what 's in season , pick what your mom sent you , or pick what your roommate 's boyfriend left in the fridge that morning . <h> 6 ) Croutons <p> If you do n't have croutons in your cupboard , I can almost guarantee that you have a substitute . Some favorites are tortilla chips , goldfish , pretzels , and popcorn . Any kind of chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make your own croutons . If you 're feeling especially fancy , cut your grilled cheese into cubes and use those as croutons in your tomato soup .

But who would dare argue with Aquaman about it ? As the king of Atlantis , why not eat the pizza named after one of the most beautiful islands ? Much like the man himself , this pizza has two sides and both are admired . <h> Wonder Woman ( Diane Prince ) : Margherita Slice <p> Wonder Woman is over 5,000 years old and is still slaying . Therefore , her pizza choice goes way back to Italy in the early 1800s . The Pizza Margherita is classy , but nevertheless fun and delicious . At times , she may switch it up with a veggie pizza .

Superman . Have you ever tried ordering a pizza and there is always that one friend who wants pepperoni ? That 's Mr. Clark Kent . Journalist by day and superhero by night , Kent requires cheap and easily accessible food . But sometimes even cheese can get boring .

For most of us , the biggest difference between the milks we use are 2% , whole , fat-free , or skim . Not really a major variety in flavor . <p> So we dip them in our plain old milk and go on our merry ways , never wondering how truly diverse the word milk really is . I made the decision to grab some friends and do a little experiment to find out if we 're missing out on any exciting flavor opportunities. - <p> We are . <h> The Experiment <p> Rachael Marks <p> Milk and cookies is no laughing matter . I consider this a true development in the scientific community . I enticed my two friends Casey and Nick with promises of lots of cookies and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like if we dipped Oreos in chocolate milk , coconut milk , vanilla milk , almond milk , and strawberry milk ? - <p> In the true nature of science , we established our control group : whole milk ( the milk we all agreed we were most likely to drink ) and Oreos . From this , we gathered an idea of what makes dipping Oreos in milk such a phenomenon . It was the general consensus that the milk created a satisfying cold and creamy flavor and supplied us with a nice , soft texture that was soft but still kind of crunchy. - <p> The Hypothesis <p> It was determined that we needed to answer two questions . Which of the five types of milk best suited the cookie , and which one did not . Casey thought the chocolate milk would be best ( which I agreed with him on ) thinking that the flavor would transfer nicely into the cream " and you can never have too much chocolate . " Nick thought that the coconut or vanilla would bump up the flavor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coconut ( Nick because he loves coconuts , Casey because he 'd never had it , and me because I thought it was the weirdest ) . - <p> When it came to determining the worst , Casey thought the coconut might be too weird and Nick thought almond because he 's never cared for it on its own . For me , it was personally the strawberry because that artificial fruit flavor is a lot to take in on its own. - <h> The Test <p> TruMoo Chocolate Milk <p> Rachael Marks <p> Although I used Nesquik milk for the vanilla and strawberry , I had to go with TruMoo ( much to the delight of Nick ) . TruMoo has a nice , frothy taste that feels closer to the variety of chocolate milks out there . Chocolate milk is my favorite means of drinking milk ( and on most days the only way I drink it ) , so I was very curious . <p> Overall we really enjoyed it . I thought that it had a creamy , chocolatey taste . It was sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it added a bonus flavor to the mix , an additional chocolate to the already chocolatey cookie . Nick thought that the chocolate canceled out the cream and was n't getting as strong a flavor as Casey or I. - <p> So Delicious Unsweetened Coconut Milk <p> Rachael Marks <p> So you 're stranded on a desert island and all you have are coconuts and ( for some reason ) Oreos . Do you dare risk spoiling your rations by dunking the Oreos into the milk ? - <p> I 'm not going to pretend like this is the exact flavor of the milk in that scenario ( it 's hard to preserve coconut milk without additives ) , but I made sure to at least get it unsweetened . The first thing you 'll notice is that this type of milk has a thicker consistency than cow milk . When paired with the Oreo , I thought it had a subtle flavor . I knew it was n't a normal milk taste , but I did n't quite get coconut . Casey noted that it did n't create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to say , " If I went vegan I would use this milk for dipping . " <p> Upon his first bite , Nick was already making yummy sounds . Initially he thought that the milk added a sweetness to the cookie . And then we all tried coconut milk for the first time . We vowed to never relive that experience. - The Oreos will definitely be a good vehicle to help you get down the milk you need to survive. - <p> Nesquik Low-fat Vanilla Milk <p> Rachael Marks <p> We were all very curious about this type of milk . I suppose the thought was that if there were a chocolate milk , there should be a vanilla milk too . I feel like this is the one Nesquik flavor that never really took off ( and yet they still sell it on campus ) . On the first bite it seemed like normal milk , but then I was suddenly hit by a shockwave of sugar ( not in the good way ) . Nick did n't notice much more than a lingering sweetness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cream in the forefront and made the chocolate " a highlight rather than a main player .

It was like a long stream of different tastes : first one reminiscent of peanut butter , then a subtle salty flavor , then a nice nutty taste . Casey was absolutely disgusted , saying that he got a nasty taste a split second after eating it ( I feel it is scientifically important for me to point out that Casey is not a fan of peanut butter ) . <p> Nick was more of a middle ground .

I remember getting really excited about strawberry milk as a kid . Nick was telling us how he likes to watch horror movies in October with a glass of strawberry milk and a bowl of Count Chocula . It really is such a nostalgic ( but extremely odd ) flavor . <p> I think it rendered the biggest reaction out of all of us . We all agreed that it was the very distinct , artificial strawberry taste . When I bit down , I was immediately thinking of fruity cereal with an Oreo aftertaste . It reminded Nick of the strawberry Peeps dipped in chocolate . Casey thought that it was exactly like a cookie with an artificial strawberry filling . He said that the milk completely eclipsed the cookie and the traditional cream taste . Nick and Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely need to know what you 're signing up for. - <h> Conclusion <p> Rachael Marks <p> After eating a few more Oreos , we all decided that it was time to come to our conclusion on the best and worst type of milk for Oreos . <p> The Best : For Casey it was the vanilla milk . He really enjoyed how it emphasized the cream center . He thought it did a good job of soaking into the cookie and had a pleasant aftertaste . Another plus for him was that he 'd enjoy drinking the milk itself after . <p> My favorite was a tie between the chocolate and the almond milk . Both types of milk have equal pluses and minuses . Although the milkshake taste that the chocolate milk provided was enjoyable , I felt like I might get sick of it after one or two cookies . I really enjoyed the nutty taste of the almond milk , but I would n't want to drink it afterwards . Nick did n't think any of them gave him the cookie experience he loves from regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milk was definitely the strawberry , it was way to intense and I am not very fond of things that taste artificial . Nick said " none of the flavors offended me , but if I had to pick a least favorite I 'd pick the strawberry . It was n't bad , but just a different experience . " He also noted that if it came to having to drink the milk after he would n't pick the coconut or almond . And Casey , the uneaten remains of the almond milk dipped cookie on the plate in front of him , stated that it " did not add any flavor besides a background taste of malaise . " - <p> So the next time you buy a package of Oreos , consider mixing it up with an interesting milk . There are certainly a lot more to experiment on ! And I assure you , the combination of cookies and science is certainly the best taste of all. -

But do you know the pH level of them ? Not only is it a fun fact , it may also be useful if you 're trying to achieve pH balance in your diet . <p> The- pH scale , running from 0 to 14 , measures the acidity/alkalinity of any substance , with 0 being the most acidic , 7 being neutral , and 14 being alkaline . To maintain good health , our bodies need to achieve a pH level near 7.4 " that is , slightly alkaline ( hence the name alkaline diet ) . If we start to depart too much from this level , then various enzymes in our bodies will not function properly .

The pH level of kombucha beverages are typically around 3 , making it quite acidic . <p> Why is kombucha acid when it 's fermented tea , and the latter is alkaline ? Well , the- dominant type of bacteria in Kombucha creates acetic acid , a healthy acid which also contributes to Kombucha 's low pH . <h> Coffee <p> Unlike green tea which is alkaline , coffee , which many people see as a substitute for tea , is acidic , with a pH level of 4.5 for black coffee . What is the pH for a latte you may wonder ? Well you need to know the pH for milk ... <h> Milk <p> Milk 's pH- level ranges from around 6.5 for pasteurized milk to 7 for raw milk .

Non-dairy milk like rice , soy and almond milk have pH levels of around 6 . <h> Soda <p> The pH level of soda varies depending on the kind . Seltzer , also known as soda water or sparkling water , is simply water in- which carbon dioxide gas has been dissolved under pressure . This process- creates carbonic acid , which means carbonated water is relatively acidic , with a pH of between 3 and 4 . <p> Ever wondered what the difference is between seltzer and club soda ? Here 's the answer : seltzer- is carbonated water with no additives . Club soda has sodium or potassium salts added . These are alkaline and increase the pH of carbonated water . Other popular , flavored soda drinks tend to be acidic : root beer has a pH around 4.5 , while Coke and Pepsi have a pH of around 2.5.

You 've probably heard Dr. Oz swear by hundreds of them as " miracle " cleansers . Detox diets promise to help people she 'd weight quickly by cutting out certain groups of food completely . Therefore , the bad toxins are eliminated from the body. - <p> Even I was enticed to try a detox diet to be healthier . I went on a 10-day sugar detox , and it turned out disastrous on day two when I realized literally EVERYTHING HAS SUGAR IN IT . After that , I thought about how ridiculous detox diets are . Why should anyone give up a food group completely when they could simply be more conscious of what they are eating ? <p> Here are five reasons why I believe detox diets are a waste of time . <h> 1 .

Juicing may give your body a few of the nutrients it needs to function , but eating is n't really involved in the process . Being deprived of physical food takes a toll on emotions . This can cause people to overeat when the detox is done simply because they missed the action of chewing and eating .

They can be bad for your health <p> Detoxes and other diets can make you think that you need to take drastic measures to be fit . However , that is not the case . Your body needs food to function . It 's okay to eat fat , carbs , and other " bad " foods in moderation . Having a box of Juicy Juice or whatever your detox tells you to have is not healthy . Some people take detox diets to the extreme , which can really destroy the body. - <h> 5 . They are expensive <p> Eating healthy every single second of every single day is very pricey .

As always , consult your doctor first if you do want to detox , and if you decide against it , go ahead and treat yourself to a donut because at least you thought- about being healthy , right ?

Originally , this was my sisters hair salon , it was Paparazzi Hair Studio and Spa . When she moved down the block , we decided we wanted to open a shop here .

Our fruity drink that is the most popular is the Peach Perfect , which has mango , peaches , banana and grapes . Our green smoothie that is the most popular is our Sweet Greens , which has kale , spinach , kiwi and green apples . And our protein shake that 's the most popular is the Burner It has chocolate protein , peanut butter , banana , carrot and rice milk . <p> Beth LeValley <p> What strange fruit combinations have you made ? <p> A lot of them come from customers .

Some people just want grapes and green apples , that 's all they will have . One I had that was really good was watermelon and pear . Oh my gosh , it was good , and they added a little bit of lemon to it , it was really nice . <p> What is your favorite drink ? <p> The Bahamian Blast and the Burner " they are both really good . Bahamian Blast has pineapple , papaya and mango . I really like papayas , so it 's really my favorite . <p> What sets you apart from other juice bars in the area ? <p> Ours are made to order , the Juice Company on 42nd does a lot of pre-made juices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .

Some fruit combinations do n't go together and some do . You have to be careful with kale , you have to be careful with cucumbers because they are very overpowering , flavorful vegetables . I learned how to clean things after you used peanut butter and when to use a special blender for people who have allergies .

The Red Rooster could always be counted on to give new life to yesterday 's leftovers with just the right amount of spice . Sriracha was more than a culinary stand-by " it was a way of life . <p> However , when I finally read the list of ingredients , I began to have second thoughts about my dependence on the hot sauce . While sriracha contains only eight ingredients , sugar is second on the list . This works out to about 1 gram of sugar per teaspoon of sriracha . <p> While a single gram of sugar does n't seem like a lot , it can quickly add up with the amount of sriracha you consume on a daily basis . Rose Ferrao <p> With refined sugar being hailed as the nutritional antichrist , I knew I had to find a substitute for my beloved sriracha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a lesser known condiment called sambal oelek .

While this lack of sugar gives sambal oelek a distinctly different taste and texture from sriracha , I find that the absence of sugar allows the other flavours to stand out . <h> 2 . It 's More Flavourful <p> Again , the lack of sugar prevents the other ingredients from being masked . The chili peppers and garlic that give the sauce its signature spice and flavour take center stage . This results in sambal oelek being spicier than sriracha , which might take some getting used to at first . However , this difference really is n't that overpowering , and you can also use less sauce to get the same level of spice . <h> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sriracha makes it hard to determine whether you 're eating hot sauce or ketchup . The texture of sambal oelek is much more rustic , and you can even see the seeds of the chili peppers . <h> 4 . It 's Less Wasteful <p> There 's nothing worse than not being able to get the last of the sriracha out of the bottle . While the squeeze bottle is convenient for quickly coating your food , it 's terrible for waste . Since sambal oelek is sold in a jar , it eliminates this problem . As a bonus , the jar is also way easier to clean out for recycling . <h> 5 . It 's More Versatile- <p> While there are countless recipes that call for sriracha , I find that sambal oelek is much more versatile .

Although Tex-Mex is generally defined by copious amounts of shredded cheese , ground beef , and flour tortillas and in the form of enchiladas , chalupas , burritos , and- " - of course- " - tacos , chili really is the OG Tex-Mex . <p> Before the " combo-plate-style " Tex-Mex of an entree served with rice , beans , and sour cream gained popularity in the early 1900 's , it was chili that first introduced introduced Tex-Mex into the mainstream . Although we have established that chili really has nothing to do with Mexican food ( but then again , nor do chimichangas ) , the story of Tex-Mex really begins with the Chili Queens of San Antonio . <p> The Chili Queens were a group of Mexican women who began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes , ultimately giving rise to the Tex-Mex tradition . <p> So , while most Texans profess their great love for tacos in all their many forms , I feel that this is an insufficient argument for establishing tacos as our state dish . In a way , I believe such an argument is analogous to arguing that falafel be the state dish of New York . Although falafel is a popular food in New York City , in no way does falafel represent or evoke the history and tradition of the city . Therefore , I stand by my conviction that chili truly is the most worthy option for the state dish of Texas .

@@322627 <h> 8 Ways to Responsibly Dispose of Used Cooking Oil <h> Do n't let your efforts go down the drain . @qwx11771 @qwx11783 @qwx11776 <p> Learning to fry food as a college student is no small feat . Sadly , getting that food onto a plate and seasoning it perfectly is only half the battle . After finishing your exquisite meal , you often find yourself confronted with a pot or pan of used oil . What do you do ? <p> The proper disposal of oil is an important waste concern . Cooking oil can block plumbing and piping , which allows for sewage backup into homes and businesses ( ew ) . People assume that pairing the used oil with hot water and pouring it down the drain will suffice , but drains do not have a proper grease management system , and the problem continues to persist . <p> How do we stop this unsanitary phenomenon ? Here are eight ways to get rid of that cooking oil through responsible and sustainable methods . Your drains and the environment will thank you . <h> 1 . Re-use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil is to , well , re-use it . If you use the oil for foods like vegetables or potatoes , the oil can be used again several times . Beware of cooking meat or fish repeatedly in oil , though . While it can be used for the same product two or three times , it 's best to make sure the oil is safe to cook with . Follow- these steps to ensure safe oil every time . <h> 2 . Pour it out <p> Recycling sounds nice , but sometimes it 's just impossible to do . If you have to throw your oil out , do it the right way . Once the oil cools , pour it into a milk carton or an unrecyclable container and toss it out . Make sure the container is unbreakable and it is sealed tightly to prevents spills and leakages into your garbage can . <h> 3 . Freeze it <p> A good way to deal with oil , whether you plan on re-using it in the near future or throwing it out , is freezing it . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealable container . Place it in the freezer , and done ; it can be re-used at a later date and even makes for an easy way to get rid of otherwise pesky liquified oil . <h> 4 . Convert it into biodiesel <p> UnitedSoybeanBoard on Flickr <p> Say what ? Believe it or not , leftover oil can be turned into biodiesel , which can be made from oils like vegetable oil or animal fat combined with an alcohol like methanol . It is a desirable substitute for petroleum because it is supposedly less damaging to the environment and emits less harmful greenhouse gases when turned into fuel for tractors , motorcycles , and more . <p> While you personally may not have enough cooking oil to do this , contacting your local restaurants to see if they participate in this awesome method of recycling is a great way to get rid of your unwanted grease and save the world at the same time . <h> 5 . Get someone else to recycle it <p> Even if your local restaurant does n't convert their used oil into biodiesel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste management companies , and the government that aid in the effort to reduce neglectful disposal of oil . Just search for your state or county and programs like Cease the Grease- or- this program from Brighton County- which may be in action near you . <h> 6 . Compost it or use it to kill weeds <p> crabtree on unsplash <p> Vegetable oils , such as canola or olive oil , are compostable in small quantities . Oil can also be used to kill weeds ; just place it in a spray bottle and spray those unruly nuisances away . It 's like killing two birds with one stone . <h> 7 . Mix it <p> If you really just want to throw your oil away , mix it with an absorbent material , like sawdust , cat litter , or flour , until the consistency is thick enough to- easily- throw away . Now you wo n't have to worry about oil leaking through garbage bags or spilling all over the place . <h> 8 . Try the Fat Trapper System <p> The Fat Trapper System is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil dilemma so many of us face . It effectively holds grease and oil in an odor-free , entirely sanitary contraption . You just fold the bag and throw it away once it 's full . Get your fat trapper system here- for mess-free oil disposal every single time . <p> While it may be easy to pour your used oil down the drain , it is definitely not the safest . So long as you take precautions when re-using , recycling , or throwing away your oil , you should never have to face the consequences any careless actions can create . Do n't let your efforts in preserving the environment go down the drain .

Even though I have a full kitchen in my apartment , I usually just heat up microwavable meals that I find in the frozen section of the grocery store . <p> There 's something about microwaves that I find comforting , and they usually are quicker than other methods . I was eager to buy this book and test out some of these recipes to see how well they really worked . It almost sounded too good to be true . For this experiment , I made breakfast , lunch , dinner , dessert , and a drink . <h> Breakfast <p> Emma Salters <p> For breakfast , I cooked biscuits . The book has a recipe for both homemade biscuits and pre-packaged ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easier . Unfortunately , I was off to a rough start . The book 's instructions insisted on using specific things to cook with . This recipe called for a browning skillet , and I used the closest thing to one that I could find , which I thought had been iron but there 's a chance it was metal . PSA : be careful of what you put in the microwave . <p> I was supposed to heat that up by itself before beginning . A weird smell came from the microwave and I was freaked out and concerned , so I decided to use a plate to spare the cookware . I hoped this would not severely impact the recipe as the book suggested . When I cooked the biscuits for the amount of time I was supposed to , they didn't- seem to be cooked all the way . I felt disappointed and worried about the rest of the meals . Up next was grilled cheese . That had to be safe right ? <h> Lunch <p> Emma Salters <p> For a lunch option I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in the toaster first , which makes sense considering I initially assumed putting bread in the microwave as is would make it too soft .

I used cheddar cheese on the sandwich , and it came out delicious . This was a nice relief after what happened with the bicuits. - <h> Dinner <p> Emma Salters <p> For dinner I cooked a steak . When I saw this recipe I was baffled . How is it possible to cook steak in the microwave ? I was so skeptical but so curious that I had to try it . I was worried about this because I was going to be using a plate , even though the book instructed to use a browning skillet .

At this point , I had to season it and flip it for another 15 seconds in the microwave . After the steak was done it looked fully cooked . <p> I shit you not , this steak actually cooked in the microwave . This was the biggest surprise to me . I added some garlic powder for fun because I love garlic , and it tasted pretty darn good . I learned a valuable lesson from this , that , yes , it is totally possible to cook a steak in the microwave .

Just like I started this experiment , I ended it with some difficulty . I was supposed to make a pie crust , but I bought one to make things easier . I bought chocolate because chocolate and peanut butter are obviously the best combo . I was n't thinking however , because these recipes were small portions meant for one person . <p> I ended up trying to double the recipe and at a certain point I was just guessing and hoping it turned out okay .

I was surprised that it did n't taste bad , and I was able to taste the peanut butter , however I could only eat a few spoonfuls before I was tired of it . <p> Emma Salters <p> This book may or may not be life changing . I had such a fun time cooking with it and I look forward to cooking more meals in the microwave in the future .

Packed with a variety of mix-ins and rich , creamy bases , each pint has the power to make any day a good day . The curious , self titled " flavor gurus " are always coming up with original concoctions , the most recent being Urban Bourbon , Oat of this Swirled , and Truffle Kerfuffle . As self proclaimed ice cream enthusiasts , Spoon Vassar decided to perform a taste test and determine which of these new flavors reins supreme . <p> Annika Rowland <h> Urban Bourbon <p> Before even opening the pint , our Marketing Director declared " I 'm so hype for this one " .

One member commented that the almonds gave a nice nutty after taste . However , this is where the positive comments end . " It 's a little plain " , " It reminds me of salted caramel " , " I 'm a little confused eating it " floated around the room . <p> We decided that Urban Bourbon was semi-original , only a disguised version of more commonly found caramel flavors . After averaging everyone 's ratings out of 10 , Urban Bourbon came in last with a score of 6.6 . <p> Lindsey Sample <h> Truffle Kerfuffle <p> This pint definitely has one of the more interesting names Ben and Jerry has come up with .

The first comments were positive ; " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not overwhelming amount of ganache " , " texture is nice " . <p> Then , things went downhill . Again . " Not very original " , " I thought it would be more chocolatey " , " It 's reminds me of moose tracks " all were critically muttered . Again , the title of the pint masked the mostly unoriginal flavor combination . Granted , you do not get salted chocolate at any old ice cream shop . <p> After another round of rating , we decided that Truffle Kerfuffle came in second with a score of 7.15 . <p> Annika Rowland <h> Oat of This Swirled <p> The final punny flavor we sampled is described as " Buttery Brown Sugar Ice Cream with Fudge Flakes &amp; Oatmeal Cinnamon Cookie Swirls " . There were some skeptics in the crowd , but members commented that it definitely- sounded like an original flavor , unlike the other two . <p> As soon as everyone dived in , positive comments were abound . " It tastes like a homemade oatmeal cookie " , " the fudge flakes are hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste the brown sugar " . I waited for the negative comments , but the only thing I heard was chocolate lovers may be disappointed . Overall , Oat of this Swirled was a great success. - <p> After careful deliberation , it was decided that Oat of This Swirled , the underdog , came out on top with a score of 8.9 . <p> Lindsey Sample <p> Be sure to run to your nearby supermarket to grab these flavors ( or any Ben and Jerry 's pint ) a try as soon as your next ice cream craving hits !

Top your oatmeal- with berries , peanut butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon for a delicious first meal of the day . <h> 2 . Protein smoothie <p> Photo by Rachel Piorko <p> Unlike smoothies from Jamba Juice and Smoothie King that contain over 50 grams of sugar , homemade smoothies can be very healthy . Use a banana- and frozen fruit as a- natural sweetener- and thickener , a scoop of whey protein powder to keep you full and make your breakfast more nutritionally dense , and a final splash of almond milk . Avoid using any juice in your smoothies to keep the sugar content to a minimum . <p> #SpoonTip : - Fruit juice is actually extremely high in sugar and low in fiber .

Use whole-grain toast as a source of- complex carbohydrates and- fiber , and a poached egg for added- protein . If you 're into spicy foods , avocado toast pairs perfectly with Cholula or Tabasco hot sauce . <h> 4 . Scrambled eggs <p> Photo by Rebecca Wang <p> Eggs are a breakfast staple " - who does n't love a good scrambled or hardboiled egg ? Egg yolks have gained a bad rep in the news , but fortunately for all those sunny side-up lovers , egg yolks are surprisingly good for you .

The egg provides folate and iron , the turkey-sausage patty gives you plenty of protein without the saturated fat that an actual sausage patty has , the avocado provides- monounsaturated fats and the English muffin gives- you fiber .

@@322673 <h> You 'd be surprised to find out how much salt is hidden in the most unbeknownst foods , and how little we 're actually recommended to consume . @qwx11771 @qwx11783 @qwx11776 <p> New dietary guidelines came out in January , and it 's no shock that the recommendations continue to be that we eat too much salt . The upper limit of the recommendation is to consume 2300mg of sodium daily , but if possible , less is better . Our bodies only need 500mg- to carry out body functions like muscle contractions and nerve transmissions . <p> But measuring in milligrams feels hypothetical , and minimizes- the extent to which we can understand- how much salt we 're really consuming . 2300mg is actually equivalent to 1 teaspoon . We 're only allotted 1 teaspoon of salt a day . <p> One standard teaspoon featured in every picture represents the recommended sodium intake per day ( 2300 mg ) , and the spoon next to it represents how much sodium is in a serving of that food . It may be surprising to see how little salt our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a lot of foods unexpectedly . <h> Bagels @qwx11781 <p> A bagel on average has a salt content of 490mg . That 's a little over 20 percent of the daily limit on the bagel itself . Keep in mind , this does n't included your schmear of choice . <h> Breakfast Cereals @qwx11781 <p> Although we commonly think of Raisin Bran as being sugary ( but not even that much tastier than cardboard ) , there 's actually a good amount of salt hidden in there . Like a lot of breakfast cereals , the salt content in a standard bowl of cereal is close to 20- percent- of the daily recommended amount . <h> Deli Meat @qwx11781 <p> Depending on the meat , the sodium content can vary , but a lot of sodium is added not as salt , but as preservatives like sodium nitrate . Deli meat alone makes up for about 70 percent- of most people 's sodium intake , with around 400mg of sodium in eachslice of meat . <h> Canned Soups @qwx11781 <p> Looking for low sodium alternatives or whipping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge chunk of sodium . Canned soups are- generally packed with salt , potentially containing up to half of the daily recommendation in just a 1/2 cup serving ( there are 2.5 servings in each can ) . <h> Ketchup @qwx11781 <p> Surprisingly enough , just 1 tablespoon of ketchup has 190mg of sodium , which is 16 percent of the daily recommendation . And that 's not to account for whatever the ketchup is being put on or dipped into : probably some salty french fries or grilled cheese . <h> Sliced Bread @qwx11781 <p> Speaking of grilled cheese , sliced bread contains a good amount of sodium as well . One slice of white bread , depending on the brand , can contain between 80 to 230mg of sodium . <h> Spaghetti Sauce @qwx11781 <p> Some brands contain very little sodium , but others can contain around 500mg of sodium for 1/2 cup of sauce , which is n't nearly enough sauce to realistically cover a serving of pasta . Check for low-sodium versions or brands that are normally low on sodium content . <h> Dairy Products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 slice of American cheese has 200mg of sodium , and 1/2 cup of cottage cheese has 360mg . <p> When it comes down to it , make sure you 're checking the nutrition facts label on foods as you go food shopping , and be cautious of all the hidden sodium in your diet .

Foods like cabbage , carrots , peppers , potatoes and apples all fall under this category . <p> If you have a big , watery bag of baby carrots that 's starting to smell weird though , pitch it . Mold and bacteria love moisture and unless you want to pick through every carrot one-by-one , you 're probably better off pitching the whole bag . <h> If your tomatoes or peaches are moldy ... <p> Nancy Chen <p> Okay , the USDA says throw them away because soft-fleshed fruits and vegetables are more susceptible to mold penetration ( like the bread ) , but I personally have cut away mold on peaches and tomatoes for 25 years and have lived to tell the tale .

Even though I may not fully believe or subscribe to what these diets advocate , I figured some of them may be worth trying so I would have experience to back my opinion . <p> Through a series of connections , I eventually found myself on the phone with Kim Kardashian 's actual nutritionist , which is , quite frankly , the most brag-worthy moment of my life in recent history . She offered and described to me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week , just to gauge how things are. - <p> Basically , I could n't have more than 40 net carbs per day , which was a hella serious problem because I practically bleed carbs . But hey , it sounded easy enough and perhaps it could even be a way to reduce my dependency on carbs . And , real talk , I 've always wanted to write an experiential article anyways , so it worked out well . <p> I decided to start the diet the same week I moved into my new apartment , that way I would n't be tempted with anything my parents cooked . I splurged at the nearest Trader Joe 's and bought some chicken thighs , sausage , and assorted produce , ready to knock this out of the park . <p> After lunch was where it started getting rough . I was hungry towards the late afternoon , so I settled with cottage cheese and blackberries as a snack . At that point , I decided I could n't wait any longer and opted to make dinner early : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well , except I felt like practically nothing entered my body . I did n't feel satiated at all , and I made it a point to let others know how I felt . <p> Jedd Marrero <p> The nutritionist- told me that it may take a while for your body to adjust , so I decided to wait it out . I went to bed in total darkness , with nothing but the sound of my stomach rumbling keeping me company . The first cut is the deepest , right ? <h> Day Two <p> Jedd Marrero <p> The whole " eat a granola bar for breakfast " thing was getting real old , real quick . Granted , I was really- supposed to have a legitimate meal that morning ( eggs , bacon , grits , sausage , the whole shebang ) , but there was no way I could squeeze in food prep before going in for work .

I , for one , did not need to lose any weight at all . In fact , I needed to gain some weight , and the Atkins diet was something that typically people use to lose weight . <p> My first day on the diet , I was able to stay under the 40 net carb limit , which was great . My calorie intake , on the other hand , was n't so great .

Even further , diving right into the 40 net carbs after having easily four or five times that number on a regular basis is super hard . <p> That 's not to say that there were n't mistakes on my behalf " I could have dedicated more time to making breakfast and packing lunch on the second day , but time is something that you either have a lot of , or none at all . @qwx11778 <p> Fundamentally , I 'm sure the Atkins diet works " hell , even Kim Kardashian did it " but it came as nearly impossible for me . I guess the real clincher here is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with a trend or be described as hip ' or cool , ' no matter how awesome drinking straight-up juice for a week may sound .

After that , I went to the gym where I had probably the worst migraine ever ( no , literally ) . Full disclosure " I admit I burped more than I ever would have in public . After I got that out of my system , I actually had a killer leg session . <h> Day 2 @qwx11778 <p> Going into day two , I knew a little bit more of what to expect . I poured my shot ( the correct amount this time " one tablespoon ) into a mini solo cup shot glass to pump myself up like a bro . I ended up coughing a lot " as if I were taking an actual shot of alcohol ( yes , I 'm that girl ) . My throat was burning afterwards . Granted , I do have the sniffles and/or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have breakfast today for a half an hour so no burping for me . <h> Day 3 @qwx11778 <p> Today I upped the ante by doing two tablespoons ( which is what most people do in the morning ) . This time , I chased it with some almond milk . I 'm not sure if that was the best idea " the flavors of vinegar , apple , and almond do n't really mesh well . I took it before my breakfast and it had no effect on my appetite . <h> Day 4 @qwx11778 <p> Again , I did two tablespoons in the morning . I wonder if my housemates are curious about why there are shot glasses to be put away every day before noon ? Yes I have continued to use my mini solo shot glass to make me feel like a boss when taking these . <p> I 'm obviously on a health kick right now and so I took my hair/skin/nail vitamin right afterward ( gummies FTW ) which left my stomach feeling acidy . I have never experienced heartburn before , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in my stomach . <h> Day 5 @qwx11778 <p> I got to see my mom this weekend and she was a witness to my fifth ACV shot . This time , I tried the organic brand to see if it made a difference . After measuring the vinegar ( still two tablespoons ) and slurping it down , my mom was horrified . She was n't freaked out by the ACV " she too had heard of the benefits " but she had never heard of taking it straight . Mixers are for the weak , mom . <h> Day 6 @qwx11778 <p> So this day kind of does n't count because I did n't take my ACV . Why , you ask , did I fail ? Was it too much to bear tastewise ? Was the daily burping getting to be too much ? Nope . I overslept and- had just enough time to make it to my morning class . I did n't want to take my shot in the middle of the day in between meals . So sue me . <h> Day 7ish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple cider vinegar cleanse trial . I have to say , taking the shot this morning was n't bad . Again , I burped my way through the morning but I also felt accomplished . <p> While I was n't 100% successful in my attempt , I 'm happy I tried this out . Would I recommend this to a friend ? If you have the time and money for some ACV , then go ahead , it 's not going to hurt . I do have to admit that I was disappointed when I did n't see a change in my skin or weight for that matter . I did notice a little less bloating but I 'm not sure what to attribute that to . <p> All in all , I kind of knew that taking this shot every day was n't going to turn me into the perfect specimen of human health . I did n't expect taking it to make- me so mindful of what I ate afterwards . Sometimes that 's what we need to kick ourselves into high gear .

Everyone knows that salmon is full of healthy fats , but much of those are actually stored in the skin .

But perhaps that 's fitting , because Arby 's gyro does n't share much with the Mediterranean version either . <p> Admittedly , not too terrible . There 's not quite as much meat here as you would expect from the standard festival gyro , and the salad is n't quite as fresh , but they 're reasonably reminiscent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too noticeable , but the texture is completely off . <p> That said , the elements are there . The pita 's soft and doughy , the tzatziki sauce is herbal , if a bit bland , and it 's one of the few items on their menu with vegetables . And unlike the gyros you buy at festivals , you know what 's in this one . It 's just not exactly the best gyro , but it qualifies . <p> But perhaps I 'm being too hard on the faux-gyro , perhaps I 'm looking at it the wrong way . As a fresh take on the roast beef sandwich , it does okay . It 's just not the direction you would expect Arby 's to take . <p> Truth is , the fast food industry is in flux . People are more conscious of what they eat ; they want new things . The result is restaurants- scrambling to keep up with demand , going all-in on bizarre new products that are more often disappointing than delicious . <p> So Arby 's , real talk here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better off sticking to the classics . You do a good job with roast beef sandwiches , so keep doing that . But trying to force foreign concepts into your menu wo n't work when your model is so clearly outdated . Keep doing beef and curly fries , and leave the gyros to the food trucks . <p> The Verdict : If you 're going to Arby 's , just grab a roast beef sandwich . It 's what they do best .

It can be found in almost any mini fridge , and usually gets cleared out of the bookstore within a day of restocking . Unless you 're like me and sometimes eat hummus plain ( I know , do n't judge ) , you need a great crunchy snack to dip in it . Hummus comes in a multitude of flavors , but each snack food I personally believe can go with any of the flavor options your supermarket has to offer . Here is my personal ranking of the best snacks to dip in hummus. <h> 6 . Wheat Thins <p> Photo courtesy of dishmaps.com <p> While wheat thins are small , their distinct cracker flavor packs a punch when combined with hummus .

The Italian-inspired meals I ate typically consisted of spaghetti noodles drenched in store-bought marinara sauce that was loaded with added sugars and preservatives . The Italian restaurants in my area were n't exactly authentic , so I never fully understood the hype behind pasta . I mean , yes , pasta is delicious , but why are there so many types ? And why ca n't I just cover my spaghetti noodles in Alfredo sauce and call it a day ? <p> Well , I could just manhandle spaghetti noodles and stick to just one type of pasta .

I also discovered that there are way too many types of pasta for me to discuss in this article , so if your favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google knows all . <h> Spaghetti <h> Penne <p> Photo by Ilze Vizulius <p> The quill shape of penne compliments almost any sauce . The thick ridges on the outside of the pasta picks up thicker sauces and the hollow middle is great at storing sauce inside . If you want to make a bomb casserole or need a little extra something to help your fave meat sauce find its way into your mouth , penne is the way to go. - <h> Orecchiette <p> Photo by Katherine Baker <p> I might not be able to pronounce this pasta , but oh man do I love it . Orecchiette 's shell-like shape allows sauce to settle inside it , meaning each bite is going to be mega flavorful and delicious . This particular pasta shape is also good for pasta bakes and pairs well with chunky sauces . <h> Linguine <p> Photo by Abigail Wang <p> Because linguine is a bit thicker than spaghetti , it 's able to better cling onto lighter sauces , especially ones made with cream. - Give it a go in your favorite one-pot pasta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mush while cooking with other ingredients . <h> Farfalle <p> Photo courtesy of John Herschell on Flickr <p> Other than being super cute , the bow tie shape of farfalle helps keep the pasta intact when tossed in pasta salads . Farfalle is best when used in casseroles involving meat sauce , as it can hold heavier sauces better than thinner noodles . <h> Fusilli <p> Photo courtesy of Myriam M. J. Rondeau on Flickr <p> The spirals of fusilli trap chunks of meat more easily and make it especially good at catching extra veggies in pasta salads . Like farfalle , fusilli gets two thumbs up from me because it 's just cute to look at . <h> Manicotti <p> Photo courtesy of alanagkelly on Flickr <p> Next to spaghetti , manicotti is my personal go-to pasta .

Egg noodles are usually quite thick and hearty , which is why they 're so great in casseroles or when paired with thicker cream sauces . Beef stroganoff is one of the more popular dishes egg noodles are used in , but there are tons of other ways they can be used as well. - <h> Angel Hair <p> Photo by Natsuko Mazany <p> Because angel hair pasta is long and thin , it 's best when used with lighter sauces or seafood dishes .

@@322851 <h> And yes , there are some days where all I can think about it is eating a grilled cheese sandwich and a milkshake. @qwx11771 @qwx11783 @qwx11776 <p> I 've been dealt a- myriad of health issues that have an enormous impact on what I eat . My food restrictions are constantly- in flux as the status of my- health changes , but I 've had ample time over the last 6 years to figure out how to cope . <p> Giving up- as many foods as I have was n't the hardest part , it was accepting this lifestyle as my new normal . It 's frustrating to be sick in high school and college , I struggled immensely with the idea that my- body was failing me when I worked so hard to- get where I am . <p> Just like I have to work hard in school , I have to work- hard to keep weight on so I do n't look like a skeleton . I can recite- my spiel explaining- why I have to eat this way to every- curious onlooker in my sleep by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be- social on campus ( even when- it looks incredibly lame to always be the only sober one ) . Some days I do n't feel well- and have to stay in bed all day when I should be in class or with friends . It took me a while to see the inconveniences as- trivial , but I 'm there now . Putting my health- first is- my new reality . I 'm grateful for the good and the bad days because of what they teach me . <p> Giving up food is not a- tragedy , tragedy would be- letting it control your life . It 's tough to stay absolute to restrictions , but- will power and- willingness to cook your own meals- skills are all you need . Take it from me because for a significant portion- of my life- I subsisted on coffee , bread , - and all things dairy . <p> If you 're in my shoes and have to give up some variation of caffeine , dairy , gluten and sugar , here 's how I went about it : <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought giving up caffeine for a long time , I told- myself that I did n't have time for the brutal withdrawal symptoms . But , alas , as- I was wheeled out of the hospital this past November after surgery on my GI tract with a throbbing headache ( from not having caffeine that day ) and paperwork about my disease diagnosis , I knew it was time to quit . <p> If you 're an avid coffee drinker like I was , and are n't willing to quit cold-turkey , cut back the amount you drink every day for 4 days until- you 're at the point of- only needing a few sips to avoid withdrawal symptoms . At this point , switch to a small cup of caffeinated tea . Following- the same idea , reduce the amount of tea over the course of a few days until you can get through the day- without withdrawal symptoms . <p> My new ritual is a cup of ginger tea , or a glass of hot water with lemon , apple cider vinegar , and raw honey . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk and cheese with- quality- alternatives . Buy unsweetened nut and seed milks , read dairy-free yogurt labels like a scientist ( because most contain gross amounts of refined sugar ) and if the vegan cheese has ingredients in it you ca n't pronounce- do not buy it . <p> When it comes to baked goods and snacks , you 're going to have to learn to love the kitchen . The biggest problem with store-bought gluten free products lies in the fact that they 're usually- loaded with sugar or fried to make up for their less-than-sexy texture . <h> Sugar <p> - <p> Photo by Kristine Mahan <p> Even the best gluten free and vegan baked goods are made with- refined sugar , so make it yourself . <p> My best replacement recommendation is- coconut sugar , a low-glycemic sweetener- that you can buy as- granules or syrup. - Though higher on the glycemic index , raw honey- is one of the healthiest foods on earth and real maple syrup offers a plethora of vitamins and minerals . And there's- always agave nectar in a pinch ( fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . - Some of my favorite- dairy , gluten and refined-sugar free recipes include oatmeal , coconut whipped cream- and- peanut butter cookies . <p> I 'm in good company when it comes to food restrictions . Our culture has finally- turned to the- diet for aid- in the healing and- bettering of health . When I first got sick it was rather uncommon- to have- dietary restrictions , let alone be open- about them . This does n't mean you wo n't encounter- unkind- comments or people telling you they could never do it , because that will happen A lot . Take it with a grain of salt , you learn a lot about people by the way they treat you when- you 're sick . <p> Part of what has gotten me through these 6 years has been a new-found enthusiasm for food . You can check out the byproduct of my enthusiasm ( and restrictive-friendly recipes ) on my own- blog The Healthy Hypoglycemic . <p> Remember to make your own rules as you go , not everything works for everyone the same way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel good .

Adding fruit flavors by slicing open fruit and dropping it into some water is a healthy way to make water more interesting . Drinking 64 ounces of water a day never looked so pretty . <p> But what about all of that ( expensive ) fruit you 're bloating with water ? You know what it looks like when you pull it out after a few hours of soaking . It looks like baby food mush . Not at all appetizing .

But what about all the fruit you 're trashing ? <p> Photo by Rachel Piorko <p> The simple answer is to drink the fruit as you go . If you want to avoid the calories , this is n't really an option . But if you 're doing it solely to up water intake and drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good option . You may accidentally eat some anyway depending on the method of drinking ( i.e. , straw vs. wide-mouthed bottle ) . <p> Another option for consuming your bloated fruit is making smoothies out of them .

Or even worse , believe that cupcakes and muffins are the same . No , cupcakes are cupcakes and muffins are muffins . <p> Photo by Jisoo Kim <p> Photo by Katherine Baker <p> Though it may be hard to pinpoint the difference between a cupcake and muffin , it should be clear whether or not you 're eating a cupcake or muffin after- your first bite . <p> One similarity between cupcakes and muffins is the ingredients . Both usually contain flour , eggs , butter , sugar and milk . However , muffins sometimes replace all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour , oat flour or even various nut flours . Muffins can also be filled with a variety of tasty mix-ins , such as dried fruits , nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter with a liquid form of fat , such as vegetable oil . The amount- of butter and sugar is higher in cupcakes than in- muffins . <p> The mixing process and the consistency of the batter differentiates- cupcakes and muffins . Cupcakes are made by creaming the butter and sugar together to create a smooth , fluffy batter . Cupcake batter is beaten significantly longer than muffin batter ; this creates a uniformness of air bubbles throughout the cupcake . Muffin batter , on the other hand , is beaten briefly and remains relatively lumpy . This makes for a more dense baked good . <p> Muffins are often believed to be the healthier option , which is why it is acceptable to eat them for breakfast . But muffins are not always the healthier option . You can , however , have savory muffins , but not savory cupcakes . <p> Photo by Katherine Carroll <p> The most obvious visual difference between cupcakes and muffins is , of course , the frosting .

You follow the recipe , you fill the cupcake liners , you pop them in the oven . They look beautifully rounded in the oven , but alas , you wait patiently . Finally , the timer goes off , you pull them out , and the flat cupcakes make themselves known . <p> Biggest . Letdown . Ever . <p> Now , for the question that 's on all of our minds : how can I avoid the flatness and achieve the roundedness ? Here are some things you may be overlooking . <h> 1 . Check how old your baking soda or baking powder is . <p> Baking soda and powder are the essential ingredients that get the chemical reactions rolling in most baked goods . They play an especially important role in cupcakes " they 're the team players that get the cupcakes to rise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your baking soda or powder is too old it wo n't react with the other ingredients properly . This means your cupcakes will not rise to their- full potential . You can check the age of your baking soda- by mixing it with vinegar and hot water . If it bubbles , you 're good to go . If not , throw it out . You can test your baking powder- similarly by mixing it with hot water and seeing if it bubbles . <p> Photo by Meredith Simmons <h> 2 . Measure out your baking soda or baking powder- precisely . <p> This may seem like a given , but hear me out . Do n't ever , - ever eyeball baking soda/powder . The recipe has an exact amount specified for a reason . Too much will cause the batter to overflow out of the muffin pan then deflate , while too little will make your cupcakes flat and sad since they- could n't rise enough . Take the extra measure to pull out your teaspoon and measure that sucker . <h> - 3 . Do not over-mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to your batter . When you put cupcakes in the hot oven with too much air in the batter , the hot air will only make it seem as if your cupcakes are rising as- the air escapes , causing the dreaded deflation . With practice , learn how to mix cupcake batter just until the ingredients are combined and no more than that . I like to use a silicone spatula and fold the ingredients together rather than use a mixer , - which can- beat the ingredients to death . <h> 4 . Filling the pan- definitely matters . <p> Fill your cupcake liners 3/4 of the way full . If you fill them more than that , they 'll have no room left to expand , and they will collapse . If you fill them less than that , there will be so- much space for them to expand that they wo n't be able to reach . 3/4 is key . <p> Photo by Meredith Simmons <h> 5 . Oven temperature is crucial . <p> This part is a little tricky , but ensures a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regardless of what the recipe says ( I know earlier I was stressing to follow the recipe precisely , but wait . ) Once the edges seemed to have baked , reduce the temperature back to the one recommended in the recipe . This way the center of the cupcake can rise apart from the edges , - giving you that desired shape . <h> 6 . The oven door is there for a reason . <p> Do not open the oven door while the cupcakes are baking . Opening the oven door let 's some of the heat out , which ultimately let 's air escape from the cupcakes , leading to deflation . Seriously , resist the urge . I know it 's hard . We 'll get through this together . <p> Hopefully your cupcakes come out looking a little like this : <p> Photo by Meredith Simmons <p> Beautiful . Brings a tear to my eye .

Arnold found some other people crazy enough to want to start a full blown museum about food and they started a Kickstarter campaign . Their first exhibit was a traveling puffing gun used to make cereal . <p> After the success of the puffing gun , the MOFAD team leased an old garage in Brooklyn to become the MOFAD Lab , a space for special exhibits until they can expand .

There is n't a rock big enough to hide under ) . It was a TV phenomenon that people could not get enough of and just when you thought you 'd heard the last of it , BOOM there was " Joey " , " The Class " , " How I Met Your Mother " and many more , all trying to capitalise on its successful format . <p> Now , 23 years later , you thought it was FINALLY over ... well , you thought wrong . Here 's my ranking of all the food related " Friends " episodes I could think of ( and there are surprisingly more than you would think ) . <h> 14 . All of those episodes that have food that is n't pivotal to the plot <p> We 're talking about all those episodes that have food in the title and yet it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. " The One with the Dozen Lasagnas " , where Monica makes a bunch of lasagnas and gives them out randomly to people throughout the episode ) . Since the food is arbitrary , all these episodes get placed at the bottom of the pile . <p> I mean , the entire story line is that the girls try to figure out Phoebe 's grandmother 's chocolate chip cookie recipe FOR THE WHOLE EPISODE ( and still fail ) . That 's it . There 's no twists and barely any narrative , so it ranks marginally higher than the episodes where the food has no role at all . <p> So , the story goes that Monica tries to make her neighbours like her by giving them free candy . Monica 's Type A personality never ceases to be funny ( especially when it gets Chandler equally rattled ) but TBH , her actions here are more sad than funny . Sorry Monica , got to rank you down for that one but since the food is a driving factor of the plot this time , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly food-centric episode for " Friends " where Chandler and Rachel fight over some cheesecake that magically appears on their doorstep ( is n't that the dream ? ? ) . Watching a desperate Chandler and Rachel scrounge around for crumbs of cheesecake on the ground is a little bit sad , but funnier than Monica having a nervous breakdown . Plus , - who has n't eaten food off the floor ? I think we can all relate to this one . <p> Rachel accidentally gets a penis shaped cake for her daughter 's first birthday , because sex ed started very early for kids back in 2003. - <p> We never get to see the cake so this episode is less funny than it could 've been , but the premise is funny enough to make the Top 10 . Plus , it 's the only episode so far on this list that is n't slightly sad ( and cake always wins in my books ) . <h> 9 . The One With The List <p> Monica tries out a new , healthier form of chocolate called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human race , the results were less than satisfactory , but the reactions sure were funny . At least in this episode you actually get to see the food in question ( still not over the lack of penis-shaped cake on our screens at No.10 ) . <p> Note : although this GIF is not from the episode , it does sum up the gang 's reaction to everything Monica made during this episode <h> 8 . The One With The Rumour <p> In this episode , Joey thinks he can eat a whole turkey in one sitting during the gang 's annual Thanksgiving dinner . The best part about this episode is n't just the fact that Joey thinks he can eat the whole thing , but it 's his turkey eating ( i.e. maternity ) trousers that steal the show - just look at him in all his glory above . <p> Deep , deep , DEEP down ( or maybe not so deep ) , we all wish we had a pair of trousers like those , which is why it ranks slightly higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 7 . The One With The Ride Along <p> This is the episode where Joey is more willing to protect his sandwich from a bullet/car backfire than his best friend . All I can say is , thank god Joey is n't a policeman . <p> That slo-mo dive and Chandler 's reaction is what makes this episode rank so highly ( skip to 3:18 to see it ) . Since Joey broke Chandler 's heart here ( look at his poor , heartbroken face at 3:28 ) , it only follows that he should rank higher than Joey 's turkey glory. - <h> 6 . The One Where Rachel Smokes <p> " Hmm , soup . I mean , noodle soup . I mean soup ! " ( face palm ) <p> This episode should really be renamed " The One Where Joey Keeps Saying " Noodle Soup " . The story goes that Joey is so nervous for his audition that he keep saying " noodle soup " instead of just " soup " . This one is n't ranked higher because it 's funny for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " JUST SAY SOUP GODDAMMIT ! " . Still , you 've got to pity him a bit more than Chandler at No. 7 - he tries his best but still does n't succeed ( sadly Coldplay was not on hand to " fix him " ) so he gets to be at No.6. <h> 5 . The One Where Joey Speaks French <p> The only food related part in this episode is at the end where Joey tries to drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds to demonstrate that at least one thing was true on his CV ( because speaking French really was n't his forte ) . It 's a small segment of the episode but it 's so funny that it 's got to be up there in the Top 5 . Physical comedy is definitely more of a crowd pleaser than the inability to say " soup " ( sorry Joey ) . <p> Does milk stain ? Let 's hope not , for Joey 's sake . <h> 4 . The One With All The Thanksgivings <p> - The gist is that Joey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) - and got his head stuck in a turkey ( and right before Thanksgiving dinner - how rude ) . It 's such a cheesy and simple gag but it really works <p> Oh , and the fun does n't stop with Joey : <p> ( How many turkeys do they have ? ? ) <p> Like I said before , physical comedy is always a winner but what makes this top even Joey pouring milk on himself is the DANCE . Monica has some serious dance skills- need I remind you of her hilarious doughnut dance ? ( click HERE- to relive that glorious memory ) <p> Just missing out on the top spot is " The One With Ross 's Sandwich " , which is pretty self explanatory . In case you have n't figured out the plot yet , Ross is very protective over his sandwich and gets super angry when someone eats it ( it did have a note on it so I guess , fairs ? ) Best part is , of course , Ross 's rant that gets him fired from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Since this gag is slightly less disgusting than Rachel 's trifle ( I know I 'm being picky but it 's a tough competition at the top ) , it ranks higher. - <p> Who agrees that Ross would 've made an awesome Hulk ? Controversial , but maybe he should 've considered a career in acting rather than dinosaurs . <h> 1 . The One With The Birth Mother <p> This episode ranks at number one because it gave birth to a line , and then a GIF , that we can all still relate to : " JOEY/ insert own name DOES N'T SHARE FOOD ! " . - We 've all felt that rage when someone steals food off your plate when you know perfectly well that they could 've got their own , and so does Joey - in this episode , he goes on a date with a girl who takes food off his plate without asking and understandably , gets a little peeved about it <p> Objectively speaking , Joey goes on multiple rants about food during the episode instead of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but really it 's the appeal to my own heart ( and stomach ) that wins it the top spot .

@@6291158 <p> To help make your shopping trip just a tad bit easier , here 's the unofficial ranking of the best and worst flavors of these new protein bars . - <h> BEST : <h> 1 . Coconut Chocolate <p> Coming in first place is Coconut Chocolate . This bar is absolutely delicious , mainly because it combines two widely appreciated flavors : coconut and chocolate . The base is coconut and contains chunks of chocolate , pairing perfectly for coconuty , chocolately bliss . <h> 2 . Chocolate Sea Salt <p> Two words : absolute genius . It is the perfect mix of sweet and salty , and it 's deliciously rich . It 's hard to believe this thing packs 12 grams of protein and- is sweetened by dates alone . Kudos to RXBAR for creating a healthy protein bar that could pass as a chocolate bar . <h> 3 . Blueberry <p> And , last , but not least , is blueberry . Fruit flavors are definitely hard to pin down , but this bar has a delicious mix of blueberry flavor and nutty crunch . Tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WORST : <h> 3 . Apple Cinnamon- <p> I decided to go in descending order this time to show the progression from bad to worse . Apple Cinnamon comes in third . It is n't horrible , but it also tastes a bit too similar to the Nutrigrain bars we all were forced to eat as a kid ( sorry , Nutrigrain lovers ) . Not my cup of tea . <p> 2 . Pumpkin Spice <p> Okay , I get that everyone has an obsession with pumpkin spice , but this is just ridiculous . In no world does a protein bar need to be Pumpkin Spice flavored " it 's just not a thing . No wonder they 're advertising 20% off ( ' cause no one wants it ) . <p> 1 . Maple Sea Salt <p> And , Maple Sea Salt takes the cake for the- absolute worst RXBAR flavor . I 'm sorry , but this flavor is just horrible . It tastes like those maple air fresheners you put in your car to make it smell good " only it 's doughy and dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hope you guys enjoyed this little RXBAR guide to good and bad .

However , with about 22% of your daily amount of fat and 11% of your daily amount of sodium , it 's not exactly the most nutritious topping out there. - <p> It 's way too easy to justify eating more ranch than you should at mealtime . Take , for example , 500 calories " about 7 tablespoons of ranch , a little less than half a cup . That sounds like a lot , but exactly what does that look like ?

Make a Daily Study Schedule <p> If your work schedule has commitment issues , AKA you 're like Batman that gets calls at all hours to come in and save the day , do n't bother with a weekly schedule .

Outfit/Meal Prep Every Night- <p> Spend 10 minutes every night packing a quick lunch and laying out an outfit before passing out . Try packing yogurt and granola or chopped fruit for breakfast . For a speedy lunch , shred some cooked meat , add white or brown rice , and throw spinach leaves in a container with a tablespoon of butter on top . The butter will melt when you reheat it in the microwave , wilting the spinach and adding flavor to the rice .

Do n't Sleep With Your Phone- <p> I 'm the kind of person that has 15 alarms set within 5 minutes of each other in the morning . It takes me forever to wake up , especially if I get less than five hours of sleep . To make it to your 8AMs and 9AMs , put your phone further than arm 's reach from your bed .

Go to Office Hours- <p> Make an effort to go to office hours at least once every two weeks . If your professor 's office hours do n't fit with your schedule , email them to schedule an appointment . If you tend to miss class because of work , allowing your professors to see your face every once in a while assures them that you 're alive and trying. - <h> 8 .

@@6291328 <h> Why Tacos Should n't Be the Official State Dish Of Texas <h> Nothing against tacos but ... long live chili . @qwx11771 @qwx11783 @qwx11776 <p> I want to start off by stating wholeheartedly that I love tacos . In fact , as a San Antonio- native hailing from the literal birthplace of Tex-Mex , it is essentially preprogrammed in my DNA to love all things tortilla-related . However , while it may sound sacrilegious , after reading about the campaign led by taco journalist and author Mando Rayo and state representative Gina Hinojosa to enact legislation designating tacos as the official state dish of Texas , I felt compelled to set the record straight and explain why this is such a bad idea . <h> The Current Situation : Chili <p> Amanda Shulman <p> We should begin first by assessing the current state dish situation . As you may or may not know , chili currently holds the title as the official state food of Texas . In 1977 the Texas Legislature proclaimed chili the state dish " in recognition of the fact that the only real ' bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While that may be hard to disagree with , the true importance of chili as the Texas state dish is far more complicated and deeply rooted in Texas history and tradition- " this is no trivial matter. - <h> Chili is Authentically Texan <p> While the origin of chili may never be fully resolved and legends of its beginnings include everything from tales of Spanish nuns to stories of a range cook in Marfa , Texas , most historians agree that the earliest written description of chili comes from Houstonian , J.C . Clopper , who described the stew after a visit to San Antonio . <p> Although chili has some traditionally Spanish ingredients , this is the extent of any connection to Mexico . In fact , unlike tacos , which have been an integral part of the Mexican diet since the 18th century , chili , according to the Diccionario de Mejicanismos , is a " detestable food passing itself off as Mexican , sold in the US . " There is little doubt , though , that chili was popularized in great part by the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staple food. - <h> The Truth About Tex-Mex <p> I get the logic behind the idea to make tacos the state dish : Texas is melting pot of Texan and Mexican cultures ( hence the whole Tex-Mex thing ) and what better to represent that than the taco ? Chili , I would respond . Although Tex-Mex is generally defined by copious amounts of shredded cheese , ground beef , and flour tortillas and in the form of enchiladas , chalupas , burritos , and- " - of course- " - tacos , chili really is the OG Tex-Mex . <p> Before the " combo-plate-style " Tex-Mex of an entree served with rice , beans , and sour cream gained popularity in the early 1900 's , it was chili that first introduced introduced Tex-Mex into the mainstream . Although we have established that chili really has nothing to do with Mexican food ( but then again , nor do chimichangas ) , the story of Tex-Mex really begins with the Chili Queens of San Antonio . <p> The Chili Queens were a group of Mexican women who began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes , ultimately giving rise to the Tex-Mex tradition . <p> So , while most Texans profess their great love for tacos in all their many forms , I feel that this is an insufficient argument for establishing tacos as our state dish . In a way , I believe such an argument is analogous to arguing that falafel be the state dish of New York . Although falafel is a popular food in New York City , in no way does falafel represent or evoke the history and tradition of the city . Therefore , I stand by my conviction that chili truly is the most worthy option for the state dish of Texas .

Coffea arabica is harder to grow and has less caffeine but is higher quality . Coffee goes through this long process to get to you . It starts with planting and growing , then harvesting cherries , separating them from the bean , drying the bean , shipping , roasting the beans , grinding them , and finally brewing coffee. - <p> During the process of picking coffee cherries , hand-picked cherries yield better coffee than stripping machines because the machines take the ripe and unripe cherries . If you 've ever wondered why some coffees taste better than others even with the same machine , it 's because of the type of bean in the coffee and the whole process used before you get the coffee grinds . <p> Tea on the other hand is made from the leaves of two plants : Camellia sinesis and Camellia assimica . From these two plants you can get four different types of teas : green , black , oolong , and white tea . Of the whole process , what makes the teas different is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas black and oolong teas are oxidized a lot , which is why they have stronger flavors and darker brewed teas. - <p> Herbal teas are not technically teas because they are n't made from either of those plants , instead they 're made with leaves , fruits , barks , roots and any other plant that might taste good . They are also caffeine free since they do not have the leaves from the tea plants . <p> Rachel Dugard <h> How to Cold Brew <p> Cold brewing is a different way of brewing usually coffee where you let the coffee grinds steep overnight instead of instantly brewing it with hot water . In general coffee has a bitter taste , but some people say that cold brewing coffee makes it taste smoother . One thing is for sure , the coffee is definitely stronger . <p> Tea is not as strong as coffee when brewed normally . Fun fact : tea has more caffeine per weight than coffee , but we use more coffee grinds for coffee than tea leaves for tea . One pound of tea leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we brew tea now , coffee is stronger so cold brewing tea will still be weaker than cold brewing coffee. - <p> Here 's how you cold brew tea : <h> Step 1 : Set up the tea <p> Cold brewing tea is very simple , it just takes a lot of time . The first step is to get your tea and put it in a container with room temperature water . I recommend one teabag ( or ounce of looseleaf ) for every cup of water . You can keep the tea leaves in the little pouch if you do n't have anything to strain it with later , but you get better tea if you cut open the bag and pour the leaves into the container. - Try to use a cup with a lid or a jar because the tea will take on the flavors of any smells in the air . <p> I chose three teas to cold brew . Green tea , chai tea ( which is black tea ) and peppermint tea ( which is an herbal tea ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see what they were like on their own , but if you usually like your tea to have flavors I would suggest adding it at this step rather than after the tea is done . <p> Rachel Dugard <h> Step 2 : Refrigerate- <p> This is the step where the internet can not agree and experimentation win . Each recipe online has its own allotted time to let sit and they range from 6 hours to 48 hours , which is why I tried cold brewing tea for 12 hours and then for 48 hours. - <p> I found that 12 hours is not enough . The tea tasted exactly the same and was n't much stronger . For me it was n't worth the time it took to make . I would recommend letting the tea sit in the fridge from 24-48 . The longer you let it sit , the stronger flavor and more caffeine you will get. - <p> Rachel Dugard <h> Step 3 : Strain the Tea <p> Once you 've let the tea sit , strain it with a coffee filter or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine and brewed the other two in french presses so I simply pressed down on the handle and poured it out. - <p> Rachel Dugard <h> The Results <p> Like I said before , the 12 hour tea was n't as good as I had hoped . The flavor and strength were n't enough for me ... but the 48 hour tea was a completely different experience . This tea was probably stronger than my daily cup of coffee . You know when you drink really strong coffee and a few minutes later you feel the pressure in your head and the coffee taking effect ? That 's how it felt. - <p> I also taste tested a cup of hot brewed tea ( that I made a few minutes before and then chilled ) to the cold brew tea . The cold brew tea definitely had bolder flavors . On the downside , the natural bitterness of the tea was stronger and I could n't sweeten it with sugar because it was cold . If that happens to you , use simple syrup . You can buy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make it yourself . <p> Rachel Dugard <p> The chai tea was probably my favorite to cold brew because it tasted very strong and I realized after the fact that the peppermint tea was caffeine free so I really just got a stronger flavor ( silly me ) . - <p> So yes , you can brew tea just like coffee . It tastes great and packs a punch . Just remember to plan ahead and give the tea enough time to sit and absorb the flavor. -

It occurs when you go overboard in how much you consume .

It 'll help take the edge off by speeding up your body 's ability to burn the extra energy . <p> The most efficient way to get rid of jitters " stop consuming excessive amounts of caffeine ( easier said than done ) .

The Italian-inspired meals I ate typically consisted of spaghetti noodles drenched in store-bought marinara sauce that was loaded with added sugars and preservatives . The Italian restaurants in my area were n't exactly authentic , so I never fully understood the hype behind pasta . I mean , yes , pasta is delicious , but why are there so many types ? And why ca n't I just cover my spaghetti noodles in Alfredo sauce and call it a day ? <p> Well , I could just manhandle spaghetti noodles and stick to just one type of pasta .

Orecchiette 's shell-like shape allows sauce to settle inside it , meaning each bite is going to be mega flavorful and delicious . This particular pasta shape is also good for pasta bakes and pairs well with chunky sauces . <h> Linguine <p> Photo by Abigail Wang <p> Because linguine is a bit thicker than spaghetti , it 's able to better cling onto lighter sauces , especially ones made with cream. - Give it a go in your favorite one-pot pasta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mush while cooking with other ingredients . <h> Farfalle <p> Photo courtesy of John Herschell on Flickr <p> Other than being super cute , the bow tie shape of farfalle helps keep the pasta intact when tossed in pasta salads .

Like farfalle , fusilli gets two thumbs up from me because it 's just cute to look at . <h> Manicotti <p> Photo courtesy of alanagkelly on Flickr <p> Next to spaghetti , manicotti is my personal go-to pasta .

The most excessively joked about , widely hated , and completely misunderstood Christmas classic in existence . To few , the smell of month-old , bourbon-soaked fruit cake is the smell of the holidays . But to most , that same smell represents a tradition that needs to come to an end . <p> In order to get to the bottom of this society-splitting dispute , I decided to turn to my grandma ( Nana ) , the ultimate fan of fruit cake . I always make Nana a fruitcake for Christmas , which might be why I get the best presents . I had no respect for this cake until I found out my grandma ( who knows her stuff ) loves it . I trusted her taste , made one myself , and have since become one of the few fruitcake fans of the world. - <h> " Fruit cake is ... can I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake is the most flavor-packed , festive , and indulgent treat there is .

And they do not always have disturbingly bright green pieces of " fruit " in them . <h> " The traditional fruit cake is made weeks in advance , and fed a little bourbon each day .

Nana suggests candied pineapple and cherries ( the citron can be " chewy and confusing " ) , along with raisins and currants . Add lots of spices , plenty of bourbon , and do n't forget the nuts . <p> James E. Petts on Flickr <p> The final product will be rewarding , authentic , and well worth your time and effort . Do n't let anyone at your holiday party tell you they do n't like fruit cake until they have tried YOUR fruit cake . It 's time to give this Christmas tradition the credit it deserves .

Everyone knows that salmon is full of healthy fats , but much of those are actually stored in the skin .

It 's all a matter of preference . <p> A lot of people spurn salmon skin simply because they dislike the taste , but , unfortunately , there is also a non-subjective reason to avoid it .

You 've got your- outfit picked out , your novelty GoT mugs- polished to perfection , and your group of friends assembled to gather at your house before 9PM ET . Now , it 's time to address the most important question : what are you going to munch on ? @qwx11778 <p> Pizza , - schmizza . This year , you mean business . An HBO series of this epic proportion deserves more than just Domino 's or Orville Redenbacher . Here are the foods you should eat based on what house you 've been rooting for these past five seasons . <h> House Stark @qwx11778 <p> If you 're a House Stark ally , you 've probably been a diehard fan since season one . As if Ned 's execution was n't devastating enough , you 've had to watch Catelyn Stark , Robb Stark , and **29;792;TOOLONG Stark get thrown to the direwolves . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can be easy to forget that- Arya , Sansa , Bran , and Rickon are still all floating around with their own storylines . <p> Since you 're pretty much perpetually in mourning , you might want to encourage your friends to bring classic funeral foods for a potluck , like Jell-o or hard-boiled eggs or some type of sad casserole . If you 're feeling uncharacteristically optimistic , you can go sweet and simple with this- recipe for lemon bars , a nod to Sansa 's favorite dessert , lemon cake . <p> Or you can get a little more complicated and try these direwolf scones , a replica of the bread Hot Pie gives to Arya before splitting up . Those leftover tears from Jon Snow being stabbed should keep you plenty hydrated . <h> House Lannister @qwx11778 <p> Oh , how the mighty have fallen . So , you might not be over that hand being chopped off . Or that gnarly poisoning scene . Or that crossbow to the heart . Or that nude walk of shame . But somehow , you find yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Based on the Lannister 's track record ( and various spoilers ) , it looks like something nasty is going to happen to another character before the end of the episode .

Bonus : this opens up possibilities for Game of Thrones drinking games . When you start to feel woozy and all that incest is n't looking half bad , it could be time to switch to solid food . Try these red wine chocolate cupcakes- instead and you wo n't have to compromise your inner alcoholic . <h> House Bolton @qwx11778 <p> Every time I see Ramsay on screen , I feel a little queasy .

Loosen up , keep the wine flowing , and who knows what could happen . <h> House Martell @qwx11778 <p> Unbowed , unbent , unbroken . That is , of course , before Prince Oberyn 's gruesome death and a botched rescue attempt by Jaime . Since House Martell did n't make a physical appearance until season four , you must be a new ally . <p> Dorne is located in a desert climate located thousands of miles away from King 's Landing and is known for its hot and spicy dishes and sour red wine . Its exotic location opens up possibilities for spicier foods . Instead of the classic chips and salsa route , - why not go spicier with kebabs or a paella ? - Do n't forget that little vial of poison to wet your lips with before you kiss your friends goodbye . <h> House Greyjoy @qwx11778 <p> Hard to believe that Reek was once Theon Greyjoy , heir to the Iron Islands and brief ruler of Winterfell . But in season six , it 's time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , literally and figuratively .

You can also go fancier with some- candy sushi . <h> Night 's Watch @qwx11778 <p> Remember season one , when Jon Snow was just a wee boy with a cute albino puppy ? Gosh .

It would also be appropriate to serve roast chicken , pigeon pie , or some type of heavy stew . You want foods that will sit in your stomach and keep you warm for the long , scary winter ahead . Or at least something that will sustain you while you 're waiting for the next episode . <h> Whitewalkers <p> Who has time to eat when you 're gathering an army of the undead to take over Westeros ?

@@6291552 <h> This is How Many Nuts You Should Really Be Eating Per Day <h> Spoiler alert : you 're eating too many . @qwx11771 @qwx11783 @qwx11776 <p> Some people are under the impression that nuts are healthy and that 's that . Unfortunately , nothing is healthy when you have too much and for nuts , too much comes way sooner than you 'd think . If you 've ever thought that it 's fine to- fill up on almonds instead of having a full meal , you were probably hurting your body more than you were helping it . It 's recommended to eat about one ounce of nuts per day , so here 's what that looks like in terms of each nut . <h> 1 . Almonds <p> Photo by Torey Walsh <p> Although almonds are very healthy , they 're also high in fat and calories . If you 're munching on almonds at every meal you might want to reconsider because each ounce has- 163 calories and 14 g of fat , according to Livestrong . The recommended serving of almonds according to a one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense if you consider that three ounces of almonds would add almost 500 calories to your daily intake . This is n't just the case for whole nuts , it remains true for almond flour and almond butter as well . <h> 3 . Cashews <p> Photo by Kristine Mahan <p> Cashews are deliciously creamy which makes them great sauce substitutes but also makes them very addictive . Weight-management expert- Dr. Gargi Sharma says that we should really only be eating 4-5 cashews a day . Super disappointing . It 's recommended not to go over that amount for various reasons but one of the more unique- reasons is that some people might be sensitive to the amino acids- tyramine and phenylethylamine in the nut and it can cause headaches. <h> 3 . Walnuts <p> Photo by Sara Kresloff <p> Walnuts have a million health benefits- so if you 're not already incorporating them into your diet you should definitely start . They 've proven to be beneficial in treating type 2 diabetes and reducing the risk of cancer . Of course , you do n't want to overdo it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnuts per day . The side effects of eating too many walnuts can be bloating or loosened stool , both of which do n't sound very pleasant so it 's best to limit yourself . <h> 4 . Pistachios <p> Photo by Christin Urso <p> For pistachios , it 's recommended that you eat 1-2 handfuls a day because they 're pretty high in calories . Three ounces will cost you about 400 calories which is a shame because pistachios are so easy to crack open and enjoy that it 's easy to lose count . Always be careful about how the pistachios are served , or any nut for that matter . Pistachios by themselves do not contain very much sodium but if you 're eating a couple handfuls of salted nuts , your sodium intake will shoot way up . <h> 5 . Pecans <p> Photo By Emily Stamp <p> Pecans help fight heart disease and cancer as well as boost your immune system . Following the one ounce of nuts per day rule , you should be eating about 15 pecan halves . Pecans are great for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packed full of protein and cholesterol-free , these nuts are a good idea for non-vegetarians too . <h> 6 . Brazil nuts <p> Photo by Courtney Lailey <p> Brazil nuts are probably the easiest to overeat , not because they 're that good , but because you should not be having more than two per day . That 's right just two , and some people even recommend just eating one . Brazil nuts are very high in selenium , and too much selenium can cause brittle hair and nails . The good news is that they 're also full of potassium which can lead to a better night 's sleep . These definitely are n't a snacking nut , but it 's beneficial to have one a day to help you snooze. <h> 7 .

@@6291554 <h> Is Raw Cookie Dough Really That Bad for You ? <h> Sometimes you just need a bite . @qwx11771 @qwx11783 @qwx11776 <p> If there was a real-life forbidden fruit , cookie dough would be it . We have been told time and time again to not eat it , yet we still find ourselves sneaking a bite here and there while making cookies , or even buying a tub of Nestle Toll House- dough at the store and eating it by yourself ( guilty ) . <p> For years , our mothers have told us that raw cookie dough could make you sick , but it 's pretty rare these days to hear about someone getting sick or even dying from raw cookie dough . So we set out to discover if cookie dough is- really- that bad for you . <p> Photo by Malia Budd <p> The most commonly cited reason to not eat raw cookie dough is the risk of salmonella from raw eggs . However , according to- Dr. Adrienne Kassis , a primary care provider at One Medical group , - only about 1 in- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year. - Furthermore , if an egg is pasteurized , as they are in Nestle Toll House dough , the chance of getting salmonella decreases even more . <p> Depending on- who you talk to , some health care professionals even say that eating raw eggs is actually good for your health , as cooking causes a minor loss in nutrients . They mention the risk of contracting salmonella , but explain that the chances are low and the benefits outweigh the risks . <p> Photo by Malia Budd <p> But what happens when cookie dough actually is detrimental to your health ? - In 2009 , a woman by the name of Linda Rivera died from E. Coli , a bacteria similar to salmonella . E. Coli can occur in a variety of foods , including the Nestle Toll House cookie dough that Rivera ate .

Although there are no specific numbers , researchers believe that the number of cases involving raw eggs does n't even reach the thousands . <p> Photo by Rayna Mohrmann <p> If you want to be cautious about how you eat your cookie dough , it is recommended that you keep your eggs at 45-F- or below at all times . Below 45- , salmonella bacteria ca n't grow . Also , make your own cookie dough . <p> Even though we all know that homemade cookies taste- better , it 's better because you know where your ingredients are coming from . When something like an e . Coli breakout happens in Nestle Toll House dough , nobody can be sure where the bacteria originated . Yes , it can come from the eggs , but it can also come from something as seemingly harmless as flour . <p> When we set out on our quest to discover the answer to the question of whether or not cookie dough is really that bad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it depends on who you talk to and what their opinions are . It also depends on how badly you 're willing to risk getting sick . Fortunately , your chances of getting sick are pretty slim .

Most recipes call for just an inch or two of fresh ginger , because even small amounts of this zesty root go a long way towards brightening soups , salads , meat marinades and even beverages ( try adding a few peels of fresh ginger to homemade chai ) . Once you 've gotten to know and love your new knotty friend , you 'll be sure to want to check out these techniques for how to peel and grate fresh ginger . <p> Total Time : 5 minutes <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 .

@@6291641 <h> The Secret to Avoiding Flat , Deflated Cupcakes <h> Go from disappointing cupcake deflation to that pretty cupcake perfection . @qwx11771 @qwx11783 @qwx11776 <p> If you 've ever baked cupcakes , then you know exactly where this is headed . You follow the recipe , you fill the cupcake liners , you pop them in the oven . They look beautifully rounded in the oven , but alas , you wait patiently . Finally , the timer goes off , you pull them out , and the flat cupcakes make themselves known . <p> Biggest . Letdown . Ever . <p> Now , for the question that 's on all of our minds : how can I avoid the flatness and achieve the roundedness ? Here are some things you may be overlooking . <h> 1 . Check how old your baking soda or baking powder is . <p> Baking soda and powder are the essential ingredients that get the chemical reactions rolling in most baked goods . They play an especially important role in cupcakes " they 're the team players that get the cupcakes to rise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your baking soda or powder is too old it wo n't react with the other ingredients properly . This means your cupcakes will not rise to their- full potential . You can check the age of your baking soda- by mixing it with vinegar and hot water . If it bubbles , you 're good to go . If not , throw it out . You can test your baking powder- similarly by mixing it with hot water and seeing if it bubbles . <p> Photo by Meredith Simmons <h> 2 . Measure out your baking soda or baking powder- precisely . <p> This may seem like a given , but hear me out . Do n't ever , - ever eyeball baking soda/powder . The recipe has an exact amount specified for a reason . Too much will cause the batter to overflow out of the muffin pan then deflate , while too little will make your cupcakes flat and sad since they- could n't rise enough . Take the extra measure to pull out your teaspoon and measure that sucker . <h> - 3 . Do not over-mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to your batter . When you put cupcakes in the hot oven with too much air in the batter , the hot air will only make it seem as if your cupcakes are rising as- the air escapes , causing the dreaded deflation . With practice , learn how to mix cupcake batter just until the ingredients are combined and no more than that . I like to use a silicone spatula and fold the ingredients together rather than use a mixer , - which can- beat the ingredients to death . <h> 4 . Filling the pan- definitely matters . <p> Fill your cupcake liners 3/4 of the way full . If you fill them more than that , they 'll have no room left to expand , and they will collapse . If you fill them less than that , there will be so- much space for them to expand that they wo n't be able to reach . 3/4 is key . <p> Photo by Meredith Simmons <h> 5 . Oven temperature is crucial . <p> This part is a little tricky , but ensures a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regardless of what the recipe says ( I know earlier I was stressing to follow the recipe precisely , but wait . ) Once the edges seemed to have baked , reduce the temperature back to the one recommended in the recipe . This way the center of the cupcake can rise apart from the edges , - giving you that desired shape . <h> 6 . The oven door is there for a reason . <p> Do not open the oven door while the cupcakes are baking . Opening the oven door let 's some of the heat out , which ultimately let 's air escape from the cupcakes , leading to deflation . Seriously , resist the urge . I know it 's hard . We 'll get through this together . <p> Hopefully your cupcakes come out looking a little like this : <p> Photo by Meredith Simmons <p> Beautiful . Brings a tear to my eye .
