@@84165872 @5665872/ <h> LMS Version 8.10.1 <p> Hello and welcome to the TraCorp LMS Developer update ! You 've probably noticed that we update your LMS several times a year , but what you might not notice is what 's included in those updates . Each update includes modifications , optimizations , and bug fixes . It 's easy to miss these implementations if you did n't request the modification or report the bug that needed fixing . With this issue , we will share several new LMS features and bugs we are happy to report as fixed . <h> Case #1166 " Content Icons <p> To make the content page on the student interface a little more informative , we added a few symbols to the content items . <h> Case #1228 " Auto-Assignment Rules <p> Originally , the LMS allowed users to save auto-assignment rules , even if there was an error in the syntax . As a companion to the Check Syntax button , users are no longer allowed to save user groups if the auto-assignment rule will cause a database error that prevents auto-assignments from running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statistics <p> One of your fellow community members loves statistics so much , they decided they wanted a snapshot of statistics available for each piece of content and learning track . See below for the information displayed under the new Statistics tab : <h> Case #1133 " Learning Track Change Log <p> Sometimes , when your system is maintained and operated by several people , it is harder to keep track of who changes what . For this reason , we created the Learning Track Change Log . The name is self-explanatory , but check it out for yourself . <h> Case #1030 " Instructor Session Report <p> Options ! Everyone loves options . Now users who generate reports can split the date and time into separate columns , and create a report that includes all instructors ! <p> We 've made it easier to control the settings for your administrators . In respect of the idea of giving more control to UGAs while still having control , there are now four options for settings . Always On , Always Off , On by default , and Off by default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAST ! ! ! THE CONTENT PREVIEW BUTTON ! Okay , maybe it has been around a little longer than since this last update , but it is still a cool feature I would like EVERYONE to know about because it makes life better . Have you ever uploaded a piece of content and wanted to see what it looked like without assigning it and logging in as a student ? NOW YOU CAN ! See how below : <p> In closing , we want to take a few moments to talk to you about our LMS team . As you may or may not know , JT Gunter accepted a position at one of our largest customers . It 's very rare that an employee leaves our organization and remains so actively involved . Lucky for us , we still see JT a few times a month as a contributor and a community member who is now driving future development .
