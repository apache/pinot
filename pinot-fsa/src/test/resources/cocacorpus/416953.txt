After the application is submitted , appraisals , credit reports and other inspections are performed so that the underwriting group can make a decision on the application ( approve/deny/counter ) . If the mortgage application is approved by underwriting and closed , mortgage loan servicing and account managers work with borrowers to process mortgage payments , change account information and answer any questions related to their mortgage .

The steps between include application processing , underwriting ( approval or denial of loan application ) , closing , and post-closing . The main purpose of this step is to evaluate the prospective borrower 's credit-worthiness ( i.e. , risk level ) to determine if the bank should lend to them , and if so , what the terms of the loan should be .

During the application process , a borrower submits a variety of financial information ( tax returns , prior paychecks , credit card info , etc. ) to the mortgage lender , who uses it to determine the type of loan the borrower is eligible for and what interest rate will be paid . Though applications for loans may be made through several different channels , in general , loan applications may be split into 4 types : agent ( branch-based ) , agent-assisted ( over the phone ) , broker sale ( third-party sales agent or loan officer ) and self-service ( through online/mobile applications ) . <h> Mortgage Loan Operations / Closing <p> The Mortgage Closing function is responsible for the last step in buying and financing a home .

They also assess the quality of loans based on the value of the home and the lender 's ability to sell the loan to a third party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Post-Closing function prepares and records all mortgage loan documentation in order to release the original Deed and Deed of Trust into the new home owner 's hands . Post-Closing employees also ensure that all documents gathered during the origination process are complete and in good order ( to prepare to pass the loan off to the Loan Servicing function and/or to sell the loan third-party ) . The Post-Closing process can take up to six months as they not only correct any recording issues that come up , but they also obtain and pay the final water bill , maintain and disburse repair escrows , issue title policies , return signed orginal documents to the lender and resolve any questions or issues that were left unanswered during the origination process . <h> Mortgage Loan Operations / Underwriting <p> The Underwriting function is responsible for assessing mortgage loan applicants and making decisions on whether to accept or reject mortgage loan applications .

Before modifying an existing loan , the lender must assess the borrower 's current credit situation to determine if they are eligible to receive a modification . <p> The Secondary , or Wholesale , Mortgage Sales function pools loans from the primary mortgage market and sells them to investors ( pension funds , hedge funds , investment banks , or insurance companies ) as collateralized mortgage obligations or mortgage-backed securities .

Improving operations is more important for these groups now than ever before . <h> The History of Broadcast Media <p> Broadcast media originated with the development of the radio in the twentieth century . Prior to the radio , news and other information was transmitted across telegraphs and , later , telephones , but both technologies transferred information from one party to another .

@@104939395 @339395/ <h> Utilities <p> Utilities provide basic public infrastructure-related services , such as electricity , water , natural gas , waste disposal and sewage treatment , for individual consumers and businesses in both urban and rural areas . These companies can be privately owned ( investor-owned ) , publicly owned or cooperatively owned ( owned by the customers that they service ) . <p> Energy retailing involves the marketing and sales of utilities services to commercial and retail customers . In some cases , retailers purchase commodities in bulk from energy traders ( spot markets ) . In other cases , utilities companies are integrated ( much like many large Oil &amp; Gas companies ) , and handle all of the steps in the utilities value stream , from production/generation , to transmission , up to the marketing/sales of energy products . Retail ( residential ) customers usually pay for energy at a fixed rate , while commercial and industrial customers may have more complex pricing schemes . <p> The Energy Transmission and Delivery function transmits energy in bulk from power plants or refineries to electrical substations and local distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then transmit that energy to substations located in high demand areas for distribution to surrounding homes and businesses .

Electric utilities include investor owned , publicly owned , cooperatives and nationalized entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Due to the increasing worldwide demand for energy , electric utilities are facing numerous issues including aging infrastructure , reliabiltiy and regulation . Electric utility companies extensively use transmission system networks ( electric power lines ) to deliver energy to customers through the use of distribution substations ( systems that lower the transmission voltage to a medium voltage ) and distribution transformers ( systems that lowers the medium voltage to a utilization voltage for household use ) . <h> Lines of Business / Natural Gas <p> The natural gas industry engages in the exploration , extraction , processing , storage and distribution of natural gas for sale in a regulated market . Natural gas production companies range from large integrated producers with worldwide operations and interests in all segments of the oil and gas industry to small one or two person operations that may only have use of a single well .

There are eight major groups of waste management methods including , source reduction and reuse , animal feeding , recycling , composting , fermentation , landfills , incinceration and land application . Unlike most other types of waste , hazardous waste ( biomedical materials , radioactive material , etc. ) requires special handling ( e.g. , placing vats of waste in a secure site deep underground ) and is usually frought with controversy .

Though both management methods involve mater treatment plants and strategies , water management systems use water softeners , rainwater harvesting and other methods to collect and cleanse water of extraneous elements ( metals , toxic elements , etc. ) before distributing it for human usage and consumption . Sewage treatment , on the other hand , involves various processes ( physical , chemical and biological ) of removing contaminants from wastewater , whether from household or industrial sewage , to produce environmentally safe treated wastewater suitable for disposal ( usually into a river or the ocean ) or land application . Both water and wastewater management systems exclusively use pipes or the sewage system to transport water to the areas that need it . <p> The Energy Generation function explores , extracts and transforms sources of energy into electrical and/or natural gas-based power .

@@104939470 @339470/ <h> What is a Broker Dealer ? <p> Broker/Dealers act as intermediaries between markets ( stock exchanges ) and consumers ( individuals and institutions ) . These brokerages provide an entry point for clients looking to perform trading activities and act as certified , regulated dealers within various stock exchanges ( such as the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ ) . They keep track of customer account information and maintain secure servers and trading systems that allow trades to be executed remotely ( via the internet ) in an automated manner . These systems interface directly with various stock exchanges to match buy orders with sell orders and provide real-time pricing data for clients on various financial products , such as stocks , bonds ( fixed income ) , currencies , and commodities . <h> The History of Broker Dealer <p> The trading of financial instruments began almost 900 years ago .

The aptly named Buttonwood Agreement stated that the 24 brokers involved would only do business with each other and would use a set commission rate of 0.25% . To this day , the NYSE is the world 's largest stock exchange , with a daily trading value of almost $50 billion . <p> The world 's second largest stock exchange , the NASDAQ , was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers ( NASD ) and was the world 's first electronic stock market . <h> Modern Trends in Broker Dealer <p> The number of purely advisory firms has been increasing , while the number of certified Broker-Dealers has declined to just more than 5,000 in the United States .

These firms allowed clients to use the Internet to make trades based on their own decisions . <p> Broker-dealers are highly regulated . The Dodd-Frank Act of July 2010 might be the most sweeping change to financial regulation since the Great Depression of the 1930s . Many investment advisors , hedge funds and private equity firms that had been exempt from regulation are now tightly governed by it . Among other provisions the law authorizes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to draw up point of sale disclosure rules on costs , risks and a broker-dealer 's fiduciary duty to each customer on whose behalf they trade .

Further regulation of business practices , including the Sarbanes-Oxley ( 2002 ) and Dodd-Frank ( 2010 ) Acts , has tightened standards and enhanced the position and importance of corporate compliance . One major challenge that compliance groups face is data collection and retention .

@@104939530 @339530/ <h> What is Mortgage Lending ? <p> The purchase of real estate , except in a few circumstances , has always been a significant expense . Most buyers , especially today , lack sufficient funds on hand for the outright purchase of real estate , so they rely on mortgage bankers to advance them the money for the purchase , in the form of a loan guaranteed by the property itself . Failure to repay the loan allows the lender to recover the property from the debtor . <h> The History of Mortgage Lending <p> The word " mortgage " derives from a combination of Latin words and means a " dead pledge , " so called because the pledge was the debtor 's agreement to forfeit his land if he could not repay the money , that pledge becoming " dead " when he repaid . Modern mortgages in the US and UK originate with the English Common Law 's formation of property rights after 1176 . By the early thirteenth century , property rights had become increasingly secure in England such that real estate , always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loan and therefore became more liquid . Initially the land was already the borrower 's property - the borrower effectively used it as collateral for a cash loan . By the twentieth century , however , land came to be both the intended use of the loan , the purchase , as well as the security for it . Mortgages had become relatively common in the early twentieth century , although borrowers were still expected to have a down-payment of as much as 50% and maturities of mortgages remained relatively short - many mortgages were arranged for only five years , while some borrowers renegotiated the terms of their mortgages every other year . <p> The Great Depression substantially changed mortgages in the US . Because of the widespread economic turmoil , borrowers found it increasingly difficult to make payments , and lenders experienced significant shortages of capital available to make loans . In an effort to respond to the crisis , the US Federal Government created the Home Owners Loan Corporation in 1933 - later replaced by the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to standardize mortgages in the US and to protect both borrowers and lenders . Modern mortgages became widespread in the decades after World War II , and in 1970 the US government created the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) to expand home ownership even farther . Additionally , in 1977 , the Federal Government passed the Community Reinvestment Act to reduce discriminatory lending and encourage broader home ownership . The law did increase home ownership after the 1970s , but contributed to the issuance of less-secure mortgages . <h> Modern Trends in Mortgage Lending <p> The financial collapse of 2008 substantially injured the housing market and the mortgage industry in the United States . Sub-prime mortgages have received the lion 's share of the blame for having begun the economic turmoil . Mortgage banking , as with nearly all sectors of the financial industry , have come under close scrutiny in the past several years , and were part of the focus of the Dodd-Frank regulation of 2010.

@@104939578 @339578/ <h> How to Measure HR Department Performance <p> This is certainly true in the world of business . Sure , your company could be bringing in a large amount of revenue , but profits could be low . Your employees may be handling a large volume of work , but customer service levels could be suffering . Maybe you are adding several new customers each month , but losing just as many on the other side . Accurately judging performance can be tricky . <p> Most business intelligence issues stem from a lack of documentation and planning on the front-end . What metrics , or- Key Performance Indicators ( KPIs ) , are you going to measure ? What are the target levels , or benchmarks , for each metric ? Who is accountable for high/low performance in each area ? These questions are further complicated when analyzing the operations of a non-revenue generating function , or cost center , such as Human Resources ( HR ) . The HR Department plays a vital role in setting the company up for success , but does not contribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in HR ? <p> Looking at these five layers ' of performance can provide a holistic , top-down view of HR operations : <h> Department Headcount <p> What are you measuring ? How many people are working in HR relative to the number of customers ( in this case , the customers ' are the company 's employees ) that they serve ? How many customers is each HR employee responsible for ? <p> Typically , you want your HR Headcount Ratio to be as high as possible , which would indicate that staffing levels within the HR function are under control , and that each staff member is serving a large number of customers . Of course , you need to assess the quality of service being provided as well , but we will get to that later . A low , or lagging , value indicates the opposite : overstaffing , poor staff productivity , and non-standard , inefficient processes . Look to examine individual employee productivity and streamline ( or automate ) repetitive processes such as employee on-boarding and record management . <h> Employee Productivity <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee producing ? Who are the high and low performers ? What are high performers doing differently ? <p> What is the KPI ? <p> Requisitions Filled per HR Recruiting Employee The total number of open positions ( i.e. , requisitions ) within the company that were filled over a certain period of time divided by the total number of HR Recruiting and Hiring employees . <p> A high , or leading , value for this metric indicates that individual recruiting employees are on-boarding a sufficient number of new hires . Set a target to see which employees fall below a certain level and look to coach those staff members on how to improve their productivity . Look to high performers to establish best practices that can be rolled out to the entire staff . Of course , you also need to take into account the number of positions that are open and the quality of new hires being brought in before making a final judgment on employee productivity . <p> A high Turnover Rate can be indicative of several things : below average compensation levels ( compared to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , sub-par employee benefits and/or less than ideal working conditions . In order to move towards industry leaders for this KPI , benchmark compensation levels against peer companies and work on creating an interview process that will weed out candidates who are not a good fit for the company and the position being filled . <p> Health insurance costs should be minimized , while still providing employees with a plan that is on par with peers and competitors . In addition to examining cost per covered employee , compare company benefits against those offered by peers and competitors to get a feel for what the quality of benefits provided should be , and how much the company should cover . <p> Costs related to filling an open position ( i.e. , bringing in a new employee ) include posting the job description on relevant sites ( Monster , LinkedIn , or similar ) , travel expenses ( e.g. , flying a recruit in to interview ) , and time taken to interview and orient the potential new hire . Examine the performance of individual recruiting channels to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to low-performing channels . Also , look to promote from within to mitigate recruiting and hiring costs . <p> Proper planning is half of the battle for any process improvement project : establishing your metrics , determining how to gather the required data , then setting up reasonable goals will get you started on the right foot . Framing your analysis in this fashion can give you the ammo required to start improving HR operations . By examining all five of these factors concurrently , you can uncover hidden improvements that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of not just HR , but any department or line of business .

@@104939594 @339594/ <h> 5 Common Accounts Payable KPIs to Track <h> 5 Accounts Payable KPIs <p> Though the responsibilities of the Accounts Payable Department varies with the size of a company , in general , the Accounts Payable Department manages and pays the bills of a company . From processing incoming invoices , which could include paying the electricity bill to providing travel management and ensuring that all of the company 's suppliers are paid in full and on time , the Accounts Payable Department does it all . Paying vendors in this way may even lead to lenient credit terms on the part of vendors , thus saving the company money . <p> So how can your company make sure your Accounts Payable Department is working at tip top shape ? By measuring key performance indicators , of course ! Let 's take a look at a few commonly used Accounts Payable metrics . <p> 1 ) Accounts Payable Transactions per Employee <p> The Accounts Payable Transactions per Employee metric measures the total number of transactions performed by the Accounts Payable function over a certain period of time divided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value for this metric can indicate various inefficiencies whether they involve poor invoice quality , non-user friendly Accounts Payable software interfaces , a high volume of invoices requiring manual entry , overstaffing within the Accounts Payable Department and so on . To increase this value , look to streamline the processes the Accounts Payable Department interacts with and find methods to deal with low quality invoices . <p> This metric measures the number of business days required to process an invoice from a company supplier , or vendor , from when the invoice is received by the Accounts Payable Department until it is approved and paid out to the supplier . A low value for Cycle Time : Vendor Payment Processing is definitely a good sign . That said , there 's no need to demand that your employees work faster in order to accomplish an ideal value . At least not yet . Look to streamline the process by which the payment is made . For instance , dedicate more of the payment processes to automated functions while also making sure all necessary documentation is near at hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face it , duplication happens . People forget they 've already finished a task , individual employees are not aware of what their coworkers are doing and so forth . Needless to say , things will be done more than once . As such , use the Percentage of Duplicate Payments metric to measure the number of invoices that are paid more than once over a certain period of time divided by the number of invoices paid over the same period of time , as a percentage . A low value for this metric is obviously desired so look to make the Accounts Payable payment process as transparent as possible . A methodology to track employee tasks can also be useful . <p> The Payment Error Rate measures the percentage of outgoing payments processed by the Accounts Payable Department that were not completed due to processing error divided by the total number of transactions initiated over a certain period of time , as a percentage . Though everyone makes mistakes , a low value for this metric should be pushed for . A possible method to decrease this value is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 ) Accounts Payable Expense as a Percentage of Total Revenue <p> A bit different than the previous metrics , this metric measures the total expense incurred by the Accounts Payable function over a given time period divided by the total revenue generated by the company over the same period of time , as a percentage . The Accounts Payable Expense as a Percentage of Total Revenue metric can be used to both measure just how much money is being used from the company 's total revenue to fund the Accounts Payable Department as well as measure the staffing of the department itself . A general low value should be desired , but the exact amount should be objective since the number of Accounts Payable employees is dependent on your needs . <p> Remember , a structurally sound Accounts Payable Department will keep your company 's lights on and doors open . Moreover , with a healthy Accounts Payable Department , CFOs , Executives and Managers will be able to focus their attention on revenue generating matters. - Are you looking for a full list of Finance KPIs ?
