We spoke with Jason to get a director 's perspective on what goes into the Studio Conservatory productions . <h> What is the AMDA Drama Showcase ? <p> The AMDA Drama Showcase is a collection of scenes from a variety of plays , usually tied together by a theme that runs through all of the scenes . Typically the theme emerges after casting is complete . A unique feature of the drama showcase is the four week acting class each director conducts with their group before the official showcase process . This allows us to get to know the students as actors before we cast . <h> Do students audition ? <p> The first week ( or so ) of showcase is devoted to casting . This is the most important part of the process . We want to find something that fits the students very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after graduating . But we also want to find something interesting for them to work on , that challenges them and their growth as an actor . <h> How are the scenes chosen ? <p> Every showcase director uses a different system for casting . I let the groups bring in material of their choosing for the first few nights of casting . This allows me to see the type of material they feel strongly about , and what suits them . After this phase , I will combine some of the scenes they brought , with ones I hand out as we go into more of a callback ' phase . After a few nights of this , we are close to being cast . Then Mark Riherd ( NY Education Director ) and I will watch the casting together to discuss , and be sure each student is showcased appropriately . As I said before , casting is by far the most important part of the process . It has been said that casting is at least 90% of the Director 's job , and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little background of what your role is and what goes into the production ? <p> My job involves overseeing everything that goes into the showcase . Casting , the concept for the showcase , the staging and transitions , and all of the design elements ( **25;0;TOOLONG ) . And , of course , the rehearsal process where we dig deep into the scenes to prepare them for performance . Throughout the process I work with a team that includes a professional stage manager , as well as two faculty members who serve as my assistant director , and voice and speech coach . I typically work with faculty members Michael Perilstein and Chris Neher , I believe we 've done almost forty showcases together to date . <h> What is this year 's title/theme ? <p> The first showcase I directed this semester used Adam Bock 's Swimming in the Shallows as a spine for the showcase . We used four scenes from the play as a through line , then sandwiched scenes from other plays in between . The second showcase ( that went up this past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we used to stage all the scenes . Both themes allowed us to showcase the students with diverse material that suits them , while also creating an evening that feels whole ' . <h> How long do you rehearse ? <p> The showcase rehearses for five weeks . The first week is devoted to casting , the second week to conception and staging . Then we have two very focused weeks of rehearsing before we get into tech . The last week is devoted to adding the design elements , and getting used to running the show . Then we preview on Wednesday and run through the weekend . <p> The Drama showcase ( as well as the Musical Showcase ) is a great opportunity for students to not only showcase ' themselves on stage in NYC , but also as the culmination of their training at AMDA . It 's a practical application of everything they 've learned as they transition from the classroom to the professional world .

It was the first time I have worked this way so there was definitely a learning curve , but once we got a good flow going it became much easier .

@@44781525 @4781525/ 49529 @qwx459529 49530 @qwx459530 <p> At AMDA , our goal is to prepare our students for a rewarding career in the performance industry . To achieve this , much of the way we operate mirrors the experience you will have when you enter the industry as a professional . Our application and audition process is no exception ! <p> Below are 8 important tenants to follow whether you 're auditioning for the role - or the school - of your dreams . <h> 1 . It 's all about connections . <p> Luckily , from the beginning , you will have the AMDA Admissions Office on your side . We are happy to be one of your first connections and understand that for some of you this will be your first time applying to a school . Do n't hesitate to call us - we are here to make this process as straightforward as possible . <p> Also , reach out to your friends , family , teachers , guidance counselors , librarians , and mentors . Whether they 're editing your application essays or lending you a presentable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a world of difference . In many ways , some of these early friends and mentors can remain the most important resources throughout the rest of your life and career , so do n't forget to repay the favors ! <h> 2 . Early is on time and on time is late . <p> In an industry where time is money " punctuality is critical . Deadlines , meetings , auditions and performances all provide you with opportunities to display your dedication and professionalism . You 'll also find that being early enables you to focus on the task at hand without added stress . <p> For these reasons , when applying to AMDA , we always recommend submitting your application documents before your audition date . This way , you are free to focus your energy on preparing your audition pieces instead of rushing to get documents submitted by the deadline . Also , when it comes time to audition , make sure to leave your house even earlier than you think you should . In addition to making a fabulous first impression , this also allows you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can relax and take a few deep breaths before presenting your pieces . <h> 3 . Get Organized . <p> Many artists resist getting organized because they think it somehow undermines their creative personalities . But being organized does not make one less of an artist ! In fact , artists may need a few carefully chosen organizational tools more than anyone else just to keep track of important information in a mind already overflowing with creative ideas . <p> Calendars , checklists , apps and email reminders can offer some much needed assistance in meeting application deadlines and remembering appointments . If this type of structure does n't come easily to you , you 're not alone . Chances are , your library has a whole section dedicated to it ! Luckily , some of these books are written specifically for the busy artist . This is a great one to get you started . <h> 4 . Expect the unexpected . <p> It 's not pessimistic " it 's professional ! <p> Even the most organized person in the world will still have to deal with unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life and do your best to plan for them in advance , you are less likely to get sidetracked when you do encounter them . While you obviously ca n't plan for all of life 's unexpected events ( that 's what makes them so beautifully unexpected ) you can still do your best to have a few backup plans in place for the things that are notorious for going wrong at the worst possible times . <p> Keep backup copies of your documents in case yours get lost in the mail . Have a backup ride to your audition in case your car wo n't start . Carry a backup map in case your GPS decides to guide you in giant circles . You get the idea . <h> 5 . Look Good on Paper . <p> As a performer , you 'll often make your first impression before you ever setting foot in the casting office . Your headshot and resume - and even your emails - can speak volumes about you . <p> When applying to AMDA , you will be asked to turn in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can learn a bit more about you . Each document is an opportunity to present yourself clearly and authentically , so be sure to submit items that are well-edited , thorough , and accurate . <h> 6 . Present yourself professionally . <p> In life , there is nothing wrong with expressing yourself through fashion , piercings , tattoos , etc . But for auditions it 's generally best to present yourself as a blank slate " open to a wide variety of roles . <p> For your AMDA audition , it is recommended that you wear business casual attire ( or appropriate dance attire if applying for Dance Theatre ) . By dressing simply and professionally , you will help ensure that your performance takes center stage rather than your style . If you are unable to attend a live audition and must audition via video , these are still great guidelines to follow . <h> 7 . Be accessible . <p> When a director calls with the role of a lifetime , or your agent tries to mail you your paycheck , you 'll want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that you are easy to get a hold of ! <p> As an AMDA applicant , you 'll want to do the same . When it comes to confirming auditions or sending admissions decisions , we 'll need to make sure we are able to contact you as quickly and easily as possible . If you move , get a new phone , or finally decide to change the embarrassing email address you 've had since junior high , be sure to give us a call and let us know so we can keep in touch . <h> 8 . It 's okay to brag about yourself . In fact , it 's your job . <p> To be a performer , you have to be comfortable marketing yourself . This means having confidence in you " the product . When it comes time to do interviews , be ready to talk about what makes you so great . <p> Your AMDA Admission interview is a great opportunity to practice this skill . If you have experience , talk about your experience . If you have passion or natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you believe that you have something to offer it 's a lot easier to make other people believe that too .

Her grandmother is the MGM Musical actress/singer Kathryn Grayson ( Kiss Me Kate , Showboat , Anchors Away , and Camelot on Broadway ) . Her grandfather , Johnnie Johnston , was the star of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn on Broadway and was a popular recording artist in the 1940 's . Kristin 's mother grew up the child of these two stars and was a great actress/singer in her own right . Her parents met when her father , Robert Towers , was playing Snoopy in the LA Production of You 're A Good Man , Charlie Brown at the Ivar Theatre , right down the street from AMDA LA . Mr. Towers has acted in hundreds of plays and musicals and has been in many TV Shows and Films . Notably he played the older Benjamin in the film The Curious Case Benjamin Button . <p> Kristin came to AMDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impressive start to her stage career , everything changed abruptly when she was injured in a show . Told she could n't go back to performing , she left the theatre and started a family . After seven long years away Kristin knew she could n't give up her passion any longer . Kristin talks about her journey and what it has been like to return to the stage . <h> When did you decide you wanted to be an actress and pursue musical theatre ? <p> I grew up surrounded by all of this . My parents LOVE Sondheim and as a child , I knew the lyrics and difficult rhythms to all of Sondheim 's shows . I also listened to all Cy Coleman shows and little known works like " Goodtime Charlie . " I basically lived and breathed musicals my whole childhood . Whenever my family had troubles and I would go in my room and listen to musicals , playing every part . As I got older , it was apparent to everyone that this was also my gift . I was accepted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every show . I knew that this was what I was born to do . <h> Tell us about how you came to AMDA ? <p> I was at Hollywood High when I saw the AMDA NYC poster ( this is long enough ago that there was n't even an AMDA in LA yet ) and decided that I wanted to go there . It was perfect " an intensive program that focused on all of the things a well rounded performer needed . Even though I grew up in LA , I was really only interested in being onstage . After graduating High School ( Best Actress/Class Vocalist ) , I went to Santa Monica College for a year and in that time auditioned for AMDA and got in with a partial scholarship . I was so excited to be in New York and never thought twice about moving there at 19 years old ! <h> What was your experience like ? <p> I get teary just thinking about my time at AMDA . All I can say is that it was the best two years of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street in New York to get to class . The classes were amazing . I loved that we got to travel as a group through our semesters and see each other grow and take chances . I loved that my teachers were all people who had been through the ups and downs of the business and could offer real world advice and I loved that it was process oriented , not results oriented . I was someone who was coming from LA with a whole family in the industry and I was in class with students from small towns in the mid west , yet we were all in the same process . I always felt safe to take chances and was encouraged to do so . I made lifelong friends who , to this day , are still some of my best friends . <p> The thing that most stuck with me however was the Dossier that Michael Sartor gave us . It was what we used to break down our songs in the 1st and 2nd semester . It has been with me through every rehearsal process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I Want " song at AMDA ( which was , " In My Own Little Corner " from Cinderella ) . It is genius and so was he . <h> What were your goals as a student ? <p> I was , in many ways , very young and was not very driven to be career oriented . I just wanted to be as great as possible at my craft . This has always been my downfall . I did n't want to see something I loved as a business . But it is ! So , my true goals shifted when I realized that as much as I loved this , I needed to be skilled and technically sound . I really embraced technique . Like , for example , a falling inflection at the end of a phrase . I see many great actors , who are very talented , make that mistake all of the time . It is a technical thing but it matters . <p> The other thing I really wanted to do was to be as strong of a musician as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at 5ft tall , I knew I 'd never be a show girl . I wanted to have the perfect marriage of acting and singing - seamless and real . I strive for this every time I walk on a stage . <h> What did you do after you graduated ? <p> I stayed in New York for a few months and then moved back to LA . I loved living there but business-wise , it made more sense for me to be in LA . I had connections in LA and an agent who wanted to work with me . So I came home and within a week , had a roommate , an apartment , an agent and was up for a big TV show on Disney Channel . And while this was all well and good , my heart ached for the stage . So , I began auditioning for theatre projects , first locally and then for Non-Union National Tours . I booked my first tour , HMS Pinafore and then did seven National Tours in four years , worked on a Cruise Ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing Christine/Cossette and went to Europe where I got to sing Christine again . I took a National Tour of Veggie Tales Live and that was when my life changed . My costume weighed 50 lbs . and pushed a disc out of my back . When I came back to LA , I was told I 'd never be onstage again . I was 27 . <p> After that , I decided to settle down and get married . I wanted something normal and constant and my husband is a great guy . We got married and 26 days into our marriage , I got pregnant with baby #1 . Then we had babies #2 &amp; #3 . Before I knew it , I was a married woman with 3 daughters and performing was just a thing of my past . <h> As many artists face the dilemma of how to balance family and career , you made the choice to set aside your career for a time in order to raise a family . Was that a difficult for you ? <p> When my youngest was a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my craft . I was back in touch with some of my theatre friends and got cast as one of the leads an operetta , The Gondoliers . It was very hard to cook dinner , leave my kids and get to rehearsal . However , having been away from my craft for 7 years , I had also realized that it was n't just the acting and singing that I missed , it was my tribe and my people . We theatre people are a special breed and I was so far from my kinfolk . I was trying to make friends with other moms ( most of whom did NOT get me ) and just be " normal . " I could n't put it into words then but now I realize that I am a very unique person because of my being raised in the theatre . Yes , I 'm a mom but I do n't have to fit into someone 's " box " of what a mom is . I still have my own hopes , dreams , talents and I decided that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom , one who was still doing what she was supposed to do , following her bliss and using her craft . Who did n't let having children or being a certain age stop her from using her God-given talents . <h> When you decided to return to your career , how did you go about getting back into the world of performing ? <p> I just started putting myself out there . I auditioned for stuff in Backstage West and started getting cast again . I was surprised that after having kids and being nearly a decade older , I was still getting cast as an ingenue and leading lady . I worked very hard to lose my baby weight so I do n't look like a typical mom of three and I got very involved with a Theatre Company in San Pedro called " The Relevant Stage " at the gorgeous Warner Grand Theatre . In 2011 , I did Kiss Me Kate there on the 1 year Anniversary of my grandmother 's death . 2011 turned into a huge year for me . I won " Breakthrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actress in a Musical " ( Dot/Marie - Sunday in the Park with George ) and " Outstanding Performance by a Lead Actress in a Musical " ( Lillie Vanessi/Kate in Kiss Me Kate and Winnifred in Once Upon a Mattress ) from StageSceneLA . I am also nominated for two Broadway World Awards , " Best Actress in a Musical " ( Kiss Me Kate ) and " Best Female Cabaret Performer of the Year " ( for my solo show , A Lovely Lineage , which I am performing again at Sterling 's at Vitellos in February 2012 ) . <h> Recently you have played numerous theatrical roles around the LA area , receiving several awards and nominations . This seems to be quite a validation of your return . How does that feel ? <p> It feels like a dream . There were literally years of my life where I ached so much for my craft to just be a part of my life again . I LOVE my children and my husband but I was a shell of myself without having theatre in my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities and continue to get to play dream roles and get awards for them , is just simply amazing . I think it is ironic that I was called a " Breakthough Performer " - it is such a telling decription . I 've had to breakthrough a health scare with my back , prejudice that comes from me being a mom/wife , my own fears about how I will be received , having a lack of a peer group - people in my stage of life still doing this . But then again , I am experiencing a renaissance of sorts , so breakthrough is right on the money ! <h> Tell us about your next show , Little Women ? You will play Meg March and your father is also in the cast . How does it feel to be able to perform with him ? <p> Our show is a benefit called Haven to Haven . Haven Academy of the Arts ( a young person performing arts school in El Segundo ) is partnering with a safe haven house for women who are rescued from domestic trafficking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise money to help fund the building of the shelter . My father is playing Mr. Lawrence . I am so excited to work with him again . We did a National Tour together of The Mikado and we 've done some local theatre together but nothing like this . It means the world . <h> What advice do you have for AMDA students and alumni who have taken time away , or are thinking of doing so , to pursue other interests ? <p> I think it 's great to take a break , if you need to . But I also think that if your heart is broken because you are n't doing what you love anymore , life is too short not to remedy that . Only you can go to the audition and book the job . I had a great teacher at AMDA , Tim Fauvel , who said to us on the very 1st day : " If you can do ANYTHING else and be happy , GO DO IT . This business is too hard if you are n't going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a bad thing that you want to do other things , just know that this business takes 100% commitment and nothing less . <p> The other thing I would say is that you are a necessary type , no matter what age you are . If you left an ingenue and now you are a mom type , so be it ! Embrace it and roll with it . Work is work . But do n't think that you are n't necessary just because you are n't 22 anymore . There is room for all of us ! And the truly meaty roles are usually for the more seasoned actors anyway . <h> Now that you have some life experience behind you , what is your ultimate career goal ? <p> My ultimate career goal is to be an actor who continues to stretch and grow , who challenges myself to audition for things I 've always wanted ( even if I do n't think they 'll cast me ) and to always be moving forward . I never want to sit back and pine for when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square in the eye and tell it to get out of my way . I want to earn the respect of those I truly admire , as an artist and as a person . I want to have artistic integrity , make work I can be proud of and hope that work begets more work . I want to do musical theatre , the only true American Art Form and do it well . There are so many things you can not control in this business but I want to be amazing at what I can control - and that is being 150% reliable , on my game and stellar at my craft . <h> Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience with us Kristin.

I first saw the stunning pictures taken of legendary dancers performing in the Berkshires of Massachusetts . It was at Jacob 's Pillow that world-renowned dancers as well as dance companies would create and/or premier new works to critic 's acclaim .

As a professional in the industry , I feel it is important to always maintain the heart of a student who wishes to constantly learn new things . I was incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to continue to study my craft at Jacob 's Pillow in addition to graduating from AMDA . From my audition , to submitting my letter of recommendation , to the training itself in Massachusetts , several professionals with ties to AMDA guided my path . Not only was it comforting , but it was also a great affirmation that the institution I chose to attend is relevant , current , and still continuing to help me achieve my goals professionally .

Since then she has recorded an album titled Far From Yesterday and is now touring the world as a featured performer for the Silversea Cruise Line . Since so many of our AMDA alumni are out performing in spectacular cruise line shows and many students are looking toward their future , we thought it would be an opportune time to speak with Kathleen to get her firsthand account of what the experience is really like . <h> When did you decide you wanted to be a performer ? <p> It was never much of a decision that I wanted to be a performer , I 've just always known . At age 12 , I began attending the San Diego School of Creative and Performing Arts and trained in singing , dancing , acting , and improv . I 've always been inspired by performers who find success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration to me because she not only performs on Broadway but in classical concerts , television series , and films in addition to recording albums . I am also inspired by the fact that my ancestors were traveling performers in Vaudeville . I guess this is just in my blood ! <h> Why did you choose to go to AMDA ? <p> AMDA 's Integrated Conservatory Program had everything I was looking for . I wanted to extend my training and the opportunity to do so in less than two years was ideal . I loved living on campus and being close to the rehearsal studios and piano rooms , not to mention being in the heart of Hollywood . I also liked the fact that the teachers were still working performers who had up to date advice and knowledge of the industry . <h> What did you learn while you were at AMDA ? <p> I sometimes forget that I was only at AMDA for less than 2 years because I learned and grew so much . Training in a conservatory is intensive but is well worth it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the final semester consists of only night classes . This gave me the opportunity to audition nearly every day and begin to feel comfortable and confident in an audition setting before I graduated . <h> Tell us about what you have been doing since you graduated ? <p> Since graduating , I 've been very busy ! I recorded my first album entitled Far From Yesterday ( which I wrote while I was at AMDA ) and shot a music video for the title song . I soon began performing those songs at venues around Los Angeles . I eventually worked my way up to performing a weekly show at House of Blues on the Sunset Strip . I booked some modeling and voice over jobs , performed in Grinchmas at Universal Studios Hollywood along with Jesus Christ Superstar and Footloose . <p> I actually went back to AMDA before beginning my contract with the cruise line and stood on the stage where I auditioned for AMDA in 2008 . It was so incredible to be back where my adventure began . <h> When did you decide you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother lived on a sailboat in her 20 's so I grew up wanting to travel as she did . The cruise line offered the opportunity to travel AND perform so it was truly everything I wanted to take out of life at 21 years old . When the audition came up , I jumped on it as soon as possible . I ca n't begin to describe how I felt when I got confirmation that I had booked it ! <h> Tell us about your day-to-day experience of what it is like to perform daily on a ship and travel to exotic places ? <p> Performing on a ship is absolutely wonderful . I explore the ports during the day and perform at night . I am on the Silver Wind of the Silversea Cruise fleet , which is a 6 Star Luxury line . Because of the ship 's status and clientele , we travel to very exotic and unusual ports . For example , we 've braved pirated waters to sail to the Seychelles Islands , which has since closed down their ports due to the ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship to be a wonderful place to grow as a person . I have the opportunity to experience new cultures every day . Since boarding in November 2011 , we 've sailed to over 15 countries . Some favorites have been Dubai ( UAE ) , Egypt , India , Sri Lanka , Madagascar , Seychelles , and South Africa . We actually crossed the Equator today and are headed up to western coast of Africa . In the last three months of my contract , we will travel around Europe . All of these different experiences are essential in growing as an artist and songwriter . <p> We perform in an array of productions including Opera , Motown , Pop , and Jazz . I also sing my own cabaret of songs from my album . This is where my training at AMDA has really helped out . Because I have been trained in all genres of music , I never have trouble switching from a " belty " Stevie Wonder tune to a classical Italian aria . <h> Would you recommend this experience to your fellow alumni ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What better way to explore the world , save money and most importantly , challenge yourself and your AMDA training by performing songs from so many different genres of music . <h> What advice do you have for current students and recent graduates ? <p> My advice for current students and recent alumni would be to organize your ambitions . I have a list of things I want to accomplish in my career ; roles I 'd love to play and stages I dream of performing on . Also , continuously audition . Even when you 've booked a job , you need to be thinking about what you want to do after that . I 'm sure at least one teacher at AMDA has told you that you 'll hear 100 " No 's " for every " Yes " while auditioning . So , do n't be discouraged if it takes you a while to start booking jobs ! <h> What is next for you ? <p> After I leave the ship , I have booked a summer tour in France where I will perform songs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while on the ship and plan to return to LA to record it . Ultimately I hope to continue traveling , performing , writing and learning . If you would like to stay updated on my career , please visit my website at www.kathleenburgoon.com . Good luck to all of you ! <h> Thank you Kathleen ! We look forward to hearing more about your next adventures !

Tell us about what the experience was like for you and Rebecca . <p> It was really awe inspiring to be part of such a big production . It 's the biggest talent show on earth , and performing for an audience of 3 thousand while also knowing it was being broadcast live to over 17 million was quite something . <h> You also competed on " Britains Got Talent " in the U.K. How were the experiences different ? <p> The UK version was a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole experience lasted just under a week when the show went live . In the US we started the process in April and finished last week , after just over 5 months . Also , the acts were completely different . In Britain it seemed like we were competing almost exclusively against kids and novelty acts . In America , we seemed to have a lot more " extreme " acts . <h> What you and Rebecca do is very unique and requires incredible skill , combining aerial choreography , acrobatics and balancing . How do you describe it ? <p> We base what we do on our collective sports , dance and performance experience , and we call it " an acrobalance and aerial musical act " . Rebecca and I both come from a musical theatre background , she as a dancer and I as a singer , and we really started our act from there . <h> How long have you been doing this and how did you start ? <p> " Britain 's Got Talent " was really the launch of our first acrobatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside each other in other people 's productions , we should try to teach ourselves partnering and start our own act . So , we took a few months and really started to focus our attention on what we 'd seen other acrobats do that had inspired us . We watched Cirque du Soleil DVDs and started from there really . <h> You certainly won over the " America 's Got Talent " judges with your performances and made a great deal of fans . What is next for you ? <p> Since " Britain 's Got Talent " opened so many doors for us in Europe we were hoping " America 's Got Talent " would do the same for us in the US . Thankfully , so far it seems to have worked , and we are getting some very nice offers at the moment including new TV opportunities both here and abroad . As a matter of fact , we are flying to Istanbul for a big TV show there , and we will be back in the US in a week or so for a performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CA . <h> Now let 's go back a little bit and talk about AMDA . How did you make the decision to study at AMDA ? <p> I grew up in Europe , and moved to the states when I was 13 getting almost immediately involved in musical theatre . As I graduated high school I wanted to really study acting and musical theatre full time but did not want a 4 year program . I wanted to be in NY , and AMDA seemed like the perfect solution . <h> Did you always know you wanted to perform or what inspired you ? <p> I suppose I did n't know until I saw other children my age performing , and realised how much fun it could be . My father was an entertainer so I had grown up in the wings of some of the biggest cabarets in Paris . It did n't connect however until we moved to the US and I joined the local children 's theatre . <h> What is the most important thing you learned at AMDA ? <p> I think one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't simply a matter of monologues and scene study . One of the things that makes our performance so personal now is that we really enjoy the story of the movement during the progression of the act . That is something most acrobats find difficult to convey but it 's exactly what appealed to us when we decided to teach ourselves acrobatics . I would definitely attribute that to my time at AMDA . The focus on the importance of the physicality of acting was invaluable in making high level acrobatics look more like a dramatic story rather than simply a well executed trick . <h> What advice do you have for graduating students ? <p> Good acting , and stage performance training translates into almost every aspect of entertainment so do n't be afraid to think outside the box . <h> Thank you for sharing your story with us and your amazing photos . Look for Donovan and Rebecca to appear on the TV show " Doctors " , as part of a fantasy bodies episode , later this month .

As a kid , I grew up in my mother 's dance studio so very early on I was exposed to the business side of things ( why which girl got to stand in the front , the mechanics of " building " a number , etc. ) and had always enjoyed choreographing . The only thing was , I was n't sure how to break out onto the New York scene . I picked five Broadway director/choreographers I looked up to and wrote them letters , asking if they would meet with me so I could pick their brain . You know " figure out how they did it . <h> When did you decide you wanted to pursue choreographing over performing ? <p> Shortly after I wrote the letters , I heard back from two Tony Award Winners , Jerry Mitchell and Tommy Tune .

I filmed the number , sent it back to Jerry and he gave me a few critiques . I started applying his advice , did a few more of these videos , and soon after I was getting phone calls to choreograph benefit concerts and small projects around the city . While all of this was starting to take off , I was still auditioning as a dancer . Sometimes it was bizarre , because I was auditioning next to people on Wednesday I had cut from an audition I was running on Monday . They kind of looked at me like " What are you doing here ? " During this time , I got a job on the national tour of Disney 's Beauty and The Beast and left everything to go on the road again . While in tech , I had an epiphany . I had worked so hard for 2 years to " become " a choreographer , and when it was finally starting to happen , I left ?

Of course it 's possible to do both , but once I focused myself and zeroed in , life really started to change . I dropped my performing agent ( which I had worked so hard for ) to sign with a creative team agent .
