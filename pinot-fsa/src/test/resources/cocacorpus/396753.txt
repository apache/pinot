Known to be sweeter though and less obvious to bake . Great for large baches . <p> Cracking : an unfortunate and undesirable side effect in a macaron shell . Cracking seems to be caused by multiple issues , including : oily or wet almond meal , whipping the egg whites for too long or not enough , over-folding the dry ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the batter and skipping the drying step before baking ; this allows cookie to form a skin allowing the moisture to escape from the bottom while baking forming the macaron feet ; foamy base ( pied ) . <p> 3 ea.

Since macaron hates excessive moisture , simply avoid making them at home if the humidity is too high or persistent . <p> MethodIn a food processor , blend almond and powdered sugar until it turns into a fine powder .

This almond-sugar mixture is called tant pour tant and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; sealed.In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment , beat room egg whites with cream of tartar and one-third of the sugar on medium speed for 10 minutes . This allows the egg whites to catch as much air as possible without rushing them when ready , increase the speed to high adding remaining sugar as it goes ; it should take 30 seconds to form stiff peaks . Do not over whip . With a rubber spatula or plastic scraper , fold in the almond-sugar mixture until just combined . Finish folding and scraping down batter ( macaroner ) until it forms a ribon . Pipe out macaron onto 2 half baking trays lined with silicon mat or parchment paper ; 30 shells per tray ; 1.5 inch ( 3.8cm ) diameter . The size of a baked macaron may vary but it should not go over 1.75 inch ( 4.5cm ) in diameter.Tapping sheets firmly against counter a couple of times to release air bubbles is optional .

The drying step or resting time before baking allow cookies to form a skin allowing the moisture to escape from the bottom while baking forming the macaron feet ; foamy base ( pied ) . <p> BakingWhen it comes to baking macarons , there is no doubt that a convection oven remains the best option . The increased air flow means that more heat gets into your cookies so it bakes quicker and more evenly.If using a convection oven:Preheat oven to 300F ( 150C ) and bake for 12 to 15 minutes.If using a conventional oven:Preheat oven to 285F ( 145C ) and bake for 18 to 22 minutes.Bake 1 sheet of macarons at a time . <p> ToppingFreeze dried raspberries , turned into powderLemon and lime zest.Method : Sift over the just baked macaron shells the freeze dried raspberry powder .

Add the chilled raspberry jam ( 3.3 ounces/100g ) and season to taste with the lemon confit . <p> AssemblySpread the bottom macaron shells with a thin layer of raspberry jam and top with the raspberry lemon cream cheese filling.A finished macaron should weigh 0.7/0.8 ounces / 20/25 grams.StorageFor best results , refrigerate filled macarons on a tray ; covered but not too tight . That way the shells can absorb the filling and become softer for at least 12 hours . Once chilled , re-arrange them standing up for longer storage ; covered . They will stay good for about 5 days at most . Macarons withstand freezing very well though . Store macarons with or without filling in an airtight container , then freeze for up to 3 months.Enjoy ! .

Can be kneaded by hand.For professional bakers only : Desired Dough Temperature ( DDT ) : 155F ( 68C ) . One of the most important skills a baker should learn is the ability to accurately control dough temperature . The benefits are clear and immediate : more consistency in fermentation , in bread flavor and color . To make bread , the ideal temperature of your kitchen should be between 71F and 75F ( 21/24C ) . <p> In general , wheat-based doughs should be between 75F and 78F ( 24/26C ) at the end of mixing time . Never add sweetener to any bread dough ; this will accelerate the fermentation process which goes to the opposite way for what bread should be about : the time factor to develop flavors on its own . Follow this useful example and you will get there.Air temperature : 70F ( 21C ) Flour temperature : 70F ( 21C ) Water temperature : 76F ( 26C ) The " friction factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you make a large batch of dough , the amount of yeast should be reduced by half because of the mass effect when the fermentation begins . The bread will actually taste better and will have a longer shelf life . <p> Autolyse refers to the destruction of a cell by its own enzymes , or " self-splitting " . In baking , this means that enzymes in flour ( amylase and protease ) begin to break down the starch and protein in the flour . The starch gets converted into sugar , and the protein gets reformed as gluten.By giving the mixed flour and water time to go through autolysis on their own , you achieve the same result as mixing it but without any of the unpleasant effects of oxidation by over-oxidized ( or , over-kneaded ) dough which bleached the dough and flavor loss in a finished bread . Additionally , an autolyse period gives the flour time to soak up all the moisture , resulting in more orderly gluten formation . It relaxes the dough which makes pizza much easier to handle .

Set the speed control to low speed , if using another mixer use the hook attachment , then add yeast and flour . Mix until homogenized and stop the mixer and cover with a slightly wet kitchen towel . Normally , yeast is added once the autolyse time is over but this is a quick autolyse ( 20 to 30 minutes ) and because of the small quantity of yeast , its effect will be delayed . Once the autolyse is done ; you will notice that the dough is already smooth and elastic , turn on mixer and add salt and mix until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl , it wo n't take too long thanks to the autolyse effect .

Once made it can be refrigerated up to 8 days.First , soak the foie gras in salted water ( 1ounce/30g ) kosher salt per gallon / 4L , or milk at room temperature for at least two hours . This will temper the foie gras , making it easier to manipulate as you remove the veins . Inspect the surface and remove visible bruises or blemishes . The ideal internal temperature of the liver should be around : 65F ( 18C ) . Carefully remove liver from water or milk and drain over paper towels . <p> To clean foie grasPull apart the two lobes .

Slice through the lobe to the vein holding your knife at a 45-degree angle , following its path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein clearly . Make a surface cut at each side of the vein to butterfly the lobe and scrape far enough with the tip of your knife to open the folds and expose the network of the veins leaving the outer skin of the foie gras intact . First , pull out the smaller network of veins located right above the thickest veins using the tip of a knife and your fingertips then continue down where all the thickest veins are and carefully pull them out . Try to remove as much of the vein network in one piece as possible . There are smaller veins throughout the liver that should be removed as well ; the more refined the finished product will be . It does not really matter how much you cut and scrape the inside , you 'll be able to reform the lobe . Once cleaned , fold over the sides to return to its original shape . <p> For the small lobeRepeat the same procedure by following the line of the primary vein .

Arrange the deveined room temperature foie gras on the seasoned plastic wrap and add the remaining seasoning and the alcohol . Roll firmly into a log and refrigerate for 12 hours . <p> Shaping Foie gras log can be re-wrapped into plastic film instead of cheesecloth . It will end up lightly coated with its own fat since the hot water wont go through . Follow the same procedure but poach in water only.Remove foie gras from the refrigerator 30 minutes before reshaping it .

Rolling it away from you , roll it up in the cheesecloth into a tight cylinder twisting and pressing one end first as you roll to force the foie gras into a compact log .

Continue rolling the log from the other side to compress into a very tight log until you 'll see bits of foie gras being forced through the cheesecloth . At this juncture your foie gras is at room temperature and it can be poached right away but it would have to be reshaped into its original form after cooking . If you want to skip this reshaping step ; refrigerate the log 12 more hours or until it has completely hardened and poach it . The torchon will keep its original shape and less fat will be wasted . <p> PoachingBring water or stock to a simmer .

Turn the mixture out onto a silicone mat . Let stand a couple of minutes . Work the nougatine from the silicone mat to protect your hands ; folding nougatine in every direction to cool it down a bit and make it more malleable . Now , the temperature of the nougatine should be around 185F(85C) . Greasing kitchen utensils are not necessary since the nougatine contains butter . Leave oven on at 300F ( 150C ) . Roll out nougatine into a 4 millimeter thick disk . Transfert nougatine into a 9 inch ( 23cm ) round cake pan and form into a mold . Reheat nougatine in the oven as you go .

Follow the same method if mixed by hand using a rubber spatula.Pipe choux on 3 large baking sheets ( 28 puffs per tray ) lined with a silicon mat or parchment using a 5/8 / 0.625 / 15.8 mm open star pastry tip . The use of a star piping tip ( or nozzle ) to pipe pGte a choux is essential to allowing the batter to expand evenly with minimal cracking during the baking process .

Enjoy ! <p> There are 3 different methods to creating a proper meringue for macarons : the French , the Swiss and the Italian.The French method macaron like at Len ( tre in Paris and is the most used in macaron recipes , because it results in the correct texture and taste for the French macaron . Though , they need more resting time before baking.The Swiss method macaron consists in beating egg whites and sugar over a water-bath first . It achieves consistant and great results . However , a bit more challenging especially if made in large numbers.The Italian method macaron like in LadurTe in Paris is said to produce a more stable meringue because it uses a hot sugar syrup in place of dry sugar . Known to be sweeter though and less obvious to bake . Great for large baches . <p> Cracking : an unfortunate and undesirable side effect in a macaron shell . Cracking seems to be caused by multiple issues , including : oily or wet almond meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , over-folding the dry ingredients into the meringue during the macaronage step , excessive moisture in the batter and skipping the drying step before baking ; this allows cookie to form a skin allowing the moisture to escape from the bottom while baking forming the macaron feet ; foamy base ( pied ) . <p> 3 ea.

Let cool completely and process with powdered sugar then .

Do not over process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called tant pour tant and can be made in advance store in a dry and cool place ; sealed.In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment , beat room egg whites with cream of tartar and one-third of the sugar on medium speed for 10 minutes . This allows the egg whites to catch as much air as possible without rushing them when ready , increase the speed to high adding remaining sugar as it goes ; it should take 30 seconds to form stiff peaks . Do not over whip . With a rubber spatula or plastic scraper , fold in the almond-sugar mixture until just combined . Finish folding and scraping down batter ( macaroner ) until it forms a ribon . Pipe out macaron onto 2 half baking trays lined with silicon mat or parchment paper ; 30 shells per tray ; 1.5 inch ( 3.8cm ) diameter . The size of a baked macaron may vary but it should not go over 1.75 inch ( 4.5cm ) in diameter.Tapping sheets firmly against counter a couple of times to release air bubbles is optional .

The drying step or resting time before baking allow cookies to form a skin allowing the moisture to escape from the bottom while baking forming the macaron feet ; foamy base ( pied ) . <p> BakingWhen it comes to baking macarons , there is no doubt that a convection oven remains the best option . The increased air flow means that more heat gets into your cookies so it bakes quicker and more evenly.If using a convection oven:Preheat oven to 300F ( 150C ) and bake for 12 to 15 minutes.If using a conventional oven:Preheat oven to 285F ( 145C ) and bake for 18 to 22 minutes.Bake 1 sheet of macarons at a time . <p> ToppingFreeze dried raspberries , turned into powderLemon and lime zest.Method : Sift over the just baked macaron shells the freeze dried raspberry powder .
