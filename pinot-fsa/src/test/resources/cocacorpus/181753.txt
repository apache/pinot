What is the Freedom of Information Act 2000 ? <p> gives you a right of access to information held by public authorities , such as the police and your local council <p> explains any situations where you wo n't have the right to access information <p> is fully retrospective - it covers any information we already hold <p> gives public authorities a number of duties . <p> The Information Commissioner 's Office is responsible for making sure that public authorities fulfil the duties given to them by the act . The Information Commissioner 's Office website gives more detailed information on the act <h> 3 . How do I get the information I am looking for ? <p> A lot of council information is already available , and much of it is on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that you need . It is a guide to the types of information that we routinely publish , the format in which the information is available and how much it will cost if there are any charges . <p> Any information not available through our publication scheme can be requested by filling out the Freedom of information online request form or by contacting us directly in writing ( which includes emails or faxes ) . The request must tell us your name and a return postal or email address and must explain clearly what information you want . Please provide as full a description as possible of the information you require and make the information as specific as possible . If your request is too broad we may ask you to clarify it which means it will take longer to get the information . Also please be clear about the format you would prefer to receive the information in , for example , by e-mail or as a paper copy . <p> We will acknowledge your request within two to three days .

If a fee is payable , the time limit of 20 days is put on hold until payment of the fee is received . If the fee is not paid within 3 months your request will lapse . <p> Some of the exemptions require the Council to consider whether it is in the public interest to withhold information , in which case we may need more time to decide whether the exemption applies . If this happens we will give you an estimate of when we will reach a decision . <h> 6 . Can I ask for information in any format ? <p> You can ask for the information in any format , for example , a paper or electronic copy of the documents that the information comes from , to arrange a visit to inspect the documents in person , or a summary of the information .

You can find these as PDF files below . <p> Please check file sizes before downloading as some are very large . If you have difficulty downloading a file , please contact us . <h> What is the Surrey Landscape Character Assessment ? <p> The Surrey Landscape Character Assessment ( LCA ) is a comprehensive assessment of the landscape character of the county . It takes account of the framework of the National Character Areas recently reviewed by Natural England and describes variations in the landscape character at a county level . <p> The Surrey LCA review was undertaken by landscape consultants Hankinson Duckett Associates , in partnership with the environment team at Surrey County Council , Natural England and Surrey 's districts and boroughs . It has been informed by and now replaces the 1997 character assessment , entitled The future of Surrey 's Landscape and Woodlands . <p> A landscape character assessment looks at the local landscapes and their unique qualities in a detailed way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying geology , soils , topography , land cover hydrology , vegetation , historic and cultural development and physical features and describes how these elements and features combine together to make one place different from another . This leads to the classification and mapping of the landscape via landscape types and landscape character areas , which seek to describe the patterns and key features of each of the landscapes . It does not judge or rank the character of a place but describes the landscape of each area in a systematic way using those essential characteristics that make up each landscape . <h> The Landscape of Surrey <p> Surrey is one of the most wooded counties in England , but despite this it has a great variety of land cover due to its varied geology , landform and soils . It contains the flat areas in the Thames Basin , the hills of the North Downs and Wealden Greensand , large expanses of open heathland , enclosed wooded gills , river valleys and water bodies , intimate small scale farmland and open meadows . Woodland covers 22% of the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Farmland , including that of the Low Weald is another main component of the landscape . The two river valleys of the Wey and Mole cut through these landscapes , flowing from south to north . They flow into the Thames , threading through a number of large reservoirs and water bodies in the northwest of the county , before joining the main river . <p> It is a highly valued landscape with over 25% of the county being designated as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( the Surrey Hills and the High Weald AONBs ) . It contains extensive areas of high biodiversity value and internationally important habitats . The county also contains a number of high quality historic parklands . <h> Landscape character types and areas <p> The LCA has identified 21 generic Landscape Character Types across the county which consist of landscapes that consist of broadly similar patterns of geology , landform , soils , vegetation , land use settlement and field patterns . These are accompanied by two landscape types which consist of groups of small individual areas on the edges of , or surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land uses which do not readily fit into the other landscape types . <p> These landscape types areas are split into 140 locally related and named landscape character areas . Each landscape character area has a distinct and recognisable local identity . <h> Landscape Guidelines <p> Each landscape type has a number of guidelines to help provide a broad framework for managing the pressures for change which may affect them . They offer guidance on maintaining the diversity and essential characteristics identified to conserve the landscape for the future . <h> Mapping and descriptions <p> The study has been prepared on a Geographic Information System ( GIS ) with mapping undertaken at 1:25,000 . This is available on the Surrey Interactive map . You can access the descriptions of landscape types and landscape character areas under the separate chapters of the landscape assessment , by downloading the relevant pdf below . <h> Purpose of assessment <p> Local authorities are encouraged to base planning policies and decisions on up to date information about the natural environment and other characteristics of the area .

@@74253345 @2953345/ <h> Providing 30 hours of free childcare <p> Parents must apply for 30 hours now through the Childcare Choices website if they want their child to start claiming in the autumn term , as the application deadline is 31 August 2017 . <p> From September 2017 most working parents of 3 and 4 year olds will be eligible for an extra 15 hours of free childcare a week , term time . Added to their current universal entitlement of 15 hours , this means that their free early education entitlement will increase to a total of 30 hours a week , term time . <p> If spread over a whole year , the current 570 hours of free childcare these parents get will increase to 1140 hours . This is statutory under the Childcare Act 2016 . <p> The government is encouraging childcare providers to offer the entitlement flexibly and extend the 1140 hours over the whole year if possible . They are encouraging partnership working between childcare providers . For example , the entitlement can be split between up to three separate childcare providers but at no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eligible for 30 hours ? <p> In a two parent family , both must work full or part-time and in a one parent family the sole parent must work full or part-time . Each parent must earn at least -107 per week ( -5,574 per year ) but less than -100,000 per year . <p> Parents who do n't  want to use Tax-Free Childcare can still apply through this website for the 30 hours free childcare . They will need to fill in an online application and if they 're eligible , they 'll be given an 11 digit eligibility code . The parent will then bring this code to their chosen childcare provider who will need to ask them to fill in an eligibility form . There 's an eligibility form for childcare settings ( PDF ) to use and a separate eligibility form for schools ( Word ) . <p> Once the relevant form is completed and signed the childcare provider will need to contact the Finance and Practice Team on 01372 833811 who will use the information collected on the form to check the code through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result . This process is temporary and will change in the near future . <p> Government will remind parents every three months to reconfirm the details they entered on their application are still correct . This is to check that they 're still eligible . They 'll send parents a text message and/or email , four weeks before their reconfirmation deadline and again two weeks before the deadline if they still have n't reconfirmed . <p> The local authority will recheck the eligibility code at regular intervals and will tell the childcare provider if a parent is no longer eligible for the extended hours along with the date their grace period ends and funding will stop . If the family 's circumstances have changed and they are no longer eligible for the 30 hours free childcare or they have not reconfirmed their eligibility , they will still get the universal 15 hours of free entitlement . <h> Do parents want to start using their 30 hours this autumn term ? <p> If parents want to start taking their 30 hours free childcare from 1 September 2017 , they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code on or before 31 August 2017 .

This equals 570 hours a year and can also be spread over more than 38 weeks if that option is available .

It can also be stretched across a full year if the provider offers this but the number of hours per week would be reduced ( for example , 1140 hours per annum is 30 hours per week for 38 weeks and 22.8 hours per week over 50 weeks ) . <p> Childcare providers will not be restricted to a minimum session length . <p> Childcare providers may charge a deposit to secure a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> Funded hours can be taken at breakfast clubs , after school clubs , holiday playschemes and at weekends , if available , as well as with registered childminders and other registered childcare providers . <p> Childcare providers must publish their admissions criteria and show clearly which hours/ sessions can be taken as free provision and any fees charged for additional time . <p> Invoices should show clearly which periods are free and which additional services or hours taken are being charged for . <p> Childcare providers will be able to ask for voluntary payments for meals and snacks as part of a free place as well as consumables such as nappies and sun cream and for trips and services such as languages or yoga . <p> Parents that qualify for the additional hours should also qualify for tax free childcare to help offset any additional costs . <h> What should childcare providers do to prepare for this ? <p> How the additional hours could be stretched across more than 38 weeks , and if so , how many hours per week would be available . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 30 hour children , 15 hour children and those children eligible for FEET .

@@74253429 @2953429/ <h> John Norden 's Mirror of Britain <p> Two of the earliest printed maps in our collection are the county maps of Surrey and Middlesex by John Norden . Both are very fine examples dating from c.1610 and were produced for inclusion in the first English language edition of Camdens Britannia . The Surrey map is the earliest individual map of the county and was made from a survey undertaken by Norden in the early 1590s . In the local government reorganisation of 1968 the borough of Spelthorne was transferred from Middlesex to Surrey and for this reason we hold historical maps of both counties in our collection . <p> John Norden was born in 1548 , the son of a Somerset yeoman . He graduated from Hart Hall , Oxford , and began his career as a lawyer involved in land tenure and surveying for the local gentry , before moving to London and becoming an attorney . He was a staunch Protestant and successfully published a selection of devotional books , including The Pathway to Penitence and A Pensive Mans Practice which ran to several editions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and influential attorney . <p> As a young man Norden had become interested in local history and antiquities and had read Holinsheds Chronicles and Camdens Britannia . Sparked by these interests , he conceived the idea of creating a series of pocket ( duodecimo ) books on the counties of Britain which would include small maps with roads and indexes of places combined with the kind of historical descriptions made popular by Camden , but in English rather than Latin . He called the project the Speculum Britanniae or ' Mirror of Britain ' . <p> In order to raise funds for this undertaking , Norden applied to Lord Burghley , the Lord High Treasurer and chief advisor to Queen Elizabeth I , for his support and patronage . Burghley issued him a Royal Pass or Warrant , enjoining Justices of the Peace and officials all over the country to assist him in his surveys , and he received some initial financial assistance from William Waad , a clerk to the Privy Council . <p> Norden began the surveying work in 1591 and published the first of the planned series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chorographical description of Middlesex in 1593 . The map of Middlesex shown here is a slightly later example , ' Middlesex olim a trinobantibus habitata ' SHC ref M/826 which was engraved by William Kip for the 1610 edition of Camdens Britannia . This first volume of the Mirror of Britain was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth . By 1594 , Norden had completed more of the maps for the project and , perhaps to raise money , he published those of Surrey , Hampshire , Sussex and possibly Kent as separate items . <p> The Surrey map was engraved by Charles Whitwell at the expense of Robert Nicholson and also bears the arms of William Waad , suggesting that Norden raised some financial support from local contacts he made whilst undertaking the surveys . This is the earliest example of a county map with roads ( marked as dotted lines ) . The map also illustrates the importance of Surreys rivers as a source of power with the depiction of a large number of mills ( 15 on the Wey alone ) . The Whitwell engraving was lost until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Geological Society . The map of Surrey shown here is a later example , ' Surrey olim sedes Regnorum ' SHC ref M/133 engraved by William Kip for Camdens Britannia of c.1610 . <p> By 1595 Norden , was desperately short of money to fund the publication costs and , in a further attempt to gain support , he sent a beautifully drawn manuscript volume containing a ' Chorographical description ' of Middlesex , Essex , Surrey , Sussex , Hampshire , Guernsey and Jersey , with copies of some maps to the Queen ' . This volume , which included the chorographical description of Surrey ( but not the map ) , is now in the British Library Add . MS 21853 . Experts have speculated whether the map of Surrey was later removed but there is no evidence in the volume that a page is missing . In the same year Norden also sent the Essex map and description to the Queens favourite the Earl of Essex , hoping for support in the venture , again without success . In fact the Essex volume remained unpublished until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1596 he and other Puritans had allied themselves to the Earl of Essex , the new Lord Deputy of Ireland , and he had published a prayer ' for the prosperous proceeding and good success of the Earl of Essex ' . Essex failed in Ireland , disobeyed the Queen and was imprisoned and , after a failed rebellion , was executed . All those linked to him were now in danger or disgrace . Norden tried to evade the association with Essex by lying ; he claimed that another John Norden had written the prayer dedicated to Essex but this was apparently refuted . Although he avoided imprisonment , his good reputation was lost and , in 1598 when Lord Burghley died , he lost his most important patron as well . Despite managing to publish the second part , Speculi Britanniae Pars : the Description of Hertfordshire , in 1598 , his project was abandoned and no further volumes for the Speculum Britanniae were published . <p> It was only after the Queens death in 1603 that Norden was able to return to favour and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster .

As the Registration Authority we maintain a Register of Common Land and a Register of Town or Village Greens . <p> Surrey has a greater proportion of common land in public or quasi-public ownership than any other County . There are over 24,000 acres of registered common land in Surrey . <p> In due course the Commons Act 2006 will replace the Commons Registration Act 1965 . The Commons Act 2006 received the Royal Assent on 19 July 2006 and intends to be a comprehensive authority on the law relating to commons and town and village greens . However , please note that the Act is not yet fully in force and will not be for quite a number of years to come . <h> 1 .

The term ' common ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the public own it at all . Common Land refers to the " rights " which specific people have , to products of the soil , not ownership of the land .

What are these " common rights " ? <p> There are six types of common rights . These have been granted to specific people known as commoners , not the general public . <p> They are : <p> Pasture the right to graze animals <p> Pannage the right to let your pigs go and eat acorns and beech mast <p> Estovers the right to take fallen branches or bracken <p> Turbary the right to dig turf or peat for use as fuel or for thatching <p> Piscary the right to take fish <p> Common in the soil the right to take stone , sand or minerals . <p> The granting of these rights has its origins in our history when the Medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of these rights existed .

It is also one of the few maps where the maker left a comprehensive record of its creation from which we can learn about those involved in its making . <p> Joseph Lindley was born in 1756 near Wakefield , the son of a local architect . He was sent to London to work in banking , but by 1781 he was employed at the Time Department at Greenwich where he rapidly rose to become Head of the Department .

During the Jacobite rebellion and subsequent Highland clearances , the army and the engineers of the Board of Ordnance had commenced a program of surveying of Scotland on a large scale of 1 " to 1000 yards ( 1747-1755 ) . By 1765 , Roy was deputy quartermaster general to the forces and engineer-director of military surveys in Great Britain . His measurement of the Hounslow Heath baseline in 1784 was the basis of the London-Paris triangulation that was to be the foundation of the modern Ordnance Survey . <p> On Lindley 's return from Paris , he decided to undertake a county survey of Surrey and , fortunately for us , he kept careful records of his surveying and published their details in a Memoir ( SHC ref 526.8 ) in 1793 .

The theodolite was a smaller version of the one created by Jesse Ramsden , a Yorkshireman , born 1735 , for William Roy for his London-Paris triangulation . This instrument for Roy took three years to build and had a base circle of 3 feet ; known as the Great Theodolite it weighed 90 kilograms , and is now in the collection of the Science Museum . This theodolite was used by the Ordnance Survey to carry out the project known as the Principal Triangulation of Britain which took place from 1783 to about 1853 . <p> Lindley sought the permission of General Roy to use his measurements from his triangulation with the Ramsden theodolite of the south east of England , in particular 5 stations in Surrey itself , and he ' in a very obliging manner ' prior to their publication , gave the positions of the five places which were to serve as primary stations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full trigonometrical survey , a first for Surrey . He started by marking these points on paper at scale of 2 " to 1 mile and then systematically and carefully surveyed the county for ' stations ' or high points , 85 in all , and proceeded with the triangulation being at great pains to test their accuracy against Roy 's readings . Every ' station ' is recorded faithfully in the published memoir . <p> Lindley then went into partnership with William Crosley who had trained as an Estate Surveyor and later undertook canal surveys at Rochdale , Lancaster and Scarborough before becoming resident engineer at Rochdale Canal in 1794 . On the Surrey survey he was assisted by a local land surveyor , Richard Crabtree of Farnham , who went on to set up a successful practice in Sussex . Crosley and Crabtree undertook the bulk of the topographical survey and employed far more traditional methods , preferring to use a plane table and two surveying wheels to conduct a fairly standard traverse along the roads . <p> The survey was completed in 1790 , and Lindley tackled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sending proofs to the Rev Owen Manning , rector of Godalming , Mr Barnes of Reigate for the names of the eastern side of the county , and William Bray the antiquarian who corrected the names of farms and pointed out ' several omissions of names of moment ' . By these conventional stages the proofs reached Benjamin Baker , the Islington engraver , one of the most respected of his day and the map was published in 1793 . <p> William Crosley died in 1797 and Lindley , having incurred considerable financial losses with the project , sold on the plates and maps to a Netlam Giles for -64 in 1799 , and until his death in 1808 took no further interest in surveying . William Faden bought the plates sometime before 1814 and reissued the map as a second edition in 1814 and again with revisions in 1819 . On his death his business was taken over by his son-in-law James Wyld who re-issued the map again in 1874 , but not before removing the names of Lindley and Crosley !

The distinction between the two is simply explained in section 5 of the Planning Inspectorate consistency guidelines PDF . <p> If an application is based on user evidence this must be gathered and submitted on standard Surrey County Council public way evidence forms .

This is usually evidenced in the first instance by a number of claimants completing public way evidence forms . It is not necessary for every claimant to have used the path for twenty years , but their evidence , taken together , must show twenty years unbroken use . The use must have been by the public at large and not by employees of the landowner or visitors to the landowner or his tenants .

This might include steps the landowner has taken to prevent the public using the route , by challenging their use in person or by erecting notices or periodically locking gates . It is sometimes the case that the affected landowner does not object to the claim . <p> Finally , we carry out any additional research which is required . Once we are satisfied that all of the available evidence has been considered , a report is submitted to the relevant County Council Local Committee , who decide whether an order to modify the map should be made or not .

It is actual or threatened physical , emotional , psychological or sexual abuse . It involves the use of power and control by one person over another . It occurs regardless of race , ethnicity , gender , class , sexuality , age , religion , mental or physical ability .

@@74253555 @2953555/ <h> Frequently asked questions about adoption of new housing development roads <p> Q : Why do housing developers build new roads ? A : Housing developers build roads for residents of new houses to get from the existing public highway to their properties . <p> Q : What is road adoption ? A : Road adoption is a process where a road in private ownership becomes a public road , which is then managed and maintained by the County Council , as part of the public highway . <p> Q : Does the County Council adopt all new roads built by housing developers ? A : No , housing developers can choose to keep their new roads private and some roads do not meet the County Council 's road adoption policy . Refer to the County Council 's ' Policy on Road Adoption ' for further information about the types of road that maybe adopted . <p> Q : Who looks after private and unadopted roads ? A : The County Council is not responsible for the management or upkeep of unadopted or private roads . Residents and management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the County Council . <p> Q : What is the advantage of having a new road adopted ? A : Adopted roads become part of the public highway . Following adoption , the County Council manages and maintains the road at the public expense . Individual residents do not have to pay for maintenance of adopted roads . <p> Q : How do developers get their new roads adopted ? A : New roads are most commonly adopted under a legal agreement and sometimes via a dedication process . Agreements are made under section 38 of the Highways Act 1980 . They are often called ' section 38 agreements ' . <p> Q : What is involved in a section 38 agreement ? A : The agreement is a legal document , normally between the County Council , a housing developer and a Surety , who financially guarantees the agreement . The terms of the agreement describe that if the developer builds the new road up to the County Council 's standards and maintains it for a year after it is built , the County Council will adopt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , such as : <p> the road construction duration and the one-year maintenance period <p> responsibility for maintenance and repair of the road before adoption <p> payment of the County Council 's fees and charges by the developer <p> any land transfer arrangements and wayleaves <p> what happens if things go wrong . <p> Q : Who is responsible for a new road before it is adopted ? A : The developer is normally responsible for the maintenance and repair of the new road up until the County Council adopts it . As above the County Council is not responsible for unadopted and private roads . <p> Q : Why does road adoption sometimes get delayed ? A : Sometimes road adoption is delayed by the following causes : <p> the developer starts building the road before entering into the section 38 agreement <p> the developer tries to vary the standard terms of the County Council 's section 38 agreement <p> the developer builds the road slowly or does not finish it <p> the developer does not build the road up to the County Council 's standards <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sewers under the new road <p> the road is finished but there are outstanding construction defects , often called ' snags ' , which the developer needs to fix .

Following a major American bombing campaign in February 1944 , the Germans took up position around the ancient hilltop abbey of Monte Cassino and the nearby town . The strategic importance of the area around Monte Cassino lay in its position within the ' Gustav ' line , defending the approaches to Rome . The first battle took place between 17 January 1944 and 11 February , the second battle , following a bombing assault on the abbey of Monte Cassino , took place between 15 and 18 February , the third battle between 15 and 23 March , and the fourth and final battle between 11 and 17 May 1944 . <p> Among the personal papers of men who served with the East Surrey Regiment are eight letters from Private Robert Charles Leslie Watkins ( 1925-1944 ) of the 1/6th Battalion to his parents in Epsom , Surrey ( SHC ref @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 , when he was still stationed in North Africa , and his last is dated 10 May 1944 , two days before he died at the Battle of Monte Cassino . <p> The letters do not offer an insight into actual combat situations and certainly not into the strategic course the battle was taking between January and May 1944 : army censorship did not allow such information to be relayed .

Indeed , the poignancy of the letters could be said to lie in the largely routine nature of their content coming , as they did , from a young man 19 years old who , like many others of his age , could think of little more than doing his duty and caring for his family . <p> On 7 April 1944 , Private Watkins writes to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might have invaded Gerry by the time this reaches you ... look after yourself when things do start and try to get a place fixed in the house so it can be made gas proof just in case " , and " he Germany is beaten as far as the war is concerned " ( SHC ref ESR/25/WAT/4 ) .

From small beginnings with the arrival of groups of children in Woking in 1952 , Ockenden rapidly expanded to provide refugee aid both in Britain and overseas - establishing schools for Tibetan refugees in India , sponsoring the education of black South African students , and bringing Biafran refugees to Britain .

The 40 reels of historic film footage of Ockenden and refugee documentaries were digitised by Screen Archive South East ( SASE ) and preserved for the future . The charity 's records , including the film footage , can be consulted at Surrey History Centre , although sensitive material is subject to access restrictions .

Any work should not pose a hazard to path users or reduce the width of path that had been previously available .

You should try to minimise any adverse effect , such as overshadowing , that the development might have on the path . Before starting to prepare plans , you should check with us where the legal boundaries of the path are . Like roads , public paths often have verges on either side , and even though the land may belong to you , if it forms part of the path , you will not be allowed to build on it .

In January 2008 we received six crates of material , covering over nine hundred years ' history , and the result of many years ' diligent accumulation by members of Albury History Society .

Since then , the society has continued to take an active role in the interests of the village and its surrounding area . <p> The sheer variety of the collection offers a wealth of information for anyone interested in researching the people , politics , architecture and landscape of Albury , with original documents dating back to the early eighteenth century .

Drummond , a wealthy banker , paid for the construction of an ' Apostles ' Chapel ' at Albury ( as well as for a new parish church to replace the Saxon church ) . All three church buildings have survived . The Saxon ' old church ' ( which also contains a mortuary chapel designed by Augustus Welby Pugin for Drummond ) hosts an annual midsummer service . The ' Apostles ' Chapel ' , whose last service was in 1950 , stands empty but cared for to this day . <p> There are histories of prominent Albury families , such as the Drummonds and Percys ( Dukes of Northumberland ) of Albury Park , and the Malthus family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings and grounds of Albury Park include research into the grounds that were landscaped by John Evelyn as well as the neo-Tudor chimneys thought to have been designed by Pugin . <p> Albury has certainly had its share of interesting residents over the years , and the collection includes papers of poet and philosopher Martin Tupper and local historian Olive Mary Heath . There are also the personal papers of the founding members of Albury History Society : William Baverstock Day , head clerk of Albury Estate ; Dr Maurice Burton , naturalist and zoologist ; and the aforementioned Helen Lloyd who lived at Weston Lodge , and who was the indefatigable leader of the local Women 's Voluntary Service in World War II . <p> Nearby Farley Heath was once the site of a Romano-Celtic temple which was discovered and excavated in 1848 by Martin Tupper .
