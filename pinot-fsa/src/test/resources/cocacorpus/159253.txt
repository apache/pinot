View More only minor edits . What makes this letter particularly interesting is that there is strong evidence suggesting the narrative of the letter was swiped from older ads , specifically from ads for The Alexander Hamilton Institute ( a popular correspondence school at the time ) . I 've included those ads as well so you can see the similarities . Now , let 's get into the actual letter . The first three paragraphs are brimming with optimism . It starts like a feel good story of " two men " who graduated together 25 years ago &amp; are very happy with key areas of their life . Then we 're hit with a down note . One man ended up being more " successful in business " than the other . For Wall St. Journal readers , this is a soft spot . They crave to be the quintessential businessman that achieves great success &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could go downhill for them or seemingly already did - now , how can they avoid such a painful situation from moving forward . This is where the Journal presents itself as the solution , stating that the special success factor is " applied knowledge " . What makes this " single " solution particularly believable is that the two men are portrayed as being the same in every other way . It leads you to the assumption that there must be something very specific that is missing between the two . If we were led to believe that there are many factors involved , the pitch would n't have the same effect . The rest of the letter finished with the Journal selling itself &amp; then presenting a soft , low-priced offer followed by a bigger yearly offer . The end of the letter finishes the loop , reinforces the similarities between the men &amp; how applied knowledge is what 's the difference aka The Journal . @qwx12127 <p> One of our biggest fears is that decades later ( or more drastically , on our deathbed ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach our full potential . The idea of time passing quick &amp; us failing to reach our desired goals in that time is very painful . <p> For many , the story also taps into other low feelings such as envy ( of the other man ) &amp; stupidity for feeling like they did n't achieve the same success as someone with an identical situation &amp; advantage . The question that then arises is " what is the missing factor(s) ? " which builds a substantial amount of curiosity . <p> Without the identical comparisons discussed , the story would n't have the same effect . It 's constructed to easily present a believable , single missing solution . <p> This is another bold example of swiping from older advertisements . The ads Conroy ( the copywriter ) was influenced by ran over 50 years earlier from when he created it . The way he swiped is completely okay because he simply used the structure &amp; flow of the narrative . @qwx12123 @qwx12131 @qwx12124 @qwx12130 @qwx12135 @qwx12134 <p> Your Name* <p> Email* <p> Website @qwx12132 <p> 13 Annotations @qwx12126 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Email* <p> Website @qwx12132 @qwx12128 @qwx12133

The insert- showcased below is a double-sided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in segments ( you 'll see some of the pages are repeated ) . It 's no surprise why the offer has been running for so long &amp; is still their premier offer -- it has a high perceived value with big savings , offers great free bonuses , is backed by a solid guarantee &amp; provides a variety you ca n't get any anywhere else , at the same convenience . They provide three options- for making the purchase : via phone , website or order form , which shows you- they 're much more than an online- retailer . @qwx12127 <p> About 50% of the insert is beautiful photography featuring their different wines , displayed in a holiday setting . This type of presentation has a big impact , making the wines look extra valuable &amp; extensive . Note how they have the bottles spread out &amp; positioned so it looks like you 're really getting a lot . This applies to their bonus wine-tasting notes as well . <p> Never underestimate the power of a killer bonus item . It 's no mistake that the free corkscrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , it may seem like nothing special , but by accompanying it with the wine as a " free gift " &amp; playing it up as " the only one they 'll ever need " , it becomes a big convincing element &amp; likely is low-cost for them .

I liked these emails Hillary 's team sent out because they demonstrate their attempt to manage attacks made on Hillary , especially at the Republican debates , which get millions of viewers . From a business perspective , this is the equivalent of dealing with objections . In this case , Hillary 's team takes a non-serious approach which shows they are not rattled by what 's being said and do n't even feel the need to respond seriously . Instead , they use humor after the debate , showing Hillary in a funny GIF that represents how ridiculous the attacks on her are .

@@2855163 <h> " Send Me Your Address " Email Hook from Daily Reckoning ( Agora ) <p> This email promotion from Daily Reckoning , a subsidiary of multi-million dollar newsletter publisher , Agora Inc. , - is marketing a free book using the " what 's ... View More your address ? " hook . Starting a promotion off by immediately asking for your address is an approach many top marketers use , - specifically to convert on- " free " offers ( for low-barrier customer acquisition ) . From what we 've seen , - Agora Financial has used this hook for several of- their free book promos . It 's important to note that whenever you 're giving something away for free , the resistance to taking action is lower . Because that resistance is low , prospects are- more willing to part with their info . Of course , desire-building copy should always follow this hook . It 's not meant to act on its own . The customer still has- to " want " what you 're selling . However , understand it 's not necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's your address ? " hook cuts right to the chase . The catch is , once you get to the sales page , you realize the free book deal includes a 30-day trial to a paid newsletter , which unless you cancel , will renew automatically and you 'll be charged $99 for the- year . @qwx12127 <p> When you 're selling a book , remember that many people are used to buying on Amazon or other third-party sites . And although third-party sales are still sales , the purpose of people- purchasing through you is to have the prospect go through your funnel &amp; potentially bump up- their order- size ( via upsells , cross-sells etc . ) For this reason , you want to make it clear ( like Agora does ) that your offer either is n't available on third-party sites like Amazon or is a much better offer than the ones found on third-party sites . <p> A profitable " free ( physical ) book " offer usually uses one or both of these- approaches . The first is marketing the book as free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upsells . The idea obviously is not to make money on the book , but help with acquisition costs &amp; then make money on back-end offers that follow the " free book " sale . The second approach ( used in the above example ) is to use a free book as the center of your promotion and include a mandatory trial for a membership or newsletter that 's automatically charged to your card if you do n't cancel after a certain period of time . It 's very powerful- in that- you 're using the power of " free " while covertly selling on top of it . <p> The " what 's your address ? " hook can be deceiving to many marketers because it seems too simple &amp; direct to work . What most forget- is that selling free stuff is much different than selling paid stuff . Have you ever noticed that when people hear something is free , they 're likely to take it even if they do n't intend to use it or really want it . Not much convincing is involved . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chase &amp; gets them primed to take action immediately . @qwx12123 @qwx12131 @qwx12125 <p> Visit the archives of this swipe 's source URL or view past screenshots of dailyreckoning.com below .
