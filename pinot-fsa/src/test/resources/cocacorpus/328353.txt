@@25231314 @5231314/ <h> Super Method To Detox Fluoride From The Body <p> There are various methods that have proven to successfully detox fluoride from the body . Using combinations of these methods provide much more punch than using one method at a time . <p> Our health is compromised by the consumption of the unnatural and toxic sodium fluoride that is added to public water , toothpaste , and food in order to supposedly combat tooth decay . The sodium fluoride is used to protect teeth , it is a poison and is used as an ingredient in rat poison . Sodium fluoride consumption contributes to the development of skeletal and dental fluorosis , 1pineal gland calcification , and lower IQ. 2 49808 @qwx249808 <p> Luckily , unless you swallow toothpaste that contains fluoride most of the fluoride in toothpaste does n't  enter the bloodstream . Trace amounts do end up being digested and over time and build up in the pineal gland of the brain , in bones , and in soft tissue in the body . <p> Sodium fluoride is so toxic that the labels on fluoridated toothpaste caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do swallow toothpaste . <p> You are not told though that it is inevitable that small amounts of fluoride will enter the body each time you brush your teeth with fluoridated toothpaste . <p> We are also told that the small amounts of fluoride added to public drinking or tap water is n't harmful . You are n't  told that the fluoride you drink from tap water accumulates in the body and just does n't  simply flow out of the body through excretion . <p> The fluoride consumed through brushing , drinking , and even eating fluoridated foods stays in the body and accumulates in the pineal gland of the brain , the bones , and tissues . <p> Since this is the case , it is important to remove as much fluoride from the body to protect organ function , bones , teeth , and the brain . <p> For instance , the thyroid is heavily dependent on iodine and fluoride displaces the iodine from thyroid cells . <p> " one halogen can displace another one of a higher atomic weight but can not displace one of lower weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interference with iodine uptake . The fluoride is a universal G-protein activator/inhibitor . The stimulation of certain G-proteins occurs due to the toxic effects of fluoride , which has the effects of switching off the uptake into the cell of the active thyroid hormone . The thyroid control mechanism is compromised . The TSH output from pituitary gland is inhibited by fluoride , thus reducing thyroid output from thyroid glands . Fluoride competes for the receptor sites on the thyroid gland which respond to TSH ; so that this hormone reaches the thyroid gland and so fewer hormone is manufactured . " 3 <p> Fluoride also combines with the calcium in bones and teeth and makes them brittle over time , 4 and fluoride is even associated with the decline in cognitive ability. 5 <h> Super Fluoride Detox Method <h> 1 . Reduce Fluoride Entering The Body <p> Stop consuming fluoridated public water . Most filtering systems use simple carbon filtration methods that ineffectively filter fluoride from public/tap water . Even reverse osmosis filters do not remove all of the fluoride from tap water . Reverse osmosis and ionizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not all of the fluoride . <p> It is best to stop brushing teeth with fluoridated toothpaste . Even using the recommended pea size is problematic because small amounts of sodium fluoride will end up getting into the bloodstream even though you spit out the toothpaste . You can protect against the buildup of cavity causing bacteria by brushing and rinsing the mouth after every meal . You want to kill bacteria in the mouth and can brush with natural anti-bacterial substances like coconut oil or oil of oregano . <h> 2 . Eat Tamarinds <p> A tamarind fluoride detox is an excellent and natural way to detox fluoride . Studies have shown that tamarind consumption results in the elevated excretion of fluoride through urination. 67 <h> 3 . Consume More Iodine <p> Studies89 have shown that iodine displaces fluoride , so the use of iodine as a fluoride detox is especially important to the thyroid .

( Short-term supplementation may be helpful but long-term you should depend on natural sources of iodine. ) <h> 4 . Overall Detox With Boron <p> Boron is a natural mineral that exists in the environment and in food . As iodine is an excellent fluoride detox for the thyroid , boron is an excellent fluoride detox for the bones and joints . Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive accumulation of fluoride in bones . Skeletal fluorosis results in brittleness of bones , and pain in bones and joints . This study by Zhou and his colleagues10 showed that boron effectively removed fluoride , which was excreted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . A study by Rex Newman and his colleagues11 attested to the importance of boron in supporting bone and joint health . They noted that in areas where boron consumption was low arthritis rates were high , and areas where boron consumption was high arthritis rates were low . <p> Natural food sources high in boron include almonds , avocados , dates , hazelnuts , prunes , and raisins . If your choice is short-term supplementation to jumpstart everyday consumption of foods high in boron , the use of borax has been shown to be effective in studies without any side-effects . The dosage calls for 1/8 1/4 teaspoon to one liter of water to be sipped throughout the day . <p> These methods work to remove fluoride throughout the body , including the pineal gland in the brain . <p> Applying these various fluoride detoxes together will allow for a more thorough and comprehensive detox across different tissue types and functions throughout the body . 49809 @qwx249809 49806 @qwx249806 49807 @qwx249807 49811 @qwx249811 49810 @qwx249810

No , that is not a picture of an ice-cream maker , it is a pooper . It is for the poop that comes out of you when you go to the bathroom . Be glad when you are pooping every day and is not stopped up for some reason . Pooping , pooping , pooping , become friends with the idea . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> Who would have thought that we should embrace and be comfortable with the thought of pooping ? Okay , yes poop is some nasty smelly stuff that comes out us of , because poop is waste . Because poop is waste , we do n't  talk about the science of it . I cant say that I have had much of a conversation with anyone about pooping . Since I became vegan and cleaned out my system and paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a science to it . Yes I will keep this conversation decent cause I do n't  want anyone talking about my poop ( smile ) . <h> Pooping Every Day : Several Times A Day <p> If you are not pooping every day and several times a day , or a couple of hours after you eat , there is room for concern . Our bodies need to remove poop from our system in a timely matter and if that is not happening it is likely that something is interfering with the digestive process . <p> Once poop stops moving through the system within the normal timeframe it will start to cake up on our intestinal walls and start to back up our digestive track . Two things are the likely culprits if you do n't  have timely poop movements , a lack of fiber in the diet and a not drinking enough water . <p> First , realize that food enters the body , and the unused parts of it need to exit the body . This is the way the body is made . Food moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is broken down into usable parts and the unusable parts must be removed . <p> This is why there is an opening at the other end of the system to let the waste material , the poop out . So now that we have established why and how we poop , let 's look at the timeframe . It has been established that it takes from one to three days for food to move from the mouth to the rectum for the poop to be excreted from the body . So once the eating cycle has started you should have around the same number of poop movements as the number of times you eat a day . <p> This would be optimal to get the poop out of you in a timely fashion . Now things might get in the way of the making bowel movements in sync with the digestive process . You may be at work , at school , or out on the street somewhere and do n't  want to poop there . Your diet also may not have enough you fiber or water in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you may be eating too much dairy and processed foods . Depression and medicines also interfere with normal bowel movements . <h> Not Pooping Every Day : Diverticulitis <p> Once we stop letting the poop out when it is ready to come out , it builds up in the rectum headed backwards towards the large intestine . If you eat a diet high in dairy products , low in water and fiber you can develop constipation , so now you have a buildup of hard to move poop . But let us back up a little bit , no pun intended . Say we do n't  get enough fiber in our diets . Without fiber to add bulk to the stool , the large intestine has to work harder than normal to push the stool forward . <p> The pressure from this may cause pouches to form in weak spots along the large intestine . So what 's the big deal with pouches forming in the large intestine and waste backing up ? This waste buildup promotes disease in the body and can lead to a condition is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming in along the large intestine is that poop will get trapped in them , which will allow bacteria to grow in them . This can lead to inflammation and infection in the large intestine , which will compromise the large intestines ability to move waste through it . This will corrode the intestine and allow bacteria and toxins to escape the intestine and enter the body causing more damage . <p> Seems like a cycle is developing here . The backed up poop in the rectum also starts to build up with harmful bacteria that produce toxins that are harmful to the body . ( Note : Even with me cleaning out my system and gaining increased energy , I find that when I do n't  go poop when my body is calling for me to go , it makes me a little more sluggish . My body is telling me that it is n't comfortable holding this poop and I need to get rid of it . ) <h> How To Combat Poop Buildup <p> We must add more fiber to the diet , especially to the western diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to eat a plant based diet or just add more more vegetables , fruits , nuts , legumes , and grains to your diet . Eating these foods will give you a balance of fiber and nutrients that will promote proper digestion . Drink more water . I drink at least a half gallon of water a day , in addition to my vegetable and fruit juices . <p> Cut down or remove dairy from the diet . Stop eating processed foods because their fiber is removed . Stop eating meat that is flooded with hormones , antibiotics , preservatives and additives that are foreign to the body and disrupt the digestive process . <p> Try to eat organic meat if you are going to eat meat . Stop letting people play God with your food . Eat natural unprocessed foods . The body can only take so much unnatural food before is starts to break down . <p> Do these things will assist you in pooping every day and several times a day and will support your healthy living . 49809 @qwx249809 49806 @qwx249806 49807 @qwx249807 49811 @qwx249811 49810 @qwx249810

I was able to get the results from last years test and was able to compare the pH levels to this year 's results . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> First of all , blood test pH should be between 7.35 and 7.45 . Many take the average and say blood pH should be 7.4 . <p> pH stands for " potential hydrogen " and is the ability of molecules to attract hydrogen ions . 7.0 is neutral on the pH scale . Blood becomes more acidic as you move from 7.0 to 0 , and more alkaline as you move from 7.0 to 14 . I have read some articles that I feel have been a bit extreme in claiming that blood pH dropping to 6.8 means death . If that were true I would n't be writing this article now . <p> The results from my blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet showed that my pH was 6.0 . This year 's pH result was a pH at 6.5 . Yeah my pH had gone up , but I did think it would be much higher , closer to 7.4 . Before I get into why I think the results were n't higher I will like to rebute articles I have read that state that nothing we ingest will change the alkalinity of the blood , because all foods that leave the stomach are acidic because of the highly acidic acid in the stomach . <p> I am adding a copy of my ph results . A person who made a comment below thinks my results ar impossible . I did n't  think there would be a reason to doubt my results so I am adding it so he can see it . <p> Well my pH went up and the thing I changed was that I went on a highly alkalizing vegan diet . So I say , yes alkaline foods raised my pH . Vegetables , fruits , nuts , legumes , alkaline grains , and ionized alkaline water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my results . I was glad my pH level went up , but I was surprised it was still acidic , and not near 7.4 . So right after I read my results I tested my saliva and urine with the pH strips I have , and they tested slightly acidic , between 6.5 and 6.8 . Now I have been testing my pH levels up until about a week and a half before I had my blood-work checked and my saliva and urine were both alkaline , around 7.4 . The only thing I was doing different in that week and a half was eat tons of pistachios , and not that i think about it I was eating less almonds because the pistachios were taking there place . Bad move on my part . The pistachios were n't on my nutritional guide , and sigh , for good reason . Pistachios are slightly acidic forming . Information I found say they are between 6.5 and 7.0 , and I would say closer to 6.5 . So I was adding an acidic food and reducing and alkaline food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a difference . Maybe they would n't have if i was n't eating a bag of pistachios a day . I have always had a thing for pistachios . <p> So I have been off my " crack " pistachios for about a week , and I have cranked my water ionizer back up to produce a higher alkaline water . I had turned it down to a low setting after I took my blood test because I did n't want to over alkalize my body . Yesterday I took a pH reading of my urine and it was close to 7.0 , so it is on the rise . I did n't get to check my saliva pH though . I will continue to stay away from the pistachios , and in a month I am going back in to get another blood test done . Hopefully my pH will be around 7.4 <p> The thing that amazes me is how quickly the urine pH has changed , which I think should be inline with my blood pH . I wonder if it will get to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's pH level longer even when more acidic foods are introduced , or will it always be easily influenced by the acidic foods introduced into my body ? I will check my pH levels closely for the next few days , looking for it to get to 7.4 again . In the meantime I should be able to videotape my boxing workout tomorrow to show my cousin the this vegan " ai n't " scrawny and malnourished . = Some people still have that misconception and need examples that it is n't true . 49809 @qwx249809 49806 @qwx249806 49807 @qwx249807 49811 @qwx249811 49810 @qwx249810

The African bio-mineral balance is a therapeutic approach that addresses disease on two levels . Dr. Sebi refers to his method as either the African Bio-mineral balance or the African Bio Balance. - <p> It first cleanses the body of acidity , on the intracellular level , that compromises the mucous membrane of organs and their health . The breakdown of the protective mucous membrane allows disease to compromise organs and to proliferate throughout the body . <p> The African Bio-mineral Balance is the balance of 102 minerals that properly supports electrical activity and health in the body .

When you consume acidic foods acidic compounds go into the bloodstream and threaten to drop its pH . <p> The body- was designed with natural buffering systems to prevent metabolic acidosis . These systems put alkaline compounds into the blood to counteract acidic compounds . <p> When you constantly consume acidic foods you overwhelm the bodys natural defense- against acidic foods .

The chronic consumption of acidic foods forces the body to strip alkaline material from other areas of the body , which results in chronic metabolic acidosis . <p> Chronic metabolic acidosis does n't  kill you right away but does support the development of chronic diseases like cancer , lupus , osteoporosis , and heart , liver , lung , kidney , and intestinal disease. - <p> The African Bio-mineral Balance supports health and vitality by supplying the body with alkaline compounds that maintain the alkalinity of the blood .

Dr. Sebis methodology is based on the idea that that fluids in the body should be slightly alkaline . The alkalinity level should be around a pH of 7.4 . Keeping the fluids in the body this level creates an inhospitable environment for disease to live in. 49808 @qwx249808 <p> Dr. Vega , and oncologist trained at Johns Hopkins University , demonstrated that an acidic environment paralyzed white blood cells and raising the alkalinity level in the body woke up the dormant immune cells .

Many people do n't  realize that the antithesis of going green is eating a meat-centered diet . You might be thinking , " Oh come on ? How is is eating a meat-centered diet the antithesis of going green ? <p> Let us first understand what going green means . Basically going green means living in a way that is sustainable for the earth . It means living in a way and making decisions that support the health of the ecosystem , so that the ecosystem in-turn can support all life on earth . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> In essence it means leaving the smallest carbon footprint behind as possible . Carbon footprint is the sum of all carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions that result from the industries we create and activities we do . <h> Green House Gases And Climate Change <p> The amount of CO2 industry and people put into the atmosphere is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of green house gases that are in the atmosphere affect the earths temperature . <p> Unfortunately carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas we need to be concerned with . There is also methane . <p> Industrial activities are responsible for the unnatural rise of green house gases in the earths atmosphere , and they are unbalancing the earths ecosystem and are threatening its ability to sustain life on earth . <p> The very delicate balance of green house gases in the atmosphere converts radiation from the sun into heat and maintains a temperature that supports life on earth . <p> The increase in greenhouse gases is unravelling that balance and is allowing the temperature of the earth to rise to a point that will not support humanity and much of the life on earth . <h> The Destruction Of The Ecosystem <p> The going green book , The God-Awakening Diet , details how the reliance on meat-centered diets is forcing the meat industry to devise ways to supply the demand for meat . The processes the meat industry has needed to develop has become the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life on earth . <p> These processes result in deforestation , overuse of fresh water , erosion of land , pollution of the atmosphere , raising and killing a billions of animals every year just in the United States , overuse of fossil fuels , and the overuse of energy . <p> Each one of these actions result in the destruction of the ecosystem and leads to destructive climate change . <h> Deforestation <p> 5 million acres of forests in South and Central America that remove carbon dioxide from the air are cut down each year to provide land for cattle to graze . <p> This results in less carbon dioxide being removed from the atmosphere , and less conversion of carbon dioxide into oxygen for humans and animals to breath . <p> Deforestation also results in the destruction of the natural habitat of many animals and is responsible for 20 percent of all endangered species . <p> A large number of livestock graze on these lands and this has resulted in overgrazing during the last 60 years that has damaged over 85% of the rangeland in the Americas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An incredible amount of nitrogen-based fertilizer has to be used to be able to grow crops on some of the damaged land so that the land does n't  become totally unusable . <h> Slaughtering Of Animals And Overproduction Of Crops <p> Around 10 billion animals are raised and killed every in the U.S. to supply the demand of meat-centered diets . <p> The majority of livestock are raised under horrific conditions in factory farms . It takes a lot of grain to feed billions of animals a year and 70% of the grain production goes to feeding them . In contrast , there are only around 300 million people in the U.S. <p> It would take far less grain to feed a U.S. population that consumed a diet centered on grains and other plant foods . This is a very important point because around 80% of the fresh water used in the U.S. goes to watering crops that we do n't  eat , but goes to feeding and raising animals . <h> Water Crisis <p> Presently we are suffering a water crisis out West and in the Mid-West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mega-drought would occur over the next 30 years and will be the worst drought seen in the U.S. in a thousand years . <p> This is happening because of the overuse of fresh water needed to not only to grow crops that are mainly used to feed billions of animals , but is also used for the animals to drink . 80-90% the fresh water used goes to grow crops and raise livestock . <h> Fossil Fuel Use <p> The amount of fossil fuel needed to raise livestock is staggering . The energy used to produce 1kcal of meat is around 11 times that what is needed to produce 1 kcal of grain . The burning of the fossil fuel also contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions . Livestock production produces more greenhouse gas emissions than transportation does . <p> All of this destruction being done to the earth and its ecosystem is being done to satisfy that demand of meat-centered diets . The welfare of humanity rests on humanity going green immediately . <h> God/The Source/Nature <p> People have been conditioned by a business paradigm that keeps people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the planet . <p> Too many people have been conditioned to see themselves only as individuals and not as being part of a collective . <p> It is ever so important that people break free of this paradigm and come to the realization that they are part of the unifying force the permeates everything animate and inanimate thing on the earth . This unifying force is also permeates the entire universe . <p> In my book , The God-Awakening Diet , I coined the term God/The Source/Nature to refer to this unifying force in and attempt to encompass all views that recognize this order in life in one way or another . <p> It urgent that people come to the understanding that a great part of their purpose in life is to be caretakers of the earth , and yes believe it that a plant-centered diet and not a meat-centered diet is the way to bring the balance of God/The Source/Nature back into the world . <p> Meat consumption in itself is not the problem .

I ate a lot of candy and a lot of junk food , and I did n't  visit the dentist often . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> I did visit the dentist when a tooth decayed so badly that I had to have it pulled . So just imagine the state of my gums . I am playing catch up now , and I am doing all I can to strengthen my gums and teeth by oil pulling . <p> I did some searching for different ways to naturally improve the health of my gums and teeth and I came upon oil pulling . The idea behind oil pulling was simple and I already had what I needed , so there was nothing for me to lose and I gave it a try . <p> Oil Pulling is a method of fighting disease in Indian Ayurvedic traditional medicine that has existed for thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . <p> Oil pulling is mentioned in the Ayurvedic text Charaka Samhita , and is called Kavala Gandoosha or Kavala Graha , and is described as being able to improve oral hygiene and systemic diseases such as diabetes , asthma . <p> Traditionally oil pulling has been used to prevent tooth decay , strengthen gums , teeth , and jaws . It has also been used to treat arthritis , blood diseases , bronchitis , eczema , headaches , intestinal disorders , kidney , liver , and lung issues , nervous conditions , and ulcers . <h> How To Do Oil Pulling ? <p> Oil pulling is performed by swishing oil around the mouth , without swallowing it . You swish and push the oil around the mouth and tongue , and through the teeth . <p> When oil pulling , you will pull mucus from the back of the throat and your sinuses will clear . This action will also pull food debris , plaque , bacteria , and toxic waste from the mouth , teeth , gums , and bloodstream . <p> It is very important not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic waste from the body and you do n't  want to introduce it back into the body . <p> Spit the oil into the toilet and not into the sink , because the oil can solidify in the pipes of your sink and clog your sink . <p> After you have finished and have spit the oil into the toilet , rinse your mouth out with water afterwards to remove residual oil left in the mouth . <p> I like to use unrefined coconut oil because of its antiviral and antimicrobial properties . Coconut oil contains the medium chain fatty acid lauric acid , which is primarily responsible for coconut oils antiviral and antimicrobial properties , and it assists with the cleansing process . <p> Oil pulling should be performed for 10-20 minutes preferably on am empty stomach , and can be performed 1-3 times a day . For people who lead fast paced lives , oil pulling in the morning before breakfast , or in the night before you go to bed might be easier . <p> Though it is better to oil pull on en empty stomach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling at all . <p> Oil pulling has removed most of the darker spots from my gums , made them pinker and tighter to give my teeth more support . Oil pulling has also alleviated my gum and jaw tenderness and pain , and it stopsed plaque from building on my teeth . <p> Oil pulling really struck home for me after I recommended to someone who an abscess and a serious toothache . After a day of oil pulling with coconut oil most of her pain disappeared , and by the second day her pain and abscess were gone .

It has made me wonder , " Should you- soak almonds before eating them ? " <h> Why Do You Soak Almonds ? <p> The general consensus of alternative medicine it soak and sprout nut and seeds to unleash their full nutritional value by activating their enzymes . <p> I must say I do n't  soak almonds all the time , but I do soak them half the time and I have reasons for doing this . <h> Soaked Almonds Nutritional Value <h> Activates Almond Enzymes And Improves Digestion <p> The number one reason to soak almonds is to sprout them and activate their enzymes .

It generally takes between one and three days for the almonds to sprout . <p> Yes it makes sense to make digesting almonds easier by activating their enzymes . Some people will make- - blanket statements saying you waste the- nutrients- is you do n't  soak the almonds. - I do n't  agree with this . <p> Our bodies have their own enzymes that digest the almonds and break them down into their components . <p> You might lose some nutritional value if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than saying their is- no nutritional value in eating un-soaked almonds . <p> Now if we do n't  soak the almonds and remove the skin , the phytates- in the skin can interfere with digestion. - The concern is phytates can bind - with iron and zinc and reduce their absorption into the blood . <p> The reality is this concern is overblown and misinformation stops many people from repeating the benefits of phytates . The studies that supported - the anti-nutrient ability of almonds involved- people who basically lived off grains and had a nutrient deficient diet . <p> Yes , this was problematic because the lack of nutrients in their diets made the high amount of phytates they consumed from grains problematic . - <p> We should n't overlook phytates because they kill cancer through all of their pathways , and make cancer cells act like normal cells. 1 Phytates also protect against osteoporosis , 2 and possess anti-inflammatory properties. - <p> In the defense of soaking almonds , it does make almonds softer and easier to chew . <h> What They Do n't  Tell You About Raw Almonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process kills the enzymes . To avoid this people eat raw almonds .

I did n't  feel like overdoing it and push myself to where I was n't comfortable , so I just accepted that we would n't be pulling up to the store together . <p> Though Ed was out in front of me , I was able to see when he pulled into the bike store 's parking lot . I knew he was going to tell me he was waiting for me for a long time , so I just played it cool . When I pulled up I spoke with Ed , " Good ride , you were moving ! How long have you been here ?

" LOL , I could see in his eyes that he was trying to figure out if I really did ( smile ) . I also let Ed know that his heavy sweating was also a give away that he just pulled up before I did ( smile ) . He had a great ride though .

I tried all kinds of diets and fit in exercise whenever I could but it simply was n't enough . I did n't  start consistently losing weight until I decided to go all in and try a completely plant-based diet . <p> Now that I 've switched to a plant-based diet I 'm healthier than Ive ever been , with lots of energy for exercise as well as for my kids . Its been a tough journey " eating out is all but impossible " but I know its worth it because I feel great every day . 49808 @qwx249808 <h> Why Does A Plant Based Diet Work ? <p> Plant-based diets are effective because they flood your body with nutrients without loading you down with extra calories . A plant-based diet does n't  have any empty calories to speak of and the high levels of nutrients in most fruits/vegetables will ensure that you have a constant supply of energy . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can happen even if you 've gotten your entire caloric intake for the day . Its why you do n't  really feel satisfied after eating at a fast-food restaurant . If you fill your body only with the healthiest foods available you 'll actually be full after every meal . <p> A plant-based diet is also a long term commitment . Month long diet plans and detoxes do n't  work because you end up reverting to your original diet once the month is up . Switching to a plant-based diet is a complete lifestyle change , one that gets easier to maintain instead of harder . <h> Vegetarian Or Vegan ? <p> Most people think becoming a vegetarian will automatically make them healthier and help them lose weight , but I learned the hard way that this is n't true . A vegetarian diet can easily be as unhealthy and fattening as a regular North American diet . This is because many people who become vegetarian often eat larger amounts of other animal products " usually dairy " to get their protein and fill their bellies . <p> Unfortunately dairy products and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . These fats contribute to all kinds of health issues and are highly concentrated in egg yolks , cheese , and pure milk products . <p> A vegan diet also forces you to avoid a lot of the unhealthy carbs that a vegetarian person still eats ( and might even eat more of to replace meat ) . Switching to a completely plant-based diet means that you absolutely have to eat the healthiest options available " everything else has animal products in it ! <h> How To Lose Weight With Your Plant-Based Diet <p> Of course , switching to a plant-based diet still wo n't automatically help you lose weight . You 'll probably lose a little weight , but if you do n't  do it properly youll hit a plateau very quickly or end up gaining the weight back . <h> Follow these tips to maximize your weight loss : <p> DO NT just fill up with substitutes As tempting ( and tasty ) as they might be , soy substitutes for meat and cheese are n't  going to help you lose weight . Most of these products are high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and can cause other health issues . <p> DO cut back on sugar Getting rid of meat and dairy will go a long way towards helping you lose weight but its still important to watch out for your sugar . Some of this will happen naturally " a lot of cheap desserts have animal products in them " but you should be consciously aware of all the sugar going into your diet . Limit it as much as you can without feeling totally deprived . Avoid fruit juice at all costs . This is one of the easiest ways to undermine your weight loss goals as most juice has as much sugar as pop and not much more in the way of nutrients . <p> DO NT avoid nuts Nuts are full of fats , but they 're actually the healthy fats you need to maintain a stable weight and keep control of your body . Most nuts also contain incredibly high concentrations of a range of vitamins and minerals . Some , like almonds , even qualify as a superfood . <p> DO drink lots of water Water helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day and fill your belly so you 're less tempted to overeat . Drink at least six glasses every day . <p> DO NT obsess over the scale The truth is that the number of pounds is not a reliable way to judge weight . Muscle is heavier than fat , so if you 're gaining a lot of muscle you can actually gain weight but lose inches around your waist . Focus on the number of inches you want to lose instead of the amount of pounds you want to lose and make sure you 're not checking your scale more than once a week.Becoming vegan is n't easy at first , especially if you also have to worry about nutrition for growing kids , but it gets easier every day and your whole family will reap the rewards .

The methods used can be very tricky and can muddy the truth . There are two issues here . One is the effect genetically modifying crops ( soy ) have on the body , though we are examining issue two . The second issue is a reason why soy crops are being genetically modified . In this case the reason for genetically modifying soy is so it can be resistant to the Monsanto Roundup herbicide that is sprayed on it . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> The Monsanto Roundup herbicide is a very strong pesticide used to kill weeds and genetic modification of soy allows it to be resistance to Roundup .

Dr. Gregers video below carefully examines the effects of Roundup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredient in Roundup and the legal level for residue levels of glyphosate in foods had been at .1 to .2 milligrams per kilogram . The residue levels of glyphosate found in GMO soy crops exceed the legal limits by an average of two thousand percent . ( It important to note that organic and conventional soy both had no levels of glyphosate ) . Something had to be done to get the residue levels within legal limits , and something was done . <p> Pesticide industries were able to convince countries to raise the maximum levels of residue glyphosate to 20 mg/kg which solved their problem . This is where some of the trickery comes into play . <p> For many years there has been evidence that roundup interferes with embryonic development , may disrupt hormones , and interferes with male fertility , but these have been animal studies and the same effect might not occur in human samples . This left doubt that glyphosate and Roundup had the same effect on human cells as they did on animal cells . <p> So now tests were done using glyphosate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredient in Roundup a test was done on human cells using the isolated glyphosate ingredient and the test showed that glyphosate did n't  seem to have much of a toxic effect on human cells , even at high doses . This supported Monsantos and other herbicide companies claim that glyphosate was not harmful . Monsanto could now use this information to support the use of GMO soy and the use of Roundup that is used to protect the GMO soy crop . <p> The thing is Roundup is not only made up of glyphosate . Roundup is made up of other chemical ingredients that help the glyphosate penetrate cells . When the same study was repeated using Roundup it found that it did have harmful toxic and hormonal effects on the human cells , even at doses less than what is used to spray on crops . Roundup was found to be 125 times more toxic than its active ingredient glyphosate , and was among the most toxic pesticide product tested .

By itself curcumin is not easily absorbed into the bloodstream , but scientists have found two ways to have it be more easily absorbed into the bloodstream . One is to take it with a concentrated amounts of piperine , the alkaloid from black pepper , but there is concern by many that the concentrated levels needed can be toxic . <p> I would stay away from curcumin products that contain piperine . I do n't  use the curcumin products that use piperine <p> The second way to have the curcumin absorbed into the bloodstream is to take it with a fatty oil . I use either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best oil we can use , and it has great antiviral and antibacterial properties .

Let 's Reduce The Mucus ! <h> Excessive Phlegm <p> Excessive phlegm in the throat can be irritating , but understand that some mucus in itself is not a bad thing . - There is mucous membrane lining body parts throughout the body that serves to protect them . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> The nose produces mucus to trap diseases and environmental toxins breathed in so they do n't  cause harm to the body . Normally the mucus trickles down the throat without us being aware of it . This is a necessary and healthy process . <p> Excessive phlegm in the throat this a sign that toxins have compromised the mucous membrane in the nostrils . <p> The thick mucus in the throat and nostrils is the result of the bodys increase of its inflammatory process . <p> The inflammatory process is part of the bodys immune system which sends out fluids , proteins , and white blood cells ( neutrophils , eosinophils , and or macrophages ) , and pro-inflammatory cells to isolate the tissue to kill the offending disease and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the throat , it is a sign that you have a weakened mucus membrane in the nose . The mucus drains from the nostrils and- builds up in throat and lungs . This also triggers inflammatory responses in those areas . <h> How To Remove Excessive Phlegm In The Throat ? <p> Killing and washing away the diseases and toxins that compromised the mucus membrane of the nasal passage is a good way to start . An excellent way to do this is to wash the nasal passage with warm salt water . The warm salt water kills disease that compromised the mucus membrane. - It helps to loosen and move the excessive phlegm and toxins out of the nasal passage . <p> I use the neti pot and I love the way it works to flush out thick mucus . It fits nice and snug so water does n't  drip out of the spout . To use the neti pot fill it with the required amount of salt and warm water . <p> Though the neti pot comes with salt packages , I prefer to use non-processed salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not to use tap water and to use distilled , purified water , or bottled water instead . <p> Hold your head sideways over a sink , place the spout in one nostril and slowly pure the salt water into your nostril .

Removing mucus causing foods and increasing the consumption of alkaline foods on the Dr. Sebi nutritional guide assists with this . <p> Dairy is the biggest offender in supporting the formation of excess mucus in the body , but the acidifying nature of meat and processed foods also promote excess mucus formation and inflammation . <p> Herbs like elderberry and mullein not only help remove excessive phlegm from the throat and nostrils , they also dissolve and remove excessive mucus from the entire body . 49809 @qwx249809 49806 @qwx249806 49807 @qwx249807 49811 @qwx249811 49810 @qwx249810 
@@25231518 @5231518/ <h> Dr. Sebi Review <h> Methodology Review <p> I must say I was skeptical when stumbled upon Dr. Sebi and his claims to be able to cure AIDS , diabetes , sickle cell , lupus , arthritis , herpes , epilepsy , and different forms of cancer . These claims would be hard for anyone to believe and would be easy for anyone to dismiss . <p> I decided to not focus on his claims , ad I scrutinized his methodology heavily as I studied it . Focusing on his claims would have discouraged me from finding the truth in his claims . <p> I had been stricken with congestion issues , including pneumonia , the flu , colds , and sinus congestion my whole life and I was at my wits end fighting an on and off cold for 3 weeks when I stumbled on some information about the herbalist . <p> His claims seemed outlandish but I stayed focused and learned about his methodology . Studying his methodology , and other peoples information on the same subject , his methodology made sense to me and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost me anything but some time and dedication . <p> I was blessed to have been directed to the herbalist- and the benefits of a plant-based diet . This path has revitalized me , has me regain my youth , and has led me to understand the benefits of a plant-based diet in detail . <p> As a result of this journey I have attained in certificate in plant-based nutrition , spread the knowledge of the benefits of a plant-based diet and have written the book The God-Awakening Diet which explores the relationship between mankind , the Most High , the food we choose to eat and its impact it has on the life of the planet . <h> The Methodology Explained <p> The methodology does not follow Western sciences approach to curing disease , which focuses primarily developing synthetic acidic drugs to attack pathogens and toxins in the body . <p> His methodology is that of the view of traditional medicine that has been used for thousands of years , and was actually passed on to him by a Mexican herbalist who cured him of obesity , diabetes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply feed the immune system what it needs to be strong to protect the body against pathogens and toxins , while removing the consumption of pathogenic and toxin laden foods that weakens it . <p> The constant consumption of acidic and pathogen laden foods weakens the immune system . The body then increases mucus production to protect itself against the acidity and pathogens . The chronic acidity and mucus buildup leads to the development of chronic inflammation . Chronic inflammation leads to the breakdown of the organs . The breakdown of the organs leaves them susceptible to pathogens and toxins . <p> The whole cycle starts with an acidic body . In general plant foods are either alkaline or alkaline forming in the body , while meat , dairy , and processed foods are acidic or acidic forming in the body . <p> The oncologist Dr. Vega demonstrated this principle by examining the blood of his patients he treated for cancer . Dr.Vega gave his cancer patients enough goji berry juice to raise their pH to 7.4 , all of whom were very acidic beforehand . <p> He examined his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their blood samples were full of uric acid and pathogens because the acidic environment paralyzed the white blood cells and they werent able to do their job of seek , destroy , and remove of disease in the body . <p> Once his patients had consumed enough goji berry juice over a few days to raise their urine to a pH of 7.4 Dr. Vega took blood samples and found that the alkaline environment reactivated the white blood and jumpstarted the immune seek to seek , destroy , and remove pathogens and toxins . <p> On top of the destructive cycle I described , the consumption of acidic foods promote high concentrations of hydrogen in the bloodstream , which interferes with proper oxygen delivery that is needed to support metabolic processes and energy production . <h> Legal Support Of The Methodology <p> He was able to beat the case by having people he cured of diseases appear in court and provide medical documentation that he actually cured them . He needed 9 people to provide documentation but instead 72 people showed up with documentation . <p> Dr. Sebi Review : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court ruling his methodology gets a " double " thumbs up ! <h> Herbal Product Review <p> After the Mexican herbalist cured Dr. Sebi of his illnesses he was instructed that he should look to herbs that had chemical affinity with the African body . <p> The African body would more easily digest those herbs to bolster than immune system and flood the body with phytonutrients that would protect against disease , just like plants use the phytonutrients to protect themselves against disease . <p> The good thing about these compounds is that they are universal and help to protect everyone , not only Africans . He was able to identify herbs sold by African villagers to support health and vitality . <p> He took those herbs to a lab for analysis and if the active ingredient in the plant herb addressed the disease it was supposed to , he knew he was on to something . <p> These African herbs , as well as the herbs of Central and South American tropical climates , have been used for thousands of years to support health and vitality. * It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people are totally consumed by the paradigm of Western medicine . <p> I have successfully used herbs that are part of the herbs he- uses in his products to support my health and vitality ! Herbs like burdock root , yellow dock , sarsaparilla , santa maria , and many more . <p> He sells two categories of herbal products , his cell food products and his therapeutic packages . Dr. Sebis cell food products are geared towards general cleaning of the body and consist of the following products . <p> You can purchase the " cell food " products online ranging from $18 to $50 , and are used to support general maintenance . The one exception is the Small Cleansing Package that costs $250 that can be bought online . The small cleansing package contains a limited amount of the compounds that the therapeutic packages contain , but it does n't  cleanse as extensively as the therapeutic packages . <p> Dr. Sebi review : Cell food products get an energetic thumbs up ! <h> Therapeutic Packages <p> The therapeutic packages can not be purchased online , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning package and the cell food products . The therapeutic packages are put together to cleanse the body down to the intra-cellular level . Some of the cell food products are included in the therapeutic packages , like banju or bio ferro , depending on the illness being addressed . <p> Though I believe in the efficacy of the therapeutic packages , the cost of the therapeutic packages could be problematic for many people . The cost of the packages are as follows : $375.00 , $575.00 , $750.00 , $1500.00 ( per month ) . <p> Ideally you would want to buy the $1500 package if you are targeting chronic diseases like heart disease , auto-immune diseases , sickle-cell , or cancer for instance . The $1500 is a combination of all the herbs in their strongest doses used to address these more serious conditions . <p> Spending this type of money can be problematic not only for one month , but especially over several months . If herbs were covered under medical insurance people would be lining up to try the therapeutic packages , but securing this amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is a difficult choice to make to purchase one of the less expensive therapeutic packages , which consist of less products , because they might not address the problem as well as the more expensive package would . <p> Dr. Sebi Review:The price of the most effective therapeutic package is steep , but the efficacy of the herbs in the package is real . If you can afford it , go for it . <p> -+ Customized Therapeutic Packages <p> The therapeutic packages are marketed on the website as being designed for each individual patient . When ordering the therapeutic packages you will find that the packages largely consist of the same products regardless of the chronic disease you are targeting . <p> The reason for this is the basic treatment for chronic diseases is the same . Depending on the severity of the chronic disease and how long you had been afflicted by it , you would either receive a higher concentration of herbs and a slight variety of herbs which would determine which price range for the therapeutic package that would be suggested for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more encompassing $1500 therapeutic package can be an overwhelming thing to do , especially since it would take several packages over a period of months to address the illnesses . <p> For instance the Mexican herbalist who cured Dr. Sebi of diabetes , obesity , impotence , and eye illness did so over a period of ninety days . During that time he drank the highly alkaline thermal waters at the Usha Village , juice fasted , and consumed the therapeutic herbs . <p> Purchasing the most expensive and most effective therapeutic package can be an overwhelming thing to do , especially when several months supply of the the package will be needed . For the treatment of severe chronic disease it is best to visit the Usha Village . <p> I purchased the $1500 package for a client and though the therapeutic package was individually customized there was n't that much difference from other $1500 packages . <p> The main difference was the concentration of certain herbs that would have a greater impact in addressing the particular ailment I ordered the package for . <p> I understood thataddressing of chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs or a higher concentration of herbs would be needed to address different diseases . <p> Others who were not as educated as to how the herbs work might question the ability of the herbs to treat their specific issues . <p> I think when ordering the packages , the way the therapeutic packages work in supporting health and vitallity could be presented in a clearer way . A more comprehensive answer could have been offered when asking for clarification about the difference in costs between the various therapeutic packages , and why one package would be recommended over another package . <h> Cancer Treatment Is Different <p> The only chronic disease I feel is different is cancer , but the diet and herbal methodology is geared towards addressing this pathway also . <p> Cancer is different from other chronic diseases in that with cancer the DNA of cells become mutated , while other chronic diseases involve a breakdown of metabolic functions caused by pathogens or toxins . <p> Cells affected by pathogens or toxins can be cleaned or destroyed by the body if necessary , and new cells are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary components that trigger a cells natural death , and this allows them to continue their unnatural replication that ends up taking over the body . <p> There are herbs in the therapeutic package that can trigger cancer cell death but the process takes longer than cleansing cells effected by pathogens and toxins , like diabetes , or lupus . <p> The success of addressing cancer using herbs definitely depends on keeping pathogenic and toxic foods out of the body on a long term basis , while allowing herbs and their phytonutrients to help trigger cell death in cancer cells . <p> I examined cancer testimonials involving the use of therapeutic packages it appeared the use of the more expensive therapeutic package can quickly stop cancer from growing if the person is eating a proper diet . <p> Though the herbs can quickly stop the replication of cancer cells , it does normally take longer for the herbs to cause cancer cell death . <h> Usha Healing Village <p> The Usha Village presents Dr. Sebi with an advantage many herbal practitioners do not have . This is what really sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has natural high alkaline thermal spring water in the village that he supplies his visitors with for bathing , saunas , and drinking water . <p> This water has a high ability to quickly and naturally heal the body .

A minimum stay of 2 weeks is suggested . You should call the office for pricing .

I know becoming a vegan was one of the most important things I have done in my life . It is important though to have a good understanding of the best way to approach becoming a vegan to have a successful transition . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> I must clarify that when I speak of how to become a vegan , I am strictly talking about the diet aspect of becoming a vegan . I am speaking about eating a whole food plant-based diet . In the strictest terms vegans only a plant-based diet , and also do n't  use any animal products . A person who lives this lifestyle is often called an ethical vegan . A person who only eats a plant-based diet only is often referred to as a dietary vegan . I am a dietary vegan , but I am also totally against animal cruelty . <p> Now that I have clarified that , the next thing you will need to understand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you will get your protein on a vegan diet . You will inevitably get this question , " But where do you get your protein ? " You do not have to worry about getting enough protein as long as you eat a well balanced diet , which is really not difficult to do . All plant based life contains protein , some just more than others . <p> Some people will think that you will become weak if you become vegan , because they think you cant get enough protein eating a vegan diet . This is not true . I became a vegan when I was 44 years old and now I am 47 years old . I have gotten stronger , more energetic , and my endurance has increased . <p> I have even returned to boxing and I spar against guys in their twenties . They are amazed that I can do what I do at my age , and because I am a vegan . I can only do what I am doing at my age because I am vegan . The reality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be from protein and I am able to easily satisfy that requirement eating nuts , seeds , and some grains . <p> Since I became a vegan I have lost 30 pounds and I have kept it off without any struggle . That was 30 pounds of unhealthy weight that made me lethargic mentally and physically . The best thing is I havent been sick in those 3 years , not even a cold , and I was frequently sick before adopting a vegan diet. * <p> So on the path of learning how to become a vegan you now understand what the term " vegan " means , and you know that you can get all the protein you need from a vegan diet . The next thing you will need to know and understand is that you must have patience . Becoming a vegan will detox your body and your body will have to remove harmful substances during a deep and long process , though you should see change right away . <p> This is done through the body excreting toxin laden urine , stool , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vegan " cold turkey " which is more difficult because your body will not be used to the sudden change , and the harmful organisms in your body will fight harder to remain alive and will work to keep your body unhealthy by polluting it with toxins . <p> It can be done though , but it may be more difficult . You can also choose to increase your fruit , vegetable , nut , seed , and grain consumption while reducing your meat , dairy , and processed food consumption , with the goal of completely adopting a vegan diet . <p> You may want to give yourself a 3 month goal of switching completely to a vegan diet . Once you have come to terms with these things , you are at the point of learning the practice of " how to become a vegan ? " This question revolves around what foods to eat . The healthiest vegan diet is a whole food plant-based diet . There are unhealthy vegans out there because they eat a lot of processed and junk vegan foods .

Unfortunately , on average we are only consuming 14-15 grams of fiber a day in our fiber deprived western diets . High-fiber diets containing vegetables and fruits tend to contain more nutrients and fewer calories , and lower blood cholesterol levels , prevent constipation , are digested more slowly , and help us feel full longer . <p> High fiber foods reduce the risk of colon cancer . <p> High fiber foods help prevent the formation of intestinal pouches ( diverticula ) which trap waste in the colon and produce toxins which are the introduced in the bloodstream and entire body . <p> Juicing vegetables and fruits removes the fiber we need to promote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nutrients Through the Small Intestine <p> Juicing vegetables and fruits does allow nutrients to be more easily absorbed through the walls of the small intestine and into the bloodstream .

This harmful mucus-like material and food residue coat the small intestine making it more difficult to absorb nutrients from the foods passing through the small intestine . Juicing may help the mucoid lined small intestine absorb more nutrients , which is beneficial in the short-run , but the lack of fiber helps to promote continual building of the mucoid condition , which hurts us in the long-run . <p> Blending and juicing both beak down the veggies and fruits into smaller pieces which makes it easier for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing smaller pieces to breakdown , and it also provides the very needed fiber to help clean the digestive track . <h> Blending Makes You Feel Fuller Longer Than Juicing <p> Since blended vegetables and fruits contain fiber , they take longer to digest than juiced vegetables and fruits , but they do n't  take as long to digest as chewed vegetables and fruits . This seems like a good balance . By blending you are easing the digestive process , by making it easier for the body to breakdown the food , and by making more nutrients available to the body .

Protein is vitally important for our health and if we do n't  get adequate amounts of protein in our diets we can die from health related issues . Okay , yes it is true protein is vitally important to our health , but we do n't  need to get protein from meat . I eat a plant-based diet and literally the first question I get is , " Where do you get your protein from ? " 49808 @qwx249808 <p> I expect this question because we have purposely been socialized to think this way to promote the sale of meat . Meat is not the only source of protein . All foods contain protein , and yes that includes plant-based foods . <p> The argument has been made supporting the idea that we should get our protein from meat because it contains complete proteins and that its protein is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does show that the makeup of protein compounds in animals is more closely related to the protein makeup in humans which allows our bodies to use animal protein more efficiently . <p> During the early periods of the study of protein in plants researchers thought that plants did n't  contain all the animo acids ( proteins ) we needed so animal-based protein was thought to be superior to plant-based protein . One reason for this was all the funding and studies went into identifying and reinforcing the idea that animal-based protein was superior . <p> As more funding became available to do more comprehensible studies on protein in plants it was realized that plants contain complete proteins also , but just not in the same ratio as animal-based protein do . Yes animal-based proteins do contain these proteins ( amino acids ) in ratios that are more closely related to that of the human body , and this is why the body uses animal-based protein more efficiently . Though animal-based proteins are used more efficiently , it is still important to know plant life does contain these amino acids also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better than consuming plant-based proteins because they are used more efficiently by our bodies . Proponents of selling animal-based products pushed this idea because the consumption protein was looked upon as the best way to combat malnutrition , and the use of animal-based products was thought to be the best way to combat malnutrition and to protect health . <p> Studies show that the bodys more efficient use animal-based protein it not the better thing for the body . Yes , since animal-based protein more closely resembles the protein structure of our bodies it is more efficient in supporting and enhancing the growth of our bodies . The consumption of animal-based protein helps to make us bigger faster . <p> This accelerated growth does not only apply to the growth of our bodies , but also the growth and cancer in our bodies . Studies show the makeup of animal-based protein also supports the growth of cancer cells in the body . Cancer feeds off the particular makeup of animal-based protein far more efficiently than it does with plant-based protein . <p> Studies show that as we increase our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our total calories , cancer increases exponentially . Studies have shown that the increase of the consumption of plant-based protein even up to 20% does not support cancer development in the body . The reason attributed to this is since the amino acids of plant-based foods are not in the same ratio and makeup as the body , the body uses the amino acids less efficiently which allows the body to control growth . <p> This does n't  mean plant-based foods do n't  support healthy living , because they do . The consumption of plant-based protein and food just controls overall growth better than the consumption of animal-based protein and food .

Science supports that the predecessors of the modern human originated in Africa and had access to the same vegetation food sources as gorillas and chimpanzees . <p> Since we know that vegetation and fruits are the natural staple of gorillas and chimpanzees in Africa then it would seem likely that it would also be the staple of the diet for Paleo man in Africa . For one thing , it is just easier to walk up to a tree or plant and pull off some leaves or fruit because they will not run away . Secondly , animals will run away or attack you to preserve their own lives , which would jeopardize your life and make it much harder to feed yourself and your family . <p> Now there is also the theory that along with this Paleo man and woman in Africa who are the predecessors of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eating habits of Neanderthals were likely different from the Paleo man who ran the plains of Africa , because the Neanderthals may have had to resort to eating more meat since they may have had less access to fruits and vegetables in the mountains of Europe . <p> One theory is the " more " modern human beings in Africa travelled out of Africa in small numbers and interbred with some of the Neanderthals , while the other lesser evolved Neanderthals eventually died off . <p> Another theory is there were large migrations out of Africa and the more culturally and technologically advanced modern humans outcompeted the Neanderthals for resources and the Neanderthals died off . In both scenarios it would appear the eating habits of the more advanced humans would also win out , or become more widespread . <p> Though I do feel there is some merit to what is currently termed the Paleo Diet , I think the heavy emphasis on meat and lack of emphasis on carbohydrates does not paint the true picture of the actually Paleo Diet . It paints a picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low carbohydrate diet which is more likely how Neanderthal men and women ate might be a contributing factor as to why are extinct . <h> The Good And Bad Of The Modern Paleo Diet <p> What is compelling about the modern Paleo Diet is its emphasis on removing processed foods and dairy from the diet . This concept is shared by people who eat a whole food plant based diet . Processed foods include genetically modified organisms and toxins that are detrimental to our healthy living . Dairy also undermines our healthy living by supporting excess mucus buildup in the body and its casein protein is linked to increased risk of cancer and other illnesses . <p> The Paleo Diet emphasizes eating lean meat to get the necessary amount of protein and fat it feels the body requires , but it is clearly demonstrated by numerous healthy people who eat a plant based diet that they can can get all the protein and fat they need from plant based foods . Diets that consist of more than 10% of animal protein promote an increased risk of cancer an other illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consumption of vegetable protein does n't  pose the same risk . <p> The Paleo Diet avoids grains and promotes a low carbohydrate diet because grains are a form of carbohydrates and some grains have a negative effect on the body . Grains like " common wheat " compromise our health not because they are inherently bad for us , but because much of the grain we consume is hybridized and in this instance it compromises its nutritional value . <p> The recent problems with gluten intolerance and other gluten related diseases is not due to the natural makeup of wheat and other grains , but it is the hybridization and sometimes genetic manipulation of the grains that make it foreign to our bodies and causes it to compromise our health . <p> Promoting a low carbohydrate diet because of this problem only creates more problems . Not all carbohydrates are the same and we need carbohydrates to support healthy living . The Paleo Diet should not generalize and promote a low carbohydrate diet , but it should specifically call for minimization of grain consumption and the total avoidance of hybridized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are our energy sources and we need both . <p> Too much fat in the diet is linked to numerous health conditions , so we need to get the majority of our energy from carbohydrates . Fruits and vegetables are major sources carbohydrates and the Paleo Diets calling for minimizing carbohydrate consumption unfortunately leads some people to minimize their consumption of fruits and vegetables when they should be the main staple of their diets . We have a genetic disposition towards fruits and vegetables and rely on them heavily keep our bodies in a state of homeostasis . Nuts , seeds , some legumes , and some grains also support this homeostasis. 49809 @qwx249809 49806 @qwx249806 49807 @qwx249807 49811 @qwx249811 49810 @qwx249810

He developed and used hemp oil to treat his own illnesses and through his compassion helped others to do the same . He provided us the method to produce hemp oil . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> Hemp and marijuana are two different types of the cannabis sativa plant . Hemp is grown to be high in CBD cannabinoids , which does n't  get you high , and marijuana is high in THC which does get you high . This " benefits of marijuana and healing properties and components " chart explains the healing properties of the different cannabinoid compounds . <p> Rick Simpsons oil have been shown to be very ineffective in treating disease , but the process involves a solvent to strip the cannabinoids from the plant . Some argue this is wasteful because the whole plant is n't being using , and the process can be harmful to the cannabinoid compounds . <p> Other methods like making cannabis paste have been used which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I personally would prefer using the whole plant , but I think it is important to also understand Rick Simpson method because it has been shown to work . Rick Simpson explains his method of making hemp oil : <p> In the interest of allowing the common man to produce the highest quality and most medicinal oils possible , I have discovered a simple method that will enable just about everyone to produce oils with even more effective medicinal values than I have showed the public in the past . All you actually have to do is add a few more steps to the process we have already showed you , but after you produce oil in this manner I think you will agree that it does make a tremendous difference . <p> If you have high quality medicinal bud to work with , you should be able to manufacture oils with very high cannabinoid levels , simply by using a good solvent and a rice cooker . Oils that I produced in this manner usually showed THC levels of 95% or more along with varying levels of other cannabinoids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this are what has finally given the cannabis hemp plant the medical recognition it deserves , but still I have found that the healing power of this substance can be taken to a whole new level without much difficulty . <p> All you have to do is take the oil and put it in a heating unit that can catch the cannabinoids as they vaporize off and this will produce oils of higher quality and purity . Although an ordinary vaporizer can accomplish this task , in truth they are not designed properly to fulfill this role , since it would take so long to produce any amount of medication and most vaporizers which are available tend to leak . <p> To produce oil on a larger scale one would require a much larger vaporizing unit which was airtight and it would also necessitate the use of a much larger collection dome that is set on an angle , so that once the cannabinoids started to collect they would begin to run down to the dome 's lowest point , where they could be collected from a small drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyone who is mechanically inclined should not have too much trouble putting together a unit to perform this task , but it will take a little time and effort to assemble the device . <p> The amount of oil which can be collected after it has been vaporized depends on what cannabinoid percentage by weight that the original starting oil had . If the oil you are using had 99% cannabinoids by weight , then you should get roughly that amount back after it has been vaporized . <p> I should also mention that this is a great way to improve the quality of lower grade oils which have a lot of impurities , so they may be used as a more powerful and effective medication . Even a starting oil with much lower cannabinoid content may produce a decent medication , if the cannabinoids are vaporized off and the impurities are left behind in the bowl . <p> You may not get out as much as you put in , but at least you will end up with an oil that is much more medicinal than what you started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine 's purity and effectiveness mean everything to the patient , so if you wish to produce the most medicinal oils possible , I think you should give what I am saying some serious consideration . <p> As yet , I can not explain why oils produced in this manner are so much more medicinally active than even the best oils which have been produced using other methods . Since the oils that I have vaporized had been decarboxylated before they even went into the vaporizer , that should mean they were already as medicinally active as possible , so one would expect to see little difference in potency after the oil has been collected from the vaporizer . <p> When the cannabinoids are vaporized off these high quality oils , all that is left in the bowl of the vaporizer are unwanted plant waxes and other contaminants . By leaving these unwanted substances behind in the bowl , the oil that you collect will be much purer , but since these oils had few impurities before they were even put in the vaporizer , this does little to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cannabinoids vaporize off the oil between 300 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit and these temperatures are much higher than those which we have been told are required to accomplish decarboxylation . Either there is something that we do not as yet understand about decarboxylation that is causing this amazing increase in potency , or all this extra heat required to vaporize the cannabinoids off may be doing something to the oil that we have never been aware of in the past . <p> I have been talking about this new process for the last few weeks when I do interviews and now there are some individuals , who have begun to manufacture oils in this manner and from what I have been told they were shocked at the difference in potency . From my experience , even the highest grade oils produced with the use of distilling equipment or a rice cooker can not be compared with oils that are collected after the cannabinoids have been vaporized off . They may look somewhat the same , but I think the vaporized oils are many times stronger and indeed this should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . <p> Some people simply put plant material in a vaporizer and then collect the cannabinoids in oil form from the dome of the vaporizer , after the plant material has been heated . By using the raw plant material one can produce a decent oil , but testing has shown that these oils do not equal the potency of oils produced in a rice cooker and that is the reason why I instruct people to produce the oil using my methods . <p> If you put high quality oil in a vaporizer , the resulting oil which will be produced after the cannabinoids have vaporized off , will be much stronger than even the best oils that can be vaporized off high quality bud material . So if you want to see great results , they can be achieved simply by vaporizing the best oil possible and this will give you a medicine , which I feel is beyond compare . <p> No matter if governments like it or not , in the near future many of us will be producing our own medicines and since these oils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , I expect to see this simple folk medicine manufactured everywhere , by those who do not have the money to play games with drug companies . In the future I am sure the drug companies will be trying to say that they are the only ones qualified to produce this medication , but we all know that anything these criminals are willing to provide would come at a very high price ; and since just about anyone can produce this substance , I see no need for drug companies to even play a role . <p> After we do the simple research that is required , we will be able to blend the different natural cannabinoids and produce oils specifically designed to treat different illnesses , but even though these new oils will have amazing healing abilities , oils which we ourselves can produce will always have their place in our medicine cabinets . I have never tried to patent any of the methods I have discovered , since I feel that this knowledge should be available to anyone who chooses to use it and no one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life and , as a matter of fact , I think it would be a much better world if we had no such thing as patents at all . <p> Although those who wish to prohibit this medication 's use , like drug companies , have proven in the past that they are more than happy to poison and kill us with the trash which they have been providing , I am sure they will try to tell us that they are the only ones who can produce this medication properly . Using the new method I have just described , anyone can manufacture medications that are just as pure as anything a drug company could provide . In addition , I think medications that we can produce ourselves will be much more effective than what a drug company would offer , because unlike them we are not in this for the money and our aim is simply to heal ourselves . <p> There is now no sensible reason as to why we can not produce our own medicines and when our bought and paid for governments try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more example of why we must rid ourselves of their corruption and once and for all , free humanity from their clutches . By now it should be more than obvious that drug companies and our governments care little or nothing about our health and well-being , so let 's give common sense and Mother Nature a chance to see what they can do to improve our overall health , and once we do so , I am sure that we will no longer accept what has gone on in the past . 49809 @qwx249809 49806 @qwx249806 49807 @qwx249807 49811 @qwx249811 49810 @qwx249810

It is more effective than a simple enema only because it involves releasing more water into the colon , which helps to clear out more lose waste . <p> The colon irrigation colon cleansing method is effective is removing the " top layer " of waste the lines the colon , but this colon cleansing method is not as effective in removing the waste from pouches , and waste impacted onto the intestine wall . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste and the waste in the pouches more effectively .

The psyllium husk is a dietary fiber and laxative that moves the putrified waste out of the body . <p> I did this colon cleansing method for three days but the longer the cleanse is done , the deeper the cleanse will be . There are fourteen and twenty-eight day colon cleanses from the manufacturers of the product I listed . You can purchase this colon cleansing colonics buy clicking the link image I posted . <p> Doing this colon cleansing at home for just three days , my stomach became flatter , I lost weight , I felt much lighter , and I felt much more energized .

Also , cleansing the intestines of intestinal parasites using a garlic enema assists the colon cleansing process . <p> This feeling lasted for a while but afterwards as I continued to eat foods that brought toxins back into my body , my old tired self came back . I now see using the colon cleansing colonic as an excellent way to jumpstart the overall body cleanse and not an means to an end . <p> Doing this colon cleanse while making lifestyle changes that involves adopting a colon cleansing diet is the way to go . A diet that includes increasing the amount of whole-food plant based life eaten , while reducing or removing meat , dairy , and processed foods . <p> A whole-food plant based diet removes the clogging animal protein , fat , and mucus , and is a high fiber diet that cleans the colon .

Do n't  you know it , the plant life around us is made up of that delicate balance . <p> Our bodies are amazing . They are living organisms and can you believe they need metals to survive ? Shouldnt metals just be in cars and buildings ? ( That was my attempt at humor . ) Our bodies are carbon-based but they need trace metal elements to survive . We need to consume metals like iron , copper , zinc , and calcium . Yes , calcium is a gray alkaline earth metal and is essential for healthy bones and teeth . <p> Plant life grows from the earth absorbs these elements and other compounds from the soil , so they are able to give us back we need to maintain homeostasis in the body .

My body is made from the earth , and when I sustain it with plant food that grows from the earth I support its strength and vitality . <p> Though I am vegan , I have to say I do n't  think it is bad if people eat meat . I do think they should only eat animals that are raised humanely and are fed unprocessed foods that they would normally find in nature . <p> The thing is if you are not eating organic meat , you are eating meat from animals that are fed growth-hormones , antibiotics , chicken feces , candy , and other chemicals that compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were naturally balanced and supported the health of our bodies , to eating foods that are unbalanced and contain growth-hormones , antibiotics , bacteria , foreign chemical substances , and illness . <p> On my vegan journey I have decided to eat alkaline producing vegetables , fruits , nuts , legumes , and grains . Most of these substances are naturally occurring as alkaline producing substances , and this is important because optimally our bodies exist in a slightly alkaline state . I have decided not to eat meat , dairy , and highly processed foods because they cause a buildup of mucus , chronic inflammation , and acidity in the body . <p> Our blood and fluids should have a 7.4 pH to support optimal health . A 7.4 pH level is slightly alkaline and eating a mostly alkaline diet will help keep the blood and fluids in the body at this optimal pH level . An alkaline environment in the body also makes it difficult for disease to thrive . <p> Eating naturally growing vegetation , fruits , nuts , and legumes not only provide our bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also alkalize the body to maintain an optimal pH level and to fight disease . <p> You are what you eat .

One way the body removes the cholesterol plaque is to use HDL to remove the LDL from the plaque . This gradual process strips plaque from arteries over time . You must stop putting animal fat and cholesterol in the body so the body will have chance to remove the plaque buildup . <p> Loading the body with nutrients from foods on the Dr. Sebi nutritional guide , will remove the toxins that undermine the health of the organs throughout the body , including the heart and arteries , and will saturate them with nutrients that will support metabolic functions to return the arteries to a state of homeostasis , or healthy functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting plant foods . <h> Salt , Oil , High Blood Pressure <p> Immediately eliminate or severely limit the consumption of additive SALT .

Alternative medicine supports that the blood pH should be 7.4 . When I recently received by blood-work from the doctor , my results stated the the accepted range is between 5.0 and 8.0 , and my pH was 6.5 . ( I feel my pH level should have been higher but that is another story about my blood pH ) . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> I do subscribe to 7.4 being the proper level of the blood pH . My previous blood-work results showed my pH was 6.0 , which shows that the vegan diet I adopted after my previous blood-work raised my pH level . It was able to raise my pH because the planted-based ( vegan ) diet is high in alkalizing minerals and alkaline ash . One of those alkaline minerals found in plant-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative medicine is that when the body is too acidic it is an environment that supports and promotes the development of disease in the body . Scientifically supported , acidosis is a medical condition that occurs when the arterial blood pH drops below 7.35 , and can result in conditions like osteoporosis and a weakened immune system . <p> Either way , reducing acidity in the body is very important in supporting proper health , and maintaining proper levels of alkaline materials in the body is needed to do so . Calcium is a very important mineral needed in maintaining proper pH levels in the body , and it is also the most abundant mineral in the body because it a major component of bones and teeth . <p> When the body becomes too acidic it will leech calcium from the bones to alkalize the body , which results in osteoporosis , a weakening of the bone . <h> Bones Calcium Vitamin D <p> Other than being part of the process of helping to keep the body slightly alkaline , calcium is needed to grow bones and teeth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General recommended minimum daily allowances of calcium are : <p> Adolescent males and females : 1300mg daily <p> Adult males and females : 1000mg daily <p> Women between 51 -70 years : 1200mg daily <p> Men and women 71+ years : 1200mg daily <p> Pregnant and lactating women between 14-18 years : 1300mg <p> Adequate amounts of vitamin D is needed by the body in order to maximize the absorption of the calcium into the bloodstream . Calcium is absorbed two ways . It is absorbed passively through the intestinal wall by diffusing through the spaces between cells . It is also absorbed actively through intestinal cells by binding to a transport protein known as calbindin , which is dependent on vitamin D. <p> The recommended daily allowance of vitamin D has been in flux as new evidence supports that vitamin D is involved in more bodily functions than previously thought . You can find daily recommended allowances of 400 IUs and 600 IUs , but new evidence of vitamin D 's increased role in cell functioning has many scientists supporting recommended daily allowances of 2000 IUs of vitamin D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500mg . If you are attaining your calcium from foods , this should not be an issue . If you are attaining calcium from calcium supplements , it is best to split doses higher than 500mg and take them at two different times of the day . The 2010 " Dietary Guidelines for Americans " states that " nutrients should come primarily from foods . I believe it is best to attain calcium from plant-based food sources because it will be in natural ratios with other nutrients that will have a synergistic affect on the body . <h> Calcium Blood , Nerves And Muscles <p> Calcium is required for the clotting of blood , normal functioning of the nerves , muscles , and heart . Calcium works together with vitamin K and a protein called fibrinogen to clot blood from cuts to stop blood flow . Inadequate levels of calcium and vitamin K increases the time it will take for blood to clot . <p> Proper levels of calcium in the blood is essential for proper electrical conductivity in the nerves . Calcium is in charge of the gated channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nerve impulses trigger muscle contractions and movement by a process called the " sliding filament model " which is dependent on calcium in the muscle cells . <h> Calcium Sources <p> Many people think that we must drink cows milk to get our recommended daily allowance of calcium . This is not true . We are the only species that drinks or is dependent on another species milk to get its needed calcium . Calcium from plant based foods like bok choy , broccoli , brussel sprouts , collard greens , figs , kale , and fortified orange juice are better absorbed by the body than milk and other dairy products . <p> Around 30% of calcium from dairy is absorbed by the body , and 45 -60% of calcium is absorbed by the body from plant based foods .

There are two theories as to why acidity damages the kidneys and we do n't  have to look at them as being contradictory but can look at them as being complimentary . <p> High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making tubes in the kidneys . The kidneys counteract the acidity of meat and dairy products by ramping up ammonia production , which is a alkaline base , to neutralize the acid . <p> This is beneficial in the short-term but when meat and dairy are eaten constantly and produces chronic acidity , the body keeps the kidneys flooded with ammonia which becomes toxic to the kidneys . <p> The other theory is the acidic pH increases the production of free radicals that cause oxidative stress , renal damage , and scarring of the kidneys . <p> It is the digestion of the sulphur rich proteins in meat and dairy that produce unwanted levels of acid in the body . <p> Plants contain far less sulphur containing protein than meat and dairy do , so when plant and their proteins are digested they generally end up producing alkaline byproducts or compounds that do n't  compromise the health of the kidneys. 49809 @qwx249809 49806 @qwx249806 49807 @qwx249807 49811 @qwx249811 49810 @qwx249810

@@25231689 @5231689/ <h> Power Walk On A Treadmill For A Full Body Workout To Lose Weight <p> Power Walking Technique <p> I have picked up some good pointers for power walking on a treadmill for a full body workout and to lose weight . Not all walking on treadmill is equal , and different techniques will produce different results . My reason for power walking is to save myself from the pounding on my knees that result from running , but I also wanted to maintain the benefits of running which are : burning of calories , increased leg stamina , and the strengthening of my cardiovascular system . 49808 @qwx249808 <p> In order for me to maintain the benefits of running , I incorporate specific techniques into my walking . Walking of any kind is good because it involves movement and the body needs adequate movement to support healthy living , but for my needs I need more than just regular walking . You can see the different approaches to walking from the video below . You can see people in the background walking on the treadmill , holding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more casual rate . <p> I noticed with them , that they did n't  produce much sweat , which is an indication to me that they werent pushing themselves enough to break a sweat . Everyone exercises at different levels for various reasons . Some people may have just incorporated exercise into their lives and need to start off slowly so they do not injure themselves . Some people are aware of some techniques and not other techniques . One thing that I have noticed is that no one in the gym I attend power walks . <p> Power walking involves working out the legs and the upper body , and both involve specific techniques to reap the benefits of a cardiovascular , full body workout , and calorie burning . <p> A good pair of sneakers are needed . I use Nike Free sneakers because they are made to move with the natural movement of the foot . I found this to be really beneficial to working out my entire legs and butt , as the sneakers allow my toes to move and grab , which strengthens my arches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamstrings , and butt muscles . I feel far more activation of these muscles while power walking in barefoot running shoes , than from running . <p> It is important to take short strides . Before I started power walking , I used to run and take long strides . I later found out that this caused me to land on my heals , which caused a lot of shock to the joints in my legs . Power walking and even running with shorter strides make me land more on the balls of my feet , which reduces shock to my knees and helps to strengthen the arches in my feet . I also find that this activates my hamstrings more , resulting in a more complete workout for all of the muscles in my legs . I push off my back leg from the ball off foot rolling to the toes , while landing on the ball of my forward foot . <p> For the upper body it is important to keep the back straight and the shoulders rolled back . I bend my elbows , keep them close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down so that the hands come to shoulder height or higher . This movement also strengthens my stomach ( core ) and lower back , as they work to keep my lower and upper body in sync and aligned . The pumping of the arms exercise my arms , shoulders , and upper back . This is a full body workout aimed towards making my bodys muscles work in sync . <p> It is important to start at slower speeds on the treadmill while incorporating these power walking techniques , and then build to higher speeds . Power walking using these techniques require very good balance , and starting at a slower speed will help you acquire the balance by training the bodys muscle memory to maintain the required movement . <p> Using these techniques while building to higher speeds will burn calories , align posture , work out and strengthen the calves , thighs , hamstring , butt , core , lower back , upper back , arms , and shoulders . 49809 @qwx249809 49806 @qwx249806 49807 @qwx249807 49811 @qwx249811 49810 @qwx249810 
@@25231690 @5231690/ <h> Lemon vs Lime Differences , Benefits , And Effects On Alkalinity <p> Strictly keeping to the idea that non-hybrid foods are better than hybrid foods , the consumption of lemons or limes would be discouraged because they are both hybrids. 1 The idea is non-hybrid foods have a primal genetic coding that works the best in keeping the body in a state of homeostasis . Even though they are both hybridized fruits they both have health benefits which should be used to support " healthy living , " but is one better than the other ? <h> Hybridization <p> Hybridization of plants does n't  necessarily mean the plants and their fruit do n't  have any nutritional value , it just means that some of its nutritional value may have been lost . Some hybridization of plants occurs naturally when two plants of the same species cross pollinate , and this is the preferred method of hybridization . Artificial hybridization is a man-made process of crossing two or more plants that are not genetically similar to make another plant whose genetic makeup is markedly different . <p> The original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more plants within the same species to make a wide variety of hybridized plants from a few original plants . Science indicates there are only four original citrus fruits that include : citron ( Citrus medica ) , pommelo ( Citrus maxima or Citrus grandis ) , mandarin ( Citrus reticulata ) and papeda ( Citrus micrantha ) . <p> Hybridization alters the nutrient makeup , like the vitamins , minerals , proteins , and fats , which is fairly simple to detect . It also alters the phytonutrient makeup which possesses much of the cancer and disease fighting compounds , which science is still trying to understand . The less hybridized plant and fruit are preferred . <h> Hybridization Of Lemon vs Lime <p> The original lime Citrus aurantiifolia known as key lime or Mexican lime is a hybrid of citron ( Citrus medica ) on the paternal side and papeda ( Citrus micrantha ) on the maternal side. 23Key limes or Mexican limes are a hybrid of 2 plants . <p> The limes that are common in grocery stores are Persian limes ( Citrus latifolia ) .

Persian limes are a hybrid of either 3 or 4 plants . <p> From the standpoint of the least hybridization key limes would be the better fruit to consume , and then depending of the hybridization of the Persian lime the Persian lime would be equivalent to lemon or would have one more level of hybridization . <h> Lemon vs Lime Taste <p> Lemons taste more sour than limes do , and limes have a smoother taste . Which one tastes better depends on what you are making with it . I had preferred to drink lemonade until I started drinking lime water . <p> Lemonade was refreshing because of sour tart taste that wakes up the taste buds . Lime water is also refreshing but it has a smoother bitter-sweet taste . <p> I use limes a lot to counterbalance the sweetness of my date smoothies and it does a nice job because it is less sour than lemons and does n't  overpower the sweetness of the fruits . <p> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limes and the video give a demonstration can pick out the more sour taste of the lemons . <h> Lemon vs Lime Nutrition <p> The figures are based on 100 grams of raw lemon juice and raw lime juice .

Vitamin C is the only nutrient that both lemons and limes supply a large percentage of the daily recommended value . <p> One thing to keep in mind is even if the nutrient levels ( vitamins , minerals , fats , protein ) in plant life is low , there are great benefits in their phytonutrients that protect out health .
