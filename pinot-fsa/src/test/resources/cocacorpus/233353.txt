Well at Illamasqua , although we are proud to be a colour brand , we do believe that your skin needs to be well kept in order to provide an optimal canvas for said colours to shine . Seeing as we do n't ( and wo n't ) create our own skin care , we wanted to create something for an instant skin pick-me-up . <p> First of all , let 's get something straight " Hydra Veil is not a primer . This wobby jelly is designed to give skin an instant surge of hydration for immediate results . Using it wo n't prevent crows feet , for example , but it will be a quick fix for sullen , dry skin ( psst it 's especially great for hungover skin . Be sure to indulge in the mandatory fry up also ) . With so many different skin types and qualms , I 'm going to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best from your Hydra Veil . <p> Before you begin do n't underestimate the power of a few glasses of water to help to perk your skin up ! Now , apply a moisturizer or serum as normal . On top of this , continue to apply your Hydra Veil . The power of two will help to combat your dry , ropey skin so you will be looking ( if not feeling ) better in no time . <p> Does your skin feel irritated post-shave ? Hydra Veil could be the perfect soothing remedy . After your usual balm , apply Hydra Veil fresh from the fridge . The combination of hydration and cooling temperature will help to alleviate any irritation or redness . <p> Do you ever find that your eye area can look puffy in the morning , or perhaps dry and cakey as the day goes on ? Let Hydra Veil come to the rescue . Gently pat a little onto and around the orbital bone with your ring finger for a fresh and dewy revival . <p> And there you have it ! <p> Want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visit your local Illamasqua shop or counter and one of our team will gladly show you our newest innovation .

@@23805167 @3805167/ <p> How to master the best application technique from Illamasqua Skin Base Foundation : <p> Step 1ExfoliationTo ensure the best potential application of Skin Base Foundation , first ensure that your skin has been eradicated of any patches of dehydrated or dead epidermal skin cells by gently applying skincare with a mild exfoliation method . Washing your face alone may not be enough to keep skin in top condition , so muslin cloths are a perfect accessory for daily facial skin polishing and gentle cleansing to achieve this successful exfoliation result . Be kind to your skin and always be gentle This should not be done over frequently as this can over stimulate the skin or may lead to sensitivity . Once or twice a week should suffice and if any sensitivity appears cease exfoliation immediately . <p> Step 2HydrationTo ensure the best potential application of Skin Base Foundation , next make sure that you have provided your skin with sufficient hydration . All foundation applications will provide a better result once applied over an optimum level of hydration . If you have extremely dry or dehydrated skin this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opt to use . Likewise if you have extremely oily skin this should be managed by the efficacy of the oil control moisturiser you choose to use . If you opt to protect your skin with SPF you should select a moisturiser with SPF contained with an appropriate SPF level you opt to use . <p> Step 3Prime for successTo ensure the best potential application of Skin Base Foundation , next make sure that you have provided your skin with an effective primer . Opt for Illamasqua Satin Primer if you want to achieve a more satin effect to the skin , and Illamasqua Matte Primer if you want to achieve a more matte effect to the skin . A primer smoothes the surface of the skin temporarily for a better foundation application and payoff . A primer can be readily applied with the fingers , however a foundation brush would provide a more effective and even application . A swirling circular buffing motion can also be used with a brush if you opt to work in this method to buff and polish the primer onto the skin . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halation . It is not designed to be completely flat and matte . A very matte result can be achieved by strategic use of powder . Please note : Natural skin is not often continually matte . Once you have selected your preferred Skin Base foundation shade , next ensure that you apply the product effectively . A little goes a long way with this formula . The foundation tottle bottle administers a small amount for you to apply due to the size of the bottle dispensing tip.Skin Base foundation can be used in several effective ways : *As a liquid concealer and camouflage under the eyes to minimize fatigue <p> * Mixed with a moisturiser to sheer to a tinted moisturiser level of coverage <p> * Mixed with Illamasqua Gleam cream to add luminosity and to provide a sheer coverage level and payoff . <p> * Mixed with a mosituriser or Illamasqua Gleam Cream for fair complexions with freckles wishing for freckle visibility and natural beauty <p> * As a foundation with a natural coverage level and payoff " skin realism <p> * As a foundation layered with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation layered with a buildable coverage level and payoff followed by a layer of Illamasqua powder foundation to set as a powder . <p> * Powder areas you will feel may require extra shine proofing for extra durability and confidence . These may include the central forehead , nose , either side of the nose on the cheek area and the chin . <p> * Blot Skin Base Foundation after application with a tissue before applying any powder for maximum hold and shine control . <p> * Skin Base Foundation has an amazing durability on the skin over many hours . <p> The foundation can be applied with the fingers or a foundation brush for optimum application and payoff . <p> I hope this guide helps you to achieve the skin confidence this formula can provide . <p> I believe this internet site contains some rattling superb leave a trail .

The colour red symbolises sexual desire and attraction . Red lips were actually brought into fashion to emulate the womans vagina , generating an appealing lust to who ever locks eyes upon the person wearing red lipstick . During the Elizabethan era an ivory white complexion was extremely popular as this reflected a persons wealth . Tanned people were associated with working outside in the sun and were therefore poorer . Having bright red lips made the skin appear even paler in comparison . <p> Modeled by so many celebrities today its an extremely popular look , but what makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fading out of fashion ? <p> It certainly flatters other features of your face . Specific shades of red can bring out the blue in your eyes or really flatter your hair colour .

If I 'm going out and find myself head to toe in black a red lip can turn this look from funeral undertaker to chic glam ! <p> If its one thing I 've learnt whilst working at Illamasqua its dare to be different . Red lips is a cool look and I- am sure the first group of people who wore bright red lips turned some heads . Probably how Apocalips does today , but to our dedicated fans who love to rock the blue/green lips just remember the " freaks " that walked around wearing the first bright red lips started the long running trend . So embrace the bold lip and try some different colours . I remember on my first week here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at me now I love going out with a darker lip and so many of friends say how great it looks on me .

@@23805527 @3805527/ <p> I think its safe to say that most girls love make-up and the effects it can have . However , there is difference between loving makeup and knowing the techniques to master it . I remember writing my CV when I was applying for my internship ; I said I had a great passion for make-up but , looking back , I really did n't  have a clue what I was doing . <p> At school art was my favourite subject , and as I 'm heading into a new year working in make-up I start to realise how make-up is a form of art . It is probably even more important as this is a piece of art you have to showcase on your face . Today , I am going to talk about some new tricks Ive learnt using make-up , and how different shades , materials and tools are all important factors in the end result . <p> Primers really do make such a difference . They set the skin and create a base for you to begin your make-up . I always used to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day . By putting on a primer beforehand , this allows your make-up to set more evenly . The question is which one , Matt or Satin ? Its great that thanks to cosmetic technology we can can have dewy cheeks without an oily forehead . <p> Before I worked at Illamasqua , I used to think that brushes were just a companys way of making more money . Why use them when you can just use your fingers to blend ? Well , I 'm pretty sure Leonardo da Vinci did n't  paint the Mona Lisa with his fingers , ( not that I 'm comparing myself to the Mona Lisa ) ! Not to mention travelling into London every day I dread to think of the terrible bacteria lurking on my hands . I used to use a Foundation Brush until I switched to a Highlighter Brush ; - I found this gave a more airbrushed and lighter effect rather than a full coverage . It gives your complexion a softer look but still leaves a lovely coverage . <p> I used to just sweep any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , I 've learnt that you can use darker and lighter shades to contour and highlight , creating a whole new dimension to your face . I was amazed by the little tricks I have been taught . Now when I take my bronzer , instead of drawing two sharp lines , I blend it into a three on each side of my face . Along the jaw line , up , then across the cheekbone and up again to the forehead . This accentuates lines and creates definition. - One of my favourite tricks is to make the illusion of a smaller nose by placing a darker colour along the sides of your nose and a lighter colour down the bridge , creating an instant nose-job ! Without fail now I always put a lighter colour underneath my eyebrows to really make them pop out . ( If you read my last post you will know how much I love a defined brow ! ) <p> A few months ago I attended the Night Time Diva Course . I had a brilliant time and learnt so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokey eye . Whenever I used to try and perfect a smokey eye , I always found that eyeshadows would fall down my face and I would end up looking like a panda bear . Even after you try and take away the fallen product , you find yourself taking away half your foundation . Starting your smokey eye first eliminates this risk ; you can be as messy as you want and then apply your foundation around the eye . <p> I 've recently switched from using a pencil to shadows on my brows and it has made such a difference ! Hair , especially on your face , should be soft . Instead of harsh , blocked lines you should blend and sweep to create an effortless look . I LOVE structured brows and used to think that the only way to create a whole new shape was to draw a new one on .

It also infects my wardrobe . I am , in honesty , obsessed with Little Red Riding Hood , and with visuals from various Hollywood films . I own dozens of red hoodies , hooded coats and capes . I work at a school and for my first few months the students called me ( before they learned my name ) The miss with the red lipstick I wear it constantly enough , nails and lips , that without either I feel only half done .

I love the contradictions in the symbolism of the colour red . I do n't  have as much of a connection to the brighter shades of red , finding them colder and harder , more obvious but at the same time less enthralling .

Many of my friends have spent money on a new hairstyle or colour to then be told they need to change it in order to keep their jobs . <p> But why are many employers so intimidated by alternative cultures ? <p> I 'm aware employers will be very conscious of what customers/clients will think although I wish more employers would allow alternative individuals to work happily and freely with their tattoos on show to help break the mould .

Luckily where I work now is open to all sorts of people but I think its disgusting that someone would be discriminated against because of how they look , whether that be body art , hair colour or how attractive they are ! <p> I completely agree , I do n't  understand why its seen as tabboo even though its a very common form of expression . When I first started at boots I was made to change my hair colour from pink to something " natural " .

I fail to understand how what other people do with their own body is seen as an affront to others . I have often been insulted by strangers asking me why I ruin myself with tattoos and piercings and been told I look disgusting and like a pig by what up to that point seemed like a nice old lady on the bus .

I wonder why tattoos are not okay yet because Justin freakin Bieber and his little gf have one and nobody cares ! If tattoos have gotten to that point , than that tells me that employers need to modernize themselves . This is why I want to work with Illamasqua I can tell for a fact everyone behind the line has a good heart .

Its disgusting that people judge over a visual difference full stop , whether this difference is i.e. race , weight or appearance . These are our bodies , and we can make our own choices as to what we do to them ; more people need to respect that . It makes me so angry that companies have the unprecedented right to ask people to change themselves , as described by the above commentators , when they should accept people the way they are , whatever their appearance . I was listening to a debate on the radio whereby a guy worked in an elderly peoples home and the residents loved him ! - However when a visiting authority figure saw the guy had tattoos , the poor guy was asked to leave his job as the elderly would find him intimidating which was indeed NOT the case !

The cosmetics industry interested me for two reasons . Firstly people kept on telling me that it was an impossible market to penetrate due to the absolute dominance of the French houses , namely LOreal , Lauder , LVMH and Chanel . Secondly I had witnessed an event in Whitby , where I was really quite moved by the way make-up was being worn by boys and girls , men and women , as a part of the alternative scene . <p> When I set off to study the make-up market I have to say I was really quite bored very quickly . Every brand was giving the same message and none seemed to be in any way getting close to building an emotional connection with their customer . Of course there was MAC and much of what that brand did was impressive , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was probably a period of 18 months within which the idea of Illamasqua , including its name ( a fusion of illusion and masquerade ) , was formed .

We were to be the brand that gave permission and encouraged self-expression . <h> With British creativity at our roots and self expression in our hearts our mission is to inspire you to take pride ineverything you are and all you aspire to become . <p> It was important from the outset to challenge everything the make-up industry had delivered to date , and as such I remember building an art team who throughout the launch of Illamasqua were keen to make a difference .

What we built became irresistible for the world 's retailers from whom we saw a strong interest , but none more so than Selfridges who really seemed to understand and support everything we were setting out to achieve . This led them to launch Illamasqua on an exclusive basis on 1st November 2008 . <p> This now seems like a long time ago , but it 's always nice to look back and remember those incredibly exciting and creative days of which I will always be immensely proud , especially when Vogue UK described us as the most important event in make-up for 25 years ' . <p> If you 'd like to find out more about Julian stay tuned for a Q&amp;A coming soon ! <h> 2 Comments <p> As a lover of quality makeup , art and the alt . scene , Illamasqua continues to be the sole brand to carry my favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a dupetruly irreplaceable , as are most of Illamasquas creations .. need I mention Creator nail polish ?

@@23805682 @3805682/ <p> New Romantiscism was a fashion movement that began with the youth of London and peaked in the 1980s . The electro pop sounds of David Bowie and his contempories were the biggest influence and the style of these icons of the era encouraged the exploration of androgyny and individuality in the club scene . The effects of this period can still be felt in popular culture today our office especially loves a bit of Bowie blaring through the speakers ! <p> The term New Romantic was coined by Richard James Burgess in reference to Spandau Ballet <p> The key clubs were Billys in Soho and The Blitz of Covent Garden featured heavily in the film Worried About The Boy which was run by Steve Strange , of the band Visage . The Blitz even had its own posse the Blitz Kids , who would make an effort to dress as flamboyantly as possible and drawing influence from as many sources as possible such as the English romantics , Golden Hollywood , Egyptians , Glam Rock and Science Fiction movies . <p> Part of the Blitz legends recalls Mick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve Strange ! <p> With roots in reggae , blues , glam rock and punk , the movement was a mish mash of influences .
