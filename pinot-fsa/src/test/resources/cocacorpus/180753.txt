@@74241151 @2941151/ <h> Queen Elizabeth I and Richmond <p> Local history note on Queen Elizabeth I and Richmond . <p> Queen Elizabeth I was the daughter of King Henry VIII and his second wife , Anne Boleyn , who were married on 25 January 1533 and Elizabeth was born at Greenwich on 7 September 1533 . Anne was executed on 19 May 1536 and Henry married Jane Seymour , whose son became Edward VI after his fathers death on 28 January 1547 . Henry also had another daughter , Mary , born on 18 February 1516 , by his first wife , Catherine of Aragon . Mary had been brought up as a Roman Catholic whereas Edward and Elizabeth were Protestants . <p> After her fathers death , Elizabeth lived with her stepmother , Catherine Parr , who had been Henrys sixth wife , at her house in Chelsea and at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire . The latter was the home of Thomas Seymour , Duke of Somerset whom Katherine had married in April 1547 . After Catherines death in childbirth on 7 September 1548 , Elizabeth set up her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was succeeded by Lady Jane Grey , a Protestant , who reigned for only 9 days before being overthrown by his half sister , Mary . Jane was beheaded on 12 February 1554 on Tower Green within the precincts of the Tower of London . <p> September 1553 could possibly be the date of Elizabeths first visit to Richmond when she was granted an audience with Mary who was awaiting her coronation . Mary and the ambassadors in England of Charles V ( Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire ) had been trying to persuade Elizabeth to renounce her Protestant faith . Elizabeth stated that she had been ignorant , asked for books and a priest to instruct her , said that she would attend services in the Chapel Royal and pleaded for Marys understanding . Her act deceived Mary , but very few members of the court . <p> Matters came to a head in March 1554 . Elizabeth was sent to the Tower of London on suspicion of being involved with Sir Thomas Wyatts plot to prevent Marys marriage to Phillip II of Spain . Released in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night at Richmond on her way to " house arrest " at Woodstock . She remained there until April 1555 when she returned to Hatfield and was still there when Mary died on 17 November 1558 and she became queen . Elizabeths coronation was arranged for 15 January 1559 , a date selected as propitious by the astrologer Dr. John Dee who lived at Mortlake . <p> Elizabeth had 14 palaces in regular use at her disposal as well as numerous " stately homes " throughout England owned by noblemen and gentry . So started the " Royal Progresses " whereby Elizabeth and her court would move round the country staying in the palaces , Whitehall , St. Jamess , Somerset House , Greenwich , Eltham , Richmond , Oatlands , Nonsuch and Hampton Court , as well as the stately homes whose owners had to bear the costs of accommodating the Royal Court . Elizabeth rarely moved move than 150 miles outside London and , wherever possible , used the River Thames for travelling or transporting heavy baggage . The river connected Greenwich , Westminster , Whitehall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 4 miles away from it . Each palace had its own landing stage . The following gives an idea of the cost of transportation by river : <p> " To Louis Walter , bargeman , for conveying the Queens Grace from Richmond to Greenwich in her barge with twenty-one rowers , every rower taking eightpencefourteen shillings . London Bridge negotiation gave crew ' danger money ' the reward of a barge beneath the bridge , one shilling and sixpence . Return journey was made for the same fare witha great boat the same day for conveying the ladies and gentlemen from Greenwich with nine rowers at eightpence a rower . " <p> In January 1579 this item was recorded : " The hier of a horse ii daies to the courte to furnishe my Lorde of Leicesters players the frost being so grate no bote could goe . " <p> One typical progress , undertaken in August 1559 was as follows : left Greenwich for Eltham and stayed there 3 days ; on to Hampton Court , breaking the journey at Richmond , but not staying overnight ; remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Whitehall . The court and therefore the government would be sitting wherever the queen was residing . <p> In the late 1580s , Elizabeth gave up her annual progresses and instead moved around her London palaces , only occasionally making short visits away from these bases . The progresses were resumed in 1591/92 , but the court stayed close to London in 1593 , moving to Richmond in the autumn of that year for fear of the plague in London . A progress panned for 1594 got no further than Richmond as there was an outbreak of measles and smallpox in Chertsey and Weybridge . Elizabeth made her last progress in 1597 . <p> Elizabeth tried to stay at least twice a year at Richmond , often in the late autumn and frequently for Christmas as it was reputed to be the warmest of all the palaces as the royal apartments were more compact . Dr. John Dee also advised her against the chill of Whitehall . In her later years , she found Richmond suited her health , the January snow made Whitehall cheerless and Greenwich bleak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to Richmond " That warm winter box to shelter my old age . " <p> Several major events occurred whilst Elizabeth was staying at Richmond . On 20 September 1562 , a secret treaty was signed at Richmond whereby English troops would occupy Le Havre until Calais was returned to England in 1567 , the date given in the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis , signed in March 1559 by Spain , France and England . Under the 1562 treaty , a loan of 140,000 crowns was also to be made to the French Huguenot forces , repayable when the English were in possession of Calais . This never happened as , in 1567 , Elizabeth was told she had broken the original treaty and Calais remained French . <p> Elizabeth spent a long period at Richmond during the spring and summer of 1564 . In April , peace had been made with France and the Treaty of Troyes signed . In 1565 , a mission arrived from the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire to discuss the possibility of a marriage between Elizabeth and Archduke Charles of Austria . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm yes or no as Charles was a Catholic and he refused to change his religion . <p> Elizabeth wrote from Richmond to Mary , Queen of Scots in June 1567 expressing her disapproval of Marys marriage to the Earl of Bothwell . <p> The French ambassador suggested , in 1570 , Henry of Anjou , a younger brother of Charles IX of France , as a possible husband . Henrys eldest brother had been Francis II , the first husband of Mary , Queen of Scots . This suggestion also foundered for the same reason , the extent to which he could still practice his Catholic religion . In 1571 , the ambassador put forward another candidate , Henris younger brother , Francis , Duke of Alencon . Elizabeth by now was 38 and he was only 17 . Negotiations again came to an end after the St. Bartholomews Day massacre of the French Huguenots on 24 August 1572 and Francis was temporarily imprisoned for his Huguenot sympathies . <p> By October 1578 , the possibility of a marriage had become closer . Letters sent from the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by January 1579 a favourite courtier of Franciss now the Duke of Anjou after Henri had succeeded to the throne came to woo Elizabeth by proxy and carry out further negotiations . The courtier , Jean de Simier , visited Elizabeth at Richmond whilst he stayed for 7 days at Syon . In August 1579 , Anjou decided to come to England privately to woo Elizabeth himself . He saw the queen at Greenwich where he stayed for 12 days . <p> Other events soon overtook the discussions , on 26 September 1580 Sir Francis Drake returned to England from his circumnavigation of the world . The Spanish ambassador demanded the return of what Spain considered to be stolen treasure and Drakes punishment . By late October , the queen was at Richmond and she summoned Drake to bring the treasure to her , but it was held at Syon House , presumably to stave off any speculation , while Drake reported to her at Richmond . Drake had already been rewarded with 10,000 and he was given a further 10,000 for his associates and crew . The remainder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tower of London . The Spanish ambassador continued to demand an audience with the queen . It was decided that the only way to balance Spains threat was to seek an alliance with France , through marriage to Anjou . No decision was made about the marriage in 1580 , although negotiations were underway again between April to June 1581 , but with little headway . So Anjou returned openly to England and on 2 November arrived at Richmond . Initially Anjou was due to stay at Syon , but then Elizabeth arranged lodgings in the town . Two inns , the Red Lion and the Bell , were taken over to accommodate his entourage . Further improvements were made to the palace , new doors were constructed in certain galleries so that access could be made without Anjou having to use the public courtyards . After a week , Anjou asked his brother for money to help pay for the wedding . Elizabeth also told the French ambassador that she would only agree to the marriage if Henri agreed to an alliance whereby France would pay for any war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for supporting the Netherlands . Henri refused , so the marriage was called off . Anjou returned to France in February 1582 with 10,000 and the promise of a further 50,000 . He died in 1584 . <p> Sir Walter Raleigh stayed at Richmond for at least a month in March 1583 . Sir Francis Walsingham , the Secretary of State , wrote , in October 1586 , from his house , Barn Elms , to the Scottish ambassador that , although the queen would be pleased to grant him an audience at Richmond , he would be unable to stay the night as there were no convenient lodgings available . <p> The trial of Mary , Queen of Scots , took place at Fotheringay Castle in October 1586 , at the end of which she was sentenced to death for attempting to assassinate Elizabeth . Elizabeth was undecided as to what to do and the sentence could not be carried out without her permission . A delegation from both Houses of Parliament arrived at Richmond in November to press her for a decision and in December , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not sign the death warrant and a plea for mercy came from courtiers of Henri III of France who saw the queen at Richmond . The warrant was finally signed on 1st February 1587 and Mary was beheaded on 8th February . <p> The Spanish Armada sailed from Corunna in early July 1588 and by 19 July , the ships were sighted off The Lizard . The court had moved to Richmond 2 weeks earlier and a Council of War was established at the palace to monitor the Armadas progress up the Channel until the court moved to St. Jamess Palace on 30 July . The court returned to Richmond for Christmas . <p> Elizabeth was at Richmond in December 1595 as she went to dine at Kew with Sir John Pickering , Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal . His house stood near the site of the present Kew Palace in Kew Gardens . Lent was spent at Richmond in 1596 and in 1599 , Elizabeth spent 6 weeks over Christmas at Richmond .

News of all this reached the court and he was summoned to appear before the Privy Council . He refused and set out for London , but nobody joined him and he surrendered after a threat was made to blow up his house . He was then arrested , put on trial , sentenced to death and executed on 25 February . <p> The queen was at Richmond in February 1602 , but she moved to Greenwich as she had " An ache in one of her arms , expecting more ease by change of air . " By March she had moved back to Richmond where the new French ambassador had an audience with her . He noted that " She walked daily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April and returned in October . Elizabeth went to Whitehall in November and intended to spend Christmas at Richmond . But she had a cold and did not leave Whitehall till 21 January 1603 " in very fowle and wet weather . " <p> One of the eyewitness accounts of Elizabeths last days was given by Giovanni Scaramelli . He was the first Venetian ambassador to be appointed since her accession and arrived in London on 2 February and immediately journeyed to Richmond where he was warmly welcomed by the queen . The end of February saw her with another bad cold and the death of her favourite lady-in-waiting , Catherine , Countess of Nottingham , did nothing to improve her health . She had intended to go to chapel at the beginning of March , but was too frail . Instead cushions were laid in the floor in the Privy Council so she could hear the service . She lay on the floor for 4 days without food or drink until she was persuaded to go to her bed . <p> By now , Sir Robert Carey had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin and the brother of the late Countess of Nottingham . He wrote a very graphic and moving account of the last 3 weeks of her life . <p> Elizabeth died in the early hours of Thursday , 24 March 1603 .

He arrived in Edinburgh late on Saturday and informed him that he was now King James I of England . <p> The queens last progress was by river from Richmond to Whitehall where she lay in state for a month before being buried on 28 April in Henry VIIs Chapel at Westminster Abbey .

Yellow lines within a CPZ do not require time plates showing the hours of restriction if their hours of restriction are the same as the CPZs hours .

You are not allowed any time at all unless the reason you have stopped is a permitted reason . For example you can not simply stop on a yellow line to ' pop ' into a shop , withdraw cash or similar , you should find a legal parking place for this .

@@74241276 @2941276/ <h> High hedges - frequently asked questions <h> Can I cut branches overhanging my boundary ? <p> Yes . As long as you ensure that you know where your actual boundary is . Fences , hedges and ditches often mark the legal boundary between properties but such boundaries do not always follow an obvious line on the ground . In cases where you are in dispute with your neighbour you would be wise to take legal advice before cutting any vegetation . It is also good practice to discuss any proposed works with your neighbour before you carry them out . <p> Only branches overhanging your boundary can be cut and they must be cut in a way that will not compromise the health of the trees or shrubs . If the tree you intend to trim is protected by a Tree Preservation Order or a Planning Condition of if it is in a Conservation Area you will need to get Richmond Borough Councils permission for the works . <h> If I cut back branches overhanging my boundary can I put the material arising back over my neighbours fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your neighbour although they are not obliged to take them or remove them or pay for their removal . Be aware that any works to trees protected by a Tree Preservation Order or by a Planning Condition will require permission in writing from Richmond Borough Council . Works to trees in a Conservation Area will also require our permission . <h> Can I expect or force my neighbour to pay for the removal of overhanging branches ? <p> No . The responsibility for funding the cost of removal will be yours . On the bright side it will probably be cheaper than expensive litigation . However , strict liability for the safe retention of trees is the responsibility of the owner of the trees . Be aware that any works to trees protected by a Tree Preservation Order or by a Planning Condition will require permission in writing from Richmond Borough Council . Works to trees in a Conservation Area will also require our permission .

May I remove a hedge in my field ? <p> No , not without first submitting a Hedgerow Removal Notice to Richmond Borough Council . The Council will then have 42 days after the receipt of a properly constituted Hedgerow Removal Notice to consider the application and make recommendations . Follow the link at the top of this page to find out how to submit a Hedgerow Removal Notice . Such hedges are covered by the Hedgerow Regulations 1997 . <h> Why should the person who is suffering the hedge problems have to pay the Council to intervene ? <p> The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 states that complainants must pay a fee to the local authority when they submit their hedge complaint . There are several reasons why this is fair and reasonable : <p> Most people who responded to questions about fees in the 1999 consultation ' High hedges - possible solutions ' thought it was fair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervene in their hedge dispute . <p> Payment of a fee will encourage people to try to settle these disputes amicably , making sure that involvement of the local authority really is a last resort . <p> A fee will also help to deter frivolous or vexatious complaints . <p> It is common practice for local authorities to charge a fee for a service which is likely to benefit an individual ( in this case , the complainant ) rather than the community in general . <h> But the complainant is the innocent party in this dispute . <p> It is important to understand the way the legislation works . It allows local authorities to review these cases , as independent and impartial third parties . Authorities are not investigating any offence - none has been committed , even if a complainant ' wins ' their case - and so the legislation does not deal in innocent or guilty parties . As a result , the fee is a payment for a service - not a penalty . <h> How can there be no offence : it 's anti-social behaviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedges provisions being included in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 . It simply provided a suitable opportunity , and vehicle , to get the high hedges legislation onto the statute book after several unsuccessful attempts through Private Members Bills . Certainly , the Act makes no provision for an Anti-social Behaviour Order to be served on the hedge owner . And no offence is committed until such time as a hedge owner fails to implement a local authority 's order to carry out works to the hedge to remedy the problems it is causing . <h> Can I reclaim the fee from the hedge owner ? <p> There is no procedure under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 for the complainant to obtain re-payment of the fee , either from the local authority or from the hedge owner . <p> People have asked about taking their neighbours to the small claims court . This is the special procedure for handling smaller claims in the county court . It can be used for most claims for 5,000 or less and so , on the face of it , the procedure may apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighbour 's high hedge . However , issuing a claim at court should be a last resort . People should have tried other ways of settling the matter ; for example , by writing to their neighbour to ask for recompense . <p> Further information is contained in the leaflets ' Making a Claim ' ( Leaflet EX301 ) and ' The Small Claims Track ' ( Leaflet EX307 ) available from the county court and at www.courtservice.gov.uk . Court staff can advise on the procedures , provide the necessary forms and help people to fill them out , but the final decision rests with the judge . So , court staff can not tell someone whether or not they have a good claim or comment on their chances of success . People may be able to get free legal advice from a law centre to help them with this . <h> Why ca n't I complain to my local authority about deciduous trees and hedges that cause problems ? <p> Government decided to restrict the legislation to evergreen hedges because of evidence that they were a widespread problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters received from all over the country . And both the problem and possible solutions were the subject of public consultation . The results indicated overwhelming support for new laws to deal with evergreen hedges , including among the majority of local authorities who replied . Government mandate - and commitment - to legislative action is , therefore , to take action in respect of evergreen hedges only . <p> The consultation revealed no general appetite for legislation to deal with all problem hedges . And it must be said that Government have no comparable evidence that deciduous hedges are a general problem . Although there are some letters from people who have problems with deciduous trees , these tend to relate to specific and individual sets of circumstances . They are also outnumbered by the representations we continue to receive on evergreen hedges . 
@@74241277 @2941277/ <h> High hedges on domestic sites <p> Find out how to make a complaint about a high hedge . <h> Complaints about high hedges <p> Once you have tried and exhausted all other avenues for resolving your dispute with your neighbour regarding an evergreen hedge , which is over 2 metres in height , you can complain to the Council by submitting detailed forms , supporting evidence and other documentation and a fee of 530 . <p> The Councils role , which has been set by central government , is not to mediate or negotiate between you ( the complainant ) and the hedge owner but to adjudicate on whether - in the words of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 - " the hedge is adversely affecting your reasonable enjoyment of your property " . In doing so , the Council must take account of all relevant factors and must strike a balance between the competing interests of you and the hedge owner , as well as the interests of the wider community . <p> A high hedge is defined in the Act as a barrier to light or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two or more evergreen or semi-evergreen trees or shrubs and rises to a height of more than 2 metres above ground level . Cypresses such as the infamous leylandii will be included , as will other conifers , yew , laurel , box and other **26;405;TOOLONG . However the Act will only offer control over hedges that affect domestic properties , which are defined as a dwelling or any associated garden or yard . Individual trees and shrubs will be outside the scope of the legislation . <p> If the Council consider the circumstances justify it a formal notice to the hedge owner will be issued , which will set out what they must do to the hedge to remedy the problem , and when by . Failure to carry out the works required by the authority is an offence which , on prosecution , could lead to a fine of up to 1,000 . <h> Before complaining <p> If you have been trying for a long time to resolve your concerns or if you do not get on with your neighbour mediation might be the answer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It involves an independent and impartial person ( the mediator ) helping those in dispute to work together to reach a settlement . The mediator 's job is not to make a decision . Instead , they help the people concerned to understand each other 's point of view - dealing with how they feel about the situation as well as the facts - without apportioning blame . <p> From there , the participants can move forward to think about how they could put matters right and to agree a plan of action . If mediation is to work , people must go into it willingly . <h> How to complain <p> You must supply the Council with at least 3 copies of this form and all accompanying plans , documents , correspondence and photographs . The Council will ensure this information is forwarded to the hedge owner . One copy is retained on a working file and can be viewed on request by the public , the third is retained and may be used for consultation purposes ( for example , with the Forestry Officer ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint form and all accompanying documentation for reference purposes . <p> In either of the circumstances listed below , you will need to supply the Council with one additional copy of your form and the accompanying documentation : <p> Where the owner and occupier of the site where the hedge is located are not the same person <p> If you are not the owner of the property affected by the hedge or if somebody else is occupying your property which is affected by the hedge <h> Why should I have to pay the Council to consider my complaint ? <p> The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 states that complainants must pay a fee to the Council when they submit their hedge complaint . Central government state that there are several reasons why they think this is fair and reasonable : <p> " Most people who responded to questions about fees in the 1999 consultation ' High hedges - possible solutions ' thought it was fair that the complainant should pay something for the local authority to intervene in their hedge dispute <p> Payment of a fee will encourage people to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local authority really is a last resort .

Information on empty commercial properties could also lead to crime associated with squatting such as vandalism and the theft of fixtures and fittings . The Tribunal concluded that an increase in squatting would also lead to various categories of associated criminal activity . As a result the Tribunal found that section 31(1) ( a ) was engaged in that it was likely that disclosure of the disputed information would have a negative impact on the prevention of crime . <p> The Information Commissioner 's Office has also re-confirmed section 31 is applicable for information about empty properties in a recent decision involving the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea . <p> Section 31 is a qualified exemption and - we are obliged to consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are general arguments in favour of disclosure , in relation to promoting transparency and accountability of public authorities , which we have noted in relation to this information . <p> There are also benefits in disclosure to the wider public , in relation to raising the profile of unused or vacant properties in order to encourage public debate . <h> Factors in favour of maintaining the s 31(1) ( a ) exemption <p> It is our view that there are strong arguments that weigh in favour of maintaining this exemption . <p> In the Camden case the Tribunal noted that there is an inherent public interest in crime prevention . It was also found that there were many costs associated with squatting , such as repair , security and eviction costs . The negative impact of squatting was not only directed towards to the property owners affected but also the surrounding community and public authorities involved . Ultimately the Tribunal found that the combined factors in favour of maintaining the exemption contributed very considerable weight to the public interest in withholding the information . This decision is consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Taking into account the above issues , we consider there to be no over-riding public interest in releasing this information . Any public interest would be best served by upholding the exemption under Section 31 of the FOI Act as disclosure of the information would be likely to prejudice the prevention of crime by enabling or encouraging the commission of offences . <p> Applicants should be aware that the decision to withhold this information and our reliance on exemption section 31 of the FOI Act has been upheld by an Internal Review . <h> Empty Property Scheme <p> Unfortunately we can not take motives into account when deciding what information to disclose under the FOI Act as disclosure under this legislation is disclosure to the general public . <p> We appreciate that some requesters will have honest motives for requesting this information and as such we would refer you to our Empty Property Scheme .

These are now being reviewed and updated . <h> Scope of the plans <p> The Village Plans are wide in scope all of the issues are considered and passed on to the relevant services within the Council as well as partner organisations , for example Transport for London and the Police . <p> Issues are collected in a variety of ways including meetings with local organisations and walkabouts with residents , as well as the more formal Leaders Question Times , drop in exhibitions and questionnaires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current phase of Village Plans and those prepared in 2011 is that the current plans include formal planning guidance . In the first phase of village plans many people expressed the desire to shape planning policy in their area , so now the opportunity is being taken to boost this element of the Village Plans with a dedicated section providing Village Planning Guidance . <p> In planning law it is called a Supplementary Planning Document or SPD . While it has a formal legal status ( unlike Village Plans generally ) , it is produced in a straightforward way involving the community . <p> Current Village Plans therefore have two elements : <p> A general Village Plan <p> Formal Village Planning Guidance which does not change over time <h> Village Planning Guidance ( SPD ) and Neighbourhood Plans <p> We have set out a programme to review every Village Plan in the borough and produce Village Planning Guidance covering every village , with the exception of Ham and Petersham , where the community have requested , and received , the Councils support to prepare their own plan ( called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are produced by Neighbourhood Forums rather than the Council . One of the challenges that local communities face in preparing a Neighbourhood Plan is that it is a big undertaking to develop a plan in accordance with the legal requirements and needs the commitment of volunteers . <p> We did not want communities who did not have volunteers to take on this undertaking to be excluded from developing guidance for planning decisions in their area , so we identified producing Village Planning Guidance SPDs in collaboration with local communities as a way of helping . <h> Producing the Village Plans <p> This graphic ( pdf , 44KB ) explains how Village Plans and Village Planning guidance is produced . <h> How the areas were defined <p> The village areas are based on the areas that residents most identified with in the All in One survey in 2010 . The boundaries are fluid and reflect how people live , for example living in one area and working or studying or enjoying leisure time in another . <p> Whilst the Village Plan boundaries are fluid , the Village Planning Guidance boundaries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets each relates to . <p> As far as possible the boundaries will match what people said in the All in One survey , although sometimes there are good planning reasons why this may vary . For example , a Conservation Area may lie in more than one village area , and from a planning point of view it is best to consider the Conservation Area as a whole . <h> Community input <p> Many different techniques are used to collect the views of the community , as we are keen to reach out to people who would not normally contact their councillors or council staff , as well as those who are very involved in their community . <p> We include drop in exhibitions and walkabouts because some issues , such as the physical character of the area , are best illustrated in this way , and some people prefer this form of presentation . <p> To help us produce the Village Planning Guidance we are particularly interested in what people consider to be the local character , heritage assets and local opportunities for improvement . <h> How Village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planning Guidance formal status the Council has to carry out additional consultation . <p> We put forward our initial ideas on the character of areas at the drop in exhibitions and online as part of the general Village Plan consultation <p> While the general Village Plan is then prepared for the website , all the comments relevant to planning are analysed separately and feed into the preparation of Draft Village Planning Guidance <p> We then consult again on this , and use the comments to inform the preparation of a final version of the Village Planning Guidance <p> This final version is then formally adopted for use in determining planning applications <h> Timescales <p> After engagement on the Village Plan has taken place there is further consultation on the Village Planning Guidance . It therefore takes some months to prepare Village Planning Guidance . <p> If we wish to alter Village Planning Guidance , we must go through the formal process again . <h> Viewing the Village Plans and Village Planning Guidance <p> Once we have collected the views of the community we update the Village Plans online . Village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regularly updated . <p> In order to comply with planning regulations , Village Planning Guidance is available in both hard copy and web form . <h> The impact of Village Plans <h> Influence of the plans <p> Consultation with residents identifies areas the community would like improved or changed . This information is collected and is sent to the appropriate departments , to see what is already being done , and what might be possible . From this , a range of actions are agreed to meet local needs . Sometimes it might be that we can do something directly to address an issue ; other times it might be most appropriate for the us to work with local partners or the community to address an issue . Either way , the aim is to develop a number of action points , which are then recorded online . <p> The information raised by residents is also kept on the website . This represents a store of community opinion that can help to guide future action by council services and community organisations . This takes place by providing evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities would like to see more of . <p> Finally , Village Plans can provide an impetus for community action . Consultations encourage local people to think about how they would like to improve their communities . This in turn can encourage people to consider what they can do , and also brings a range of different people and groups within the community together . In the past this has inspired a range of different community projects , which have made communities more vibrant and active . <h> How Village Planning Guidance is used <p> Village Planning Guidance ( Supplementary Planning Documents ) have to refer to a defined physical area , in order to comply with the law . These documents can not change national planning rules or planning policy as set out in , for example , the National Planning Policy Guidance , the London Plan or Richmonds own Local Plan . But they can flesh out the policy and explain how it will apply . <p> Many local and national planning policies refer to the existing character of an area . Village Planning Guidance can usefully describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borough is like , for example specific housing estates with a particular character , or shopping areas , and what features should be retained and what opportunities there are to improve the area . <p> In some villages the Village Planning Guidance may identify potential extensions to existing Conservation Areas , or areas which might be suitable to become new Conservation Areas . Every part of a village is covered in Village Planning Guidance . <p> This can be helpful for : <p> Applicants for planning permission <p> Amenity societies commenting on planning applications <p> Planning officers assessing applications <p> Councillors making planning decisions <p> Village Planning Guidance can also be used by the Council to defend its decisions when applicants appeal against the refusal of planning permission . <h> Community influence on Richmonds Planning Policy <p> Comments made as part of the Village Planning Guidance process can not change existing national or local planning policy . However , we are working on a review of our Local Plan . <p> Any comments which are relevant to how local policy might change in future are passed on to the Planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing the new Local Plan .

@@74241397 @2941397/ <h> Planning enforcement frequently asked questions <h> If someone builds something that is different from what they got planning permission for , does that mean enforcement action will be taken automatically ? <p> No . Although the Council does not condone building anything that is different to a proposal that has planning permission and it is extremely unwise and risky to do so , planning permissions do not represent the only form of proposal on that site that may be acceptable to the authority . Therefore , enforcement action would only be taken against a different and unauthorised building to that previously approved if it was considered to result in an unacceptable harm by the Council . ( See below for what is regarded as an unacceptable harm . ) <h> If someone breaks planning regulations should n't they always be punished as a matter of principle , and made to remove or stop whatever they have done ? <p> Not according to planning law . Other than in the case of unauthorised display of advertisements or works to listed buildings , carrying out building works or a change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act and , initially , not subject to penalties such as fines or imprisonment . Later in the process , if an enforcement notice has been served and not complied with , then court action and penalties such as fines can be imposed . However , planning enforcement is a discretionary power of a local authority that should only be used to put right any harm caused by a failure to comply with planning control . When there is no harm , or it is insignificant , enforcement action is generally not justified . A harm requiring enforcement action would normally occur when the breach in question results in an unacceptable departure from relevant planning policies that would have justified refusing planning permission if it had been the subject of a planning application . <h> Does n't  planning law mean some people who break the regulations get away with it ? <p> In the first instance , the objective of planning enforcement is generally not to punish those who break the regulations but to remedy any harm caused by unlawful actions . However , people who do not get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of serious consequences from enforcement action that can be extremely costly , and failure to comply with an enforcement notice can result in court action and legal penalties . It may also be difficult or impossible to sell a property if planning permissions have not been properly obtained or followed . <h> Can you apply for planning permission to keep a building or continue a use that did not get the necessary planning permission ? <p> Planning regulations do allow someone to apply for planning permission retrospectively after they have carried out unauthorised works or a use and the law requires the Council to accept and consider them . Such retrospective applications are considered on their planning merits in the same way as other applications and are not more likely to be approved or refused because they are submitted after the event . Planning permission may be granted retrospectively if the application proposal is considered to be acceptable but if this is not the case and permission is refused then it is likely that enforcement action will follow . <h> Do all alterations to houses require planning permission ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insertion of a window into the wall of an existing house , may not require planning permission at all . In such cases , no enforcement action can be taken . <h> Is building without planning permission from the Council always unlawful and potentially subject to enforcement action ? <p> No . Planning law allows some types and sizes of buildings , and some changes of use to take place without the need to get planning permission from the Council , and these are sometimes referred to as permitted development . For example , many domestic extensions and out-buildings to houses are permitted development , but those wishing to carry them out should have this confirmed prior to starting any building by the Councils Development Control department . If you complain to the planning enforcement team about a building or use being carried out , officers will initially assess whether it requires planning permission . If it is a type or size that does not , perhaps because it is permitted development , then it will not be possible for the Council to consider taking enforcement action , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal , ( for example in terms of neighbourliness ) . <h> What will the Enforcement Officer do about a complaint of an alleged breach of the planning regulations , and how long will it take ? <p> The officer will investigate the complaint and , as a first step , assess whether there has actually been a breach of planning control regulations . If there has not , then the complainant will be told and no further action will be taken . If there appears to have been a breach then a number of options for action are available ranging from informal requests to voluntarily stop or remove unauthorised work to serving formal enforcement notices requiring remedial action . These options are set out in Planning Enforcement Policy referred to above . <p> There is a right of appeal against planning enforcement notices and this , in addition to the work that is required to properly investigate some cases , means that the process of resolving a breach in regulations can take a long time .

@@74241418 @2941418/ <h> Twickenham Station development <h> Background <p> Twickenham Station is not owned by Richmond Council . In December 2011 , our Planning Committee granted planning permission for a proposal by Solum , an external developer , to improve the station . <p> Solum is a partnership between Network Rail and Kier Property that was established to bring private investment into the rail network by generating funds from the development of under-used railway land . It has completed projects at Christchurch , Epsom , Haywards Heath and Walthamstow . <p> The agreed development had been scaled down from a previous proposal which would have included over 160 additional homes and have been up to nine stories high . The development includes key improvements to the station , incorporating a new modern entrance and ticket hall , lifts to all platforms and improved public transport interchange facilities . There will also be a cafT , a riverside walk and a new public plaza with a development of flats above the scheme . <p> Since the decision was made , a group of local residents who formed Twickenham Residents Action Group ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the High Court . A judge reviewed all the evidence presented and agreed with the Council that the process followed was correct and the decision properly made . <p> TRAG appealed the decision and three Court of Appeal judges dismissed the appeal .

On 26 July 2013 three Supreme Court judges refused permission to take this any further <p> Following this , the Greater London Authority and Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government both announced that they would not be overriding the Planning Committee decision . <p> The developers decided not to commence work until after the Rugby World Cup . This will now be commencing in Spring 2017 . <h> Scheme overview <p> The scheme will provide a new station with modern facilities as well as an opportunity to build new homes and retail units around a new station plaza plus a riverside walk beside the River Crane . <p> The new station will be built on a podium over the main rail lines . This will enable a new public plaza to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will provide direct access to the platforms via steps and lifts . Retail units will be provided around the hard landscaped open plaza to create a sense of arrival . Station car parking and a new taxi pick up and drop-off facility will be provided below the podium . The number of secure bicycle spaces will be increased to 250 and changes to the bus interchange at road level are proposed . <p> New homes will be provided in three blocks built above and beside the new station . In total , around 115 apartments will be created . <p> The final key element to the redevelopment will be to open up the neglected area along the River Crane . A new riverside link will be created for pedestrians from Moormead Park to the new station plaza . This will be in association with the new pathway provided by the new Brewery Wharf development and will extend this walkway beyond the station and towards Twickenham Stoop and the new Richmond College development . <p> See the planning application which states the decision issued , the proposal with supporting documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the planning permission , Solum have to assign a Community Liaison Officer to work with the developer and the community .

It has identified areas where community services could be improved , providing opportunities for local residents and the Council to work together to make that happen . <p> Village Planning seeks to give communities as much influence in planning matters as Neighbourhood Plans . Whilst Neighbourhood Plans require communities to organise and write their plans themselves , the Council recognises that this is not feasible for every community , and that many need additional support to develop their plans . <h> All in One Results for Barnes <p> In November 2010 a postal survey was sent to every household in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views and priorities . <p> 1,174 people responded to the survey in Barnes ( representing 16% of households in the area ) , with 95% stating that they were broadly satisfied with their local area as a place to live .

@@74241455 @2941455/ <h> Wandsworth shared staffing structure <p> On 1 October 2016 , Richmond and Wandsworth Councils launched a Shared Staffing Arrangement , which will deliver substantial savings to preserve front-line services . <h> Background <p> The new Shared Staffing Arrangement is a single staffing structure across the two boroughs , delivering estimated savings of up to 10 million per year for local tax payers in each authority . Both Councils have reduced their budgets since 2010 , but significant savings are still required as local government makes its contribution to reducing the national budget deficit . <h> How it works <p> Initially the focus was on merging management structures , reducing duplication and the proportion of spending that goes on senior management . In the longer term there will be opportunities for further savings to reduce overheads ; for example , negotiating better deals from suppliers when commissioning services . <p> Since 1 October , the two Councils are now managed by a single Chief Executive , Paul Martin , and a Deputy Chief Executive and Director of Resources , Mark Maidment .

The quality of housing to be provided is as important as the quantity . Core Strategy Policies CP14 Housing and CP15 Affordable Housing set out the strategic approach . The Core Strategy sets out that within the expected housing capacity , consideration will be given to the range of housing , and its relationship with the wider issues of local character , sustainability , economic buoyancy , the labour market and supported independent living. - <p> 5.1.2 Existing housing is valued in the borough due to the constraints of limited land supply and high land values . Changes of use to housing from other uses will normally be encouraged as far as is consistent with other policies , except for employment uses ( see Employment policies ) . The retention of housing in town , local and neighbourhood centres will be encouraged including provision of housing on upper floors above retail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be encouraged to bring unused space above shops into use before proposing extensions . The provision of small units will be encouraged in sustainable locations in accordance with Policy DM HO 4 Housing Mix and Standards ' to create a mix of unit sizes. - <p> 5.1.3 As set out in the Core Strategy Policy CP1 , retaining and refurbishing existing buildings will normally be a more sustainable option if the embodied energy in the building and the impacts of removing and disposing of construction waste are taken into account and if the resulting building is fit for purpose . There should first be full consideration as to whether existing housing can be improved or converted to a satisfactory standard . Proposals for redevelopment will be assessed for benefits on the balance of the quality of housing provision including sustainability , design and amenity considerations including impacts on traffic and parking , in accordance with other relevant policies . <p> 5.1.4 There is a presumption against the loss of housing units but exceptions may be considered if other policy priorities are met and wider benefits considered e.g. increase in employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs , provision of heath facilities , or infrastructure . <p> 5.1.5 It is recognised that RSLs are subject to complex financial regulations and have to address specific needs . Therefore exceptions to policy will be considered in cases where conversions or redevelopment will result in units being retained and managed as affordable housing by a RSL or similar body , in furtherance of the Council 's Housing and Supporting People Strategies . <p> 5.1.6 Reversions of houses converted into flats back into a single family dwelling house may be considered acceptable if the property was originally a single family dwelling house and it can be demonstrated the loss of units will be outweighed by environmental , street scene , transport or parking benefits which could not be easily achieved without the reversion . <p> 5.1.7 The conversion of larger types of houses to flats can make a contribution to meeting certain housing needs and provides the opportunity to meet the need for small units . However , it must be recognised that only certain types of property are suitable for conversion , and that there are some areas where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , or lead to unacceptable parking conditions . In considering in principle the suitability of a property for conversion the Council will take into account : <p> the size of the property and its physical characteristics , including layout and size of rooms ; <p> 5.1.8 In cases where the Council accepts that in principle a property may be suitable for conversion , the design of the conversion will be required to provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation and contribute positively to its surroundings . If a property is considered suitable for conversion , the Council will take account of the following design considerations in assessing the proposal : <h> Policy DM HO 2 <h> Infill Development <p> All infill development must reflect the character of the surrounding area and protect the amenity of neighbours . In considering applications for infill development the following factors will be taken into account : <p> Plot width - plots must be sufficient width to allow a dwelling(s) to be sited with adequate separation between dwellings ; <p> Spacing between dwelling - new dwellings must have similar spacing between buildings to any established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildlife habitats - features important to character , appearance or wildlife must be retained or re-provided ; <p> Impact on neighbours - including loss of privacy to homes or gardens . <p> 5.1.10 Infill development involves the development of a small gap in an otherwise built up frontage , this could be a separate unit or units or an extension to an existing unit , and could include side garden plots . It excludes back garden and other backland development which is subject to Policy DM HO 3 Backland Development ' . It can include garden land which is now excluded from the definition of previously developed land and there is now no automatic presumption that this land is suitable for housing development . <p> 5.1.11 It is important that infill development reinforces the character of streets by reflecting the scale , mass , height , form , fenestration and architectural details of its neighbours . <p> 5.1.12 The character of streets has often been weakened by infilling space between dwellings . In considering new infill development the width of the remaining and the new plot should be similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between dwellings , building line and height should be maintained. - <p> 5.1.13 Character is also determined by materials and architectural details and these should reflect existing materials and predominant styles . <p> Proposed new LDF indicator : Percentage of housing development on backgarden land out of all housing completions Target:TBC ( once time series data available ) <h> Policy DM HO 3 <h> Backland Development <p> There will be a presumption against loss of back gardens due to the need to maintain local character , amenity space and biodiversity . In exceptional cases where it is considered that a limited scale of backland development may be acceptable it should not have a significantly adverse impact upon the following : <p> Garden land- " - rear garden land which contributes either individually or as part of a larger swathe of green space to amenity of residents or provides wildlife habitats must be retained ; <p> Impact on neighbours " privacy of existing homes and gardens must be maintained and unacceptable light spillage avoided ; <p> Vehicular access or car parking " these must not have an adverse impact on neighbours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Access roads between dwellings and unnecessarily long access roads will not normally be acceptable ; <p> Mass and scale of development " development on backland sites must be more intimate in scale and lower than frontage properties ; <p> Trees , shrubs and wildlife habitats- " features important to character , appearance or wildlife must be retained or re-provided . <p> 5.1.15 Most backland development in the borough involves loss of garden land . The recent changes to PPS3 to exclude private residential gardens from the definition of previously developed land emphasise that there is no presumption that garden land is suitable for housing . In general the Council will not accept proposals for developments on back garden land but proposals for development of backland sites in other uses will be considered subject to the criteria above and other relevant policies . Side garden plots would be considered under Policy DM HO 2 Infill Development ' . <p> 5.1.16 The restrictive approach reflects the direct and indirect value of gardens contributing to local character , providing safe and secure amenity and play space , supporting biodiversity , helping to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat island ' effect . <p> 5.1.17 The London Plan review proposed greater recognition to the contribution of gardens ( especially back gardens ) and suggests a presumption against their loss where it can be locally justified . Given the limited contribution from back garden development and the direction of travel of the London Plan and emerging housing targets for the Borough ( which have reduced the contribution from garden development ) , the Council will restrict garden development where gardens make a significant contribution to local character , ecology and/or the general environment . In assessing local ecological value the Council will take into account the length and overall size of the gardens and value of adjacent land as larger areas support a wider range and number of species . Gardens are also important in establishing the character of certain parts of the borough and this is recognised in the Design Quality Supplementary Planning Document and in various Conservation Area studies . The Council 's Tree and Landscape Strategy recognises the value of mature trees in gardens .

The housing mix should be appropriate to the location . <p> All new housing development , including conversions , are required to comply with external and internal space standards. - <p> The Council will only grant planning permission for new dwellings that provide adequate internal space and appropriate external private and/ or communal amenity space to meet the needs generated by the development . Development must take account of accessible design as required by Policy CP14 . <p> Amenity space for all new dwellings should be : <p> private , usable , functional and safe ; <p> easily accessible from living areas ; <p> orientated to take account of need for sunlight and shading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the likely number of occupiers ; <p> accommodation likely to be occupied by families with young children should have direct and easy access to adequate private amenity space . <p> In areas of poor housing environment the Council will seek appropriate improvements by tree planting , provision of open space and play space , when opportunities arise . <p> 5.1.19 In order to retain the character of established residential areas new development should provide family sized accommodation . This will provide for a range of family needs and single person households who need accommodation for visitors or home-working . There are an increasing proportion of one person households and on appropriate sites an element of small units ( 1 bedroom or bedsits ) will also be required in accordance with Core Strategy Policy CP14 . <p> 5.1.20 Town centres provide the most appropriate locations for small units and schemes would be expected to provide more small units in the most accessible areas of Richmond and Twickenham town centres . <p> 5.1.21 The appropriate mix of dwellings sizes for affordable housing is set out in Core Strategy Policy CP15 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to address the housing mix requirements for both the private and affordable elements to overall maximise provision to meet priority needs . <p> 5.1.22 It is recognised that adequate space in the home has an effect on health , diversity and community cohesion and that insufficient space provision in the housing stock will therefore impact on local services . It is an important issue in the borough given the scarcity of housing land supply and particularly to prevent sub-standard accommodation in small units in the private rented sector . It is important to make efficient use of land and cater for changing lifestyles , including home working , and accord with requirements for Lifetimes Homes Standards and wheelchair housing as set out in Core Strategy CP14 . Standards are expected to be equivalent to those applied across London , which will also be used as a benchmark , but in some areas the Council may , based on local characteristics , set out specifically local priorities . <p> 5.1.23 Affordable housing is covered by separate standards .

Narrowing the gap will increase flexibility into the system and potentially assist if tenure changes are considered , such as related to viability in different economic climates. - <p> 5.1.24 This policy applies to flats and houses . The Council 's Residential Development Standards SPD ( 2010 ) sets out residential space standards . It includes baseline standards for the net internal floor area of flats , including for the kitchen/dining/living area . <p> 5.1.25 For amenity space , there are general guidelines as the type and size of space will vary according to the size and use of the dwelling , set out in more detail in the Residential Development Standards SPD. - Provision should ensure a balanced range of public , communal and private space . The aspect , usability , sense of enclosure and prevailing pattern established by local character will all be taken into account in assessing whether private gardens will provide sufficiently good living conditions . For houses a minimum total private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2 beds should be provided . To provide adequate private amenity space for development of flats , a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space for 1-2 person dwellings should be provided and an extra 1 sqm should be provided for each additional occupant ( as set out in the Mayor 's Housing Design Guide ) . - Flats at upper levels may have a private balcony area , if in accordance with Policy DM DC 6 Balconies and Upper Floor Terraces ' , and in addition should have access to communal open space . <p> 5.1.26 There are additional requirements for play space . Accommodation likely to be occupied by families with young children should have direct and easy access to a private garden . Ground level family units within a block of flats should have larger private amenity spaces . Flats at upper levels may share play space as part of a community garden and/or have a private balcony area , as outlined in the paragraph above . As set out in CP17 and Policy DM OS 7 Children 's and Young People 's Play Facilities ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking distance . There is further guidance in the London wide London Plan SPG Providing for Children and Young People 's Play and Informal Recreation . <p> 5.1.28 Conversions are expected to comply with the same standards as new development .

These types of accommodation generally need to be protected and encouraged given the constraints of land supply and affordability issues in the borough . The limited land supply means that new developments must be directed at identified local needs . <p> 5.1.30 Although there may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of housing to meet specific community needs can include sheltered housing with care support , staffed hostels , residential care homes/nursing homes , extra-care housing , provision by local colleges , hotels and other institutions for their students and/or staff . These include supported housing provision for children , older persons and other client groups . Each may have specific local needs and their requirements need to be recognised . <p> 5.1.31 Local need can be identified on the basis of up to date evidential need and particularly related to the Council 's Housing and Supporting People strategies , and any specific reviews concerning supported housing for specific client groups , and the investment priorities set out in the South West London Housing Partnership Investment Framework , or other relevant strategies. - <p> 5.1.32 The Investment Framework sets out the supported housing client groups that are a priority , currently 98% of homes for general needs ( and of that 80% family housing ) and 2% for supported housing . <p> 5.1.33 The Older Peoples Supported Accommodation Review ( 2008 ) identified : no additional requirements for residential care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care ; and adequate affordable social sheltered accommodation .

The use proposed for any site must be kept under regular review and not assumed to have stayed the same , as communities needs can change within a short time period . If there is no evidential need arising within the borough , other priorities should be addressed and the capacity for conventional housing should not be compromised . Limited land means that needs arising from outside the borough will not generally be supported . <p> 5.1.36 Provision is encouraged in accessible locations and integrated within communities . <p> 5.1.37 High quality design standards , relevant to client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal and external space e.g. for older people accommodation should address specific needs such as storage of electric buggies in dry locations , increasing wheelchair housing and turning circles for day centre buses . <h> Affordable Housing <p> 5.1.38 The ability to provide sufficient affordable housing in the borough continues to be a challenge . The need for affordable housing has been confirmed by local evidence , with the strategic approach to increasing provision set out in Core Strategy Policy CP15 and the Sub-Regional Investment Framework . This currently requires a tenure mix of 80% housing for social rent and 20% intermediate housing . Preference is for on-site provision and the affordable housing priority is for larger social rented units . <h> Policy DM HO 6 <h> Delivering Affordable Housing <p> The Council will seek the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing when negotiating on individual private residential and mixed-use schemes , having regard to the strategic borough-wide target and the individual circumstances of the site , in accordance with Policy CP15 . <p> On sites capable of less than 10 units gross , a financial contribution to the Affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required : <p> No of units <p> % Affordable Housing <p> AH Homes <p> 9 units <p> 45% <p> 4.05 <p> 8 units <p> 40% <p> 3.20 <p> 7 units <p> 35% <p> 2.45 <p> 6 units <p> 30% <p> 1.8 <p> 5 units <p> 25% <p> 1.25 <p> 4 units <p> 20% <p> 0.8 <p> 3 units <p> 15% <p> 0.45 <p> 2 units <p> 10% <p> 0.20 <p> 1 unit <p> 5% <p> 0.05 <p> The level of the contribution required will be based on the difference between the gross development value of the whole scheme as a market scheme and the equivalent as an affordable housing scheme , divided by the number of homes in the scheme , to give the subsidy per home , that will be multiplied by the number of AH Homes relating to the size of the scheme as set out above . <p> As outlined in Core Strategy Section 7.2 Costs and Viability , in considering proposals or financial contributions , the Council will have regard to : <p> economic viability ; <p> individual site costs ; <p> the availability of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other planning benefits . <p> 5.1.39 In considering the maximum amount that can be achieved on site , the Council will have regard to the Core Strategy CP15 , the suitability of the site for different forms of provision and the economics of site development . Particularly in the current uncertain economic climate , an assessment of economic viability is important which is sensitive to location and the nature of the existing use . Where affordable housing involves dwellings with larger numbers of habitable rooms per dwelling , or different sizes of habitable rooms with different tenures , it may be more appropriate for the calculation of the affordable housing proportion to be in terms of habitable rooms or floor space . The Council will nonetheless expect developers to have taken into consideration any abnormal costs in developing a site before negotiating or acquiring land or an option . <p> 5.1.40 The threshold is expressed in terms of the capability of the site , in order to overcome attempts to evade thresholds . For example , these could be by lowering densities , failing to provide the required mix of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same site or adjoining sites , or by incremental acquisition of sites . <p> Off-site Contributions from Small Sites <p> 5.1.41 In the context of Richmond small sites make a significant contribution to housing supply and the cumulative impact of these sites should contribute to affordable housing provision . CP15 states that on sites below the threshold of capable of ten or more units gross ' , a financial contribution to the Affordable Housing Fund will be sought on sites involving new-build housing . Policy CP15 states the amount involved will be set out in this DPD and reviewed annually. - <p> 5.1.42 This policy sets out further details of the methodology for calculating the contribution : the amount is proportionate to strategic borough-wide target but applies a sliding scale that decreases with a decrease in total number of units proposed ; the amount reflects local values and take account of other development costs , the focus is on achieving financial neutrality in terms of on or off-site provision ; and contributions will only be spent on affordable housing that would be in addition to affordable housing that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the developer would have put in , had the scheme been entirely for affordable housing , applied to the sliding scale of contributions sought related to the size of the scheme . <p> 5.1.43 As a benchmark , the GLA/Three Dragons Toolkit has borough-wide benchmark property prices for properties of different sizes and types . Variation may be applied on more location-specific values . Further detail including worked examples will be set out in Affordable Housing SPD . <p> 5.1.44 Contribution will be secured via a legal agreement. - All contributions made to the ring-fenced Affordable Housing Fund are re-used for new affordable housing , or for bringing existing private properties back into use as affordable housing , or for enhanced provision through re-modelling existing affordable units or supported schemes , in pursuance of housing and planning objectives. - The financial contribution will not be converted into the actual delivery of units on an identified linked site , unless suitable , as it may be amalgamated to deliver affordable housing in the most effective way . <p> 5.1.45 An annually updated schedule of costs will be published ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Housing SPD ) . <p> 5.1.46 This cost should be factored into negotiations on land values in the borough . The onus will be on developers to pay for viability assessments and any cost of independent assessment . The Council will only consider reducing planning obligations if fully justified through a financial appraisal model or other evidence . This will be the exception rather than the rule . The Council will expect this contribution in addition to any other requirements set out in the Planning Obligations Strategy SPD . If , due to viability , the Council will consider accepting a reduction in contributions , consideration will be on a case by case basis as to whether to prioritise funding for affordable housing or other priorities such as education and transport . As an alternative to financial contributions provision could be made on site . Conversions are recognised as different because development costs are usually higher than with new build . <p> 5.1.47 If the Community Infrastructure Levy is introduced within the borough , this policy will be subject to review .

During her childhood which was spent at her familys house at Hyde Park Gate , London and at their country house in St. Ives , Cornwall , she displayed those characteristics which were to develop and intensify themselves in later life : a brilliant creative intelligence , allied to a delicate nervous constitution . <p> After her fathers death in 1904 , she moved with her sister Vanessa and her brother Adrian to 26 , Gordon Square , Bloomsbury , where her first serious writing began . The earliest work consisted of literary criticism : she contributed articles to various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until her death . <p> The house in Gordon Square became the regular meeting place for a group of brilliant young men whom Virginias eldest brother , Thoby , had known at Cambridge . They included Roger Fry , J.M. Keynes , Lytton Strachey , E.M . Forster , Leonard Woolf and Clive Bell . To those outside its circle , the group became known as the " Bloomsbury Group " . <p> In 1912 , Virginia married a member of the group : Leonard Woolf , a journalist , publicist and writer on political topics . The couple lived partly in London and partly in Sussex . <p> In October 1914 , Leonard and Virginia Woolf moved to Richmond , where they occupied rooms in a house on the east side of The Green : number 17 . Leonard describes some amusing incidents which he experienced here in the volume of his autobiography called Beginning again . ( 1964 ) . <p> Hogarth House . Photograph . <p> Early in March 1915 the couple moved to Hogarth House in Paradise Road . This was part of the present Suffield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , situated next to the premises of the North Surrey Squash Rackets Club . <p> The move to Hogarth House came at an unhappy and unsettled period in their life , for Virginia was suffering from a severe attack of the mental illness which was to recur at various times during her life . In 1913 she had completed her first novel The Voyage Out ( published in 1915 ) . As was the case with each book that she wrote , the work had left her in a state of extreme physical , mental and nervous exhaustion and in September 1913 she attempted to take her own life . By the summer of 1914 she appeared to have fully recovered . In February 1915 , however , there was another , more violent recurrence of the illness which this time lasted until about 1917 . <p> Leonard was anxious to find some hobby or occupation in which he and his wife could engage and which would serve as a relief from her writing , with all its attendant mental stress . They were both interested , as amateurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased a small handpress , some old typeface and the necessary accompanying implements and materials . The first book was issued from this modest equipment in July 1917 . It was a 32 page pamphlet entitled Two stories containing Virginias story The Mark on the wall and one by her husband called Three Jews . The title page bore the imprint " Hogarth Press , Richmond 1917 " . Thus began the life of a publishing house which was to become world famous . <p> In the years immediately following , the business of the press expanded rapidly , additional equipment was installed at Hogarth House and some of the work of printing was handled by outside firms . However , sixteen of the thirty-two books which were published during the years that the press was in Richmond ( 1917 to 1924 ) were printed by the Woolfs own hand . These sixteen included two works of Virginias : the story mentioned above and Kew Gardens . In the latter , the author conveys not only the visual impression of the gardens themselves but also the mood of the typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diary on July 20th 1919 , she describes , with typically acute observation , her impressions of the " peace " celebrations held in Richmond that year : <p> " After sitting through the procession and the peace bells unmoved , I began after dinner to feel that if something was going on , perhaps one had better be in itThe doors of the public house at the corner were open and the room crowded ; couples waltzing ; songs being shouted , waveringly , as if one must be drunk to sing . A troop of little boys with lanterns were parading the Green , beating sticks . Not many shops went to the expense of electric light . A woman of the upper classes was supported dead drunk between two men partially drunk . <p> " We followed a moderate stream flowing up the Hill . Illuminations were almost extinct half way up , but we kept on till we reached the Terrace . And then we did see something not much indeed , for the damp had deadened the chemicals .

Rising over the Thames , among trees , these rockets were beautiful ; the lights on the faces of the crowd was strange ; yet of course there was grey mist muffling everything and taking the blaze off the fire " <p> Besides The Mark on the wall and Kew Gardens , two of Virginias other works were first published under the Richmond imprint of the Hogarth Press : the collection of short sketches called Monday or Tuesday ( 1921 ) and the novel Jacobs room ( 1922 ) . The appearance of the former marked the real turning point of Virginias career , for in these sketches she was experimenting with a new technique of writing which enabled her , in the words of David Daiches : - <p> " to embody in fiction her conception of the flux of experience , a style that was flexible , impressionistic , meditative . " <p> This technique was to be further developed in Jacobs room and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House to 52 , Tavistock Square , London in March 1924 . <p> Besides writing novels and short stories , Virginia also assisted S.S. Koteliansky in translating a number of Russian works into English . Her critical writings are , of course , another important part of her work , notably the two collection called The Common reader ( published in 1925 and 1932 ) which contain some of her best prose . <p> Her last novel , published in the year of her death was Between the Acts . Early in 1941 , the symptoms of mental illness reasserted themselves and in April of that year she drowned herself in the river near the house which she and Leonard owned in Rodmell , Sussex .
