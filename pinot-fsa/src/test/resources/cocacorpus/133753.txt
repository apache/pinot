@@73450486 @2150486/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> When she took office in 2016 , Prime Minister Theresa May announced that increasing the country 's supply of housing , or more specifically , affordable housing , would be central to her administration . It 's fair to say that , to date , she is delivering on this promise . In the months since arriving at Number Ten Downing Street , she has overseen the announcement of a raft of measures aimed at easing the housing crisis . The Government has , for instance , banned letting agency fees for tenants , identified the sites of numerous new garden communities , offered funding to local authorities to build homes in areas with a large proportion of non-resident homeowners and pledged resources to help with infrastructure development to support new housing projects . Just this week , in fact , Communities Minister Sajid Javid confirmed a previous central governmental commitment to provide around 7 billion for programmes connected with " turbo-charging " the construction of new , affordable residential properties across Britain . While many social policy think tanks , charities and industry bodies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we are going to make a meaningful inroad into the problem , most would readily admit that the signs are more encouraging than they have been for decades . Further significant interventions are expected to be proposed when Mr Javid releases the Government 's long-awaited White Paper on housing later this month and , while some of its contents are still subject to speculation , a couple of intriguing policies have already found their way into the public domain . <p> Return of the prefab <p> Associated with the massive house building programme started after the Second World War , " prefabs " or " modular homes " are quick and comparatively inexpensive to erect and are therefore uniquely suited to accelerating construction projects and helping to solve pressing housing crises . Sajid Javid says that they will form a key component of the upcoming White Paper . There is a certain amount of cynicism around modular homes and at least one newspaper harked back to the days when they were associated with slums and decaying housing estates . To counter this reaction , Mr Javid said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Netherlands where a new generation of modular homes has been developed and where they are proving to be a popular and widely-respected solution to those countries ' own housing shortages . He said that the homes being delivered are of a high quality , are stylish and attractive and could be a realistic proposition for the United Kingdom . <p> It has also been pointed out that many of Britain 's post-war " prefabs " have lasted incredibly well , enduring significantly beyond the expected thirty or forty years of service they were forecast to provide . There are also numerous projects already in hand which are making use of the availability of modular homes . In an earlier column , we discussed an Anglo-Chinese partnership established to create six or so factories to manufacture these homes , and , across the country , there are examples springing up quite frequently . Consider , for example , this story from the North East of England which involves a former shipyard on the Tyne being transformed into a residential housing estate : LONG ... <p> Discussing the policy , Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes being built and that the very nature of modular homes , namely speed and cheapness of manufacture , means that they could give the Government 's house building ambitions a real shot in the arm . <p> We do n't , of course , know the full details of the proposal yet , but the industry will be looking forward to seeing the White Paper and offering its views on what is being touted as a radical and innovative approach to solving the housing crisis . <p> Changes to planning laws <p> The White Paper is also expected to propose modifications to existing planning laws to make it easier for local authorities to build homes themselves and to give planning permission to private developers . There is , by way of example , thought to be a provision in the White Paper that would allow councils to allow building on some green belt areas and compensate for this loss by designating new locations as " green belt " . Similarly , it is thought that there may be further deregulation of brownfield site management in order that this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes . These features , naturally enough , have long been on the wish lists issued by the various housing economists and property experts . <p> In truth , though , they are n't without controversy . The FT newspaper and others are reporting that many Conservative Members of Parliament are deeply opposed to changes to Britain 's planning regime , partly because such actions would be unpopular with rural and countryside groups , partly because they worry that the policy would be extremely unpopular with constituents ( in other words , voters ) and partly because localism was a key plank of the Government 's manifesto and this seems to be an erosion of that policy . It is hinted that many of these opponents would be prepared to defy the Government whip on the issue . Mr Javid has said more than once that the country will need to abandon its so-called NIMBYism if we are serious about providing affordable homes in large numbers . We simply do n't have the luxury of being able to pick and choose where we build homes . The counter argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserving the character of their neighbourhoods and the charge of NIMBYism is a little unfair . Equally , there are legitimate concerns around critical infrastructure , such as roads and schools , and whether and how the facilities to accommodate new populations will be funded . Certainly , this debate is likely to be heated and intense and will be watched with interest by the industry and the public at large . <p> The team here at Nethouseprices will be monitoring these stories and wider issues emerging from the upcoming White Paper , and will keep you posted on developments as they happen .

@@73450491 @2150491/ <h> How to prove and calculate private residence relief ( PRR ) <h> Tax expert Steve Sims explains how to prove and work out private residence relief when selling a buy-to-let property . <p> Property investors who sell a buy-to-let property may try to establish that they lived in the home to claim private residence relief to save Capital Gains Tax ( CGT ) . However its worth bearing in mind that claiming a buy-to-let property as your main home sets alarm bells ringing for the tax man . <p> Unfortunately tax law does n't indicate how long someone has to live in a property before it 's officially regarded as home . The law instead talks about quality rather than quantity of occupation . <p> Two recent tax tribunal cases have helped confirm some of the factors taken into account to prove PRR . In each of the cases HM Revenue &amp; Customs ( HMRC ) looked at each claim separately and ticked boxes on a list to indicate whether the property was a home or a buy-to-let . <h> Proving PRR checklist <p> Was the property the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility bills in the owners name and sent to the property ( not another address ) ? <p> Was council tax exemption claimed ? <p> Did the local council pay housing benefit on the property ? <p> Was the owner on the electoral roll for the property ? <p> Where was the owner registered with a local doctor ? <p> When was the home advertised for sale ? <p> Was the property purchased with a buy-to-let or residential mortgage ? <p> Does the DVLA have the owners car registered at the address ? <p> Do telephone and internet bills tie up with the dates the owner claimed residence ? <p> Does the owner have photographic evidence of living there ? <p> Is the property in a habitable state ? <p> Where do the owners children live and go to school ? <p> Does the owner have a partner , and if so , where do they live ? <p> Is the property within a reasonable commute of the owners workplace ? <p> Tax inspectors and tribunal judges will want to see that someone has genuinely lived in a property as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a few years . <p> Recently judges have explained that when a property went on sale is important . Their argument is an owner could n't have intended to make the property a permanent home if they 'd moved in just prior to sale . <h> Why claim Private Residence Relief ? <p> PRR reduces CGT on your main home to zero for the time you live there and adds 18 months CGT exemption as a tax bonus if you have to move out before you sell . <p> If you can claim PRR and have let the property to a tenant paying rent at a commercial rate , you can also claim letting relief . Letting relief is another CGT relief worth up to 40,000 for each property owner . The key point is commercial rate . Homes where friends or relatives live for free or pay the mortgage and bills but no rent are uncommercial let 's . Owners pay CGT on disposal of an uncommercial let but ca n't claim letting relief . <p> Combined , PRR and letting relief can significantly reduce the amount of CGT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tax rules lay out a formula for PRR if the seller has only lived in the property as their home for part of the time of ownership . <p> The formula is : <p> The formula is : <p> Total gain ( ) <p> x <p> Period of occupation <p> Total period of ownership <p> To work through this formula , calculate the time you have owned the property and the time you have lived there as a main home plus 18 months . <p> Take this example of Peter , who bought a home for 150,000 in January 2001 and sold it for 400,000 in January 2015 . He lived in the property for just one year after buying and then rented out the home as a buy-to-let . <p> The calculation is easier in months rather than years because the 18-month bonus period converts to a fraction 1.5 years : <p> A <p> Owned from January 2001 until January 2015 <p> 168 months ( 14 years ) <p> B <p> Lived in as main residence from January 2001 until January 2002 <p> 12 months <p> C <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months <p> D <p> Total CGT exempt occupation ( B+C ) <p> 30 months <p> E <p> Chargeable gain <p> 250,000 <p> F <p> CGT exempt gain ( 250,000 x 30/168 ) <p> 44,653 <p> G <p> Gain chargeable to CGT ( 250,000 x 138/168 ) <p> 205,357 <p> Deemed occupation is the 18 month bonus period . <p> Total CGT exempt occupation is the time Peter lived in the house as his main home plus the period of deemed occupation ( B+C ) . <p> PRR is Step F and calculated as : <p> PRR is Step F and calculated as : <p> Total gain ( ) <p> x <p> A - D <p> A <p> Where A is the period of ownership and D is the period of CGT exempt occupation . <p> Step G is effectively the gain less Step F. <p> Remember , each owner will have their own PRR calculation if they 've lived in the property . 
@@73450494 @2150494/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> Halifax , the mortgage lender , has in recent days issued a fascinating report showing conclusively that house price growth in the United Kingdom 's so-called new towns , has , markedly in some cases , outperformed the national average during the past ten years . Towns like Corby , Milton Keynes , Skelmersdale , Telford and Warrington , urban centres largely constructed after the Second World War in an effort to solve the country 's housing crisis and absorb a burgeoning population , are growing in popularity with house hunters , for a couple of key reasons . Firstly , they are often located close to , and have the advantages of , big cities , without their glaring defects of those cities , such as the inflated cost of residential property , overcrowding and higher crime rates . Secondly , the available housing in these communities is typically quite modern and comfortable , needing comparatively little maintenance , which is always a boon to hard-working householders . In this short piece , we look at house price trends in those new towns , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keynes and the London commuter belt <p> In many ways regarded as the archetypal British new town , Milton Keynes celebrates its fiftieth birthday this year . It was , in fact , this " milestone " birthday which inspired the Halifax study into the growth of house prices in some 26 new towns . Situated in Buckinghamshire , around seventy miles from London , Milton Keynes is highlighted in the report as having recorded the most impressive growth in the price of its residential property during the past three decades . By way of example , house prices in the town have grown by an astonishing 601 per cent since 1986 , with the cost of the average property now standing at an impressive 309,415 . <p> It 's in the past decade , though , that growth has been most startling . House prices in new towns generally have risen by as much as 32 per cent , from an average of 173,337 in 2006 to 228,902 last year . A hike of over 55,000 in just ten years ! In fairness , the majority of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years are located within comfortable commuting distance of London . Just to illustrate this point , Halifax found that Hemel Hempstead , Stevenage and Welwyn Garden City have seen by far the most dramatic price increases since 2006 . Homes in Hertfordshire 's Welwyn Garden City , for instance , have skyrocketed in cost by an incredible 67 per percent . To put this statistic in some sort of context , it compares with a national average of 26 per cent growth in the same period . <p> Midlands and the North West <p> Growth is n't wholly restricted to the London commuter belt although , in truth , the remaining high performing new towns are typically pretty close to other large , vibrant cities . Other locations identified as recording significant growth in the last decade include : <p> - Telford in Shropshire - 30 miles from Birmingham - average house price 178,568 - growth of 586 per cent - Corby in Northamptonshire - 23 miles from Northampton - average house price 173,633 - growth of 561 per cent - Warrington in Cheshire - 20 miles from both Liverpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 559 per cent - Skelmersdale in Lancashire - 13 miles from Liverpool - average house price 138,466 - growth of 551 per cent - Redditch in Worcestershire - 15 miles from Birmingham - average house price 210,149 - growth of 521 per cent . <p> The cities mentioned in the above list have , of course , all experienced strong economic expansion and the resulting house price inflation in recent years . As Martin Ellis , Housing Economist at the Halifax , argued , this explains the increasing popularity of the local new towns , especially during the past ten years . Homes are more affordable , but are still close enough to the attractions and amenities of the big city . <p> North East England , Scotland and Wales <p> House prices in these regions of Great Britain are traditionally somewhat less expensive than elsewhere and this is , to an extent , reflected in the relatively subdued house price growth of their respective new towns . Nonetheless , there were some encouraging figures noted in all these areas . In the North East , for example , Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles ) from Newcastle , Durham and Sunderland , racked up an increase of some 438 per cent , so houses now cost an average of 148,635 . Similarly , in neighbouring County Durham , Newton Aycliffe , a town just five miles north of Darlington , saw prices rise by 418 per cent to around 157,625 . <p> Farther north , in Scotland 's Livingston , a town which is approximately 15 miles west of Edinburgh and 30 miles east of Glasgow , house prices jumped by 423 per cent to 161,184 . In the meantime , the cost of housing in East Kilbride , Scotland 's first designated new town , spiralled to 150,785 , a rise of 406 per cent . <p> Finally , Wales was n't unrepresented in the Halifax study , with Cwmbran in Gwent recording a rise of 388 per cent in the cost of residential property . A house or flat in the town now costs an average of 159,294 . <p> More new towns and villages on their way <p> As we reported in a previous column , Gavin Barwell , housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and villages up and down Britain , to help solve the housing crisis of the modern era . While the development of these communities , which are expected to deliver homes for some 200,000 families , will take some time and will almost certainly meet with difficulties and local objections , the proposals have been welcomed by housing charities , social justice think tanks and businesses alike . The Halifax findings , which highlight the economic and social value of new towns , will surely add an exclamation point to the positivity surrounding Mr Barwell 's plans . <p> The team at Nethouseprices will be monitoring this and other stories as they emerge .

Prices have surged of late , both for rental accommodation and owner-occupied homes . To put this growth into context , Zoopla have reported that the average house price in the Salford Quays area is -169,281 , a huge 12.34% growth in 2 years , as well as demanding average rents of in excess of -800 per month . <p> Because of the popularity of Salford Quays , people are more than proving their readiness to pay these prices ( and oftentimes above the average price ) to secure their property in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as tenants are fast becoming enamoured with the area .

Perhaps the most high-profile development in the area is X1 Media City , a development housing over 1,000 apartments and is soon to be the largest residential development in the North West .

The first tower of the development was more than 50% sold out in as little as 6 weeks , and is nearing fully sold out status , just as the second tower is released onto the market . <p> Needless to say , this is an exciting time for the area .

@@73450510 @2150510/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> As a portfolio landlord incensed by George Osbornes fiscal attack on landlords I have written a report which explains in detail how this approach to the private rental sector is doomed to cause great distress for landlords and tenants throughout the country as well as being a morally reprehensible move by the Government of a civilised country . <p> By far the most significant of the recent attacks is Section 24 of the Finance ( No. 2 ) Act 2015 and this is the policy which needs to be urgently re-visited with a view to scrapping it before its planned implementation from April 2017 . <p> Section 24 is the clause which was described by George Osborne as the removal of landlords tax relief on finance costs , but which actually consists of the disallowing of finance costs when calculating profit . This is an incredible departure from normal accounting practices as it means that a large part of landlords costs ( usually the main cost ) will now magically be re-interpreted as profit , even though it is n't . <p> This is not my interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other senior personnel in the Institute of Fiscal Studies , the Institute of Economic Affairs , the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales and the Taxpayers Alliance ( none of whom have a remit to support landlords ) have all published vigorous critiques of this change in the tax regime . For example the IEA stated that it makes no sense , and the IFS said that it was plain wrong to expect a business to pay tax on profit but not to allow that business to deduct the costs of making that profit . <p> Other businesses should be alert to this dramatic and discriminatory ( it only affects unincorporated landlords with finance costs ) abandonment of the principle profit = revenue costs . The Telegraph finance editors have rightly described it as absurd and idiotic and an Alice in Wonderland tax one would expect a lunatic dictator to introduce . These are sober journalists who do not deal in hyperbole . <p> For portfolio landlords the effects will be most dramatic , with the logical conclusion of s24 being that many landlords will pay huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlord has a large number of properties for example , all of the finance costs for each property will be added together and tax will be payable on this debt . So landlords who provide housing including to millions of people on low-pay and benefits , will now have their tax bills increase exponentially . The Government seems to be punishing landlords for providing the essential housing needed , especially since the mass sale of social housing . <p> My report provides clear evidence of how landlords will face huge effective tax bills , with two real case studies showing effective tax rates of 83% and 93% for two portfolio landlords as soon as Section 24 is fully in place . Interest rate rises are likely to cause the tax rate to exceed 100% of their real profit . It will even be payable on a loss , making the rate infinite . <p> Indeed the tax will be confiscatory as if the landlord is able to pay this hugely increased tax burden out of another salary or savings , the salary/savings will be confiscated by the Government . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bankrupt him or her , and the property will be confiscated by the lender . Tenants will be evicted and landlords livelihoods and lives will be ruined . <p> To examine how the Government could have made such an incredible move against landlords one needs to understand how and why landlords have been made the scapegoats of a housing crisis which is in fact due to a decades-long under-supply of new dwellings . Landlords have actually made a huge contribution to the supply of new dwellings over recent decades , and yet , ironically are now seen as part of the problem rather than as part of the solution . <p> I believe that the basis for this misrepresentation of landlords was set by organisations such as Shelter and many sections of the media who have vilified private landlords for years ( despite surveys showing that more than 80% of tenants are satisfied with their homes ) . It is highly regrettable that they have been allowed to paint this picture of landlords as though they are all rogues and as though all tenants are angels . <p> Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult for landlords to find any voices of support within politics ; it is more the case that there has been competition amongst MPs as to who can be the most anti-landlord . Gradually though a handful of politicians are starting to speak up against this absurd attack on landlords . <p> The Conservative MP , David Jones has described it as profoundly unconservative , and Lord Flight , a former shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury has recognised what a betrayal this is of many landlords who voted Conservative as they were the only political party which did not have explicit anti-landlord policies , during the general election campaign . <p> As there was no consultation with experts or stakeholders of any kind ( itself a highly questionable approach for Government to take ) before this policy was announced , there was no valid analysis of how many landlords would be affected , and the impact report on the measure did not mention tenants as an impacted group , although one estimate is that 4.6 million tenants will be affected , with the most in need being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take into account the fact that even before Section 24 was announced , UK landlords received worse tax treatment than all their counterparts in the advanced world , with the exception of Ireland . The evidence for this , too , is in my report . These are not just statements ; they are backed up by hard evidence . <p> Astonishingly , it would also seem that the Treasury was not aware of the fact that similar , yet far milder , policies were introduced in Ireland twice in the last 20 years and both times there were adverse consequences , including sharp rises in homelessness . The UK Government has never made a reference to this so we can assume they do n't  know about it or certainly did n't  at the time of the announcement of Section 24 . <p> Indeed the UK incarnation of this tax change is far more extreme than that which occurred in Ireland , as it applies to properties already owned ; in Ireland it only initially applied to new purchases . My report shows how it is the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will lead to the bankrupting of currently successful businesses . <p> The Irish Government has now made the dramatic announcement that their measure against private landlords is to be repealed , because of how it has exacerbated Irelands housing crisis . The UK Government needs to learn from the lessons of others which are clear to behold . <p> If , instead of draconian tax punishment , the Government offered the same incentives that landlords in other advanced countries enjoy , private landlords would increase the supply of new dwellings even faster than they did up to 2015 without such incentives . They financed new-builds , rehabilitated run-down properties and converted large residential or commercial buildings into flats or houses of multiple occupation ( HMOs ) . <p> In tandem with the attack on individual landlords , the Government has supported Build to Rent by institutions , some of whom are Conservative Party donors .

No justification has been advanced for this preferential treatment . <p> The anger landlords feel towards the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this hard-left measure ; they need to scrap this tax urgently before further damage is done .

@@73450513 @2150513/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> In the first part of this guide , we commented on how house prices in the UK and interest rates are n't the only considerations when you are seeking a mortgage . We looked at the basic nature of a mortgage and at the broad categories of mortgage products . Now we turn to more specific types of home loan . <p> 2 ) Discounted variable rate mortgages <p> These are essentially an arrangement by which you will receive a discount on an interest rate , usually the lenders standard variable rate . The duration of the discount varies , but is most commonly 2 - 3 years . At first glance , you might think this is a superb product , but you do need to exercise caution and shop around . The Money Advice Service does a great job of illustrating this point when it cites the example of two banks offering discounts : <p> i ) Bank 1 offers a 2 per cent discount on a standard variable rate of 6 per cent , meaning that you will pay 4 per cent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount on a standard variable rate of 5 per cent , meaning that you will pay just 3.5 per cent . <p> Had you opted for the higher headline discount , you would have ended up paying more . Another feature you need to look out for is a financial penalty should you wish end the arrangement early . <p> There are some important advantages to discounted variable rate mortgages . Initial monthly payments will be lower as a result of the discount , and if the bank or building society cuts its standard variable rate , you will receive a further cut in your mortgage repayments . In a sense , though , this type of mortgage has the defects of its qualities . For instance , your lender could increase its standard variable rate at short notice , possibly as a result of the Bank of England raising its bate rate . If you were n't prepared for such a hike , you could find yourself struggling to meet your monthly commitments . <p> 3 ) Capped rate mortgages <p> With a capped rate mortgage , the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted , normally to reflect your lenders standard variable rate . There is , however , an upper limit or " cap " on the rate you will be required to pay . The rate ceiling is normally limited to an introductory period of say 2 - 5 years . <p> The most attractive point about these mortgages , which are perhaps less common than they were a few years ago , is the certainty they afford you . You can be sure that your interest rate and therefore your monthly payments wo n't rise beyond a certain level . You will , though , benefit from lower payments , should your lender lower its standard variable rate . This being said , your agreement may well incorporate a lower level or " collar " below which the rate payable can not fall . <p> Notwithstanding these inducements , there are some issues you need to factor into your decision to commit to a capped rate mortgage . Firstly , you need to ensure that you will be able to make your monthly payments if the cap , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondly , lenders are free at any time to alter the rate just so long as it does n't exceed the agreed cap . Finally , the initial rates tend to be higher than those applying to fixed rate or other variable rate mortgages and there may be arrangement fees , so you really need to do your homework . <p> 4 ) Offset mortgages <p> An offset mortgage sounds rather complicated but , put simply , it operates by linking your savings to your mortgage . Effectively , you pay interest solely on the size of of your mortgage debt over and above your savings balance . In other words , if you take out a 250,000 mortgage and have 45,000 in linked savings , you will only pay interest on the difference between these sums , namely 205,000 . <p> The outstanding advantage of this type of mortgage is that the interest you save on the mortgage interest will usually be higher than the interest you would accrue on savings . This is particularly significant at the moment , given how low savings rates have fallen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are paying off your mortgage much more quickly . As one expert puts it , you are making your financial resources " work harder . " An important addendum to this discussion of offset mortgages is the fact that you will typically continue to have access to your savings , should you need these funds for any unexpected expenses . Any such withdrawal would merely reduce the sum being offset against your mortgage . <p> The main downside of the offset mortgage is that the interest rate is often higher than that attached to other products . In most cases , you will need to have substantial existing savings and expect to have the wherewithal to make regular savings deposits in the future , if this sort of commitment is going to be worthwhile . <p> 5 ) Tracker mortgages <p> Tracker mortgages are those home loans where the rate payable is , typically but not exclusively , the Bank of England base rate plus a couple of percentage points . Accordingly , should the base rate rise by 0.25 per cent , your monthly payment would rise by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relevant interest rate was slashed . The reverse is also true , of course - if the rate being tracked was raised , your mortgage payments would increase . Arrangement fees and a charge in the event that you leave the scheme are also pretty common with tracker mortgages . In recent years , there have been a couple of relatively high profile cases where lenders have raised rates even though the rate being tracked has remained unchanged . It 's crucial therefore that you check the finer points of your mortgage terms . <p> In the final part of this series , the team at Nethouseprices will complete this overview of mortgages and set out some tips for navigating the mortgage market when house prices in the UK are so high .

@@73450520 @2150520/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> Buy-to-let as an investment vehicle has seen dramatic growth in recent years , with a variety of reasons for its popularity . Low interest rates , for example , have allowed investors to organise highly manageable mortgages . Likewise , sluggish wage growth coupled with the very same low interest rates have prohibited many prospective home owners from buying their own residence . <p> This is particularly true in certain areas , with house prices being so inflated . As a result , the private rental sector has become central to Britain 's housing market . Against this backdrop , it has been possible to reap a very respectable return on a buy-to-let investment . While it remains eminently possible to make money from investment in the rental market , there are new legislative and regulatory headwinds that will almost certainly make it slightly harder to navigate . <p> There is , for example , the new stamp duty surcharge on second or rental homes . And there is the very real possibility of the entire buy-to-let sector facing oversight by the Bank of England 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we look at some of these new features of the market . <p> We should preface our summary of the changes with an explanation for their rationale . Essentially , there is a perception in government that buy-to-let investors are effectively elbowing first time buyers off the property ladder . Many of the measures are therefore calculated to dis-incentivise and cool investment in this sector . The other issue from the public policy standpoint , is that buy-to-let has grown so quickly and the country 's banks and financial institutions have such exposure to it , that there is the risk of a so-called " bubble " that could seriously compromise Britain 's economy in the event that it " burst . " Policy-makers have responded to this perceived threat by considering enhanced regulation of lending arrangements in the sector . <p> Taxing matters <p> There are four key strands to the new tax regime affecting buy-to-let . It is important to note that the property sector is doing its utmost to have aspects of the tax measures modified or repealed so there is a slender chance that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The key tax changes are : <p> 1 . The tapering off of mortgage relief for landlords from 2017 ; 2 . A stamp duty surcharge of three per cent on the purchase of second or rental homes ; 3 . Exclusion of investments in residential property from recent cuts to capital gains tax ; 4 . The possibility that capital gains on buy-to-let will be taxed as income . <p> Described as an assault or war on landlords , the first three prongs of the attack have been covered widely in the media . The fourth item has only just gained any attention , with critics contending that it has been rather sneakily tacked on to the 2016 Finance Bill without consultation in order to avoid scrutiny and criticism from an industry that is already regarded by some as reeling from other tax measures . Various professional bodies , including the Law Society , have pointed out that this proposal would affect the way in which the property sector does its financial reporting and could lead to a serious lack of clarity for investors . There are naturally widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a significant rise in the number of companies claiming to help landlords to avoid the new taxes on a legally justifiable basis . While many of these are legitimate and can help you make the best tax arrangements possible , a marked number of them are believed to have peddled unsafe advice that could incur serious penalties if acted upon . As always , we suggest that anyone affected by the new tax regimes should seek early advice from a reputable professional before embarking on any of these avoidance schemes . <p> Regulating the sector <p> There has been speculation that the PRA , the supervisory wing of the Bank of England , would assume responsibility for regulating parts of the buy-to-let sector . Certainly the Bank 's Governor , Mark Carney , has expressed concerns about the size of the finance sector 's exposure to the market . Accordingly , in March , the Bank issued a consultation on the matter , looking at various questions , for example , when lending money to landlords , should banks be required to assess the affordability of the mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spectre of this type of supervision has n't been universally welcomed . Property investors have argued that it will make investment more difficult and more expensive while their counterparts in the financial services industry despair over the possibility of yet another layer of regulation . There is the perception in some quarters that , having failed to spot the signs of the global financial crisis of 2008 , the Bank of England and central Government are displaying a degree of paranoia , seeing bubbles and crashes that just are n't going to happen . For all the criticism , however , many financial institutions seem to be viewing the proposals as a virtual fait accompli and are adjusting their lending criteria accordingly . <p> There are parallel proposals that institutions that are not supervised by the Bank of England 's PRA ( but are nonetheless involved with buy-to-let financing ) should come under the supervision of the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) with regard to their buy-to-let activities . Again , this would not be especially popular and many property market participants believe it to be unnecessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notwithstanding the changes , it is crucial to point out that there is money to be made in buy-to-let . There are admittedly new challenges and obstacles to investing in this sector . But the dividends remain higher than those deriving from other investments , especially savings products which , with interest rates being so low , currently generate almost derisory returns . <p> Just to exemplify , a recent report looked at returns on buy-to-let in student towns and found , for example , that investments in Sunderland reaped returns of well over 6 per cent . The key to making money in this sector is to do your research before you commit to any investments and to take the appropriate professional advice . <p> At Nethouseprices , we will be monitoring developments affecting this sector .

@@73450522 @2150522/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> There has been much speculation that a leave verdict in the EU referendum would - at least temporarily - bring down the value of Britain 's residential property . Certainly , some of the house price indices have tended to suggest that price growth was losing momentum , especially in London . Some of the more colourful headlines about the housing market in recent days , however , have covered an apparent decline in prices that has absolutely nothing to do with the outcome of the vote on 23 June . <p> Instead , the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) has changed the criteria by which it calculates average house prices . And the new index suggests that prices are perhaps not quite as high as we thought . We have previously discussed the wide disparity in the monthly statistics issuing from the main mortgage lenders and the reasons for which the ONS figures are generally held to be the gold standard for businesses and institutions needing accurate house price information . <p> But the new methodology - or rather the conclusions it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people do n't like hearing that their house may be worth 100k less today than it was worth yesterday . In this piece , we look at the new ONS index and assess whether it makes much of a difference . <p> Why are the ONS statistics so important ? <p> Since they are largely based upon their own business during any given month , the figures produced by the mortgage lenders can vary dramatically and are n't necessarily the most sensitive indication of the wider housing market . In previous posts we have discussed the marked differences in the statistics published by , for example , Halifax and Nationwide . These are interesting and provide fodder for the business pages but they are n't as reliable as the studies produced by the ONS , which uses a wide range of sources to produce absolutely neutral and impartial data . <p> House prices are , of course , endlessly fascinating to Brits , whether we are delighting in our house gaining thousands in value or we are despairing of ever getting on the property ladder . But the housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast amounts of wealth tied up in property investments . So government bodies such as the Bank of England ( BoE ) , international organisations including the International Monetary Fund and the big banks all need access to absolutely accurate information on the market . <p> They all rely upon the ONS . That said , there were some well-known defects in the old index . For example , it was largely based upon sales involving mortgages so a significant number of cash sales were omitted from the calculations . Similarly , many analysts thought that it placed too great a weighting on extremely expensive , " high end " or prime residences which would artificially inflate the average house price . The new measure seeks to remedy these and other perceived problems . <p> What are the changes ? <p> The new ONS index replaces two indices prepared separately by the ONS and the Land Registry . Described as " experimental " and therefore presumably subject to further refinement , the index will take account of all sales , including those where mortgage financing is not used . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . These two elements account for the new index suggesting a lower average house price across the UK . <p> Sales without mortgages are often of lower value properties , bringing the average house price down , and losing the distortion of the most expensive properties means that averages are pushed down still further . So do n't worry unduly about headlines such as " How the ONS single-handedly cut 100,000 off the average UK house ... " <p> Another key change is that the new ONS index uses a far wider base of information than its predecessors and offers data regarding the types of property being sold . Having access to information about numbers of rooms and floor space means that housing economists can make realistic comparisons when they look at sales prices . As the FT put it , they know they are comparing " like with like . " <p> What are the drawbacks ? <p> The obvious drawback is that , at first glance , householders may think that their home is suddenly less valuable . This is n't really the case , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is still what your house is likely to be worth . What it means is that your house value may have changed by comparison to the average house price , which , according to the ONS , is now 209,000 rather than the 292,000 suggested by the last index . <p> Conflating the ONS and Land Registry indices also means that there will be fewer official updates on house prices . This will probably make little practical difference to the householder , but it will mean dramatically less material for the media to turn into headlines which feed our national obsession . As Gemma Tetlow of the FT put it " Some may feel this loss . Others will probably breathe a sigh of relief . " <p> Broader picture <p> The central finding of the latest ONS index is that the average UK house is valued at 209,000 . This actually represents a healthy increase of some 16,000 or 8.2 per cent over the last twelve months and a rise of around 55,000 since the low point in March 2009 during the height of the financial crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU referendum and polling as of 19 June 2016 suggests that " Leave " and " Remain " are level pegging . The effect of either outcome on property prices is n't properly understood although many commentators suggest that there will be a brief decline in prices , largely as a function of the on-going uncertainty . <p> There are , of course , other factors . The US is reportedly on the brink of raising interest rates which could affect the global economy . Similarly , Britain 's domestic economic outlook is looking less positive than it was earlier in the year , with the BoE cutting its growth forecasts . This has the potential to trigger changes in house prices . Elsewhere , there are some sombre predictions being made about the impact of the Chancellor 's buy-to-let taxation measures . The Daily Mail , for example , carried a headline this week suggesting that " George Osborne 's buy to let tax hikes ' will knock 20% off house prices .

Sometimes parents become involved with regard to an issue , especially where they are guarantors , and this usually facilitates matters , rather than causes conflict <p> 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasant type of tenant . <p> a ) They rarely default on rent , tending to be what we might call ' old school ' in this regard <p> b ) They are nearly always polite and reasonable in their requests <p> c ) They often have children , who will call if there is a problem . <p> d ) They tend to be quiet , and so cause no problems , especially important if the rental property is a flat <p> e ) If they like your property they are unlikely to leave it , since the call of a career requiring them to move to another location is not an issue <p> 3 ) Single parents <p> a ) Even where rent is subsidised through Housing Benefits , I have usually found that this class of tenant likes to be settled , wants to keep a property clean and tidy for their children 's sake , and is reasonable in requests for repairs to be done or other issues resolved <p> 4 ) Professional couples <p> a ) Often good tenants , but career demands often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) For some reason , they tend , but only in my experience , to call the landlord over certain matters they could easily resolve themselves with a little initiative , even where the landlord has no objection to paying to sort out the problem <p> c ) Sometimes their relationship hits the rocks , and so the tenancy ends ! <p> My preferences may seem odd to some , but they are based on many years of experience as a professional landlord . <h> 2 . It 's All Down to Character , Not Previous Experiences <p> I 've been a landlord for several years and have seen many tenants come and go . I 've seen good ones and some , not so good . <p> Whilst I like to think that if you treat people with respect they will reciprocate - that 's not always the case . There are no hard and fast rules . <p> It 's about judging the prospective tenants character and to do this you need to meet them personally . You need to see everyone with an open mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are different and have different value systems irrespective of their profession or background . If you are in a situation where you have two candidates who are almost identical , you may want to choose a professional over student or a post-graduate student over first year student etc . <p> I like tenants who are down to earth , communicate well , ask questions and come across as having courtesy and respect . Remember , their attitude and character will also show when you deal with them in the future . <h> 3 . Loyal Families Just Need the Occasional Lick of Paint <p> My favourite tenants are ones who view my property as their home rather than a stopgap or temporary solution . A family with children tend to put down roots and have more of an interest in looking after their environment . <p> The fact that this is purely because it benefits them is neither here nor there ! <p> Their children do make a mess but it is usually mess that can be cured with a tub of emulsion . <p> They also notice things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it benefits them ) . <p> They also stay longer which means no ' annual turnover ' just when I want to go on holiday : ) <h> 4 . Couples Can Give You More Security <p> My favourite tenants are professional couples . This doubles the security as you can check two separate references . Also if anything happens to the employment status of one and they 're finding it hard to pay the rent . The other tenant can usually cover costs until they find another job . <p> Also a couple can manage the rent more easily as it is halved . They also tend to look after the property better as they can often afford a cleaner or can share the house work between themselves . Couples are far more likely to look after the property , and take pride living there , as they see it as a home and are more likely to entertain friends and family etc. <h> 5 . Do n't Write Off Students Because of the Odd Party <p> It will often depend on the property , for those of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional couple . You have the stability of knowing who is using the apartment on a day to day basis ( unaffected by changing relationship statuses ) but also the confidence of a regular income and therefore rent on time . <p> Young children can add to the risk of damage and so I would be cautious to lend an upmarket rental to a family with young children , or negotiate removal of some of the most delicate items to avoid risk of damage . <p> I also must fight the corner of the student here , they often receive a bad press but can be responsible and decent tenants . I have had trainee medical practitioners who work tough shifts whilst studying and are highly responsible . The regular student loans mean that they always pay me rent , often I time rental demands alongside their loan income to help them manage money and ensure no arrears . Yes there is the odd risk of wild parties , but a good relationship and clear expectations have n't let me down yet ! <h> 6 . Single Professionals Love Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals .

Our tenants have good jobs with long-term stability , so our tenancies would run for two years or more . Tenants like this look after the property well , and one even did a full re-paint of the house with her builder dad , which she paid for in full and the results were better than the original builder 's work . <p> Where we have let to couples , the formula is ; both working , thorough referencing , both names on the tenancy agreement , always email both of them , and help them establish themselves in what for some may be a new living arrangement , the first time they 've lived together . <p> We ask all of our tenants to pay by Direct Debit , which they do on the button , never miss a payment and we always email a receipt and a thank you , every month , on every property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Term Solution <p> Retired people want security . Moving home is a huge ordeal at their time of life so they will do their best to avoid it . They know that to get security they need to pay the rent on time and treat your property with respect . They also appreciate a long term lease so that there is never the worry of notice to quit hanging over them and for this , they are prepared to pay a premium . At the natural end of the tenancy , your property is in good condition . <p> Both tenant and landlord win . Stable , happy tenants and a guaranteed premium rent and relatively low maintenance costs . It 's not all one way , though . To keep the tenants happy , do repairs very promptly and very well , and do n't raise the rent . That can be done at the start of a new tenancy . <h> 8 . The Best <p> Type is the One Who Checks You Out Too <p> My favourite type of tenants are of course those tenants who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ref , last 3 months bank statements and some form of I 'd , holding fees at the ready and of course , those looking to stay long term ( they can demonstrate this by not requiring a 6 month break clause in the contract ) . <p> A good sign from a perspective tenant is if they do a check on you ( i.e. the private landlord ) too e.g. they could do this by checking out your LinkedIn profile , asking to speak to the departing tenants , checking to see where the private landlord is going to lodge their deposit . <p> Nothing too evasive from their side but enough to show that they are serious diligent tenants that you can feel comfortable to trust that they will pay their rent in time and look after your property . <p> A tenant willing to pay 6 months in advance can also be considered a ' favourite type of tenant ' ! Once the tenant has moved in , a favourite tenant could be a tenant who does not disturb you for every minor thing e.g. change of lightbulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ears open to let you know asap if there is a problem so that you can deal with it promptly before the issue gets out of hand . <h> 9 . The Ultimate Low Maintenance Tenant <p> My all-time favourite tenant was a city executive from Tokyo who , accustomed to the confined spaces and soaring prices of the Japanese property market , thought London flats were palatially large and extremely cheap . He clearly worked all hours and barely used the flat because when he left and I did the checkout inventory , the instruction manuals were still inside the brand new oven where I 'd left them three years earlier ! <h> 10 . A Good Relationship is the Only Rule <p> I think the most important type of tenant is ones that you can have a good relationship with . We all have different personalities so finding ones that agree with you on major points and give all the answers you want would be the best . After that i would n't really be too bothered what the personal circumstances are as long as there are no obvious warning signs .

@@73450539 @2150539/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> Paying the fees to join a landlord association might seem too much when trying to make a profit from your rental property . However , there are many reasons why it is a good idea . The membership fee will cover you for a lot of issues that will , in the long run , make renting out your property far easier . <p> Landlord associations can voice concerns on your behalf about issues affecting landlords . These associations represent all landlords on all kinds of local and national issues , ranging in size from small problems related to councils or large questions raised by governments such as tax issues . <p> How Much Does It Cost ? <p> It might not cost as much as you think to join a landlord association . There are three such associations in the UK . For example , you could join the Residential Landlords Association ( RLA ) for just 5.33 per month , the Guild of Residential Landlords ( GRL ) for 9.00 per month , or the National Landlords Association ( NLA ) for a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits from being a member , such as learning from the experiences of other landlords and staying abreast of relevant legislation . Landlord associations all have interesting forums which can be accessed by all members . They also host regular events and seminars where you can meet and network with other landlords and industry experts . <p> Access Free Advice and Resources <p> One of the most important parts of membership is the free advice and resources you can access such as downloadable templates , useful forms , and advice booklets about all aspects of property ownership and rentals . You can learn about house prices in the UK , rental values , and house values by postcode , as well as accessing examples of formal letters . As these letters are all checked through solicitors , they can help to ensure landlords stay within the law . <p> Landlord associations also run helplines which are useful if you hit a problem that needs solving , such as a specific enquiry . The association could end up saving you many hundreds of pounds . In addition to all this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounts on insurance policies , useful training courses , and important trade magazine subscriptions . <p> Landlord Accreditation Courses <p> Landlords need certification to prove that their property and service has been independently evaluated and judged to have met certain standards . For this reason , accredited landlords are acknowledged as more trustworthy that non-accredited landlords . As a member of a landlord association you will be able to become accredited by taking a recognised course through your association . <p> As you can see , there are many benefits to joining a landlord association and the small fee each month should certainly not put you off . The benefits far outweigh the costs and whether you want to find out house prices in the UK from a trusted source or brush up on your legal knowledge , becoming a member of an association is a great place to start . 
@@73450544 @2150544/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> It 's probably fair to say that buy-to-let has been the go-to property investment during the past decade , for a variety of reasons . In general terms , it was easier to obtain mortgage financing if you were a landlord . There were also some clear tax advantages arising from this type of investment . Of course , properly managed , buy-to-let properties can be hugely lucrative . Times have changed , though , and buy-to-let is n't necessarily the attractive proposition it was just two or three years ago . So , should investors be looking at alternative projects , such as buy-to-sell ? In this Nethouseprices article , we look at why the climate around buy-to-let has shifted so dramatically and set out some of the advantages of buy-to-sell . <p> Taxing times for buy-to-let <p> Regular readers will be familiar with the various issues which have combined to dent the buy-to-let market . Just to recap , however : <p> 1 . Tax changes <p> Between April 2017 and April 2020 , mortgage tax relief is being tapered out for landlords , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors and in fact the subject of an expensive and ultimately unsuccessful legal challenge , the measure was announced back in 2015 , by the Chancellor at the time , George Osborne . He was quite clear that the policy was designed to level the playing field between landlords and first time buyers , helping new buyers to take that first step on the housing ladder . There is currently something of a loophole in the law which permits limited companies to avoid the tax , but the current Chancellor , Philip Hammond , has suggested that he might correct this anomaly at some point in the future . <p> There are several central government schemes in place to help first time buyers . Whilst there is certainly a noisy debate around the efficacy of these schemes , there 's little doubt that they have helped some prospective owner occupiers to compete with investors for the comparatively inexpensive homes which are typically bought as rental properties . <p> The first two policies have been described as an outright assault on landlords . Despite a great deal of political rhetoric about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to renting , there are no visible signs that there will be any easing of the tax regime for landlords . <p> Buy-to-sell : the way forward ? <p> The first point to highlight is that , contrary to public perception , there are n't necessarily any significant tax advantages in this model of property investment over buy-to-let . There are Capital Gains Tax considerations and , when you buy-to-sell , you will still be hit with the Stamp Duty surcharge . The tax perks attaching to buy-to-let , however , have been virtually eliminated , meaning that investors can look at the inherent benefits of both investments , without tax being the deciding factor . With this in mind , what are the upsides of buying-to-sell , or " flipping " ? <p> 1 . Fast growing house prices in the UK <p> While there is evidence that house prices in the UK , at least in some areas , are starting to cool down , inflation in recent years has been little short of spectacular . It has been entirely possible to buy a property , perhaps at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later at a very healthy profit . While outcomes might not be quite so striking when house prices are less buoyant , it is still reasonable to expect a decent return on this type of investment . Crucially , you will have realised your profit quickly and can deploy it on other projects . With buy-to-let , profits are more slow-burning but may well , over the long term , exceed those raised by flipping a house or flat . <p> 2 . Predictable , one off expenses <p> Buying property to sell it on does n't come cheaply . As well as the price of the house , there are development costs , like renovation and redecoration , marketing the home and , of course , professional fees for the conveyancing . As steep as these might be , they are fairly predictable and you will only need to pay them once . This is in stark contrast with buy-to-let , where you have ongoing expenses , such as maintenance and landlord insurance , as well as repairs and the cost of dealing with any unforeseen problems . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you buy-to-sell , you might endure several months of extremely hard work in bringing a house up to scratch for reselling it and , naturally , you need to find a buyer , which can take weeks or months , even in the best of housing markets . However , once the property is sold , you can move on to your next investment . With buy-to-let , the efforts are ongoing . You need to find suitable tenants to occupy your residence multiple times , carry out frequent maintenance on the property , deal with your tenants ' issues and concerns and comply with the relevant regulations applying to the landlord and tenant relationship . You can delegate these responsibilities to an agent and , if you have a portfolio of rental properties , you no doubt will need to do so . These services , however , can be costly , and need to be factored into your yield calculations . <p> 4 . Less negativity <p> This is a minor point in many ways , but to landlords , it can seem that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to feel as though they are part of the country 's chronic housing problem , rather than part of the solution . This is despite the fact that the vast majority of landlords provide safe , clean and secure housing for people who need homes . While property developers do attract occasional criticism , the vitriol is n't continuous and is nowhere near as lurid or toxic as that directed at landlords . <p> Overall , then , there are some major benefits in buy-to-sell , but you need to be mindful that over the long term , buy-to-let will usually be more profitable . In the final analysis , which investment you choose will depend on your approach to making money and your appetite for the efforts involved in each enterprise .

Whether it 's golf , rugby , cricket or football , hundreds of thousands of people attend sporting fixtures every week of the year . This being the case , you could be forgiven for assuming that residential property located close to a sporting stadium would sell for a significant premium . This is n't universally the case , however . Certainly , homes next to famous racecourses or near the London football stadiums do tend to sell at higher than the national average asking price for similar homes . However , housing near one or two of the more celebrated , well-supported football clubs such as , for example , Liverpool and Everton , is generally priced rather dramatically less than the national average . In this article , we look at house prices near a selection of some of the country 's major sports venues , to see how they stack up against the national average . <p> Golf <p> Predictably perhaps , you will need to splash some rather serious cash if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf course . Not only is the sport pretty expensive for both spectators and participants , meaning that in general , it is restricted to the more affluent , but golf courses also tend to be sited in pleasant , green and leafy areas where properties are already expensive , irrespective of the proximity of a golfing facility . As an example , homes in the SL5 postcode in Berkshire , close to the Formby and Berkshire golf clubs , sell for a remarkable average of around 877,000 . This part of the UK has historically racked up some of Britain 's most inflated house prices , but you can expect to pay a premium wherever the course is situated , with houses or flats in the same postcode as a golf course costing around 419,500 . To put this in context , this figure is nearly twice as much as the country 's average house price of 219,000 . <p> Horse racing <p> If the sport of kings is your thing , then you will need to spend an average of 362,000 to have a racecourse right on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the most prominent courses . Homes in Esher , close to Sandown Park , routinely sell for more than 1 million . As with golf courses , though , there is a slight question of cause and effect , since racecourses tend to be located in already attractive areas , with Sandown Park being an excellent case in point . That particular postcode would apparently be desirable even without the added attraction of one of the country 's foremost racecourses . <p> Cricket <p> It is n't a proper English summer without cricket , and aficionados of the sport would no doubt relish living near one of the countrys great cricket grounds , like the Oval , Trent Bridge or Old Trafford . The latter , as we 'll see in the football section , carries relatively inexpensive house prices . If you want to buy a property close to that most famous of grounds , Lords , you will need to find an average of nearly 1.5 million . You would , though , have the other delights of London close at hand . As well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would be within comparatively easy travelling distance of several other important sports venues such as the All England Lawn Tennis Club at Wimbledon , the Emirates Stadium , home of Arsenal Football Club and the National Stadium at Wembley . <p> Rugby League <p> At the other end of the scale , fans of rugby league will find residences near their favourite grounds a little more affordable , with the average price being some 163,500 . There are several reasons for the relative cheapness of homes close to rugby clubs , with the most obvious being that this sport was traditionally based in the North of England , where homes typically cost less than their equivalents elsewhere . Equally , the clubs are often found in heavily industrialised parts of these towns and the prices of houses in these areas tend to be inexpensive , even by local standards . <p> Football <p> The national sport is a game of extremes and nowhere is this more graphically seen than in house prices close to football stadiums .

Meanwhile , homes in close proximity to the home of football , Wembley Stadium , cost in the region of 462,00 . <p> The size and fame of a football club , though , is n't the main driver of house prices . There is arguably no bigger or more successful club on the planet than Manchester United , but houses in the same postcode cost a reasonable 204,000 . At the opposite end of the country , residences close to Championship contenders Brighton and Hove Albion 's ground are priced at around 410,000 .

@@73450691 @2150691/ <h> About our sold property price data for England &amp; Wales <h> Overview of data from Land Registry <p> This article sets out exactly what data we receive from the Land Registry ( HMLR ) . We cover how the information is compiled and extracted , the accuracy of the data and what to do about errors which may exist in Land Registry records . <h> Background <p> Having received requests from interested parties such as Nethouseprices for a useable , affordable digest of all the English and Welsh residential house sales registered every month , the Land Registry built an extraction system to deliver bulk data to these customers reporting all the house prices achieved in England and Wales . <p> Due to the volume of these records , there is a delay in receiving the data and as a " rule of thumb " these tend to be received a few days before the end of the subsequent month . For example January registrations would be available at the end of February , and February registrations would be received at the end of March . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on the website within 1 day , however , unfortunately there may be further delays which are out of our control . <h> Scope of the Information <p> The information we receive is : <p> " Full Market Value Residential " transactions - this means that it includes every house sold at an agreed price between a private buyer and seller . <p> " Not Sold at full market value " transactions - this includes properties that are sold as Repossessions , Buy to Let 's ( where they can be identified by a Mortgage ) and transfers to Non-Private Individuals <h> Processing of House Sale Transactions <p> Once a property transaction has been concluded , the conveyancer ( Solicitor ) sends an application for registration to the Land Registry . This is an application to have the transaction registered in the Land Register which is the perpetual record showing who owns what . <p> Because of historical factors and the large number of conveyancers submitting varying types of transactions for registration , much of the entry onto the land register is done manually . <p> As the application progresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amendments are made . A straightforward application to register the sale of a fairly new property can be completed in a matter of days . On the other hand a complicated transaction , involving many parties or " difficult " transactions where much supporting documentation must be found , supplied and checked may take several years ! <p> Regardless of the time taken , once the application is completed , checked and signed off as being correct it is entered into the register on that day . <p> Land registry may correct any errors identified at any time . This corrected information is then released to us every month . <p> This means that we have a 100% correct snapshot of all registrations as they are recorded at the " last updated " date shown with every piece of Land Registry data on this site . It is possible that this may not reflect every single detail that is recorded with Land Registry ( because a change may have been made in the meantime ) . <h> Accuracy of information <p> The information is 100% accurate as detailed above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Land Registry data at the time it was extracted and that date is clearly identified on every page of the site where Land Registry information is displayed . <p> The information we use is the only type of information supplied , by the Land Registry , so Nethouseprices has exactly the same data supplied as every other licensee . <h> What does the Land Register Show Now ? <p> The only way to get Land Registry information as it is today is to do a search on the land register today . That is exactly what we would recommend if you need to know exactly what is recorded for a particular property . It is possible that an error is still uncorrected after years . But an inaccuracy on our site might have been corrected and you would see the correct information when you searched the land register . You will certainly see the information exactly as it is recorded . <p> There are two advantages we offer - immediacy and cost . To search the land register you can go and do it in person , use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search for you . They may well use Land Register Online and then add on a charge for their time and overheads . The cost for finding a single record using Land Register Online is 2 and you have to familiarise yourself with the system . We do recommend Land Register Online if you want to know the exact state of the register today . <p> To use an online or other search agent to search on your behalf will usually cost anything from 10 upwards . <p> Compare this with Nethouseprices who offer free access and include easy searching and grouping , allowing you to search for properties via street , town and postcode . In fact we know that some of our members use our house price service to check that details are correct for no cost and then take action to check if any errors they find here are still present on the register . <h> Correcting Errors <p> It is possible that the information we have displayed , which you believe to be inaccurate , has already been corrected on the Land Register . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should conduct a search , or have one conducted on your behalf . This is then a transaction between you and the Land Registry and they will answer questions and investigate errors you point out to them . The easiest way of doing this is at http : **26;87;TOOLONG and help about the service can be found at http : **39;115;TOOLONG . <p> If you search there and the records reflect an error , then you need to get in touch with them and ask them to resolve this . There is a convenient feedback link at http : **36;156;TOOLONG . <h> Conclusion <p> Nethouseprices offers a quick convenient and cost effective way to search details extracted from the Land Register . These details are an accurate reflection of the record at the time of extraction and corrections are updated monthly . The details we are supplied with do not differ in this respect from any other customer . <p> Errors recorded in the Land Register can only be identified by searching the Land Register . Any errors identified can then be rectified by direct contact with the Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we receive our next monthly update . <p> The information we receive is sorted , has additional information added and is loaded to a state of the art database system where it can be accessed easily by the custom website we have designed to present the information in a usable and informative format . <h> When is the sold house price data updated ? <p> Our house price information is updated once a month for each of the Registers we cover . This is carried out as soon as the data is released to us by the Land Registry . <p> Due to the volume of sales transactions , there is a delay in receiving the data . House sales registered in a month will usually be available on Nethouseprices the last week of the following month . For example all sales registered in July will be available in the last week of August . <h> Can I find commercial sales here ? <p> A limited amount of commercial transactions are included in our data , when they are identified as not sold at full market value . <p> Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data set we license from the Land Registry . However , if we are given the opportunity of licencing this information , it will be available free of charge on the website as soon as possible . <h> Does the sold house price include Stamp Duty ? <h> Cost of lease extensions <p> Unfortunately this information , while it may be available in the Land Register , is not part of the sold house price data set delivered to us as part of our licence agreement , and as such can not be included in our information provided to you . <h> Why have a properties details have changed ? <p> The Land Registry do from time to time change details on their records if they have been challenged and will then send us the revised records in our monthly updates . This will explain why a property amount or date may have changed . <h> What is Acceptable use of Land Registry data ? <p> The end user licence displayed with every piece of Land Registry data explains this and if you are in any doubt as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write to them at the address shown in that licence . <p> Fortunately Land Registry have responded to our request for clarification of what might be acceptable and we have had a very helpful response . <p> The use must be strictly non-commercial and you may not amass data of a street , area or other category of the data and then publish it .

@@73450698 @2150698/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> There has been a great deal of media attention around the recent Halifax survey , showing that more first time buyers managed to get onto the residential property ladder last year than at any time since the beginning of the global financial crisis . The mortgage lending giant said that there were some 335,750 first time buyers last year , which represents the highest figure since the 359,900 first time purchases recorded in 2007 . That has to be good news , then ? Well , not entirely . Housing experts greeted the statistics with modified rapture because , as well as indicating a welcome uptick in families finally moving into a home of their own , the numbers also showed that the average deposit required of this group has more than doubled since 2007 . First time buyers now need to find an eye-watering average of more than 32,000 for their deposit and will ultimately pay more than 200,000 for their home . The figures are even more startling for London , where first time deposits stand at over 100,000 and the average first home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagnant wage growth , there are serious questions around the sustainability of this trend , which Halifax housing expert Martin Ellis attributed to ongoing low mortgage interest rates , high employment and the various central government help-to-buy schemes . These three factors have combined to support the market , he added . <p> Longer term mortgages <p> The Halifax review also found that high house prices were forcing first time buyers to take out significantly longer term mortgages . In 2016 , for instance , around 60 per cent of first time buyers took out a mortgage of 25 years or longer . This contrasts rather dramatically with 2007 , when the figure was just 36 per cent . Additionally , 28 per cent of first time buyers last year took out a mortgage of 30-35 years . In itself , this is n't especially alarming , although it will obviously take home owners longer to build up equity in their properties . What is more troubling is the finding that first time buyers are now older ( average age 30 ) than they were just a decade ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21-25 years . In parts of the South East of England , the average age of the first time buyer is now 34 . This means that people will be carrying mortgage obligations into much later life than their parents ' generation . <p> House prices <p> In previous columns , we have analysed the predictions made by property gurus about the likely direction of house prices this year . In general terms , the consensus is that there will be moderate growth across much of Britain , of between one and four per cent . This would be a markedly slower rate of growth than we have seen during the past few years and is being predicted for various reasons . Firstly , say the analysts , the housing market in some areas is reaching an affordability threshold and a cyclical downturn may be inevitable . Secondly , the impact of the Brexit negotiations may well slow down the wider economy and have a knock-on effect on the residential property sector . The forecasts , of course , are just that : the British housing market has defied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming the experts are correct in their assessments , first time buyers could conceivably find the challenge of finding an affordable home at least a little less daunting by the end of this year . <p> Supply and demand <p> The central issue facing first time buyers in the UK is the country 's chronic shortage of homes . This means that demand outstrips supply and house prices are dragged ever upwards . Policy-makers , however , after decades of kicking the problem into the high grass , are finally making a concerted effort to get to grips with the problem . There current Government has , as we have discussed at length in previous columns , already announced several measures designed to increase the supply of affordable homes . There also are numerous regional efforts to buoy those central government policies . The Mayor of London , Sadiq Khan , has , for example , published details of an ambitious plan which aims eventually to ensure that some 50 per cent of all new builds in the Capital are " genuinely affordable " . <p> Similarly , the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , which communities minister Sajid Javid is expected to release within the next few days . While not all the contents of this document are generally known , a couple of its headline policies have found their way into the public domain and have been discussed at length across the media . They seem to be geared towards facilitating affordable new builds and helping first time buyers . Mr Javid , by way of example , is expected to allow some housing construction on the country 's so-called green belt . There is also thought to be a provision in the paper for the use of a new generation of prefabs or modular homes , to speed up the pace at which new homes can be delivered to first time buyers . Certainly , the Government is apparently taking an innovative and radical approach to solving the housing crisis , and most first time buyers will surely welcome the proposals . Naturally , the numbers of affordable homes wo n't multiply overnight and there will almost certainly be some opposition to one or two of the policies , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . These objections aside , though , there is every reason to believe that we will start seeing major progress on housing programmes by the end of this year . In the end , all the help-to-buy schemes in the world - as well-intentioned as they undoubtedly are - ca n't compensate for a simple lack of homes available to buy . The Government seems determined to tackle this problem . <p> The team here at Nethouseprices will be following these stories as more details emerge .

@@73450710 @2150710/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> We have grown accustomed in recent weeks to reading dire prognostications about house prices . Many - if not most - commentators seem to think that Brexit will cause house prices to wobble , especially in London . This is great news for first time buyers who will no doubt welcome houses becoming more affordable . It 's not such a pleasant prospect for existing homeowners who wo n't particularly relish seeing the value of their property tumble . <p> The narrative , however , has moved on and we are no longer just talking about a blip in house prices . We are now seeing stories about negative equity starting to appear in the business pages . Few phrases are likely to chill the blood of a Brit as easily as " negative equity . " The housing crash of the early nineties had a great many casualties and the horror stories of people suddenly owing more on their mortgages than their house was worth will live long in the memory . <p> At least since the financial crisis , mortgage lenders have tightened their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon sensible house valuations so no one really anticipated the negative equity debacle being repeated . Until now . In this article , we look at the reasons for which the spectre of negative equity is being resurrected and ask whether it 's a genuine risk . <p> Why are we talking about negative equity again ? <p> The central reason is that many housing analysts believe that Brexit has the potential to drag down house prices . Moody 's , the international ratings agency , was one of the bodies which originally forecast a fall in the value of residential property in the event that the United Kingdom opted to leave the European Union . Its latest report enumerates the wider implications of a decline in house prices , and among these , it identifies the possibility of some householders facing negative equity . <p> What exactly are they saying ? <p> The most widely-reported forecast was that a 10 per cent drop in house prices would put roughly 1 in 10 borrowers in the North of England in negative equity . The agency said that there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flats across the UK , meaning that mortgage-holders in the northern regions are significantly more " vulnerable " to post-Brexit price fluctuations . Moody 's added that a 20 per cent decline in prices would leave around 22 per cent of them owing their mortgage lender more than their property was worth . <p> This is in stark contrast with southern regions , where less than one per cent of borrowers would find themselves in a negative equity position . The agency , in fact , estimated that , in the event that prices across the South of England fell by 10 per cent , only around 0.3 per cent of borrowers would owe their finance company more than the current market value of their property . <p> One of the key reasons for this disparity is that many homes in the North of England have not yet recovered their pre-2008 crash values . In contrast , properties across the south have , at worst , reached their former values , and , at best , surpassed them . Steven Becker , an analyst at Moodys , was quoted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even across the country , placing borrowers in Northern England , Wales and Scotland at greater risk of negative equity if house prices were to decline . " <p> Elaborating on this , the agency added that borrowers holding interest-only mortgage products and those who took out home loans immediately before the global financial crisis were most likely to lose the equity they had accumulated since 2009 if house prices were to fall . Homeowners who agreed mortgages in 2014 are regarded as equally vulnerable to negative equity . <p> The report came against the backdrop of the Bank of England 's ( BoE ) recent cut in its forecasts for the property market . Quoted in the Guardian , the BoE said that it had lowered its forecast of housing investment significantly and had revised down the short-term outlook for house prices . Commercial property was expected to take a similar hit . <p> Is this certain to happen ? <p> The short answer is " no . " The UK 's property market is famously ( some might say " infamously " ) difficult to predict at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing economist who staked his or her reputation on suggesting that any development in the country 's housing sector was a " sure thing . " There are too many unprecedented variables at play in our wider economic and political circumstances . <p> As mentioned above , many commentators believe that house prices will fall in the wake of the referendum result , but very few are guessing the depth and length of this decline . Brexit is a major factor , of course , but market participants have been suggesting that a price correction was imminent irrespective of the outcome of the EU vote and the clamp-down on buy-to-let investors is widely expected to cause a drag on prices - at least to some extent . <p> Equally , it is n't clear whether the BoE will cut interest rates in an attempt to shore up the economy . The Monetary Policy Committee of the BoE surprised many businesses and economists when it elected to keep the rate at 0.5 per cent in July . There was a fairly universal feeling that rates would be cut quickly , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still has this option available to it and it 's not beyond the realms of possibility that we will see a rate cut before the end of the year . <p> This move could buoy the housing market by making housing finance more affordable and it could protect existing homeowners from nasty shocks from increased interest payments .

It 's a lifestyle . <p> DARLING BUDS OF MAYThe interior has been decorated in a modern , Georgian style with neutral colours , elegant cornices and eye-catching features , such as the grand chandelier hanging over the staircase.The kitchen is probably my favourite room to spend time in . It 's so big , with a conservatory , and feels sociable - you are aware of everyone coming and going.The house has been a hub of activity over the last decade , with friends and family enjoying all it has to offer - from relaxing summer parties to large barn dances . And it has also been a wonderful family home.When I bought it , it was like The Darling Buds of May , with all of the children living in houses around the farmhouse , he described.In the evening , we 'd all have a barbecues together , and we kept animals , chickens - it was perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> KING OF THE CASTLEA veranda stretches around the house , which the owners have enjoyed relaxing on with a glass of wine , overlooking the fields and making the most of their 360 deg views.It 's one of the best locations in the area . We get a lot of visitors who had no idea Whitehall Farm was here , and their jaw drops to the floor as they come through the gates , especially because of the view , and its location on top of a hill - I can see the sun setting , or the rain coming in from miles away.On bonfire night , the family enjoy watching fireworks displays as they burst into colour across the town below . And at night , with the house illuminated in a violet colour , Whitehall Farm sits atop Basildon as a beacon of light.It 's a dream house , in every respect , he said . I think it 's one of the biggest houses in the area - it feels more like a country estate .

@@73450750 @2150750/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> In the earlier sections of this guide , we looked at value-adding modifications - great and small - that can be made to the interior of your home . In this piece , we turn to the exterior , namely to garages , conservatories and gardens . The necessity of keeping these smart and tidy is pretty obvious , as it enhances the so-called " kerb appeal " of your property . However , you can go much further in transforming these features into assets that can add thousands of pounds to the selling price of your house . <p> Garages <p> In researching this piece , we came across the extraordinary statistic that around 90 per cent of garages in Britain contain no cars . Quite how this figure was calculated , we do n't know , but if it 's true , it does beg the question : what on earth are we using our garages for , if not to protect our cars from theft and the elements ? It seems likely that we are using them as overflows from our houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Garages are probably central repositories for white goods like chest freezers , old gym equipment , DIY paraphernalia and the kids ' bikes . The temptation to stow things in the garage is entirely understandable , but the space could become so much more . <p> In the first instance , even if you have neither the time nor the resources to have major modifications made to your garage , do declutter it , give it a coat of paint and make sure the flooring is in good repair . It 's also possible to make it into a legitimate and valuable storage area by placing old kitchen units around the walls . These can often be procured relatively cheaply from second hand dealers or you might even have some left over from your own kitchen remodelling . <p> If you are considering something more ambitious , such as converting the garage into an office or even a bedroom , you will need to do your research . For example , if you do n't have alternative off-street parking , the loss of a garage could reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms may be . A local estate agent will usually be able to help you make this decision . Equally , every street has a ceiling price at any particular time , so you need to be sure that you will be able to recoup any outlay . Bedrooms , for instance , typically do add to the selling price of a property , but you should do the maths to make sure that you can realistically expect the cost of having your garage converted to be reflected in the ultimate sale price . Again , an estate agent will be able to give you a shrewd idea of whether it is worth embarking on this type of project . <p> The work will need to be in keeping with the rest of your house and with the neighbourhood , so you will need to have extensive talks with your architects and other contractors , to be sure that they are planning a conversion that complements the existing structure . Note that it 's also possible that you will need to apply for planning permission from your local authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . <p> Conservatories <p> The construction of a beautifully appointed conservatory is a great way to add value to your property but , as ever , there are some important caveats . It 's crucial that you can afford to lose the garden space . If your garden is small , for example , it 's unlikely that a conservatory will be appropriate . Similarly , would a conservatory suit the character of your house ? It may be that in order to harness the value of your garden , you should consider other solutions such as the increasingly popular garden entertainment huts , luxury gazebos or the new generation of garden sheds . French windows are another possibility , if you want to make the garden part of your everyday living space . <p> The limited size of conservatories means that planning permission is usually not required , but if you are considering something elaborate , it is worth speaking to the planning department of your local authority , to make sure that the work complies with the relevant regulations .

These include : <p> accommodation arranged by local authorities or relevant NHS bodies in response to statutory duty <p> care homes , hospitals , hospices <p> social housing <p> hostels and refuges <p> tied accommodation <p> student accommodation <p> long leases <h> Right to rent guidance : how landlords should vet a new tenant <p> Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should follow four initial right to rent steps : <p> Establish who will be living at the property <p> Landlords must see original and genuine documentation which proves the tenant has a right to live in the UK and check the documents validity in the presence of the holder <p> Retain a copy of the documents and record the date of the check <p> If the persons right to rent in the UK is for a limited time only , the landlord will need to make a note of the date this right will expire in order to make a follow up check . Depending on which is the longest , landlords must make a further check just before either the expiry date of the tenants right to stay in the UK , or 12 months after the previous check . <p> My opinion is landlords should check the status of all prospective tenants to avoid breaching discrimination laws , even if they 're sure of the persons ability to rent in the UK because they know them . Its important to not make assumptions . <h> Right to rent documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many different types of documents which are acceptable , including single documents , combined documents and those where a time limited statutory excuse applies . <p> A few examples : <p> a British or EU passport or National Identity Card <p> a foreign non EU passport showing the holder has indefinite leave in the UK <p> Click here to see the full list . Landlords do also have the option to appoint an agent to act on their behalf . If an agent has accepted responsibility for compliance with right to rent ( in writing ) , the agent will be the liable party in place of the landlord . <h> Landlords tenant immigration background check : how to carry one out ? <p> Landlords should check that the documents appear genuine and show no signs of being tampered with and that they belong to the holder . Photographs and dates of birth should be consistent across documents and match the persons appearance . <p> My opinion is that if the document shows an expiry date of leave to remain in the UK , check this date has n't  passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false or tampered with , do not proceed . <p> There are some tenant referencing companies starting to offer standalone enhanced I 'd checking services for those landlords who do n't  have the facilities available or the experience to carry out right to rent checks sufficiently . <h> What if a tenant does n't  have the right documents and I 'd ? <p> The Home Office has set up a ' Landlords Checking Service ' . Landlords are able to use this service if their prospective tenant does n't  have any of the acceptable documents to prove that they 're in the UK lawfully . <p> As long as the person provides the landlord with a Home Office reference number , the Home Office will do the check and get back to the landlord within 2 working days confirming if there is a right to rent or not . <p> The Landlords Checking Service can be found here or call the helpline on 0300 069 9799 . <h> What if my tenants right to rent has ran out ? <p> Some permits will expire during the term of the tenancy . In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landlords should make copies of the documents and keep them with their records . <p> If a follow-up check shows that a person no longer has the right to be in the UK , landlords should make an official report to the Home Office . <p> The forthcoming immigration bill proposes new measures to make it easier for landlords to evict illegal tenants . Landlords will be expected to evict illegal immigrants soon after receiving a Home Office notice that their tenant no longer has the right to rent in the UK . In some circumstances , landlords will be able to act without a court order . <p> A new criminal offence will also target landlords and letting agents who repeatedly fail to carry out right to rent checks or fail to remove illegal immigrants from their properties . <h> What are the right to rent penalties for having illegal tenants ? <p> If an illegal immigrant is found living in a landlords property and sufficient checks havent been carried out , the landlord may be liable for a civil penalty of up to 3000 . The amount will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property is let to a lodger or the landlord is letting private accommodation . <p> If the tenant does n't  pass a further check the landlord must tell the Home Office , and it may be necessary to evict the tenant . <p> Landlord Action can advise on the best course of action . For more information contact their advice team on 020 8906 3838 . <h> Conclusion <p> Often landlords can be daunted by the prospect of changes to the law and would rather ignore them . However , ignorance will not prevent a penalty . <p> I want to reassure landlords that these checks can quite easily be integrated in their existing vetting process and should be viewed as another measure to give landlords peace of mind . All good regulated letting agents will have this built into their referencing process and for self-managing landlords , there is plenty of support and material out there . The secret is education and carrying out thorough due diligence.

@@73450822 @2150822/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> A new study has shown that new house building in the UK has little discernible and consistent impact on local house price patterns . <p> The report by LSE London at the London School of Economics and Political Science and jointly commissioned by Barratt Developments , the largest house builder in the UK , and the NHBC Foundation , examined whether a new development will always reduce prices or reduce the rate of increase in prices in the immediately surrounding area . <p> Examining the impacts of eight recent residential Barratt developments on their local areas , the research concluded that prices did not decline as a result of development , although sometimes there may be some limited impact during construction . Once the developments were completed , the local areas generally moved with the market . <p> One of the most common concerns of home owners across the UK is that a new build residential development nearby will reduce property values in the local area .

Five sites were built on land with previously higher amenity value , and three were built on land that previously had lower amenity value including derelict industrial land . <p> Specifically , the research found that house price changes in the surrounding streets and the broader three or four digit postcode districts suggest that new developments may stabilise or even increase prices in the immediate areas once development is complete where the market is generally stable and rising .

Occasionally , the homes being sold at auctions are in some way idiosyncratic or defective and need significant remodelling to be habitable and are not entirely suitable for sale through more traditional means . <p> The upshot of these motivations , of course , is that the properties being auctioned can sometimes be acquired at significantly lower prices than by taking the usual estate agent route . But there are pitfalls that you need to navigate if you are going to avoid splashing out on an expensive white elephant : <p> 1 . Finance <p> It 's important to make sure that you have the necessary financing in place before you commit to any purchases at auction . While mortgage rates are currently at historically low levels , housing finance products vary and different lenders have different loan criteria . Similarly , certain types of property are anathema to finance companies , flats over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are planning to buy a house as a rental property , do factor in recent changes to the tax regime affecting buy-to-let homes . These could affect your income . And it is increasingly crucial to bear in mind that many banks and mortgage companies are adjusting their requirements for lending on this type of property . It 's also important in this context to make a realistic assessment as to the costs of any renovations you will need to make in order to make the house fit for purpose . <p> Once you have agreed financing in principle , do make sure you stick to your upper limits . It is all too easy to get caught up in the atmosphere at auctions and end up bidding more than you can realistically afford . A good tip is to attend a few auctions before you intend to enter the market so that you can become attuned to the way in which business is conducted at these sales . <p> It is likely that you will lose out on one of two of your early targets . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with investors who have a portfolio of properties and who have the financial backing to absorb the odd mistake so they can be a bit more relaxed about the whole process than you . <p> 2 . Research <p> There are several prongs to adequately researching properties being sold at auction . In the first instance , you need to do the same sort of due diligence you would carry out if you were buying any house . This entails having the property 's interior and exterior surveyed to make sure that there are no serious structural problems that will be costly to fix and/or which could negatively affect the onward sale price . <p> Investigate the neighbourhood for any issues that might compromise the property 's value and do check with the local authority that there are no major building or infrastructure projects that could erode your investment . The importance of local amenities will vary according to what you propose ultimately to do with the property . Schools , hospitals and shops will be critical if you are buying the house as your own family residence , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you plan to rent out your house or flat to a single professional . Concentrate your efforts accordingly . <p> In addition to checking out the geography and structure of any property in which you are interested , do a little legal research on covenants and rights of way in case any of these impact on the property 's value . It 's also worth noting that repossessed houses may be the subject of bankruptcy orders which can affect the sale . Being clear on this sort of problem can avoid inconvenience , expense and disappointment further down the road . <p> Finally , do ensure that you familiarise yourself with the local auctions and read the listings on a regular basis so that you know the full range of residences that are available . Veterans of the auctions also advise you to get to know local estate agents . These professionals thoroughly understand the housing market and can help you understand valuations in different neighbourhoods . They can also help you to ascertain whether you are looking at a potential bargain . They are very often the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold at auction and may be able to give you a vital " heads-up " if there is something in the pipeline that would suit your requirements . <p> In future issues , the team at Nethouseprices will set out further tips to help you make the most of property auctions , whether you plan to be an owner-occupier or whether you are hoping to buy property as an investment .

@@73450866 @2150866/ <h> Do I Need Landlord Insurance ? <h> Find out if you need a landlord insurance policy and the answers to related questions you might have on the cover . <p> If you rent out a property , its a good idea to have landlord insurance . It covers lots of the same things that your regular home insurance does but it goes further , covering the risk that comes with a rental business too whether you rent out one house or ten flats . <h> Why do I need landlord insurance ? <p> There 's no legal obligation for you to have landlord insurance , but most buy-to-let mortgages come with the condition that you have it . <p> Being a landlord comes with it risks that you do n't  have when you live in your own home . Imagine if a tenant of yours gets hurt you could be facing a legal claim , and if you 're sued , home insurance may not cover you . <p> Also , if a tenant cant stay in the property due an insured event , such as fire or flood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even include cover for the loss of rent for the time when your tenants cant live in the property . Landlord insurance reflects your responsibilities and covers your risks as a landlord . Read more about why landlords need public liability <h> Do I need landlord buildings insurance ? <p> There are a few exceptions to this , but if you 're the freeholder and rent out a property , you need to have landlord buildings insurance as part of your landlord policy . <p> A landlord building policy would insure the structure of the building , plus built-in items such as kitchens , bathrooms and boilers in most cases . As such , you need to make sure the property is insured for its full rebuilding cost , including professional fees and the cost of site clearance . <p> You may need expert advice to calculate the rebuilding cost , which is often a lot less than the market value . You can also get a rebuild cost estimate when getting a quote with Direct Line for Business . <p> Landlord insurance offers cover for the building or structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents insurance ? <p> Whether or not you need contents insurance as part of your landlord policy depends on whether or not you 're renting out a furnished property . <p> If you 're a residential landlord and include upholstered furnishings or free-standing white goods , such as fridges and washing machines , as part of the tenancy agreement , you may want to insure those items . If you had to replace all of those items after a flood or fire it may cost quite a lot . Landlord contents insurance will give you the peace of mind that you 'll be able to replace those costly items should you need to make a claim . <h> Do I need buy-to-let insurance ? <p> As a buy-to-let landlord , having proper building insurance is a way of helping you cover your investment . <p> Landlord insurance covers you against unpredictable events , like vandalism , fire or flood . It also insures you against claims should tenants injure themselves on your property and you 're found to be at fault . <p> As a property investor you need to ensure that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean additional costs that would eat into your profits . <h> Do I need landlord insurance for a flat ? <p> When you have a leasehold for a flat or part of a building , in some cases the freeholder will have the building insured . However , if you do n't  have insurance that covers your flat or apartment , you may not be covered if your tenant is injured and you 're found to be at fault . <p> Say , for example they trip on a loose carpet , or a tradesman you hired is injured on the property . A legal claim could be taken out aginst you . Landlord insurance covers you against these types of claims . Its worth making sure you have a policy that covers your flat and your property owners liability . <h> Do I need landlord insurance if renting to family members ? <p> If you 're renting a property out to family members , you may feel that you do n't  need a policy that will cover you against legal claims or loss of rental income . <p> However , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance policy may no longer be suitable . You may need landlord insurance in place so if your house is damaged you can put everything right . As 10% of our customers paid 118 or less for their landlord insurance ( between January 2015 to June 2015 ) this may not be much different in price to your pre-existing home insurance so its worth checking . <p> Direct Line for Business Landlord Insurance <p> Direct Line for Business Landlord Insurance offers a range of insurance options for landlords . Whether its for a single property or a business with a portfolio of properties , our Landlord Insurance offers a high level of standard cover and the choice to extend your cover and increase limits . 
@@73450867 @2150867/ 12879 @qwx632879 <p> It 's probably an understatement to say that the past twelve months have been among the most dramatic in living memory , both in the United Kingdom and abroad . There was , of course , the largely unexpected outcome of the historic referendum on the country 's membership of the European Union and the domestic political fallout , including the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron . Then there was the American election which attracted unprecedented media coverage and the result of which remains somewhat contentious , even months after the event . Then there are questions around the future of the UK , with at least one member country , Scotland , apparently considering a fresh vote on independence . Now , the new Prime Minister Theresa May has called a snap general election to be held in early June . History tells us that these kinds of events can have dramatic impacts on the economy generally and on the housing market specifically . So , how do experts think the upcoming election will affect house prices in the UK ? <p> Precedent <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the past nine general elections , namely that house price growth has , in various degrees , faltered in the quarter before the vote . As Alison Platt of Countrywide commented when asked about the forthcoming poll , there is a " clear correlation " between elections and the volume of property transactions . House prices have , in turn , risen much more quickly than expected in the immediate aftermath of the election . In broad terms , then , it seems that it is the uncertainty , rather than the fear of a particular party gaining or retaining power , which causes the pre-election slump , although some political commentators might take a different view . <p> June 8 , 2017 <p> So , can we expect the same pattern to emerge in the coming weeks ? Well , not entirely . According to the housing economists , this election may prove anomalous , in terms of the trajectory of the property market , for several reasons . <p> 1 . Market is unpredictable <p> The sector is proving fairly difficult to predict right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brexit vote has n't really materialised and prices have in fact proven remarkably resilient . Certainly , there has been a marked decline in the central London prime or luxury end of the market , but the capital has more exposure to the EU than other major British cities and there are other factors weighing more heavily on the traditionally exclusive neighbourhoods like Kensington and Chelsea - the new tax regime for investment properties being the most prominent . In contrast , locations in the Midlands , East , South West and North West of England are recording sustained house price growth . Manchester , for instance , reported 8.8 per cent growth year-on-year in February , and the volume of sales in the city has increased by an astonishing 40 per cent in the past three years . Numerous causes for this have been posited , but the most likely explanation is the city 's centrality to the Government 's Northern Powerhouse Project and the booming local economy . <p> 2 . Atypical election <p> There is n't the typical lead time on this election , so there wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Likewise , while the result of the poll is by no means certain , very few commentators are seriously expecting a change of governing party , so there is n't the customary uncertainty during the weeks of campaigning . On June 9 , moreover , the sector will have the certainty of knowing that , all things being equal , we are five years away from the next election . To this extent , June 's vote wo n't necessarily affect the cost of housing to any significant degree . <p> 3 . Bank of England base rate and housing shortage <p> The Bank of England base lending rate is 0.25 per cent and there are no signs that this will be adjusted upwards anytime soon . This means that mortgages are generally more affordable and helping to support the market . Similarly , the country is in the midst of a well-documented housing crisis , with demand for houses and flats outstripping supply . While there are numerous ambitious central government plans afoot to increase the country 's housing stock , this is a long term project and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will act as a parachute , preventing prices from falling too far before and after the election . <p> 4 . Mortgage wars <p> Despite suggestions covered in these pages earlier this year that the days of ultra low mortgage rates might be numbered , intense competition among mortgage lenders seems poised to unleash a rates " war . " In a recent Nethouseprices column , we looked at Atom Bank , which in March launched the cheapest ever mortgage , at just 1.29 per cent for certain deals . This offer was admittedly withdrawn rather abruptly after a few days , but there are clear indications that other banks are following suit and that a mortgage rates war might be the upshot . See , for example : http : **38;498;TOOLONG . Economists believe that the net result of lenders slashing their rates will be an uptick in both the volume of house sales and in prices , negating the impact of the election . <p> However ... <p> As discussed in previous features , there is a widespread expectation among the housing gurus that pressures on the wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly subdue demand for housing . General price inflation , a weakening jobs market and near record consumer debt are being forecast . This tends to suggest that , while a house price crash is emphatically not on the agenda , prices are unlikely to grow at such a rapid a pace as we have seen in the past few years . Taking an average of the predictions for growth in 2017 , it seems that growth will be limited to around two or three per cent , irrespective of the general election . <p> As ever , the team here at Nethouseprices will be monitoring the news for developments affecting house prices in the UK in the coming weeks and months .
