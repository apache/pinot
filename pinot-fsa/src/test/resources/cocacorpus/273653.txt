As soon as a thief starts to make an entry , he is exposed . A car cover takes a few minutes to remove , so the thief 's exposure time is increased . With so many cars uncovered , why would a thief increase the risk of being caught ? A cover also helps protect the contents of a vehicle . When radios , packages and other items are out of sight , they 're less likely to tempt a thief . <p> - <p> How can I prevent my car cover from being stolen ? <p> The lock and cable accessory kit that comes with many covers will certainly help .

Watch installation video ( link to same link as how to install a car cover ) <p> - <p> What is the best way to fold a cover when taking it off the vehicle ? <p> The easiest way I 've found is to fold each side up onto the roof and refold it as necessary so the material ends up about 2 feet wide .

Ambient temperature builds inside enclosed spaces , and if you open the windows slightly you 'll allow air to circulate , just like it circulates under the cover . Some cover fabrics offer more heat insulation than others do , simply because they are multi-layered and are more effective at keeping heat away from the vehicle 's surface .
