The resulting awkward contortions are humorous , but the interaction contains deeper meanings . ' Its related to issues of science , philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Wurm says .

The Negozio Olivetti , once a showroom for the companys typewriters and calculators , designed by its erstwhile art director Carlo Scarpa in 1957-58 , and now a museum run by FAI ( the Italian Environmental Foundation ) , is an architectural treat .

It was while caressing the concrete balustrades of the interior during 2015s Venice Art Biennale that Zana struck on the idea of introducing the space to a new crowd the Biennale art-trippers by combining it with the work of Ettore Sottsass , another of his design heroes ( and another one-time Olivetti art director , who created the brands first computer , alongside its Valentine typewriter ) . The subject of the four-month exhibition this year would not be Sottsass Memphis masterpieces of the 1980s , but his early work with ceramic , when the painter manquT , who forewent his first love of art to follow his father into architecture , started applying his painterly eye to terracotta , mixing colour and decoration with structure and form in an original way . <p> Ceramics is a very important part of Sottsass work , maybe the best thing he did , but its only known by a few collectors and museum directors , Zana says .

They moved the frontier between art and design design became a way to rethink society , colours , the furniture industry , comfort , says Zana , who trained at Paris Beaux-Arts in the mid-1980s , and developed a practice combining architecture with interior design . <p> Zana takes particular interest in Sottsass work from the late 1950s , when he was producing collections with Bitossi for Milan gallery Il Sestante . He had discovered terracotta and was exploring techniques linked to early Italian civilisation , mixing them with modern design , says Zana . He would do a collection every year based on his mood . So when he was in a dark place he did one called Ceramiche Delle Tenebre ( ceramics of darkness ) , for example , something very new for that time. <p> For this exhibition Zana is lending ten to 12 of his own pieces and has persuaded other private collectors to lend theirs , making a total of around 60 .

This is going to be a fantastic way for people to take in two things you would n't usually see together , says Zana of his subject and location .

Its an homage to the two former art directors of Olivetti. 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Realising the showroom was nearby , he ran over , met Sala and a collaboration was born . Now , almost a year later , Mara Sala Editions is making its US debut at The Future Perfect in New York . <p> The furnishings are remakes of pieces architects Claudio Lazzarini and Carl Pickering made for various projects over the years .

Case in point : the slightly c-shaped Elizabeth sofa was designed for a woman who was very short , but frequently had guests over who were tall .

Courtesy of Burberry . Photography : Josh Olins <p> In the 20th century , Henry Moore attempted to define the body more than any other artist , visualising its form in magnificent bronze sculptures , shapes that are now synonymous with modern British culture . Moores vision was distinctive : feminine forms that were both classic and modern , larger-than-life , and characterised by their complex , concave surfaces with sensuously scooped-out voids . <p> Now , the work of the foremost sculptor of the British body is the inspiration for clothing made to hang on it , serving as the springboard for Burberrys freshly launched collection . The process , design references , and final pieces from the collection , shown earlier this week during London Fashion Week , are now on view at Makers House as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspiration &amp; Process , alongside more than 40 sculptures by Moore , including Mother and Child : Block Seat ( 198384 ) , Draped Reclining Mother and Baby ( 1983 ) . <p> For Moore , imagining the body was about more than addressing the human form it also absorbed the British landscape . Moores sculptures share a serendipitous connection with Burberry : Yorkshire . Its often pointed out that the artists curvaceous , undulating lines relate to the hills in the county . This is also the manufacturing home of Burberrys iconic trench coat , and the birthplace of chief creative and chief executive officer Christopher Bailey , who has long been fascinated by Moores creations . <p> We are delighted to be returning to Makers House this month , Bailey explains . This time , we are incredibly privileged to be working alongside the Henry Moore Foundation to bring our collection and exhibition of Moores work to life.

A chunky , cable-knit jumper with a funnel-neck , recalls Moores SeatedWoman : Thin Neck ( 1961 ) , while a nude dress with cut-outs at the waist and shoulder echoes the artists presentation of hollowed out silhouettes . <p> Just as Moore experimented with oversized forms in clay , wood , bronze and plaster on different scales , texture and materials remain consistently important to Baileys vision for Burberry .

Alma and Austere : Creative-focused co-working space and a concept store . llustrator : Luke Fenech <p> This May , Brunkebergstorg , a hulking brutalist square in Stockholm , will host the most bizarre stunt in its history . Norwegian entrepreneur and billionaire Petter Stordalen is going to swing from its rooftops in a locked safe attached to a rope . The rope will be set alight and Stordalen , something of an escapologist , will have to free himself before he is plunged 30m to his death . <p> Stordalen is performing this daredevil spectacle at the launch of his latest hotels , At Six and Hobo . The 54-year-old operates 180 hotels under his Nordic Choice brand , plus 20 independents across Scandinavia , and his openings are legendary . In 2012 , he abseiled down the fatade of his Clarion hotel at Arlanda airport ; for the launch of The Edge hotel in Troms in 2014 he skied in with two Olympic medallists ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet-skiing up a ramp to his new Clarion hotel . I hit the concrete at 40mph , in front of 10,000 people and a symphony orchestra . I was blue all over , he recalls . Undaunted , he s in intensive Houdini-style training with a magician in preparation for the opening of At Six and Hobo . It might be difficult to pull it off , not least because the Swedes are quite health and safety conscious , he says . But this project is definitely worth dying for. <p> Aisslingers design for the rooms is fun and functional , including pinboard walls and headboards that double as desks <p> Are two hotels and a rooftop restaurant really worth an untimely demise , however spectacular ? Stordalen fought off 75 international operators to acquire the 30,000 sq m Brunkebergstorg site , at a cost of at least SEK500m ( 53m ) . He believes he is bringing something new to Stockholm , and certainly to Brunkebergstorg , a downtown former red light district . At Six offers five-star metropolitan luxury and museum-worthy artworks ; Hobo will draw hipsters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reworks New Nordic cuisine with Japanese influences . <p> Hotels are about storytelling , says Stordalen from the first fully completed bedroom in At Six . People take photos of what they eat and drink , but never of the beds they sleep in . Being in a hotel is more about the bar , the lobby , the public areas where you hang out. With that , Stordalen and his Swedish art adviser , Sune Nordgren , offer me a wrap of snus ( Swedish snuff ) and begin . They met in 2005 , when Nordgren was director of Norways National Museum of Art , Architecture and Design . I was dining at the restaurant Eik , in Petters Hotel Savoy in Oslo , and I was looking at a horrible , social-realistic painting by a Norwegian painter . It was ruining my appetite , so I complained , recalls Nordgren . Stordalen was outraged , until he heard who the complaint was from and took the painting down . In 2006 , Nordgren set up Strawberry Art + Design for Stordalen and started to build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They started small , mixing midcentury furniture from Scandinavian greats with black and white photography at the Clarion Sign in Stockholm . Until At Six , The Thief in Oslo , which opened in 2013 , was Stordalens finest hotel , with more than 150 artworks in situ . In most hotels , even somewhere like the Four Seasons , you can see whether its proper art or something the designers have added , says Stordalen . Nordgren commissions many artists to create hotelspecific works more than 1,600 of these appear in At Six . A marble head by Spanish sculptor Jaume Plensa greets visitors from the grand marble staircase in the lobby . You almost do n't  know whether you 're entering a national museum or a hotel , says Nordgren . <p> There 's a Tacita Dean creation in the reception , works by Richard Long and Sol LeWitt in the restaurants , and pieces by Julian Opie , Olafur Eliasson and Swedish photographer Dawid in the public areas . The Thief has artworks in every bedroom , as will all 343 rooms of At Six , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . <p> Since meeting Nordgren , Stordalen has acquired around 600 large works . He keeps 100 of them at his private home on the island of Bygdy , near Oslo ; the rest are in his 20 best hotels . I bought a lot and Sune even said some of it was OK . But , really , I went from nothing to a bit more than nothing . Even a blind hand can find a corner , he laughs . Stordalens favourite artists are Tracey Emin , Alex Katz and Opie . <p> Hobo 's furniture is specifically designed for the hotel , or curated by Aisslinger such as this low table <p> Contemporary Swedish crafts and design will also appear in the Instagram posts that the public areas of At Six are sure to invite . A 4m-long table made from reclaimed elm by artist Lies-Marie Hoffman sits in the ground-floor wine bar ; leather tannery TSrnsj has created all the hotels balustrades and door handles ; lighting is by designers Carina Seth Andersson and Rubn . Hannah Carter Owers , director at Universal Design Studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The period and aesthetics of the original building inspired the tone , the materials , and our selection of modernist furniture . We also looked locally to weave in stories of Swedish craft and making. <p> A former bank completed in 1977 by Swedish architects Boijsen &amp; Efvergren , At Six has a metal-clad fatade and hefty granite columns . As fans of modernism and brutalist architecture , we were instantly attracted to the building , says Carter Owers . We had to create an interior that feels authentic and has a dialogue with original features of the facade , but steers away from the municipal and the institutional. <p> Brunkebergstorg is in the Norrmalm area of Stockholm , where controversial architecture prevails . Until the 1950s , the area was known as the Klara quarters after the still-standing Klara Church ; then , for 30 years , period buildings were demolished to make way for the modern City . Views from At Six and Hobo take in many buildings from this era of development , including Swedish architect Peter Celsings iconic granite-clad Riksbank , and his nearby Kulturhuset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city would come to its hotels for parties and special events , says German designer Werner Aisslinger . Somewhere along the way this has been forgotten. As the creator of Hobo , part of Aisslingers job is to ensure the hotel attracts locals as well as guests . In the face of Airbnb , the hospitality industry knows it has to create an experience , he adds . Nice hotel design is not enough . Its about public areas that are connected to the city , that are filled with life. Creating hotels that are destinations in themselves is a major part of the brief . <p> Putting lifestyle first and local ingenuity close behind , Hobo has a separate entrance to At Six and features its own restaurants , bars and public areas . Space is a 6 sq m corner near the lobby dedicated to pop-ups by Stockholm creatives ; first in line are fashion designer Jennie Ellen , tech start-up ReachTail and jeweller Felicia Swartling . Tech brand Teenage Engineering has provided lobby artwork and free-to-use pocket synthesisers in all 201 rooms . A shop will sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Above Hobo is Tak , the rooftop restaurant , which has its own entrance . Stordalen , who claims to have heard every story going about New Nordic cuisine , was won over by Swedish chef Frida Ronge , who opened award-winning restaurant vRA in Gothenburg in 2012 . Within the 1,000 sq m space is a raw bar serving tartars and sushi and a separate area offering dishes that fuse Japanese and Nordic specialities : think potatoes grown on the beach in the west of Sweden served with brown butter and soy , horseradish instead of wasabi , and soy and caramel ice cream . Tak is spread across two floors and its 200 sq m outdoor terrace ( a rarity in Stockholm ) is connected via a footbridge to the rooftop of the neighbouring Spotify headquarters . Its our very own High Line , jokes Stordalen , who explains how a series of green interconnecting rooftops will be next in Brunkebergstorgs regeneration . <p> The members club at Alma offers creative co-working space such as this canteen , while local designers have been commissioned to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just one part of a huge scheme to revitalise the area . Consisting of four streets , its the largest planning project in the city centre since the 1960s . Later this year , Scandics Downtown Camper hotel , promising an outdoorsy , nature-inspired appeal and the fostering of creativity and connection among guests , will open on the other side of Brunkebergstorg along with a clutch of outdoor cafTs . The traffic that once clogged the squares arteries has been replaced by granite paving , cherry trees and refurbished fountains . There will be something of a return to the glory days of the 20th century , when this was the heart of Stockholm , its hotels , boutiques and restaurants frequented by intellectuals and socialites . The 800 digital workers who rent desks in Epicenter , a high-tech co-working space in another former Brunkebergstorg bank , represent the first wave of new visitors . <p> Epicenter is one of many new co-working spaces that cater to Stockholms bubbling start-up scene . Another is Alma , located in the former Beckmans College of Design in +stermalm . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skin to open doors and buy food from its vending machines , Alma has a canteen with an in-house chef , elegantly designed desk spaces , meeting rooms and private offices courtesy of architects Tham &amp; Videgsrd .

Fredrik Carlstrm is the creative director behind both Alma and Austere . There are so few places in Stockholm for design people to actually work and network at the same time , he says . Shy Swedes will be forced to interact in Almas canteen . <p> Not many schools and industrial buildings have been reimagined into interesting meeting places in Stockholm , he adds .

@@40481193 @481193/ <p> To celebrate ten years in business , London-based designer Lee Broom has collaborated with British heritage brand Wedgwood on a collection of vases and bowls , pictured above . The four vessels , launching this month in a limited edition of 15 , have been made in classic Jasperware at Wedgwoods Stoke-on-Trent factory . Broom drew inspiration from the companys 250-year-old archives for his pieces , including the 18th century Panther vase with its black and white stripes . Treated to glossy finishes and bold splashes of colour , the pieces feel original and new . Ive been working with Wedgwood on this for a couple of years , says Broom . I do n't  often do collaborations , but this felt right . I 'm so happy with the connection between our two brands : the Britishness of it all , one contemporary , one heritage , with references to historical manufacturing. <p> With his tenth anniversary year in full swing , Wallpaper* caught up with Broom to find out more about his Wedgwood collaboration , his upcoming Salone del Mobile presentation , and what the next decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoke-on-Trent <p> W* : How did the Wedgwood by Lee Broom collaboration come about ? LB : I was contacted by Wedgwood who asked if I would be interested in designing a collection just over three years ago and the idea was for me to create a prestige range of limited edition vases using their iconic Jasperware . Jasperware is n't something which has been touched by many designers over the years so I was really excited at the prospect of creating my own interpretation of something we all know so well . I designed the collection in London but also spent many days in the Wedgwood archive and visiting the factory in Barlaston , Stoke-on-Trent . <p> The pieces feel formally contemporary - how did you balance this with Wedgwood 's long history and traditions ? During my time in the archives I looked back at a lot of Jasperware silhouettes from different periods . I wanted to retain the very classic Wedgwood silhouette but strip back the ornamentation . This immediately gave the vase a very contemporary feel . I then looked at combining the graphic stripes with postmodern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacquered textures which starkly juxtapose the very matte biscuit finish of the traditional Jasperware . As a result , I think the collection looks both distinctly Wedgwood and Lee Broom at the same time . <p> ' Vase on Orange Sphere ' in the making <p> You 've said before that you do n't do many collaborations . Why is this ? Has this collaboration changed your mind ? I have found it tricky at times to fit in collaborations , however , we are ten years old this year and collaborations are something we plan to do a lot more of . When I am working on my own collections , I set my own brief so the canvas is completely blank . With a collaborative project , you are often given a distinct brief which for me , pushes my brain in a direction I potentially may have not have ventured into otherwise . So for me as a designer that 's incredibly exciting and very rewarding . It also allows me to potentially work with materials I have never touched on before such as ceramics - as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12,000 <p> What other exciting anniversary projects can we expect this year for the studio ?

Over the past few years I have created immersive and experiential presentations and this one will be no different .

@@40481196 @481196/ <p> Contemporary art seems to find itself in a constant battle between the logical and the illogical , the possible and the impossible , the visible and the invisible . Is it better to be understood , or to understand something about the world ? Do we have to explain everything ? Should we even try ? <p> This seems to be the question at the heart of Annette Messagers first exhibition at Marian Goodman in London , and her first major appearance since her 2009 show at the Hayward Gallery . Messager , a somewhat eccentric , euphemism enthusiast , who has won various awards for her art , presents a series of visual riddles that offer the viewer both an easy route and a hard one . Cryptically titled ' Avec et sans raison ' ( with and without reason ) the French visual artist plays with all kinds of materials and symbols , in a cavalcade of artworks that prod at both your instinct and your intellect , and leave neither in tact . <p> Wallpaper Uterus , 2017 <p> For example , the 30 pendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giant safety pin , comb , key and pair of scissors , make you feel like one of The Borrowers , dangling threateningly above your head , while inexplicable works like 3 Escargots-Seins ( three snails-breasts ) and Le Bras Chassure , ( the arm shoe ) seem to have come straight through the proverbial looking glass . <p> Easier to decipher are Messagers ' vengeful ' uteruses , a dominant presence in the exhibition space : there 's a new sculpture , the very pink Tututerus ( 2017 ) , attached to a frothy leotard bobbing in the air blowing from a nearby electric fan , and of course , her Wallpaper Uterus ( 2017 ) covering several expanses of wall with different uterus designs . <p> What Messager successfully shines a light on is our own ability to be utterly - and uterally - perplexed . ' Avec et sans raison ' is the perfect presentation of what the writer Albert Camus might call the absurd : the tussle with our own desire to understand everything , while fully realising that we do n't  know anything . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Photography : Paola Pansini <p> Viale Regina Giovanna 35 by Mario Rodolfi , 193739 <p> Editor and art director Karl Kolbitz first became fascinated with Milans everyday architecture as a teenager , when he would regularly visit the city and explore its perimeters by foot . He was in awe of the Milanese magnificence , but later realised that little attention had been paid to its outstanding array of modernist entryways . So he decided to put together a book about them , now published by Taschen , titled Entryways of Milan . <p> If you were in Milan last week , chances are you will have missed some of the citys finest designs : over 384 pages , Kolbitz picks out some of the quintessential corridors of the Modern era , revealing a side of the city that is usually concealed from view , unless you happen to live in one of the residential buildings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingressi are Renaissance-inspired tile designs by Gio Ponti , textured glass panels by Trieste-based Fontana Arte , or Milanese studio BBPRs dramatic rearrangements of the elements of the conventional entrance hall . <p> Rare and local materials are identified by stone experts Angela Ehling and Grazia Signori , such as Carrarra marble , Botticino and Benedetto limestone , or Tivoli travertine , all contributing to the elegance and history of these entrances , part of a post-war period of technological advances in stone cutting , metalwork and ceramics combined with aesthetic innovation . <p> This book wishes to represent for its readers the way in which the ingressi stand as a piece of punctuation to the architectural and design accomplishments of the citys modern history , writes Kolbitz , of his motivation to capture the city as it appears behind closed doors . It is , too , a reflection on the Milanese approach to design , placing prominence on the interior , and the feeling you get when you arrive home . As the book reveals , hallways are perhaps the unknown hallmark of Milanese design . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Photography : Jean-Pierre Gabriel <p> Stairs lead from Arocha 's workspace on the third floor to the living areas . High-gloss French walnut lines the walls , while the floor is in American walnut . <p> Glenn Sestig 's ' signature ' kitchen for Obumex was made in Pierre du Louvre stone , rather than the standard concrete <p> A corridor leading from Arocha 's dressing room on the third floor . Finishes include white tadelakt ( Moroccan plaster ) and natural stone . <p> A walk-in closet with doors in silver oak . The central piece is made to measure in high-gloss French walnut with bronze details . The ' Regard ' lighting is by Glenn Sestig , for Kreon <p> Arocha 's bedroom with symettrical titanium travertine pillars <p> Luc Tuymans does not shy away from controversy . The Belgian painter has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klansman and the murdered African politician Patrice Lumumba on his canvases , which are often relatively small in scale , muted in colour , and dominated by grey-tone hues . So when it came to asking Ghent-based architect Glenn Sestig to design the interiors of the spacious Antwerp penthouse he shares with his wife , the Venezuelan artist Carla Arocha , perhaps its no surprise that Tuymans inspiration stemmed at least partly from the work of Paul Ludwig Troost . <p> One of Hitlers favourite architects , Troost designed the Haus der Kunst in Munich , built between which David Chipperfield was recently commissioned to renovate ) . It is , of course , a Fascist building , Tuymans says , but its also very sound . I mentioned it to Glenn almost as a joke , but it became our starting point. At the very beginning , Tuymans and I discussed the meaning of the word architecture , recalls Sestig , and things just fell into place . From that moment on we clicked ; we were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritarian regimes are not the point here . Its about the visual impact of these structures. <p> The two-storey penthouse occupies the third and fourth floors of a building in the densely populated Eilandje district , around the citys historic docks ( Eilandje is Flemish for little harbour ) . For the past decade the couple had lived in an Antwerp townhouse , but they decided to relocate mainly for reasons of space and comfort . For the first time , we have a gigantic walk-in closet that allows us to put all our stuff in one room , which was especially important for Carla , Tuymans laughs . <p> The salon on the fourth floor , with chairs by Christian Liaigre and a view through the archway to the dining room <p> But they also value privacy and functionality : Arocha and Tuymans have separate bedrooms and bathrooms and they chose to install Sestigs high-performing Signature kitchen for Obumex in Pierre du Louvre stone . Much like that kitchen , Sestigs characteristic penchant for horizontal and vertical axes is palpable throughout . Both floors open out from arched central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a dining room , living room and kitchen on the fourth . <p> A mirror at the end of each corridor doubles their length . In Arochas bedroom , Sestig placed two columns in titanium travertine , their symmetry enhanced by arched apertures that frame the windows . Sestig also used the same travertine for the fireplace , both as a nod to Mies van der Rohes industrial modernism and to Tuymans own subtle colour palette . Elsewhere , grey Rubino marble has been used for the staircase and some walls ( Sestig sourced all the marble from Belgian stone specialist Van Den Weghe ) . There are parallels between the interiors colouration and my own work , Tuymans says . <p> The colours , the materials , they are quite saturated . The further along we went with the plans , the more we realised we wanted to offset these elements with some warmth. Sestig achieved this with American walnut wooden floors , with built-in shelves and cabinets in high-gloss French walnut . The wall lights , which reinterpret Michel Boyers 1974 Brasilia table lamp , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved paper-based diffusing parts . Wooden details can also be found in the main living room , where Christian Liaigre sofas reflect Tuymans affection for art deco , but in a more stylised iteration . In the adjoining dining room , a custom-made table is by Ceccotti Collezioni . <p> Despite the ample number of windows and the light that streams in from both sides , not to mention the terraces that Tuymans values highly , the penthouse still has plenty of wall space not that Arocha and Tuymans plan on displaying their own art there . I find it very important to separate work and life , says Tuymans , who instead has plans to install their private art collection on the first and second floor of the building , along with their personal library . In the basement , in due time , they plan to install a spa as well . <p> The building also houses Arochas atelier and a small exhibition space , which she shares with her artistic collaborator StTphane Schraenen . Arocha + Schraenen , as their joint moniker goes , cultivate an eclectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tuymans , on the other hand , retains his atelier in the Borgerhout district , staying true to his belief in the separation between life and work . But for the time being , Tuymans says , I spend most of my time on the fourth floor . That 's where life happens. 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Gvasalia also debuted a host of boxy shoulder bags that will no doubt refresh Balenciagas bag business , along with striped laundromat totes that echoed the more utilitarian vision he has cultivated at Vetements . <p> Francisco Costa called this collection for Calvin Klein urban eroticism . Focusing on the suit as his leitmotif , he developed his shapes throughout the show , alternating more severe trouser silhouettes with shifts worn underneath deconstructed overcoats . After a series of looks in various tartans , Costa turned animalistic . Fur came on collars and in the form of highly detailed animal prints on fabric , combined with plenty of luscious black .

Inspired by American art from the 1960s and 1970s , soft knitted pieces expressed ideas of reconstruction , using different methods of tying and wrapping to give shape and form .

Maier crafted bowling shoes and square-toed leather booties had a whiff of the 1970s , while long ropes of wool scarves and sharp fedoras synthesised into a dandy look reminiscent of David Bowie . <p> The mood at Zegna was refined and regal yet understatedly wearable , from gently printed overcoats to precisely cut wool suiting that harked back to another era . Best of all were sweaters embellished with rich silver embroideries of flowers and crystals . Every detail was carefully considered , from the mens perfectly combed hair to the leather number cuffs wrapped around their wrists as if they were old-fashioned salon models .

Also thrown into the mix were riffs on the 1940s : boxy short-sleeved shirts in printed silk , wide-lapel captains coats and cap-toe shoes with super-chunky soles .

Established by Kjartan Gfslason and his childhood friend Oskar Thordarson , Omnom was formed after three years of experimentation in an old , abandoned gas station . Since then , the brand has opened its first bean-to-bar chocolate factory and shop in Reykjaviks up-and-coming Grandi district . Gfslason pays homage to Icelands culinary and aesthetic history with traditional Icelandic flavours such as licorice and , with the help of in-house graphic designers Veronica Fillippin and Andre Visage , playfully colourful packaging . Other widely loved choices for chocolate sampling , such as burned butter and barley and rye , also find their way into the concoctions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Jessica-Christin Hametner <p> Bath vader 26 April <p> Our sustainable skincare needs have been met with the launch of Angan . The Reykjavik-based brand was set up by -ris Laxdal , an architect and nature enthusiast , whose goods are crafted with only raw ingredients . Named after the Icelandic word for scent , Angan uses salt from the unpolluted sea of the Westfjords as its key ingredient . The salt is hand-harvested by gourmet cooking salt producer Saltverk , who utilises hot geyser water and just one energy source an eco-friendly process , which demonstrates the brands integrity . The collection currently consists of two key products a detoxifying , mineral-rich bath salt that 's infused with seaweed and a therapeutic blend of essential oils like bergamot and grapefruit and the other , an exfoliating salt scrub made with Icelandic moss . Evocative of pharmacy jars , the bottle-green packaging of the former was created by Bessermachen design studio , while the abstract logo , takes its inspiration from Icelandic runes . By putting the focus on quality over quantity , Angans minimalist approach receives our seal of approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April <p> We 've always been partial to a good-looking bar of soap . The latest example to win our fancy comes from the Canadian independent label , Binu Binu . Named after the Korean word for soap , these sculptural beauties are carefully handmade using a cold process method that allows the bars to retain all the goodness of their 100% natural plant derived ingredients . Each soaps base is made up of boricha ( Korean roasted barley tea ) and then mixed with additional essential oils and ingredients to cleanse and treat skin . Binu Binus collection of soaps is inspired by the rituals surrounding the Korean public bath . Founder Karen Kim has designed formulas that elegantly binds the traditional and modern . From the Haenyeo Sea Woman soap , an invigorating sea salt soap inspired by the elderly female divers of Jeju Island , to the Celadon Tea Ceremony soap which relies on healing clays and green tea to purify skin as well as provide its ceramic-like , pale green glaze , each hand-cut , monolithic soap brings a refined touch to everyday bathing .

Truth be told , the mezcal label adheres to the strictest quality and production guidelines that truly makes it an exemplary specimen of its kind . Made in Oaxaca by artists Elliott Coon and Adrin Adrina , together with fourth generation mezcaleros , Gem &amp; Bolt 's mezcal is gleaned from slow roasting agave in conical earthen pits that 's then traditionally mashed with a Tahona stone ( turned by a horse , of course ) .

Park Fevers small size does n't  stop it from drawing large crowds , who come to indulge in the stores discerning selection of high quality chocolate and craft brews . Those who make the journey southeast can pick bottles from a wide selection that includes Beavertown , Pressure Drop , and Magic Rock breweries , as well as chocolates from local producers like Land and Duffy .

Verandi , Icelands latest all-natural skincare export , understands this all too well , and while its inception might have started small , over a simple cup of coffee in Reykjaviks Te &amp; Kaffi , the brand has big ambitions already . Joining founder Rakel Gar=arsd=ttir Gar=arsd=ttir on her mission to instigate necessary change were Elva Bjrk Barkard=ttir ( a lawyer who runs a free-range chicken farm ) and graphic designer Egill =r=arson . After two years of culmination , Verandi was born when the trio teamed up with Te &amp; Kaffi to produce skincare products made from surplus coffee grounds that , while no longer used by the cafT , still contained some 92 per cent of its skin-loving qualities . The first in a series of products is a grapefruit and lemon body scrub , infused with high quality raw materials that are normally wasted , including coffee , as well as detoxifying seaweed , hydrating sweet almond oil and healing pure essential oils.Wrapped in beautifully minimalist packaging , Verandis body scrub looks good both inside and out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Urbanears covetable blend of design and technology is now available in a brand new format .

Our pot dreams have recently been met by a project by Danish architects COBE , realised in collaboration with Kilo Design . Inspired by the materials and forms of the COBE-designed kindergarten Forfatterhuset , in Copenhagen , the terracotta vessels were conceived to bring the city into the living room . Meanwhile , plant inspiration is moving from the desert to the rainforest ; the richly patterned leaves of the calathea and lush tendrils of the Komodo Sumatra hanging vine are currently the favoured tenants for our pots . <p> Nutritionists have been telling us to eat more coloured foods for some time , but now were being urged to concentrate on the darker end of the rainbow spectrum . So far , hard scientific proof is in somewhat short supply , but the anthocyanins that give fruit and vegetables their dark red and purple colours are thought to play a role in reducing the danger of everything from heart disease to cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackberries and elderberries , purple cabbage , blackcurrants , red wine , aubergine , dark-coloured figs and plums ( though not in beetroot ) .

You can even buy purple cornflakes , courtesy of American organic outfits like Back to the Roots , which , naturally , are stoneground on an old stonemill in San Francisco . Though its not clear whether the health-giving qualities of purple food are entirely thanks to anthocyanins or other micronutrients and bioactives that they 're mixed with , nutritional scientist Dr Ana Rodriguez-Mateos , of Kings College London , is cautiously optimistic . More studies are needed to confirm the findings , she says , but consistent evidence exists on some health effects of anthocyanin-rich extracts and supplements.

Stora Skuggan ( Swedish for the great shadow ) is built on the idea of telling stories that blur reality and fiction-myths but taken from real life , says Olle Hemmemdorff , who is behind its latest scent . Silphium uses notes of frankincense , myrrh , leather and tobacco to echo silphium , a herb considered as valuable as gold in ancient times . High demand for the plant , only found in the wilds of northern Africa and used for medicine as well as for its aromatic properties , led to its extinction .

Bold , political statements came courtesy of Ashish , Rick Owens and Gareth Pugh ; while HermTs , Delpozo and Pringle of Scotland applied little more than lip balm and mascara . Whether you favour air-brushed beauty or statement-making face paint , explore our tale of two pretty cities here ... <p> Eckhaus Latta : Hair was left elegantly under-styled at Eckhaus Latta , allowing the innovative face paint design to shine through . Colourful dashes were dabbed across cheeks , chins and brows with an uncomfortable freneticism ; one part futuristic disease , one part unfinished pointillism painting . Amid the backdrop of a troubled USA , the clashing , troublesome collection ( which paired Mad Max shoulder pads with ugly-beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latta do cult-cool Americana like few else . Photography : Jason Lloyd-Evans <p> Rick Owens:There was a sense of ceremony in Paris with makeshift architectural headresses made from sweatshirt sleeves draped over bent wire frames . In terms of make-up , things were just as bold and visionary . Chalky white faces recalled ancient rituals . Photography : Jason Lloyd-Evans <p> Ashish : This season , Ashish boldy opted for Mexican wrestling mask-inspired make-up , a **26;116;TOOLONG reference to Donald Trump and his infamous wall . Created by part-time face-painter turned beauty doyenne Isamaya French , the graphic make-up design broke barriers , as fashion show slipped into a theatrical costume party ( in a good way ) . Hair , courtesy of Ali Pirzadeh , was pulled taught , as if under skull-hugging mask hats , or back-combed and tinted halloween green . Photography : Jason Lloyd-Evans <p> Gareth Pugh : The designer 's army of outsiders stalked the runway in unsettling military garb , to a frenetic , terrifying soundtrack . The make-up design followed ( highly structured ) suit . Eyes were covered in what looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look hooded with sweeps of dark green , while lips were coated in poison blue . It was a dangerous , statement making affair . Photography : Jason Lloyd-Evans <p> Versus : Versace 's naughtier cousin Versus continued the bold eye trend it employed last season . Sweeps of exciting pigment were applied from the inner corner of the eye , extending to the hairline.The rest of the face was kept clean , so as to emphasise these daring pops of colour . Where last season hair was unfussy and minimal , here , it exploded in hand-tousled rat tails and shaggy bobs . Photography : Jason Lloyd-Evans <p> Alberta Ferretti : No one blended a bold eye this season quite like Alberta Ferretti . Heavily charcoaled eyes were lightened by pockets of rusty colours at the centre of the lid , forming a wearable yet edgy look . Under the eyes , pale , dusty highlight contrasted the heavy-handed shadows . Hair was similarly easy to wear , swept into carefree , low buns . Photography : Jason Lloyd-Evans <p> Thom Browne : Cool , calm and collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little in terms of make-up . Fun , fabric lips were cut out in the shape of a perfect pout and stuck on it natty black and white check patterns that matched the tailoring . Photography : Jason Lloyd-Evans <p> Delpozo : Slicked back hair was pulled taught under swimming cap-esque headgear , rounding off Josep Font 's architectural display . Make-up remained minimal , so as to not distract from the structural , highly textured collection . The matte , amber eye shadow was of particular note , however , kept close to the eye line . Photography : Jason Lloyd-Evans <p> Junya Watanabe : Head-props and hair-hats from master Japanese hairstylist Tomihiro Kono topped off a punk-perfect showcase from Junya Watanabe . The neck-craning affair also saw smokey eyes get blown up , with punky spidery lashes in smouldering shades of burnt orange and pollution green <p> HermFs : The house often delivers a softer , subtler approach to the current make-up trends . This season was no different . It continued to apply the soft liner and pulled-back hair looks that they tested last season , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gently blushing cheek . Photography : Jason Lloyd-Evans <p> Maison Margiela : John Galliano 's relentless energy and eccentricity was felt in his wonderfully weird styling this season . On some girls , neon lashes made a welcome return , this time paired with equally vibrant shadows . On others , dead-white paint on eyelids was also drawn across the girl 's torsos in faux skintight t-shirts . Up top , sinewy feathers and colourful lengths of string were tied into hair in anarchic deadlocks. 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Available in maple , walnut and pear wood , the letters slot together to form a cube . Photography : Bea de Giacomo <p> The story of Bottega Ghianda demonstrates the entrepreneurial guile , good fortune and smart connections common to so many of Italys finest family operations . It begins in 1889 , when Iginio Ghianda established a small bottega , or workshop , next to his home in Bovisio-Masciago , in the heart of Brianza . He started out producing inlaid parquet flooring , before moving into wooden aeroplane propellers and then , from around 1920 , furniture . <p> Pierluigi Ghianda was born in 1926 into this family of falegnami , or woodworkers . After Iginio died in 1938 , his wife Serafina ran the business while Pierluigi and his brother Giuseppe juggled their studies and apprenticeships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gio Ponti had asked Iginio to work on a writing desk , Montecatini . The relationship with Ponti proved pivotal for the workshop , with the architect and designer requesting prototypes of his creations . The workshop went on to collaborate with manufacturers such as Cassina , De Padova , Skipper and Knoll on product development . Pontis patronage also encouraged a steady flow of orders from great names in Italian architecture , including Gae Aulenti , Cini Boeri , the Castiglioni brothers , Gianfranco Frattini , Richard Sapper and Ettore Sottsass . Ghianda craftsmanship brought their designs to life , producing bespoke furniture and fittings for international projects such as Aulentis MusTe dOrsay in Paris , and for Livio Castiglionis homes for industrialist family the Agnellis . <p> Pierluigi was established as the go-to man for advanced woodworking . Architects and designers sought his advice on construction , joints , inserts and connections , often developed without the use of nails , screws , bolts or any foreign materials . As Mario Bellini puts it , Pierluigi offered quality and solutions to the limit of construction techniques . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HermFs and architect Rena Dumas wanted to introduce the Pippa line of folding furniture , they too sought out Pierluigi . They knew he shared their obsession with quality . <p> Scatola Portapillole , 1935 , by Bottega Ghianda . Each pillbox is hand-carved from a single piece of wood and has a curved lid that is moulded for easier opening . Photography : Bea de Giacomo <p> Romeo Sozzi , another master of Italian woodworking , first met Pierluigi in 1985 , three years before founding his own furniture company , Promemoria . In 2015 , Pierluigi , now 87 , was looking to secure the future of his workshop . His wife , Francesca , had died and his three children had rejected the plane and chisel as a career option . Later the same year , just a month before he died , Pierluigi signed a deal with Sozzi , who acquired all the bottegas intellectual property , as well as its craftsmen . Pierluigis eightstrong team moved to a new workshop in Valmadrera , around 40km away from Bovisio Masciago , but just a five-minute drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new name , Bottega Ghianda , and hired Milan-based architect Michele De Lucchi as artistic director . De Lucchi is completely smitten by the product . He says his role is to assist and accompany Romeo Sozzi on this adventure , to maintain the spirit of Ghianda . According to De Lucchi , Pierluigi was a man who knew the culture of wood , the story of wood and the identity of wood . <p> The two had never met , although Pierluigi had developed prototypes for Memphis while De Lucchi was part of the design collective . The special thing about his story is the quality . How do you make something like this ? Its incredibly perfect , De Lucchi says , pointing to a flawless joint . For someone who works in wood , its magic . You cant understand how they make it its exaggerated and outside the usual dimensions. <p> De Lucchi has designed Bottega Ghiandas very first store in Milans Brera district , using panels of light black wood , lacquered and hand-polished with steel wool five times over . This process gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm and highly tactile touch ; they reinforce the flawless finishing of Ghiandas products . <p> The goods are illuminated with museum-quality lighting and displayed as if floating away from the wall , on soft-cornered rectangular shelves covered in grey Loro Piana felt the perfect complement to the warmth of the woods , such as Swiss pear ( Italian pear is no good , according to Sozzi , as the trees are cut too low ) . De Lucchi has used the same lacquered and polished wood , as well as cream coloured Loro Piana cashmere , for the packaging . The ceremonial aspect of the packaging is very important , as you only have one opportunity to have a first impression , he says . <p> The store displays a collection of objets and furniture designed between 1918 and 2002 by the likes of Aulenti , Bellini , Boeri , Frattini , Carl Magnusson and Emanuela Frattini Magnusson , plus one new piece by De Lucchi and historic items from Iginio Ghiandas era . Over the years , Iginio assembled quite a collection , developed with these architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces include a bookmark , first realised in 1935 for a passionate Venetian bibliophile , and a set of photo frames based on the frames made by Iginio for the MusTe dOrsay . <p> Calzascarpe spoon , 1981 , and Specchio Da Viaggio mirror , 1920 , both by Bottega Ghianada . The workshops oak-leaf logo was designed by Pino Tovaglia . Photography : Bea de Giacomo <p> Also on display is Bellinis +tagFre shelving , designed as a kind of dare after his first meeting with Pierluigi Ghianda in 1989 . Knowing you have as a partner an absolute master , I designed a piece using a large amount of very thin vertical columns to connect different shelves a sort of small , lightweight skyscraper , Bellini says . <p> The Kyoto table , from 1974 , is made up of 1,705 individual 45-degree joints . Its a design by Gianfranco Frattini , who trained with Ponti and became one of Pierluigis closest collaborators . A wastepaper basket by Emanuela Frattini Magnusson from 1986 , the Cestino a baguettes , is constructed from 89 beech strips , known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished with wood-tipped brass rivets . All the bottegas pieces are stamped with an oak leaf in relief . Ghianda means acorn and the oak-leaf logo was designed by graphic designer Pino Tovaglia , who also created the workshops Amore puzzle in 1959 . <p> Once , when Marella Agnelli , the wife of Fiat owner Gianni Agnelli , visited the workshop , Pierluigi saw her taking out a plastic pillbox . He thought it was most unsuitable and decided to offer his wooden pillbox . This is a piece that impresses De Lucchi a great deal . As he takes one in his hand , he says : Wood never stays still . Its alive , its a fibre which absorbs humidity as it breathes . To create this piece you must have courage its a surprise , a marvel. For him , this is the essence of Bottega Ghianda . <p> As for the future , De Lucchi feels it is essential , for the health of the business , to develop new products it is not a commercial decision , but a question of vitality .

@@40481252 @481252/ <p> The Yorkshire Sculpture Park ( YSP ) is memorialising its 40th anniversary in the way only sculpture enthusiasts could : with countless exhibitions , commissions and events , including a 40-hour long party in the summer ( not for the faint-hearted ) . Gearing up for the celebration , a more introspective event opens tomorrow in the Upper Gallery . Anne Purkiss : Sculptors at Yorkshire Sculpture Park pays homage to the many renowned sculptors who have contributed work to the parkk over the years . Two important pieces from Sir Anthony Caro ( pictured here in 1991 ) once towered over YSPs rugged lakeside . Both Dream City ( 1996 ) and Promenade ( 1996 ) were proud and lonely works made from rusted steel , appearing starkly manmade against the lake . Having worked with Henry Moore ( perhaps the most renowned of the Yorkshire sculptors ) early in his career , it 's fitting that Caro was picked by Purkiss to kick off this exhibition .

For more information , visit the website <p> Back in 1991 , YSP launched a major exhibition of Lynn Chadwick 's work ( pictured here in 1995 ) . Chadwick , who passed away in 2003 , was a self-trained , extremely skilled metalworker . In the 1950s , critic Herbert Read coined the phrase a ' geometry of fear ' , which he applied to the work of a group of young post-war artists including Chadwick , many of whom have featured at the park . The tortured figures , alien shapes and imposing angels of Chadwick 's work would have appeared particularly drastic and otherworldly against the undulating valleys of the Bretton Estate <p> Another ' geometry of fear ' proponent , Dame Elisabeth Frink , is captured here by Purkiss in 1990 . The post-war sculptor 's work can still be seen at YSP , perhaps most movingly in the Camellia House gallery , where a Frink bust moodily looks on among row upon row of camellia trees <p> Purkiss captured environmentalist Andy Goldsworthy in 2002 , leaning on an almighty stone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 , the YSP curated its most ambitious exhibition yet , revealing the breadth and direction of Goldsworthy 's practise .

Along the way , it has generated in excess of 100 limited editions . One of the most fTted horological designs of all time , the Speedmaster became the official Nasa timepiece in 1965 . Buzz Aldrin ( pictured , 1969 ) , a self-confessed ' watch guy ' wore his on the Apollo 11 mission , bestowing the Speedmaster stratospheric status when it became the first watch to be worn on the moon . <p> To celebrate , here 's our pick of six decades of classic Speedmaster designs ... <p> Photograph : NASA <p> 1957 The Original Its dial simply reads Speedmaster because space travel was the furthest thing from the designers minds when this watch was first conceived , as a chronograph to time sporting events . Enthusiasts call it the Broad Arrow because of the shape of its hour hand one of the very few design details to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it was so right . <p> 1959 First in Space By 1959 , the Speedmasters broad arrow hand was replaced with a dagger-type , and the bezel was changed to black aluminium . In 1963 , before the Speedmaster was made official NASA issue , astronaut Wally Schirra would wear this model on a mission into space on 3 October 1962 , for the Mercury programmes Sigma 7 mission . It was thus the first Speedmaster to leave Earth . <p> 1965 The Moon Watch Having passed all of NASAs tests with flying colours , the Speedmaster was officially sanctioned for the space programme . When Armstrong and Aldrin stepped onto the lunar surface in 1969 , this was the version of the Speedmaster they wore . The first with an asymmetrical case , for added protection for the crown and pushers , it was also the first with a dial bearing the term Professional . <p> 1969 Alaska I Prototype Omegas internal code name for anything to do with NASA was Alaska , to protect the top-secret nature of the proceedings .

The white dial was employed to reflect the heat of the sun . <p> 1971 Speedmaster Mk III Housed in a swoopy Pilot case , the Mk III was fitted with Omegas first self-winding chronograph movement . Calibre 1040 was heralded by an advertisement in 1972 , which stated , After six landings on the moon , there was only one thing we could teach the Speedmaster . To wind itself . This model also featured the cross-shaped 60-minute chronograph hand and a 24-hour day/night indicator at 9 oclock . <p> 1985 First Speedmaster with moonphase Although the Speedmaster had been to the Moon , it did n't feature a moonphase indicator until 1985 . Nicknamed the Speedymoon , it was issued in a series of only 1,300 pieces . The moonphase was displayed using a disc adorned with a painted moon and stars , in a fourth sub-dial with a date function . On some rare examples , a face is also painted on the moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Speedmaster Professional wasnt restricted to space missions . When Michael Schumacher became an ambassador for Omega in 1996 , it was a natural move to revive what collectors call the racing dial , from 1968 . Produced with both red and yellow dials , the watch earned its name from its racing-style minute track . Its rubber presentation box resembled the tyres of F1 cars . <p> 2003 From the Moon to Mars While unmistakably a Speedmaster Professional , this models sub-dials were adorned with photorealistic images of the Moon , Earth and Mars , and bore the legend From the Moon To Mars . Its release was a response to Americas announcement that the country planned to build a permanent space station on the Moon before 2020 to act as a launch site for future manned missions to Mars . <p> 2007 50th Anniversary A decade ago , to mark the watchs first half-century , Omega produced this limited edition of 5,957 pieces .

Sticking with the basic chronograph topology , this all-new ladies model features a diamond-paved bezel with its tachymeter scale on a brown aluminium ring . In addition to the fresh colours , the eye is drawn to oval apertures for the sub-dials . <p> 2017 Speedmaster Racing Master Chronometer Racing is the operative term for this new 2017 offering , recalling the dial details of the 1996 Schumacher model . Here , the background is matt black , while the rest of the new watchs name tells you that it boasts chronometer certification .

Annual visitors and clients will likely agree : there is always a particular thrill in knowing that such meticulously staged mise-en-scenes within a tent in the Tuileries exist for such a fleeting few days . <p> But the guarantee of discovering something unique or rare , or else finding familiar objets dart grouped with originality , is what truly makes PAD Paris such a destination fair . An advance walkthrough of this latest showcase yielded too many highlights to include here . So at the risk of excluding quite a bit , what follows is simply an attempt to single out various points of interest or newness , plus a few random observations . <p> ' PanthTon ' , by Mauro Fabbro , 2016 , at Biaggi Gallery <p> For starters , there is a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honorary curator of the Centre Pompidou 's design department . It is likely no coincidence that her arrival coincides with an increase in female gallerists , who now represent 30 per cent of the exhibitors ( it is , admittedly , still a low percentage ) . In addition , the fairs cafe design was overseen by Sarah Lavoine , who created a lush green setting enlivened with her signature pattern mixing . In some instances , women who have participated in the past are playing up their female artists this year , as is the case with Antonine CatzTflis . Her booth comes alive with the diverse creations of contemporary ceramicists ClTmentine de Chabaneix ( her innocent animal figures bear the faintest trace of her grandparents , Claude and Francois-Xavier Lalanne ) , Agathe Brahami Ferron and Elisabeth Lincot , whose 110 unique bird heads make for a lively wall installation and conversation piece . CatzTflis is also presenting a remarkable piece from Benjamin Pagnart which looks as though it materialised from a Hieronymous Bosch painting , with its many breast-shaped drawers and bowed legs , all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired by a perfumer for storing small samples although frankly , its novelty has far wider appeal . <p> On the subject of ceramics , Karen Swamis series in a deep shade of lapis blue ringed in lustrous gold deserves a look , if only to appreciate how she has parlayed traditional techniques into vessels that bridge time . But Maria Wettergrens eye for Scandinavian graphic minimalism is no less impactful . Among MW Galeries key pieces this year are a striking panel of iron thread-like pressed coral fibres by Gjertrud Hals ; Ilkka Suppanens subtle white tableau rendered whimsical thanks to scattered dewdrops in Murano glass ; and a high-gloss cubist stack of boxes in peony pink from Ditte Hammerstrm in her booth . Was she thinking differently about her selection this year ? ' I think everything is faithful to the spirit of the gallery , ' she maintains . These are all poetic works inspired by nature. <p> ' Miroir I ' , by Karen Swami <p> The same could be said of the light fixtures Christopher Boots created exclusively for Armel Soyer ( yet another female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth tones are illuminated by LEDs within hooped metal frames so that the effect is simultaneously raw and refined . <p> Indeed , while PAD Paris has never taken a thematic approach , the inclination among exhibitors towards natural subject matter feels undeniable this year . Its certainly noticeable in Damien Gernays manipulation of leather as wave-like patterning for his ' Mer Noire ( Black Sea ) ' table in the Gosserez space , and also in Alexandre Biaggis choice of elegant coral sconces from Janine Janet , an artisan who often did window installations for Crist=bal Balenciaga . While Biaggi is among many contemporary decorative arts specialists at the fair , this year marks the 20th anniversary of his gallery and so he returned after a hiatus . Its such a creative space where antiques and contemporary works come together in an unparalleled setting , he says . There are so many opportunities to discover. <p> ' Interieur Serie 5 ' , by Wim Borst , 2015 , at Galerie Clara Scremini <p> And if not to buy , then to learn ; Lacostes tribute to the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MTtro ornamentation among other Art Nouveau marvels brings together rare , highly stylised furniture from the turn-of-the-century , recreating the whimsy with freshness and flourish . For an extreme counterpoint , see Dominic Harris arrangement of small screens at PrivTekollektie , each featuring a different species of flower in a state of augmented reality ; picture a deconstructed , animated still life ( an oxymoron , to be sure ) and you get a rough idea . <p> Also worth singling out : Studio MVWs ' JinShi ' console with its decorative pink jade discs that are lit from within to service the adjacent mirror . Youd be hard-pressed to find a chic-er piece for a boudoir . Then there 's the rare Lalanne rhinoceros screen at Y &amp; V Gastou , which will likely find a home early into the fairs five-day run . <p> Galerie Alexandre Guillemain , stand view <p> And as for this years winners , determined by a jury that included Vincent DarrT , Joseph Dirand , Jacques Grange , India Mahdavi and Philippe Starck ? Sleeves , the luminescent , multi-hued glass scrolls by Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best contemporary design with ' La Collection ' , a series of forward leaning decorative forms from RoWin Atelier at Galerie Alexandre Guillemain . <p> But for some , Pierre Gonalons re-imagining of Rudolf Nureyevs Parisian apartment for the designated Studio Pad space might make the most indelible impression . Here , the young designers austerely attractive marble designs punctuate Pierre Freys rhythmic oversized vegetal textiles . Not just an update of the dancers bold taste , the inspired arrangement crystallises the fairs mission to surprise time and time again . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

@@40481275 @481275/ <p> For 40 years , British artists Langlands &amp; Bell have decoded the structures of buildings to illuminate human relationships their subjects have included Le Corbusiers CitT Radieuse , the British Museum , Millbank Penitentiary and , most famously , the house of Osama bin Laden ( a work which earned them a nomination for 2004s Turner Prize ) . For their new exhibition , opening this month at Londons Alan Cristea Gallery , they are turning their attention to the futuristic architecture of internet giants . <p> The show consists of 24 editioned prints , depicting in-progress or recently completed campuses belonging to Apple , Facebook , IBM , the Gates Foundation and Nvidia . Stripped of texture and context , they are shown in distilled form against sharply coloured backgrounds that accentuate their shape . Most of them are laid at an oblique angle , so viewers feel like God looking down at a Lilliputian landscape , and experience a rare sense of power over companies that have influenced almost every aspect of our lives . <p> The belle of the ball is the new Apple HQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the late Steve Jobs and designed by Foster + Partners . With a circumference of one mile , it is unprecedented in scale and ambition . But by presenting it in top view , the artists emphasise its circular shape , which has parallels throughout historical architecture . You can see the connection between the Apple building and the Coliseum , and between architecture , power and spectacle , the duo contends . Like the Coliseum , and by extension the Roman Empire , the Apple building stands for universal vision , but also the centralisation of might . <p> Gates Foundation ( Seattle ) , 2016 , shot at the Alan Cristea Gallery in London <p> The simplicity of Langlands &amp; Bells prints belies meticulous research and production . The artists began by constructing physical models based on building plans downloaded from municipal websites . These were photographed from various perspectives , then redrawn on a computer .

The latter was designed by Frank Gehry , but eschews the flamboyance that characterises the architects other work . Instead , it comprises a single floor on stilts with a garden-like roof . Langlands &amp; Bell contend that Facebook is reluctant to reveal the extent of its power it avoids monumental architecture lest it appear as a monolithic conglomerate . Accordingly , the wall sculpture does not show the buildings fatade , but presents a model of the interior , colour-coded for both functional purpose and aesthetic impact . The grey area represents open-plan office space for 2,800 employees , making it the single largest room in the world . The artists call it a spectacle of endless access , a deliberate display of transparency that contrasts with the way some say that Facebook has enslaved its users . <p> The artists look forward to continuing the series beyond this exhibition , yet they question if the architecture of internet giants might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages , the baroque palaces and gardens of the Enlightenment , and the factories and railway stations of the Industrial Revolution .

It is a book with very few words , writes Sir Jony Ive in the foreword . It is about our products , their physical nature and how they were made. The pages that follow trace two stratospheric decades of product design with the effortlessness that 's become synonymous with the company . <p> It is a quiet and elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and production . It is far from a show-off vanity project . Great care , time and money has been spent on making it a paean to good , useful design and manufacturing . It is also of course a paean to Steve Jobs.In the five years since his death , Apple has forged on without him . Designed by Apple in California is a tribute both to him , and to the products that have shaped our future . <p> The tome is Apple at its purest : the products . We caught up with I 've to find out more ... <p> Wallpaper* : The new book , quite unusually for Apple , is a look back.Jony Ive : The biggest challenge for us was the fact that our focus and preoccupation is always on the future . So that tends to exclude much time to look back at the work we have previously done . Sometimes if we are struggling with a particular issue then that gives us reason to go back and look at the way we have solved problems in the past . But because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to realise we did n't have a catalogue of the physical products . So about eight years ago we felt an obligation to address this and build an objective archive . Many of the products that you see , we actually had to go out and purchase laughs . It 's a rather shameful admission , but it 's just not an area that we really invested much time or energy in , so we started to build an archive of the physical products . <p> These custom-designed , high-performance tungsten carbide cutting tools were use to manufacture the iPhone 4 bezel <p> W* : Objectivity seems to be the key goal ? JI : We were intrigued how we could objectively describe , define and catalogue the objects and try to give people a sense of how they were made . Not how they were designed , but how they came to be . How they were manufactured and how you can transform these often-anonymous materials into something that is valuable and useful . <p> W* : By looking back , did it trigger memories ? JI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Apple so many of us associate different projects with different parts of our lives . It was curious and interesting . For each project there are multiple stories . <p> Interestingly , the only way we realised we would finish the project was to treat it like one of the projects in the studio . There were a few things we needed to do to accurately and objectively portray these products . Of course , many of these products are white , so the off-the-shelf printing processes really did n't do an adequate job in describing the colour and surface of those products . So , unsurprisingly we ended up developing custom forms of paper from British papermaker James Cropper and custom inks . <p> The composition from the launch of the very first iMacs , unveiled in 1998 , was replicated exactly for the book <p> W* : Did you and the team in turn learn anything from the process of making the book ? JI : The products we 're working on at the moment , and have been for a while , are the beneficiaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course to us they are the very best things we have ever done . Therefore the frustration , the absolute frustration , of not being able to include that work was sometimes enough to make us think this is something we 're not going to be able to finish . It 's around 20 years of work and it certainly is n't everything we 've done it 's the things that we think were salient in our learning or that we just had an affection for . That part the selection process was n't too hard or challenging we generally all felt the same way about the same products . But certainly to draw a line and say this will be the end of this first catalogue , first book , that was exquisitely painful . <p> W* : Quite typically for Apple , the book comes beautifully packaged . JI : We 're so used to packaging 3D objects , so that was part of the project we really enjoyed trying to create a very simple way of protecting the book and not having to force people to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwrapping and made it enjoyable . So often you can put all of your energy into the primary product that you forget that your actual experience is an aggregation of the product plus all of these peripheral objects like the packaging and shipping box . We really wanted to treat each of them with the care they deserve , or rather , the care that people the customer deserves , such as with the draw tab on the cardboard box and the simple tuck on the envelope . <p> Detail of the draw tab of the shipping box , which is pulled open to reveal the book inside . Photography : Antonio Camera <p> W* : What were your key objectives for the book ? JI : We asked ourselves , ' What is the value of a book like this , when most people know these objects so intimately already ? ' First , to see the objects out of their functional context . Next , to see them in a context of the subsequent products and hopefully how we have learned as a team how technology shifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the fact that many people do n't really have much of a sense of how their manufactured environment came to be . Most people would n't understand how the chair they are sat on is made . One of the things we wanted to do was try and explain as clearly as we can through photography how you transform a raw material into a product that you recognise and hopefully use as a daily tool . <p> We decided to be fairly explicit about some of the processes we used . I guess we feel a strong sense of ownership of these processes because they really do aid our understanding and learning and transfer from one product to the next . We feel that more than ever there has been a disconnect between designing and making and really , you ca n't disconnect them . In the 90s , as manufacturing was outsourced , this chasm developed between where something was made and where it was designed . But designing and making are inseparable if you want the ultimate product to have integrity . Another key point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design colleges in the world . We are keen to get it into the hands of young people who are studying design disciplines . It 's very important that its an educational resource as well . <p> iPod aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour <p> W* : I presume all the photographs ( by Andrew Zuckerman ) were shot specifically for the book . But there 's one incredible image of a Nasa space shuttle ? JI : Yes , they were with the exception of that Space Shuttle image ( above ) . The first image in the book is of the very first iMac .

And the album artwork kept delivering surprises . If you hold the gatefold cover to the light , a celestial image is revealed ; expose it to a black light and it shines a vivid blue . I think it is boring to understand everything immediately , says Barnbrook . There are some people who have the album that do n't  realise the front says " Bowie " .

A compact , one-bedroom retreat , it lies tucked into a hillside site in a remote spot west of Calgary . Approached from the rear , all one sees is a slender entrance door cut into a concrete wall . Yet once inside , the sheer drama of the landscape is unveiled , with floor-to-ceiling windows showing a panoramic sweep of prairie and woodland reaching all the way to the horizon , split from the sky by the jagged white peaks of the distant Rockies . <p> The house was designed by James Cutler of Cutler Anderson Architects , a studio that specialises in discreet but dramatic and , above all , slow-burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully fitted into landscapes , says Cutler , whose approach splices craft with respect for the world outside and an embrace of new materials . The architect still draws details freehand and wo n't design anything he ca n't build himself . Houses are dreams . People hire me to create a stage set for the drama of their lives , he says . I have to make an emotionally powerful connection with the landscape. <p> The Rock House provides the dream modernist experience , bringing the outside in while staying safely ensconced behind thickly insulated glass . Insulation is a necessity out here . A few miles north of the Trans-Canada Highway , between Calgary and Banff , the land is rolling prairie . The only occupants are widely scattered farms , remote private plots and reservations , as well as elk , bison , eagles and wolves . Winter is hard and lasts many months , during which time many tracks and cabins are almost inaccessible . For Cutler , the landscape was a major component of the design . Our clients understand that were going to do things really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyor out I personally engage in the landscape with a tape measure . We looked at 15 potential sitesfor a house on this land . I walked the whole property and I thought it was the best spot. <p> The cabin nestles alongside a rare outcrop of lichen-covered rock , creating a natural break in the treeline where the land gives way to a sharp dip and a long , open view . The design is like a ships prow , a glassy point that rises up from the cut in the rocks and oversails the landscape . The structure is simplicity itself , with a central steel I-beam lifted up on slender steel columns , above which floats a wood-framed roof . Every fatade is glazed and the careful cut into the rock means the house literally abuts nature , offering up a miniature landscape of time-worn rock in the foreground , the epic vastness of Alberta in the background . We cant give this view away , says Cutler , so we came up behind the building and it reveals itself as you enter the house .

After three decades of coasting along under the auspices of Vorsprung Durch Technik , the rest of the auto industry eventually caught up with Audis technocratic idealism . What 's rather more secure is the companys lead in terms of perceived quality and sophistication . Audi is still the industry leader when it comes to interiors , navigation and dashboards , with rigorous attention to detail . <p> As we 've often noted , there 's an Audi for every occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest in what promises to be another deluge of new models ( eight in two years ) is the RS3 , a high performance variant of the A3 available in both sedan ( saloon ) and Sportback versions . RS is Audis magic performance glitter , a dedicated division that has been building limited run high-speed versions of its regular production models since the 1990s . <p> The RS3 features a singleframe grille in gloss black honeycomb and a striking RS bumper <p> The RS3 is notable chiefly because this is the first time the magic dust has been dappled on a compact saloon car as opposed to something larger , sleeker or more capacious . The move shows how important traditional saloon car markets still are to Audi ( the US , China , India , etc. ) ; even as markets like Europe switch to SUVs big and small , a sports car still has a halo effect across a range . <p> Audi chose to launch the RS3 in Oman , away from the European circuit and not far from those key target markets . The car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no denying its ability . A landscape of wide , fast , empty roads goats , camels and cattle notwithstanding Oman offers the kind of fantasy world that best suits the modern performance machine . We can report that the RS3 in both variants is both competent and comfortable , with the quattro four wheel drive and numerous other stability aids endowing deity-like control over the car . Way up in the country 's sparsely-inhabited Dhofar mountains exists a veritable paradise for drivers , with the kind of wide , empty , far-sighted roads that usually exist only in car ads and on press launches . <p> The car features a five-cylinder engine , S tronic and quattro permanent all-wheel drive that switches gears at lightning speed <p> Herein lies the paradox at the heart of the traditional performance car .

The car is even explicitly described as the entry ticket to Audi Sport by CEO Stephan Winkelmann , who also notes the RS3 will probably be the sub-brands biggest seller . <p> That being said , Audi Sport models make up less than two per cent of Audis total sales ; they exist almost purely to garnish the brand .

Photography : Takumi Ota <p> Nendo 's concept sketch of the clock workshop <p> A futuristic clock-making workshop set up in the opulent surrounds of Milans Palazzo Visconti , made for an intriguing spectacle at last weeks Salone del Mobile . With its brightly lit , open , black framework design sitting in sharp contrast to the palazzos frescoed ceiling and glittering chandeliers , the temporary atelier is the result of a collaboration between luxury Italian watch brand Panerai and ubiquitous Japanese design studio Nendo . <p> Time is not something that you get afraid of , says Nendo founder Oki Sato of the exhibitions theme , but it is something that by feeling it , it becomes very rich and it becomes part of you . I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home their own time. <p> Clock faces of varying thicknesses were cut on site from a length of extruded transparent plastic in front of waiting customers , who could order a clock and then watch as it was sliced and assembled in the workshop . While the minimal square-shaped face displays just four numbers and one-stroke numerals , the clocks thickness depends on the exact time of the customers visit . For example , explains Sato , if the time is 10:15 we add 10 and 15 to make a 25mm thickness , and you understand that you were here at 10:15 and you can take home your own time. <p> Slice of Time , by Nendo and Panerai <p> After being cut , the clock proceeds through the different departments of the workshop , where it is polished , sand blasted and assembled by Panerai technicians dressed in white lab coats .

@@40481303 @481303/ <p> Every now and again , someone from the architecture and building industry stands up and says something worthy and meaningful about how adaptation , reuse , restoration and upgrading existing buildings is of far greater importance than building anew . Unfortunately , nothing captures the imagination more than a shiny new building , so proponents of innovation restorations are often left trailing in the wake of novelty . <p> Marc Kristal hopes to change all that with The New Old House . An international survey of adaptive re-use , the book looks at 18 case studies where renewal has included a major new built component , sitting alongside the old to make a sharp and shapely juxtaposition . Covering everything from ancient British industrial architecture to new takes on the NY townhouse , these are strikingly different projects with a shared ethos at their heart . Renovation , it seems , need place no limits on formal and material innovation , and as the many photographs ably demonstrate , the combination of old and new enhances the patina and texture of these new residences . <p> Kristals book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that project descriptions are rich with insider insight and a genuine interest in the history and processes that shaped each project .

Silver Lake is now a hot residential and retail address , Culver City draws upmarket restaurants and galleries , and the nightlife in Downtown and Koreatown is flourishing . No area is changing faster than the Arts District , which , with its industrial buildings and converted warehouses , feels more Brooklyn than LA , no doubt in part due to the flood of creative New Yorkers relocating here . <p> Construction in Taipei has intensified in recent years the Shongshan Cultural and Creative Park , home to Toyo Itos New Horizon , is one of the most ambitious urban-renewal programmes of the last decade , while OMAs Performing Arts Centre is nearing completion . Meanwhile , fine-dining restaurants serving light-touch cooking have revolutionised the cuisine . Taipeis title of World Design Capital 2016 might be a little premature , but what is happening creatively here right now is more exciting than at any other time in history . <p> Alessandro Micheles debut at Gucci brought a romantic about-face for the Florentine brand . Sexpot ploys were replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though Micheles woman veered in and out of dishevelled street style and hyper luxury , best in show were the lady-like dresses and skirts featuring knife-sharp pleats in printed silk or papery leather . Michele also delivered a sense of wide-eyed wonder to winters extras , with the most striking footwear being his fur-lined slippers and mules . www.gucci.com <p> Calculated , undone clothing was at the heart of Phoebe Philos stellar winter collection , where dresses were left incomplete on the backside and skirts swooshed along in unfinished , asymmetrical layers . The clothing was painstakingly put together with eccentric touches such as fancy bell-sleeve cuffs or patch fronts , while raw-seamed , leather bucket-totes in contrasting colours or flashes of zebra skin completed the look . Philo is heralded as a minimalist , but her best work of late deals with more complex , intricate workmanship . www.celine.com <p> Lengths dropped , waists were cinched and fabrics advanced as Consuelo Castiglioni cut tunic-like sheaths over flared skirts and wide trousers to create a warrior-like silhouette . Weighty , cloak-like coats were superbly drawn , but the hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser-cut holes trimmed with glistening black crystals . Fur arms , python bags and huge disc earrings all gave a tribal feel to this collection , while the new python boot of the season featured a sole that extended beyond the edge of the foot like a puddle . www.marni.com <p> Separation was the theme that Rei Kawakubo mined with her hauntingly beautiful collection . Using strips of black leather , lace , white cotton or rich gold brocade , the designer wrapped her models in wearable cages , protecting them from the outside world . The looks became progressively more impactful , culminating in a giant , wearable igloo-like structure crafted from black strips of lace and bows that held the model like a prisoner . There was also a collection of hats that covered both heads and faces like gauzy , wet cobwebs. **25;234;TOOLONG <p> Key features : Models were wrapped in wearable fabric cages , as if to protect them from the outside world Creative director : Rei Kawakubo Brand based : Tokyo , Japan <p> Photography : courtesy of Comme des Gartons <p> Louis Vuitton <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouettes continued to look sharp and swift , while the clothes themselves were down-to-earth in a resolutely cool way , as shown by the polar-bear-sized white sheepskins , 19th-century puff-sleeved shirts , and peplum tank-top skirt suits .

Handbags morphed into silver trunks , as kitten-heeled , pointed shoes came covered with gold rivets . www.dior.com <p> This autumn Stefano Pilati envisaged a natural dreamscape populated by sleek eco-warriors ready to jump into the urban jungle . In fact , there were more trees inside the show venue than there are in most of Milans parks . The runway , however , was devoted to protective , in-the-field gear that had a high-end luxury bent , the best of which were Harris tweed-inspired , mud-coloured wool coats with reptilian scales and a glossy finish . Also hot property were the sweaters that came with their own cable-knit , baseball cap hoods. www.zegna.com <p> Hidden beneath hood-like black felt chapeaux , Rei Kawakubos characters arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cool wool that spiralled on the bias . Ultra-slim suiting clung like tiny cardigans puckering at the chest , and a zebra-printed pony skin lightened the chilling message made by a menacing face mask and harness-sleeves .

Using only the finest tweeds , pinstripe wools and jacquards , the collection offered the modern gentleman the definitive globetrotting wardrobe , from three-piece flannel suits to fine wool safari jackets . www.carusomenswear.com <p> Pradas show invitation was cut from a crisp sheet of black taffeta , and much of this collection came from the same inky-hued fabric perhaps a nod to the sheen of the Milanese houses infamous black Nylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to highly masculine tailored pieces , including cropped peacoats , short-sleeved shirts and pressed jackets . Mrs Prada took her fascination with clunky , orthopedic footwear to new heights , presenting lace-up shoes that were clamped into plastic vices with jaw-like soles . www.prada.com <p> A return to dandyism was the order of the day at Junya Watanabe with a collection of tuxedos and top hats in his signature textile patchwork . Watanabe rolled out the red carpet to transform the cold concrete of the Palais de Tokyo into a classy cabaret , opening the show with the shadow play of a slow-spinning disco ball . Casting was key : Watanabe enlisted the Sapeurs ( the Society of Ambiance-Makers and Elegant People ) that began in the Congo , while a handful of genuine Parisian dandies were also called in to help . <p> We make no apology for including Buly 1803 on our shortlist for the second year running , as this French brand continues to innovate .

Perfumer Olivier Polge explains : I wanted to convey the atmosphere of the Ballets Russes and the smell of make-up from that time.

What it really became was a hilarious roast and toast of four 20th century Cool School artists , who had come together to reminisce , reflect and tease one another with eyewitness tales and memories . <p> On stage were Ed Moses , silver-haired and bearded in a wheelchair ; Larry Bell , cowboy-hatted and crusty ; Ed Ruscha , first dour and then amused by his peers ' alternate facts ; and provocateur Billy Al Bengston in a floral jean jacket . ( Only Robert Irwin , the beloved watercolour teacher at Chouinard , the pre-cursor to CalArts , was a no-show , due to back problems . ) In the star-studded audience , Irving Blum , a director of the late , great Ferus Gallery , stood up to respond to Ruscha 's query about how much Andy Warhols soup cans actually went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripped over one another to wittily dispute memories as waves of laughter rippled through the packed house . Times were frugal . Their parents were worried . Of his practical decision to paint , despite working under the tutelage of ceramist Peter Voulkos , Bengston said , You got more money for a painting than for a pot. <p> Ed Ruscha ( left ) and Billy Al Bengston trade quips <p> Back in the 1960s they all had day or seasonal jobs that informed their practice . Ruscha worked personalising gift items ( like a Ma and Pa Chopper Hopper false-teeth holder ) and saw the power words could have . Bell worked in a frame shop and saw the power cheap , perfect glass and mirror could have . <p> Bengston raced motorcycles and learned how air-brushing techniques could be applied to canvas . ( He also helped cut and stretch Warhols silver Elvis series , which arrived at Ferus in a roll since it was cheaper to ship that way . ) Bell welcomed ' three suits to his studio , only to learn , belatedly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum , was among them . ( Marcel , did n't  you do something like that , said one suit , blowing his cover ) . <p> The four legendary art icons regaled the audience with personal tales <p> Of Ed Kienholz , the founder of Ferus Gallery , Moses recalled , ' Kienholz was always sitting on his haunches , cleaning guns. Working in New York did not appeal . Our hair froze , said Bengston . <p> I did n't  have it in me to live in that city , said Ruscha , reminiscing about hitching to the Big Apple with Joe Goode . California was sparkly . Chicks in cars. Warhol saw Ruschas first book on LA gas stations and said , I love it . There 's no people there. And on it went , playfully stage-managed by moderator Hunter Drohojowska-Philp , who wrote the excellent history , Rebels in Paradise , on this period . <p> It was , in the end , a guy night . ( One hopes this will be addressed in the next Sothebys-Broad collaboration scheduled for autumn . ) The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played chess with Duchamp buck naked at his retrospective . Nevertheless , it was a thrill to have these artists assembled in one place all are still practicing and exhibiting to remind us of the important role of Los Angeles in the counter-narrative to east coast abstract expressionism. 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

@@40481341 @481341/ <p> Two Temple Place , a late Victorian mansion built by William Waldorf Astor on the north bank of the Thames , is one of Londons lesser known architectural gems and lesser known galleries . Until April , its grand , eccentrically embellished halls will be filled with paintings , poems , furniture , photographs , sound installations , scale models , films and paraphernalia from the Sussex Modernists . They comprise Sussex Modernism : Retreat and Rebellion ' , the most interdisciplinary exhibition the space has staged in its six years promoting culture . <p> For curator Hope Wolf , a lecturer in British modernist literature at the University of Sussex , including all these different disciplines is essential to understanding the diverse group . But pulling together such an eclectic exhibition was no mean feat . Wolf mined local archives and enlisted contacts in nine galleries and museum-houses across Sussex . <p> The objects she uncovered plot a visual history of the region . We discover that in the first half of the 20th century , the rolling hills of provincial East and West Sussex became unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped metropolitan London for the rural idylls and farmhouses that were to become cultural epicentres . ' I was keen to question why these people went to Sussex , what they thought of it , or whether they were interested in it at all , ' explains Wolf . <p> We begin our countryside ramble in Ditchling , near Brighton , where a Catholic craft community advocating working by hand was founded in 1920 . The most famous member was sculptor and typographer Eric Gill . Here , we see his blending of religious iconography and eroticism through a series of sketches and sculptures . The posthumous revelations surrounding Gills reprehensible sexual proclivities has created a serious ethical dilemma for curators , and marred the idea of Sussex as a utopian retreat . <p> Nonetheless , the Ditchling group 's desire to merge utility with art provides a solid basis on which to build our picture of the Sussex modernists . Unlike these patriarchal craftsmen ( they did not allow female members ) , the Bloomsbury group was feminist and progressive and both were working concurrently , less than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rural home of London 's intellectual set , marks our next Sussex stop . It is represented by a selection of paintings and murals by Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell , including a powerful nativity scene for which local Sussex farmhands served as models . <p> From here we journey onward through the South Downs and coastline , past staggering works by John Piper , Pablo Picasso and Edward Wadsworth to painter Peggy Angus cottage Furlongs and collector Edward James ' extravagant Monkton House . Displayed in the original glass-fronted wall cabinets of Two Temple Place , their works could n't look more at home , and visitors are transported back in time . We sense the political undertones of the period bubbling away behind the glass like in the Angus sketch of a reclining nude reading The Crisis of Capitalist Culture with a wry smile , never before shown in public . <p> To fit in the extensive range of works , Wolf has made use of every space in the building , including its fanciful stairway , replete with ornate balustrades and newels . Here , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Edward James and designed by Salvador Dalf in 1938 , juxtaposes with the dark wood of the staircase . <p> But at the top of the stairs we are transported into a modernist world that seems a million miles away from this decadence . Humble and quiet , Farley Farm House ( near the delightful-sounding village of Muddles Green ) was home to photographer Lee Miller and surrealist artist Roland Penrose . For 35 years , from 1949 , their kitchen table hosted many renowned international guests notably Picasso , Joan Mir= and Lszl= Moholy-Nagy , whose photographs of the modernist De La Warr Pavilion are displayed here next to its impressive scale model . <p> ' Steinberg added the finishing touches to the Long Man of Wilmington , East Sussex , England ' , by Lee Miller , 2016 . Courtesy of Lee Miller Archives <p> Like the Hungarian Moholy-Nagy , many influential artists were attracted to Sussex from overseas .

In The Times , Virginia Woolf described hearing bombs fall on France from the South Downs as ' the beating of gigantic carpets by gigantic women ' . The immediacy the English writer depicts gives the whole region a sense of creative claustrophobia . <p> So much pioneering , problematic art was being produced , and in such close proximity . Wolf describes it as a ' visual cacophony ' . The curator teases out connections and synergies between these interrelated communities , creating a coherent path through the region 's cultural history . Nonetheless , she has left many questions unanswered , for the audience to draw their own conclusions .

Following a period of turmoil in his personal life and the collapse of his marriage , the American photographer abandoned the clamour of New York , moving into a former Methodist church in rural Massachusetts . <p> There , Crewdson withdrew both personally and professionally . I was shut down in many ways during that time , and in fact did n't produce work for at least two years , he says . Instead , he sought solace in the hinterlands , going on long hikes and open water swims ; in winter , he turned to cross-country skiing through woodland trails . <p> I found that spending time in the wilderness was comforting , and Becket was a familiar place for me , explains the artist . I was doing all of this solely as a way of keeping my head clear , and to find a sense of refuge. And it was there in the rural town of Becket that Crewdson , the artist , would be reborn . <p> Launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathedral of the Pines is a new series comprising 31 digital pigments captured during Crewdsons sojourn in Becket . It was a homecoming of sorts for the artist , whose family had a country home in the area , and where he spent a great deal of time as a child . <p> Crewdson recalls the moment of his epiphany , skiing on a trail miles from anything : The light , the cold air , the smell of pine triggered a sense memory , and I had this feeling of revelation . I knew I wanted to make pictures that explored that simultaneous sense of isolation and connection that you feel in nature. As it happens , he was on a trail known as the Cathedral of the Pines . He knew immediately that this was going to be the name of his next body of work . <p> The series bears all the hallmarks of Crewdsons inimitable style immaculately composed mise-en-scFne , cinematic lighting and somber figures caught in forlorn trances in small-town America but there 's an undoubted shift in the visual narrative . Crewdsons staged twilight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Cathedral of the Pines " , in many ways , represents a turning point for me . There 's a sense of return on many levels , but specifically to using colour and light as a way of telling a story and creating a mood , says Crewdson . I think the pictures also come out of a place of personal reconnection. <p> To wit , the artist worked with a smaller crew than usual ( up to 60 people would normally assist on a Crewdson production ) and also cast friends and family in his pictures a new experience for him . <p> Beckets forests and ultimately Crewdson 's salvation are brought to the fore in this series , recalling 19th century American and European rural canvases .

Co-published by the Judd Foundation and David Zwirner Books , it has been in design development for over two years . <p> Judds son Flavin , who oversees the artists legacy with his sister , Rainer Judd , worked collaboratively with Judd Foundation archivist Caitlin Murray and designer Michael Dyer , of Remake in New York , to produce the dense edition , which he refers to as a toolbox .

It is effectively a verbal sketchbook of the artists life . There is repetition and changes throughout , he adds . You are able to see the transition of thought from the beginning to the end and because of its completeness it adds a whole new layer of meaning to Dons work. <p> Since his fathers death , Judd has been back through every piece of the artists writing and transcribed handwritten notes ( personal musings , opinions of art and literature , political views , criticisms of people and society ) that he found in his journals . <p> There were some notes that seemed directly related to conversations I remember having with Don , he says . The conversations were either pretty abstract or about history or art and they tended not to end . Rainer and I were probably the only ones who could talk completely frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employees , seemed afraid . We could ask tough questions and if you can ask tough questions it leads to long discussions. <p> The process of putting the book together was arduous , with Judd sometimes spending up to eight hours deciphering one word of his fathers scrawled handwriting . I have a whole page in my own sketchbook where I rewrote his words to figure out what certain things were , he says .

Photography : Flavin Judd <p> The size of the book was Judds idea . He admired Phaidons redesigned pocket edition of EH Gombrichs The Story of Art , published in 2006 . I liked the way it was unpretentious , it was compact , it did what it was supposed to do and you could still carry it around , he says . <p> So Dyer was tasked with figuring out the proportions for the book so that the finished product could be a similarly small size and from there they established the brick-like form .

At the same time we had to ensure the design did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and from their destination with ease , she says . <p> The team generated dynamic pedestrian model simulations for all stations for the morning rush hour , which they used as a design tool to inform the optimal circulation paths for moving passengers between trains and the street level <p> Working to extend the existing NYC Subway system that had never been formalised in terms of design , the AECOM and Arup teams worked with New York City Transit Authority to devise a clear set of sustainable design guidelines that could be used for the future and incorporated rules for architectural detailing , ADA ( Americans with Disabilities Act ) compliance , spaces with high-ceilings , quality artwork and dramatic lighting , as well as parameters for improved safety and security . <p> The column-free design of the new platforms and mezzanine levels marked a change from the steel column and beam construction across the existing system . It allows much better customer movement and visibility , says Arup principal Gillian Blake . 72nd Street and 86th Street are stations in rock caverns over 70ft wide and the curved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved mezzanine ceilings . The customers cant see all the engineering challenges that went into creating these spaces however I hope they appreciate the sense of openness , adds Blake . <p> Engineers led the excavation of spaces up to 1,591ft in length , some of the largest underground excavations in North America , while navigating the congested mass of telecommunications , electrical , gas , steam , water and sewage lines beneath New York using specialised skills from hydrology to geology . <p> Yet , the biggest challenge was connecting the old infrastructure to the new . Retrofitting 63rd Street Station was the most complex part of the project , says Arup director and fellow David Caiden . In many respects modifying an existing station is trickier than building a new one . Everything had to be accomplished with negligible service disruptions working behind hoardings that concealed things from the public. <p> The close coordination of design engineers and construction professionals during the 15 year project , which broke ground in 2007 , was the most important thing for D'Orazio . This helps to streamline the build process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Today , design build procurements are much more effective because they are integrated and collaborative. <p> Phase two of the expansion will extend the NYC Subway north and west from Second Avenue and E 96th Street to Lexington Avenue and E 125th St , and includes three new stations at 106th Street , 116th Street and 125th and Lexington Avenue , and eventually run 8.5 miles along the east side of Manhattan . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Photography : Gianluca Di Loia <p> The exhibition graphics have been designed by Milan based brand design and visual communication studio , Zetalab . Photography : Gianluca Di Loia <p> The playful display of the new exhibition communicates the essence of Bellinis bold and progressive style . The art work for the exhibition poster , banner and catalogue cover have been designed by designer Leonardo Sonnoli . Photography : Gianluca Di Loia <p> Mario Bellinis long and distinguished career spans design brands and counter-trends . As a designer who grew up in the austerity of post-war Italy , then began his career at the height of Pop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unrooted eclecticism . Yet what defines his work ( still in progress ) is a commitment to a sense of place and a sense of beauty , but bound up with a functional rigour that transcends shifts in the way we interact with places and things . <p> As his Italian Beauty exhibition opens at the Milan Triennale , its perhaps time to take stock and celebrate a lifetime in design . This is not a retrospective , according to Bellini , but a prospective , and the 1,200 sq m show takes you through a career spanning six decades . The space is a stage for Bellinis many and varied products , from chairs to typewriters to lamps , with seating areas placed before vast screens to give an impressive , immersive insight into a suite of his studios best-known buildings . <p> Bellini can lay claim to being one of the progenitors of modern technological style , together with other precursors like Dieter Rams and Jacob Jensen . During his long and fruitful collaboration with Olivetti , he reshaped the office landscape into a playful , colourful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IBM approach . And where Rams brought a Northern European austerity to consumer design , Bellini has always headed in a more humanist , playful direction . <p> Italian Beauty begins with a vast cabinet of curiosities containing objects and memorabilia that have inspired Bellini , including pieces by Gio Ponti and Issey Miyake historical fragments of memory , art and literature . Ive designed furniture , objects , machines , buildings , Bellini says . So to design an exhibition about myself is to go back to something I did at the very start of my career . But its also more special and challenging. <p> An archival advertisement for Olivetti typewriters <p> Bellini was born in 1935 . Exceptionally talented at sketching from a young age , thanks to the encouragement of a grandfather , he spent five years studying at Milans polytechnic , graduating in 1959 and beginning his career as primarily an exhibition and product designer . In Olivetti , he found a client that shared his love of detail . In Bellini , Olivetti found a designer who could simplify its increasingly complex wares and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included the legendary Programma 101 of 1964 , an impressive calculating machine that many consider to be the first desktop computer . <p> The Olivetti partnership made Bellini a major force in industrial design , whose works were collected by MoMA and who was eagerly sought by other clients , such as Cassina ( for whom he designed showrooms ) , Vitra and B&amp;B Italia . His guiding principle is to combine functionality with finesse or dreaming and doing , as he describes what he learnt in his student days . You have to be talented to answer needs and yet end up with beauty , he says . Needs , functions , materials , costs and rules all have to come together . But beauty also comes too . To create a simple object you need grace and poetic beauty. <p> A photograph from Bellini 's US road trip in 1972 <p> Throughout his career , Bellini has always looked further afield , drawing inspiration from other cultures and approaches , including the design communities in Japan and Northern Europe . He has also had a long and favourable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1972 road trip after his participation in a MoMA exhibition on the Italian design scene ( see W*199 ) . <p> In the late 1980s , Bellini was a pioneering editor of Domus at a time of a great renaissance in Italian product design and architecture , and his profile was buoyed by a 1987 MoMA retrospective . His career has also spanned social and technological change , but he has never lost sight of the emotional component of design . Whenever we design something we look for beauty its a very delicate thing that connects you to the world through your senses . Beauty is a way of communicating meaning something that connects with you and moves you. Bellini is now an elder statesman of modern design , but his work continues to surprise and delight . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Photography : Ale Jungmann <p> Bridges , walkways and balconies give the exterior a nautical flavour <p> Studio TaK 's faithful restoration includes the playful use of colour <p> Since the early 1990s , visitors to the sleepy town of Celkovice , just a few kilometres from Prague , could have easily missed the concrete ruin of Villa Volman . Situated in a large natural park , the house had become more of a neglected , weather-battered , graffiti-covered squat than the luxury mansion of its heyday . But the building one of the Czech modernist movements forgotten icons has been returned to its pre-war glory after years of careful restoration work . <p> Saved by enlightened local business group CZ Tech , the home of industrialist Josef Volman was originally built in 1939 , designed by avant-garde Czech architects Karel Janu and Jirf tursa . Prague-based Studio TaK won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be involved in a project of such significance , says chief architect Marek Tich . His teams detailed prep work , surveys , design and construction lasted almost 15 years . The design of the villa is extraordinary . It is a unique example of its kind in what was then Czechoslovakia , adds Tich . Its architecture shows the synthesis of various streams of European modernism of the early 20th century , and also the importance and strength of the first Czech Republic , which , in the period between the world wars , was one of the most developed countries in the world. <p> The villa is also emblematic of the divide created by a debate in Czechoslovak modernist architecture . The countrys avant-garde Devetsil group , headed by influential theorist , artist and visionary Karel Teige , advocated architecture as science , a tool to build a modern society . The opposition argued for architectures more artistic qualities , treating it as a means to experiment with shapes and fine art influences . <p> Villa Volman shows the clash between these two ideologies . Although Janu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this commission was primarily an artistic and compositional challenge . Volman , who had previously built a factory and housing for his employees in Celkovice , bought a large piece of land and gave the architects an almost unlimited budget . The result was one of the finest ( and most expensive ) residences in the countrys interwar period , along with Mies van der Rohes Villa Tugendhat in Brno and Adolf Loos Mnller house in Prague . <p> One of the marble-lined bathrooms , which each feature a differently coloured tub <p> The architects conceived Villa Volman as a sculptural object . Its not just its functionalist architecture , but also the composition of the house and the context of the Elbe River and the beautiful floodplain forests nearby that need to be considered to understand the full breadth of this project , says Tich . The building is a dynamic composition of intertwined volumes . Sharp lines alternate with curved walls and organic details ; sleek , smooth surfaces contrast with traditional stone masonry . Bridges , walkways , balconies and staircases dominate the exterior and create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . <p> The interior is a rich mosaic . Aside from the built-in furniture and fixtures , designed by Janu and tursa , the space was finished with contemporary pieces some bought , some tailor-made by Volmans daughter Ludmila , who looked after the interior decoration . The villa was designed as a modern house , equipped , among other things , with central heating , high-tech mechanical infrastructure and , of course , luxurious materials , such as several types of marble , chrome details , stainless steel and exotic wood , says Tich . <p> Unfortunately , the Volman family was not able to enjoy its home for long . The fate of the villa is a reflection of the sad story of the devastation of Czech society after 1948 , when the Communists came to power , explains Tich . Volman lived in the villa only briefly , until his death in 1943 . His daughter and her husband , Jirf RuPek , lived there throughout the Second World War , but after 1945 the Communist regime began harassing the family and they had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house used as a kindergarten . After 1989 , the villa was returned to RuPek , who offered it to the Czech state and the city of Celkovice as a valuable cultural monument , yet even so it remained abandoned . <p> CZ Tech bought it in 1998 . The new owners soon called upon Tich and his colleagues Magdalena Kurfnrstov and Jan Tome , who started to examine the site , working with historical research and the original drawings and documentation . The most difficult part was putting all the pieces of the puzzle together , working out how the villa was built and how it looked at the time of its inception , as the damage from years of neglect was considerable . It was real detective work , and involved experts from various professions , says Tich . <p> Unlike similar renovations , where architects may add a new , contemporary layer to a buildings historical fabric , Villa Volman was restored as faithfully as possible . New elements were selected to fill in gaps , but in a way that does not compete with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects I 've ever worked on , says Tich . Our goal now is to present all the documents we discovered and the procedures we used in a book about the history , present and reconstruction of Villa Volman . At the same time , the owners are thinking about its potential future use , possibly as luxury long-stay apartments for the nearby baths. <p> As originally featured in the November 2016 issue of Wallpaper* ( W*212 ) 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Its latest venture is a revamped tasting room , Devils Corner Cellar Door , located within the Hazards Vineyard on Tasmanias east coast . Prioritising the dramatic views over the Freycinet Peninsula , Hobart-based outfit Cumulus Studio has assembled five repurposed shipping containers to create a structure that comprises a trio of lookout points . These , say the architects , interpret the landscape from which the wines originate . Indeed , the curated views , which include a lofty panorama of the sparkling bay , are the perfect platform from which to appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' market ' , which features a retail space , a private tasting room , a restaurant and a cafT ample opportunity to settle down with a bottle of the fruity Pinot Noir for which Devils Corner is best known . <p> Situated next to Papineau Avenue 's residential area , the energy efficient construction comprises clean , laminated wood , which gives the stadium elegance and unity . What 's more , the structure is flexible and can be adjusted , transforming the stadium into an open-air facility during the summer , and providing gaps for ventilation in the winter . <p> On the stadium 's berm there is an elevated pedestrian path that preserves the existing trees . This leads up to the main lobby , which is contained inside a large , translucent crystal box , providing abundant daylight along with views across to the public spaces nearby .

The ' outstanding ' rating is given to less than one per cent of new non-domestic buildings , and the companies that achieve this accolade are labelled as official ' innovators ' by the awarding body , as opposed to mere ' followers of best practise .

Conjuring up an array of exotic notes , the botanicals include Baobab and the regions Buchu plant infusing the fruity flavour of blackcurrant . <p> Sloe gin , Elephant Gins latest addition , smacks a sweet note that is tempered with a subtle sharpness and distinctive colour . <p> Aside from the obvious African symbolism , the name and motif is central to one of the brands tenets it helps preserve African wildlife by contributing 15 per cent of all proceeds to two African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plastic 23 September <p> Reflecting on his approach , freelance designer Riccardo Randi said , I believe design to be more of a " strategy attitude " rather than an actual work field , perhaps it is Randis refusal to be pigeonholed that gives him the freedom to act on his creative impulses ; delivering inspired ideas such as the Wood + Cutlery concept . <p> Conceived with the aim to reduce the environmental damage caused by disposable cutlery production , Randi has designed a cutlery set that requires playful engagement . <p> Comprised of wood and plastic , the main part of the body is made from reusable wood and the head is made from biodegradeable plastic . The idea is to connect the different components creating the cutlery . <p> In addition to encouraging the daily rhythm of recycling , Randis Wood + Cutlery concept offers a textured alternative to silverware . <p> Writer : Adam Chapman <p> Under pressure 22 September <p> Foam rollers are the secret weapon of many athletes and therapists used to warm up , stretch and soothe muscles before or after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rollers is , well , rather basic . GatorTail aims to change that with its longer , thicker composition . Still portable and light , the 20mm thick eva foam comes with a sleek carrier bag making it easy to transport . More important still are the deep ridges inspired by the skin of an alligator which are all the better for an effective ( and satisfying ) deep tissue massage . Made to withstand up to 600lbs of weight , you can be sure that this sturdy roller wo n't collapse under pressure . <p> Widely know as ' The Land of Fire and Ice ' , Iceland is a country of extreme contrasts and one closely connected to nature . It is this cornerstone which has spawned Reykjavik-based Alda Iceland to create lemonade that pays homage to the country 's diverse landscape . <p> Manufactured in limited production by Stedji , a small family-owned brewery located in the historical upper Borgarfjr=ur region in the West of Iceland , the wholly natural formula is sugar-free , blending filtered spring water with hydrolysed marine collagen , sustainably sourced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alda ' , a traditional womans name and concurrently , meaning , " wave " , suitably demonstrates Icelanders special connection to ocean and land . It is this respect for nature that Milja Korpela of Iceland Ocean Cluster captures in the design . While the minimalist packaging evokes a handmade feel , a playful editorial portrays Icelands elements the blue depicting the sea and as the source of the ingredients , celebrating Icelands idyllic terrain in the process . <p> Autumn is the perfect time for a new scent . Think about it . The nights grow longer and the winter chill sets in , making your fragrance all the more crisp . Especially with Malin+Goetz 's new Vetiver eau-de-parfum in the mix . <p> The first of its kind for the New York-based apothecary brand , it builds on the success of their eau de toilette and perfume oils , as well as the popularity of their Vetiver candle . The new parfum employs an earthy base , tied with amber and guaiacwood , lifted by top notes of bergamot , grapefruit peel and cardamom to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gentle woody overtone . <p> Somewhere between a sculptural art piece and the familiar reed diffuser , designer Pierre CharriT and French plumassier Maison Julien Vermeulen have collaborated to create Nuto , a sculptural feather diffuser . <p> Available at galerie MICA , Nuto is a solid marble-based pendulum that slowly swings a delicate , perfumed ostrich feather through the air , diffusing its scent across the room . The feather is made of ostrich fluff starched and tinted by hand . Once perfumed , the feather naturally diffuses your chosen scent . <p> Rare will the moments of respite be this coming weekend with both London Fashion Week and London Design Festival in full swing .

Slots of 15 minutes are booked in which the alchemy of Dom PTrignons 2006 Vintage will be explored through sight , sound and taste . The experience is guided by the voice of Cellar Master and Wallpaper* Game-Changer Richard Geoffroy .

In fact , if the swarms of daily op eds and lifestyle features are to be believed , chowing down on insects might be the future of our increasingly fractious food industries a readily available and sustainable source of high-protein , low-fat sustenance . <p> Jimini 's is a new Parisian brand marketing a small range of dried savoury mealworms , crickets and grasshoppers , and cricket-flour chocolate and fruit bars . They 're surprisingly moreish ; while the smoked onion BBQ crickets slip down a treat , there 's a singular weirdness in chomping through the beady compound eyes and crunchy wings of the Greek spiced grasshoppers ( the squeamish , the packaging informs , can remove these ) . The cricket-flour bars taste identical to any other protein or natural energy bar , which is either a shame or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not quite Indiana Jones &amp; the Temple of Doom 's bug banquet , but our insect eating future might take some getting used to . <p> Writer : Tom Howells <p> Cool stirrings 13 September <p> There is something about the scale of grand design that 's inherently visceral the realistion of an artists epic vision invariably inspires awe . However , there is a charm to be found in the intricacy of small design details that delights in equal measure ; cue the Ice Bell . <p> Japanese designer Ryosuke Fukusada has conceived an ice tray with a particular stylistic flourish that sets it apart from its rather square counterparts . Producing bell-shaped ice cubes that have been carefully calculated to melt slowly and accommodate an array of different glass sizes , Fukusadas riff on the household product is inspired . <p> The use of silicone lends a playful functionality to the set - allowing easy release of the ice cubes and the tailor-made stirrer has a silicone handle to enable self-standing . Twirling the cubes in a cocktail creates a melodious clink - all at once making sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past with the innovation of the present is the philosophy at the heart of the new skincare range House of Life . <p> Taking its name ( and cue ) from an Ancient Egyptian institution that first documented the discoveries of health properties in plant life , House of Lifes anti-ageing formulation is comprised of naturally medicinal ingredients mined from Georgias herbal gardens . <p> Promoting purity , it has a high oil to water ratio in its formulations , infusing a wealth of nutrient rich herbs , fruits and vegetables to enrich and enliven the skin . The range is comprised of four organic anti-ageing oils , one body oil and three distinctly fragranced multi-action day and night anti-ageing creams . <p> Parker has built a solid reputation so unyielding in its resistance to the tide of changing trends , owning one of their pens is like owning a minature monolith . <p> The premium pen purveyors latest range distills the essence of what they do best .

The Beatles inspired notebook collection from Moleskine gives off a glowing testament to the iconic band with a range of designs that pay particular homage to the Yellow Submarine film . <p> Pyschedelia abounds in a plethora of playful covers . Each notebook is complimented with a custom designed Beatlesmania sticker set . The Beatles Limited Edition Notebook Collection from Moleskine offers an invigorating alternative to the all too conservative deskware . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched the ' 4116 collection ' , a range of products and collaborations . Among them - and arguably most captivating of all - is their teaming up with Motorola to revolutionise mobile photography . <p> The slim ' Hasselblad True Zoom ' seamlessly snaps into place by way of magnets , adding a 10x optical zoom and a Zenon flash to the Moto Z smartphone . While it is true that mobile photography has come along in leaps and bounds over the years , this nifty add-on may just top them all . <p> We just cant get enough of Tom Dixons endless ingenuity . The dynamic designers latest venture sees him making his stylistic mark on the world of stationary . <p> Far from plain and mundane , Dixons iteration on essential deskware is ( as expected ) an imaginative one . Luxury and functionality intertwine in a range that 's comprised of three different sets COG , CUBE and INK . <p> Remarkably robust , The COG collection , inspired by great British engineering , is made from Brass-plated solid Alluminium . The cog pencil and desk tidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be found in the INK range immortalising not only the written word but also the utensils employed in creating it . Fully decking out the desktop is the CUBE set , with its sleek , minimalist , zinc alloy and copper plate additions such as the stapler , pen and tape dispenser . <p> Cycling has always been an aesthetically alluring pastime , segueing between the classic clean lines of vintage steel , ruggedly muscular mountain bikes and the space-age geometries of carbon racers ( give or take a few bulky hybrids and ungainly city bikes ) . In recent years , its outlying elements have been playing catch-up canny labels , particularly , are finally developing fashion-forward cycle wear though the aspect of security has always been functional at best . <p> British brand Hiplok is looking to change that with Airlok . The world 's first Gold Rated bicycle storage hanger , the compact design is attractively minimalist , constructed in hardened steel with an impact-resistant outer casing hiding the lock 's frame and fixings . Securing the frame with a single hardened steel pin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of cycle storage , form and function need n't be mutually exclusive . <p> London Distillery collective Sweetdrams first limited edition release is their own take on American moonshine , produced in collaboration with their friends at Kings County Distillery in Brooklyn , New York . <p> Paying tribute to Kings County and its rich moonshine culture , Sweetdram shied away from synthetic flavourings and sugar , instead opting to infuse their white whisky blend with a botanical recipe to include subtle flavours such as sour cherries , peppery vanilla notes , coriander seeds and hibiscus . <p> The result is a balanced and unique liqueur which is intended to be enjoyed slowly sipped neat , or mixed into whisky cocktails providing a unique and vibrant twist on classic flavour combinations . <p> ' Cool ' and ' compact ' are the two words that spring to mind when talking about this neat , new gadget from Japanese designers Jiyoun Kim and Junyoung Jang . <p> The Conbox is an electronic fan that offers something more than its built to function and more often than not , cumbersome counterparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all of which can be remotely adjusted via a smartphone app . <p> Abound with playful ingenuity , the joints can be taken apart and packed into the base of the fan , transforming the device into a convex shape that can double as a decorative piece during the winter months . The choice of neutral palettes also underscores the Conboxs all-year-round appeal a tasteful accompaniment to any room , come rain and shine . <p> A staple of any bar , the gin and tonic can trace its roots to the British Raj some 200 years ago . Its variations are plenty some add a splash of liqueur , others opt for exotic garnishes but until now have tended to be formulaic . Enter Bombay Sapphire 's ' Artistry of the Ultimate Gin &amp; Tonic ' series , a half-year collaboration with six mixologists hailing from London 's finest bars . Each of them has given a different spin to the classic beverage and presented it in wildly inventive style . Dav Eames of Gilbert Scott has devised a layered , green and yellow ' G &amp; Ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trading Company 's Andy Mills turns up the theatrics by pouring his ' Whoops Daisy ' in to a milk jug , and serving it with syrup that spills from dropped wine glass reminiscent of a Massimo Bottura creation . Not to be outdone , ' Nature 's Yield ' , a concoction by Heddon Street Kitchen 's George Simmons , manages to include a Bonsai tree with hanging tonic droplets . Others have experimented , with great success , with nettle beer , barrel aged fermented tonic and peashoot-infused Bombay Sapphire . Proof that in the right hands , the gin and tonic is more exciting than ever . <p> The hand mirror is an innately personal object , and brining a new polish to the piece are industrial designers Joseph Guerra and Sina Sohrab , aka . Visibility , for New York-based manufacturer Good Thing . <p> Made by polishing a piece of stainless steel until it reflects your own image , a corner of the surface is dipped into industrial rubber to create a comfortable and modern grip . At its heart it speaks of utility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of universal accessibility . <p> Technically , British design brand Tom Dixon has a ' new ' entry in its accessories range , but we think this term is just a formality ; as once again the companys ethos is fully on display in the Stone Candle artfully transforming a traditional material into an item of tasteful functionality . <p> With marble the material of choice , every purchase promises uniqueness as each individual block has its own distinct design . <p> The deep , verdant green palette elicits the impression the candle has been fashioned out of forestry ; fitting since the organic essence is comprised of dry exotic fig and sandlewood . <p> We recently lauded the benefits of Contexts skincare range , and hot on its heels is the arrival of the brands first colour collection lipsticks and nail polishes to match . <p> Available in eight quintessential shades , Context has created a 5-free formula nail polish that 's devoid of formaldehyde , formaldehyde resin , toluene , DBP and camphor to ensure that its polishes are non-toxic , 100% vegan and cruelty free .

Stylishly enclosed in a zippered leather case and lined with velvet , the set features a selection of hardworking essentials , including an array of wrenches , two pairs of pliers , a selection of screwdrivers and a hammer all handmade in Germany . Each piece is elegantly secured in its own place within the leather folio so that whatever dirty work the tools get up to , a level of decorum is always maintained . <p> Simple logic dictates that timeless design should command timeless respect well at least that 's the theory we at Wallpaper* have always applied when talking about beauty brand Kjaer Weis . Their latest line of lipsticks is no exception to the rule . <p> Housed in metal casings , each colour is accentuated with a silvery sheen and lent a weighted luxury . The sleek modern shells playfully belie the classic shades contained inside , including : ' Adore ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Hollywood glam ; Believe , a taupe plum polish ; Empower , a bright , energizing pink ; Honour , a sweet , pale nude colour with a hint of rosy pink and Love , a fresh , red coral to match any mood . <p> The Kjaer Weis collection is the perfect marriage of organic ingredients with ergonomic sophistication . <p> Tea drinking may be a traditional custom , but a collaboration between Berlin-based tea company Paper &amp; Tea and the East-London based Vodka distillery Our/London also proves that it can be fertile ground for new ideas too . <p> Their exclusive range of vodka tea infusion kits blend P&amp;Ts earthy and organic whole-leaf tea with Our/Londons smooth , sweet vodka to create cocktail mixes which can be used to enhance existing recipes or invent new combinations . The experimental infusion kits come in two varieties : Golden Earl and Matcha . Golden Earl combines vodka with an Earl Grey mix of bergamot oil and golden-bud black tea for a warm , citrusy kick , while Matcha , a Japanese green tea infusion , strikes a bittersweet note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne that is too warm ( or , in fact , too cold ) .

Keeping the aluminium case hidden , only a sleek polished steel rim is on show , along with an illuminated light . <p> The sophistication does n't stop there . The Kaelo is activated with a touch of the illuminated rim , the colour of which can be altered to match the hues of your interiors . <p> Lomography has travelled back to the 19th century to create its newest camera lens the Daguerreotype Achromat 64mm/f.2.9 . <p> Inspired by Charles Chevaliers 1839 optic lens , used by Louis Daguerre in his first daguerreotype camera , the Achromat houses a Waterhouse Aperture Plate system , ideal for experimenting with drastic focus , watercolour textures and bokeh effects . <p> The lens comes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital and analogue cameras , echoing the early days of photography in its design as well as the perfectly imperfect images it can create . <p> Thanks to companies like Rapha and Swrve , cycling fashion is slowly shifting away from the traditional sea of over-stuffed lycra into more urbane territory . <p> British startup Vulpine has been at the fore of this sartorial micro-movement since setting up in 2012 , creating city cycling apparel that works functionally and aesthetically both on and off the bike . <p> For A/W 2016 , the brand heads in a more luxury direction , launching four staggered collections . The first , ' Indian Summer ' , embraces the onset of autumn , comprising lightweight and multipurpose pieces imbued with classic British tailoring . This season also sees material and feature upgrades to existing Vulpine bestsellers , such as as the Harrington Rain Jacket and Merino Alpine Jersey . <p> Says Vulpine 's founder , Nick Hussey , ' Were completely committed to urban apparel , not as a fashionable fad , but long-term , and I think its this passion for quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic and true .

The latter created by Marx Design and Kate Phillips of TypeB features modern typography , highlighting their pride in their product , while the high MGO ratings ( the Methylglyoxal count which relates to the quality of the honey itself , based on the concentration of the natural compound ) is the true focal point , representing their authentic , honest and overal healthy approach . <p> What could be cooler than cocktail popsicles ?

But that is not to say they need not be refined . Elevating its inner ear game this September is American audio brand Master &amp; Dynamic with a new colour way for their celebrated ME05 Earphones . <p> The existing ergonomic and elegant tones warm brass and cool palladium are joined by a fashionable black-on-black monotone . The acoustics remain sublime , as you 'd expect , as do the finishing details like laser etching and mirrored accents .

Right : parts of Huaqiangbei , considered to be the home of to the world 's largest electronic market , have been closed since 2013 for construction , but are due to open again later this year <p> The challenge was not nearly as daunting as it might sound : to find design and innovation in a district of Shenzhen once known as the counterfeit capital of the world . <p> Stretching about a kilometre and a half in central Shenzhen , Huaqiangbei has been the heart of the citys electronics industry since the first factories set up there in the early 1980s . Now home to thousands of dealers , stacked and jam-packed in a labyrinthine sprawl , the area continues to churn out dodgy shanzhai ( imitation ) Apple and Samsung smartphones , alongside all the components youd need for assembling one yourself .

On a recent weekend , however , I had a less glamorous mission . As curator for M+ , the new museum for visual culture being built in neighbouring Hong Kong , I was looking for what my colleagues at the V&amp;As nearby Shekou project have aptly called unidentified acts of design , the often unsung outputs of processes that lie outside the design mainstream , but that in Shenzhen mark new systems of production that are reshaping the way we make and consume things . <p> Dodging the drones and hoverboards that were zipping to and fro , I threw museological obsessions like provenance to the wind , and instead sought out phenomena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends , whether hoverboards ( so 2015 ) or virtual-reality glasses ( the latest thing ) , I decided to focus on hybrid objects , which intriguingly mix and match what 's existing and familiar a kind of incremental , see-what-sticks innovation in a way that perhaps only Shenzhen can . <p> Some examples I found pragmatically address under-served users : building on a widely cited large-button mobile phone for the elderly that started popping up some years ago , a new version , simply labelled Model K2 , incorporates a flashlight and radio with retractable antenna . Others were more unwittingly evocative , like the mini-tripod that turns your smartphone into a telescope in an age of growing surveillance . <p> Somewhere in-between was the card phone , a credit card-sized mobile phone that looks like a cross between a bank security device and a pocket calculator .

Fast-advancing tech and ever-increasing legislative demands on car use are coming up against an emerging generation who seem blasT at best about the advantages of owning , let alone driving , cars . In the past , any such uncertainty would have been brushed aside by futuristic conceptual visions , stoking anticipation and stimulating participation in the glorious tomorrow of personal transport . <p> From the 1950s onwards , the concept car served a very singular purpose ; it demonstrated technology and forms considered too advanced to build or to sell . The far , far future is always a more interesting place to visit , which is why esoteric ideas such as gas turbines and self-driving ( General Motors 1950s Firebirds ) , flying cars ( every decade or so ) , outlandishly impractical styling ( the work of Luigi Colani ) and even nuclear power ( the Ford Nucleon , from 1958 ) lingered in the cultural imagination . <p> Technology is catching up . Although fission-fuelled four wheelers are definitely out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never quite takes off , there are other areas where processing power can fulfil long-held predictions .

Now , however , the fight is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The cars represent the intersection of future technology and brand aspiration . The mighty Rolls-Royce 103EX concept is n't just about forms and technologies , but a full-tilt trip into the future of one of the worlds most recognisable brands . From the vertical cliff of the marques signature grille here rendered as a screaming maw between two fist-like wheel spats through to the preposterous sweep of the rear end , the 103EX dominates the environment . It foretells a world where the one per cent have presumably bought their escape from revolution , either through philanthropy or steep taxation , and are safe to roam the world in overt displays of wealth that distract , divert and entertain the masses by their very existence . To a certain extent , a Rolls-Royce already does this , although class-conscious hackles will be raised still higher by the menacing approach of the 103EXs hand-crafted combine-harvester-like presence . <p> At the heart of the 103EX is an artificial intelligence system coyly named Eleanor , after the model for the original Spirit of Ecstasy figurine .

The 103EX is the absolute epitome of future vision , says Giles Taylor , its design director ( although he prefers the term custodian ) . It shows we will never lose sight of what makes Rolls-Royces so special. <p> Rolls-Royces road-going superyacht is one facet of BMWs brand-centric future . Its flipside is the Mini Vision , a foursquare , pebble-smooth update of the marques 60-year-old automotive ideal . Contemporary Minis have been knocking back the protein shakes , with hefty flanks a long way from the original Mini spirit .

Although its fully electric , Mini emphasises the ongoing role of driving for fun , implying that this is the sort of shared transport you 'll take if you fancy enjoying yourself along the way . The BMW-badged Vision Next 100 completed the set , a hybrid of styles and technology cloaked in flexible , faceted bodywork . The Next 100 signals BMWs inevitable evolution away from the ultimate driving machine to the ultimate driving experience . <p> These three cars are concepts in the purest sense . Sure , they are recognisable as contemporary brands through their proportions , detailing and use of key styling elements , yet the roads , cities and customers they 're designed for do n't  exist .

Electric cars were represented by GMs EV1 launched , trialled , abandoned and crushed before the decade was out . No one else even came close . Driverless cars , on the other hand , have been a futurologists fetish since the 1950s . By the mid-90s , most driverless research had eschewed the idea of roads embedded with tracks in favour of onboard processing linked to sensors . Industry-sponsored research projects were beginning to explore ways in which driver control could be ceded to machines , and in turn how those early radars and cameras could feed back into safety features . <p> Mercedes-Benz took a long view with its 1996 F200 Imagination concept . In formal terms , it previewed the 1999 CL Coupe , albeit with a dollop of conceptual gloss in the shape of pivoting doors , but under the skin there was a sure-footed suite of predictions about how future cars would interact with their surroundings .

This retro-esque concoction was one of the industrys first forays into naked nostalgia , taking the fundamental shape of the famous 4CV , which debuted exactly 50 years before and marked Frances first credible VW rival , setting the scene for the countrys long domination of the small car market . The Fifties bulbous wheel-arches , chunky detailing and compact flair were the Gallic equivalent of VWs New Beetle , under development in California , and foreshadowed the explicit retro stylings of cars like the Fiat 500 ( 2007 ) and Mini ( 2000 ) .

The auto equivalent of the iMac G3 , it could have driven the big oval in a bold new direction <p> Future visions rarely benefit from hindsight .

Designers relish these opportunities to showcase their skills , creating statements of intent that do n't  have to hint at next years model . Perhaps it was the absence of an imminent technological revolution that makes the concepts of the recent past seem so straitlaced . <p> Massive change in some form is afoot . Companies such as Tesla have kick-started radical rethinks of the ways cars are designed , built and sold , inspiring a host of identikit rivals from the mainstream manufacturers and that 's before bold players like NextEV and Faraday Future have entered the game .

Concepts like these help determine and define if and how brand worship will influence the next generation of cars and owners . Futurology is an unforgiving discipline . When tomorrow comes , the conceptual utopia will simply move further afield ( and failed predictions will be quietly forgotten ) .

Photography : Milan Zrnic <p> Solemani is not ' a typical property developer ' as he is guided by his taste more than ' the bottom line ' . Photography : Milan Zrnic <p> Back from Melrose Avenue and rising up like a Mediterranean villa on steroids , Restoration Hardwares vast Los Angeles gallery possesses the ambition of a Hollywood tentpole production . Unveiled in 2014 , the store features a grand double staircase leading to a 929 sq m public rooftop park complete with an olive grove , towering hedges , water fountains and fire pits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Melrose High Street , a six-block tract extending from the CTsar Pelli-designed Pacific Design Center to La Cienega Boulevard . The man behind the strips radical revitalisation is Ben Soleimani , the scion of a vaunted Iranian family that has dealt in museum-quality carpets and tapestries for four generations . <p> Not that long ago , this area was extremely sparse and not the kind of place where you 'd wish to spend much time , says Soleimani from the lush rooftop aerie , which he conceived in conjunction with Restoration Hardwares CEO Gary Friedman . People thought we were insane building such a huge store in this location , but its proven to be a tremendous success . Gary Friedman shares my vision for innovation ; we met and were immediately finishing each others sentences. <p> Born in pre-revolution Iran , Soleimani moved to Los Angeles from London in 1988 . After the cold , dark school days in England , I craved the sunshine and Californias sense of ease , he says . Soon after , the ambitious teenager convinced his father to buy land on Melrose Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emporiums and tattoo parlours . In 1993 , he opened Mansour , the first North Americanoutpost of the familys venerable rug dealership , known in the UK as the official purveyor of rugs to the royal family . The venture was a huge success , drawing other rug merchants and design firms to Melrose Avenue . At that time , nobody knew Mansour in America , but we made it the most popular place in the country for vintage rugs , he says . <p> Los Angeles was a very different city back then . It was a year after the LA riots and the citys long-promised cultural renaissance was yet to coalesce . LA has come a long way in the last 15 years ; its now considered a genuine global capital , a place that is setting trends and influencing people , says Soleimani . But when I first arrived , if you wanted to buy anything you 'd have to go to Rodeo Drive , which was too flashy and felt irrelevant to a person in their twenties or thirties. <p> Soleimani envisioned the kind of retail destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began quietly buying up neighbouring properties along Melrose . I could see the potential to create something like Mount Street in Mayfair an intimate destination that was stylish but with an independent , contemporary spin , he explains . Today , Soleimani estimates he owns around 80 per cent of the land along Melrose High Street . <p> Soleimanis prescient acquisitions foreshadowed Los Angeles wider metamorphosis . In recent years , the city has achieved a status as a global tastemaker . Its artistic bona fides have been burnished with the recent openings of the Broad Museum and downtowns Hauser Wirth &amp; Schimmel , considered the largest private art gallery in America . Fashion is also gaining traction after resident designers Hedi Slimane and Tom Ford have shown high-profile collections here . Global luxury brands are flocking and the city is increasingly siphoning design talent from New York and other capitals . A 2015 New York Times article tracked the citys nascent status as a style capital in an article titled Los Angeles is Becoming Paris Amid the Palms . <p> Melrose is going to be the benchmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Soleimani predicts , emphasising that he has n't  set out to replicate the experience of shopping in London or Paris . A sense of place is very important to me and this is still classic California . I 'm not a typical property developer as I 'm guided by my interests and taste more than the bottom line . My nature is to shake things up and make them my own. <p> Soleimanis masterplan , which he estimates is about 85 per cent complete , will be fully realised in around 18 months . It includes a West Coast outpost of gourmet temple Dean &amp; DeLuca , complete with an outdoor courtyard cafe ; athleisure stores such as Sweaty Betty and Lululemon ; a curated selection of international fashion labels and design stores ; and new restaurants , salons and art galleries . I 'm very hands-on about looking for freshpartners and brands . I 'm making it more fashionable and artsy without attracting the same luxury brands you find everywhere . Its a place for sophisticated people who do n't  need to show off , he says . <p> Perhaps second to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Melrose High Street is also poised to become one of the most pedestrian-friendly corridors in all of car crazy Los Angeles . And , despite some resistance from locals concerned about the huge footprint of Restoration Hardware , which was built from the ground up , Soleimanis plans have been popular with the community . Ben Soleimani had a vision on the end of Melrose that was compatible with the Citys desire to make that area a strong economic engine for our community , says West Hollywood councilman John Duran . It took a lot of hard work with the City , the neighbourhood and surrounding businesses but in the end , we have a design district in West Hollywood that is the envy of surrounding communities . Much of that is attributable to Bens tenacity , vision and hard work. <p> Soleimani is bringing the same energy and sense of reinvention to the rug industry with the growth of his eponymous line , a collaboration with Restoration Hardware . We are revolutionising the way people are buying rugs today , he says . Over the years , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpriced ; with the Ben Soleimani RH collection , we set out to create contemporary but exceptionally made pieces that feel compatible with the way people live today. <p> Soleimani designs each rug within the expansive collection himself , working with artisans and craftspeople all over the world . I like to emphasise the natural and the handmade with my collection , he says , pointing out contemporised versions of ancient patterns , as well as innovative new techniques , which involve hand-dyeing and spinning to create a textural , patinated effect . Whether he s talking about his incredibly popular collection of rugs , his vision for Melrose High Street ( a thriving village within a city ) or a recent weekend playing polo in Santa Barbara , Soleimani is clearly a man guided by his instincts and driven by a genuine lust for life . It does n't  matter if I 'm designing a rug or finding an architect to create one of the new stores , the common denominator is I like to be creative and make a difference , he says .

Geometric motifs and shades of blue are unifying features throughout the project . Photography : Jean-Nodl Leblanc Bontemps <p> Auratic and avant-garde , Jean-Michel Othoniel is one of the most intriguing names on Frances contemporary art scene . From filling an abandoned boat with tears to installing glass dancers in Versailles Water Grove Theatre , his aesthetic transforms galleries , public spaces and historic sites alike . Now , Othoniel is preparing to preview for Wallpaper.com one of his most ambitious projects yet : Le TrTsor de la CathTdrale dAngoulOme , an immersive artwork nearly a decade in the making , recently opened to the public . <p> The sky is still dark when I arrive at Gare Montparnasse , where a photographer and I are to journey to AngoulOme with Othoniel . With only a minute until departure , I clutch my coffee , worrying Othoniel is too late , but then there he is , crisply casual and cheerily upbeat for the ungodly hour . <p> With a rich history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the biggest jewels in AngoulOmes crown is the 12th-century cathedral . Between 1852 and 1875 , French architect Paul Abadie of the SacrT Coeur Basilica fame in Paris restored the building in his signature neo-Romanesque style . <p> Fast-forward to 2008 , when Frances Historic Monuments office , headed by Pierre Cazenave , put in motion a campaign to revisit the cathedrals interior spaces and breathe new life into Abadies restorations . <p> Otoniel 's backdrop to a statue of St. Bernadette . Photography : Jean-Nodl Leblanc Bontemps <p> Working alongside Frances Ministry of Culture and AngoulOmes bishopric , Cazenave decided to commission a contemporary artist to create a new treasury to house 147 pieces , including statues and liturgical objects from the 1800s . Experienced in creating architectural and site-specific artworks for historical locations , Othoniel was a natural choice to take on the project . <p> We arrive at CathTdrale Saint-Pierre , bells tolling and all . Othoniel brightens at the sight of its facade , depicting the teachings of the Ascension and Last Judgement , which was also restored by Abadie . Like the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19th-century France it was a fantasy , people were dreaming about it but the 19th century was actually the beginning of modernity , he says . Inside , he points out features that inspired his work , from cement floor tiles to stained-glass windows . <p> I wanted to make my designs spectacular but not use rich materials , because the period was about facade and fake objects , he says , gesturing to a newly painted plaster statue of St Bernadette . The challenge was to show the quality in things that were not appreciated. <p> Othoniel unlocks a heavy wooden door to reveal the first station of Le TrTsor , which spans three rooms adjoining the cathedral . Previously a boxy storeroom , this space is now airy and light , complete with large stained-glass windows designed by the artist . A unifying feature throughout the site , these windows depict a sky sprinkled with stars , overlaid with a geometric motif that echoes patterns found on the cathedrals tiling . <p> They frame the landscape like a painting , explains Othoniel . With them I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , walls painted cool lilac , contains a crystal chandelier , wooden chapel chairs and an ornate plasterwork relief . Like the rest of Le TrTsor , the space is unfinished at the time of our visit , with areas of restoration still needed and objects yet to be displayed . It will eventually house a lapidary , Roman fragments , and a Madonna and child statue . <p> Given that Othoniel describes himself as not particularly religious , I wonder how he approached a commission so steeped in the spiritual . I was interested in the idea of the sacred , he replies . This project pushed my ideas of wonder and magic , making a connection between beauty and the radical. <p> Up a spiral stone staircase , the second station is revealed , themed around the ritualistic figure of the priest . <p> Here , ceremonial clothing and object will be housed in glass cases on rows of black glass beads . Fans of Othoniels work will recognise his use of hand-blown glass globes made by the same Murano artisans that collaborated on his beaded sculptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This project was a real celebration of craft , he says . It required a lot of different dialogues , and I worked with more than ten artisans after we first took time to feel and rebuild the space. Other examples of the workmanship can be seen in the final station , from the geometric wallpaper and tiles mirroring the motif on the windows to the glass vitrines to hold cathedral treasures . More glass beads , tinted blue ( symbolising the Virgins mantle ) and gold ( the colour of Christ ) , support the furniture . A monumental window is the real show-stopper , formed of 10,000 chunks of glass and framed with hundreds of handmade cast aluminium rings , which , I am told , were nearly four years in the making . Rising from the ashes of the cathedrals bombed-out bell tower , this last room has been transformed into a transcendent space suffused with natural light , illuminating saintly sculptures , religious artefacts and gilded objects . <p> The space is a masterpiece but surely one that was n't without its challenges . Its the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . But I love building a new destination in contemporary art.

An artist is part of history . I am not an artist of fracture I am one of continuity , he enthuses , face lit blue and gold in the light of a window .

Connected to sensors on the roof and within the hall , the laboratory set-up , which can be viewed through a glass screen , is fed information about changes in light and humidity . In response to the data , the microorganisms within the bioreactor create patterns that will then trigger sequences of movement within the space . <p> As a whole , the effect is beguiling ; like being inside a disorientating collage made up of layers of natural and artificial sound and light that eradicate any sense of perspective or scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many surprises we would have , says Oikonomopoulos of the six-week installation process .

The studios camera shutters were not to stop for more than a century . <p> ' Dynasty Marubi a hundred years of Albanian studio photography ' , an exhibition of that legacy , is currently being staged by Foam ( Fotografiemuseum Amsterdam ) , where a stream of black and white images provides a record of important aspects of Albanias history and its people , captured by three generations of studio photographers from 18561959 .

There is no record of where the studio was first located , although many studies suggest that it was actually al fresco , which could be true looking at the portraits of a wide variety of the locals . On the masters death , his assistant Kei took over the business and changed his name to Marubi , bringing in techniques such as special effects and the retouching of negatives together with more sophisticated cameras . The third generation of the studio , Keis son Gegd , was trained at the LumiFre brothers ' school in France in the 1920s . He pioneered the use of celluloid instead of glass plates in what was regarded as the studios most successful period . <p> In the 1970s , Gegd donated the studio 's collection some 150,000 glass negatives to the Directorate of General Archives . He dedicated the rest of his life to working on their conservation and died in 1984 .

@@40481468 @481468/ <p> His 15-acre mixed-use development , under construction on Shanghais Moganshan Road <p> Some of the largest architecture projects in the world are taking shape in a ground-floor atelier tucked away in Londons Kings Cross . Thomas Heatherwick set up his studio in 1994 after studying at Manchester Polytechnic and the RCA , and over the years he gradually scaled up its output , creating everything from furniture and installations through to buses , bridges , art museums and whole city blocks . Heatherwick now works alongside around 200 designers , 130 of whom have architectural training . The studio output is focused on big buildings . These include one of the largest mixed-use projects in China , a key component of a vast US private development , a California office for a tech colossus , and a new bridge for London , all of which are at various stages of planning and construction . <p> Despite this mega-structural ambition , every Heatherwick project can be infinitely zoomed into , right down to the smallest design component . This combination of scale and detail comes out of an absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sit down with Heatherwick to talk about his work . <p> A mock-up of this issues cover , handmade with brass fasteners and cut card to illustrate the concertina-like mechanism within , is a textbook example of Heatherwicks approach : a low-tech but delightful piece of paper engineering to create a simple but effective transformation . One of the inspirations behind the piece was a prototype circular table , fabricated from compressed and glued paper . Concealed within the ribs is a mechanism that allows the table to be expanded into a long oval in one smooth movement . <p> Like so many of the studios projects , it represents the intersection of engineering , design and making . Heatherwick used to believe he was originally misrepresented as a sculptor , frustrating when he always wanted to move towards architecture . I did n't  see any separation it was clear to me from very early on that everything was designed . My first thesis at Manchester , 25 years ago , looked at the role of making in the design of buildings , he says . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place. His very first structure , a pavilion to which he dedicated his final year at Manchester , was completed in collaboration with Aran Chadwick ( now of Atelier One structural engineers ) . I thought I 'd risk the first two years of my degree to gamble my third year on making an actual building I knew that you did n't  learn by just making a card model. <p> In addition to the many models and mock-ups of their own work , the Kings Cross studio space is a treasure trove of objects , mostly bold and sculptural , often taken far out of context and detached from their original purpose . This is industrial designs guilty little secret that unintended abstraction tends to aestheticise objects in ways their makers could n't possibly have conceived . My initial response was that the balance between thinking and doing was disconnected , he says of his student years . Why couldnt the physical environment meet that expectation ? What sets Heatherwick apart is his innate understanding of how to reinvigorate this separation . <p> In Cape Town , work continues on the conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Contemporary Art Africa . The 57m-high structure on the citys Victoria &amp; Albert Waterfront is set to become a new urban destination , with a hotel above and 6,000 sq m of galleries below . Founded by former Puma CEO Jochen Zeitz to house the collection of contemporary African art he began in 2002 , MOCAA is due to open in spring 2017 . The original building is dramatic enough , but rather than advocate full-on , Bilbao-style intensity , Heatherwick took the curators suggestion of creating interior drama all the better to draw people inside and hence be more likely to view the collection . Heatherwick has spent many hours on-site , helping oversee what will become the collections signature space a vast internal atrium carved from the concrete silos ( We could either fight a building made of concrete tubes or enjoy its tubeyness , he wrote ) . The abstract , organic form is cut out from what is already there . The quality were looking for is that it must look and feel like a hot wire has run through it , Heatherwick explains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades-old concrete is hammered , smashed , grinded and polished into shape . I have been training the guys on site to feel by hand when it was right , says Heatherwick , always able to boil the most heavyweight industrial process down to skill and feel . <p> Our projects are an interplay between the ordinary and the exciting , says Heatherwick , mindful of the importance of background elements , whether its method or materials , space or form , deliberately allowed to lie fallow while our magpie minds fixate on the shiny and new . Partly this is down to the rapid change and evolution of visual culture , in an era when even the most sophisticated architectural project can be compressed into a single visual soundbite for dissemination , posting , liking and sharing . Its a temptation Heatherwick cleverly accommodates . At Bombay Sapphires new distillery in Hampshire , he points out that the studio dealt with 49 historic buildings , as well as widening a river . We actually only built two things . And they fit in the photograph. This afterthought is telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an understanding of the importance of these photogenic moments . <p> Heatherwick also cites the UK Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Expo , a scaled-up version of his original Sitooterie from 1999 , only with each strand of hair created from a 7.5m piece of optical fibre , with a unique seed embedded at its tip . The 20m-high ' Seed Cathedral ' was one of the stars of the entire exhibition , yet as Heatherwick recalls , it had barely half the budget of its rivals , even though the brief explicitly called for it to receive the top five visitor numbers out of some 250 pavilions on the vast site . That drove the strategy , he says , so we designed five-sixths of the site to be ordinary. Although the pavilion itself is what everyone remembers , it was set on a plinth that the designer says was intended to be deliberately unmemorable . <p> Many of the studios architectural projects get their expressive , expansive qualities from clever replication and duplication of carefully designed elements . The Learning Hub building at Singapores Nanyang Technological University is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multi-storey car park , the designer says , explaining how a universal mould was used to shape various poured concrete components . Along Shanghais Moganshan Road , the citys long-established art district , another mega structure is emerging . Occupying a 15-acre site , the new mixed-use development is described by the studio as a piece of topography , an urban mountain range in the middle of Shanghais cityscape . The greenery consists of 1,000 mature trees , including indigenous Chinese pines , set among tree-like poured concrete columns , which in turn form 200 outdoor terraces . Nothing is small in China , Heatherwick comments . <p> Big projects can spark controversy , though . Londons Garden Bridge , although signed off , approved and partly fabricated , still seems to be hanging by a thread . Our job is to hold up the garden and get out of the way , Heatherwick says . It was not about making a massive thing , although it has to work from many dimensions. For the most part , the designer steers an apolitical and pragmatic path , but issues like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private sector , and the dominance of the latter , inevitably surface . At times , he seems almost pained by the negativity . We all want to do something special and wonderful were just trying to harness peoples passions , he says . Humans underestimate humans all the time . We extrapolate problems to an enormous extent , but when pushed , humans are also brilliant problem solvers. <p> At the same time , he notes that its depressing when something has n't  got the confidence to be ordinary . He adds , The role of designer has become disproportionately exalted . Its unfortunate the glory of making has been lost. Pragmatism and optimism rarely come together as credibly as this . The projects I enjoy most are the ones that are unexpected , and the public realm is the best place to find those unexpected qualities , says Heatherwick . Its frustrating when people think our projects are expensive. <p> As you fold , squash and stretch your Wallpaper* Friction Cover , consider that you 're holding one of the smallest and most intricate projects to come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the surprise and delight conjured up by the earliest works . Scaling up this level of focus is hard work . You need endurance and perseverance for these big projects . The world underestimates how hard it is to design and build buildings , he says . Nonetheless , the major works keep on coming , including a new retail space in the revitalised goods yards of Kings Cross and a new football stand at Fulham FC . In 20 years , we 've gone from two to 200 people , Heatherwick says . I picked up my student manifesto the other day , and what we do now is a spooky manifestation of what I 'd written . Right now I feel like we 've only just got going. 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

We now begin with design and the world is a better-designed place . <p> Throughout this issue we celebrate the people ( and products and places ) who have transformed our world and their own over the past two decades . 1996 was certainly something of a springboard year . It was the year Jony I 've took charge of Apples design team . It was the year Raf Simons held his first solo menswear show and Elon Musk started his first company , Zip2 Corporation . Peter Zumthor produced his landmark work , the Therme Vals , and SANAA completed its first project , the S-House in Okayama . Ian Schrager opened the Mondrian Los Angeles , designed by Philippe Starck .

In 1996 , Gucci sales increased by 90 per cent . No wonder , then , that the Gucci look dominated the first cover of Wallpaper* . Significantly , it was Ford who recruited a young Alessandro Michele to the label in 2002 and it is Michele who , now creative director , has totally revitalised the brand . Fittingly , its his ( very different ) Gucci look that again graces our cover , 20 years on . <p> Of course , its no normal cover ( we do n't  do normal ) .

Inspired by Hansens 1957 solo show in the salon of the Warsaw newspaper Po Prostu , the Yale exhibition employs horizontal and vertical platforms as well as a scaffold-like steel and wood ' choke chain ' structure hovering above to loosely group the content into the varied phases of Hansens career . Theme-based sections , filled with models , drawings , installations and ephemera , range from ' Architect as a Curator ' , about Hansens malleable exhibition and installation work , to ' Art and Didactics ' , about his efforts to rethink teaching , learning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fine Arts . <p> Highlights of the show ( and there are many ) , include the drawings , sketches , and maps for Hansens unrealised ' Linear Continuous System ' , a proposal to establish linear , decentralised cities running throughout Poland and the rest of Europe . Their outlines would trace rivers and other geological boundaries , and their forms would allow all residents to have equal access to sunlight and green space . On a far smaller scale are Hansens many temporary pavilions , such as ' My Place My Music ' ( designed with his wife Zofia ) for the Warsaw Contemporary Music Festival , a tensile steel structure embedded with speakers that would allow users to compose their own works ( and break the rigid divisions between orchestra and audience ) by walking from one musical piece to another .

' Its the idea that the creative process can be an ongoing communication , not a lecture , ' sums up Kedziorek . This could sometimes lead to chaos , but it also opened up untold creativity and a much-needed sense of collectivity that , ironically , could be argued to be as lacking in Communist Poland as it is in our world . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Working within a three-month window , the planes of glass were water jet-cut , polished , drilled , coated with the polarisers and then suspended from the ceiling on polished metal rods .

It has also designed a minimal Berlin store for Dutch eyewear brand Ace &amp; Tate , and has contributed furniture to the Berlin showcase apartment developed by Freunde von Freunden magazine in collaboration with Magis . Goller cites his education at Bauhaus-UniversitSt as the prime influence in much that the studio produces , including a set of graphically-shaped stools for the Hotel Wallpaper* bar . <p> One of our main inspirations is the modernist , constructive way of designing things , says Goller . We like minimal , graphic shapes . We work a lot with paper and cardboard models in a two dimensional way to form the 2D shapes into a 3D object . With the bar stool , we thought about it a lot . Our first drafts looked like typical bar stools with four legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want to use a typical shape . We tried to find new ways to make a different-looking stool .

Depending on the angle that you look at the bar stool , from one view the middle part becomes very thin , it looks light and delicate , but when you shift to the side angle , it becomes more solid , more like a sculpture. <p> For Hotel Wallpaper* , New Tendency worked with Rainer and Peter Wagners eponymous high-end office furniture firm to put its design into production . Wagner began life in the 1970s and is based in the Bavarian municipality of Langenneufnach , about 100km west of Munich . Its design focus is on the wellbeing of its users and their backs as well as aesthetics .

Rather than designing the traditional ring for a footrest , New Tendency placed a cylindrical beam through the front of the legs . The circular motif is echoed in the solid base and the cantilevered seat . The top of the seat was made using a Raf Simons-designed Kvadrat textile and a nappa leather cushion . <p> The bar stools generated a lot of enquiries when they appeared at the Handmade show in Milan , so Wagner and New Tendency are now in talks about a production deal , and plan to show off the design at further trade fairs , including IMM Cologne . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

It 's our small way of raising a glass to 80 years of exemplary design . <p> The ' L-leg ' came into being thanks to Alvar Aalto 's adventures in wood bending techniques , which were a new phenomena in the 1930s . With the help of furniture manufacturer Otto Korhonen , Aalto developed a combination of cutting and steaming local Birch wood in order for it to become malleable . <p> Since then , the technique has remained pretty much the same : after being soaked in water , multiple vertical saw cuts are made in the end of a piece of wood a few millimeters apart the deeper the cut , the bigger the bend .

It has quite literally propped up hundreds of variations since it was patented in the 1930s . The technique has also spawned bending experiments in other materials , like steel , as we saw last year in Artek 's ' Kaari ' ( or ' arch ' ) collaboration with the Bouroullecs . <p> Aesthetically , these curves have become a defining feature of Artek 's designs flicking through a 2016 catalogue , the memory of Aalto 's early bending experiments can be seen in every contemporary curve .

And the playful Barony bar , made out of Dinesen timber , vibrantly tinted using organic linseed oils , is his case-in-point . <p> We asked the Belgian architect to collaborate with Danish flooring company Dinesen and skilled carpenters Ocular to design one of our exhibition centrepieces ; a striking but service friendly bar . His response was to produce something fun and eye-catching that also feels substantial and regal ; beautiful but functional ; sturdy but with the appearance of lightness . <p> The bar is a composition of vertical and horizontal volumes , says Sestig .

The Blue Baron butterfly offered inspiration . Its beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When opening its wings , it becomes something completely different. <p> The butterfly concept guided the designs colourway , which uses hues by Danish pigment manufacturer Linolie , including Violet and Dusty Black .

I always find hotels have badly designed wardrobes and cupboards you do n't  really want to use . The Butler is a different approach , a combination of dressing table , valet stand and storage that brings all these things together to make unpacking more of a joy than a chore. <p> Chipperfields chosen collaborator was E15 , an accomplished furniture design studio originally founded in the eponymous London postcode by German architect Philipp Mainzer and Iranian designer and art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fayland table and Fawley bench , bespoke pieces for a modern country house , as well as the Leighton coffee table and Drayton sideboard .

Every joint and junction was given careful attention . The E15 team describes American willow as being much softer and more malleable than the European-sourced oak it usually works with . It not only has a fine texture but can be polished to a near-perfect surface , with concealed gaps to accommodate any dimensional changes as the piece ages . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

It seems like the Cajrati Crivelli home is the only lived-in house along this east-facing canyon for as far as the eye can see . <p> Alessandro and Debrina Cajrati Crivelli hired Bell to design their LA home four years ago . At the time , the couple were living in London and began the design process before they moved to California a year later . <p> Alessandro , who works in real estate , has a knack for finding great locations , so perhaps its no surprise that he discovered this sprawling , untouched plot to build his dream house on , as if plucked from the pages of a storybook he read while growing up in Milan . It turns out this canyon , not far from the Santa Monica mountains , is a hot spot of new construction , as the housing market ever on the rebound in LA builds steam . <p> The Crivellis house is Bells first new-build project in the United States .

Felicity really did spend a lot of time thinking about inside-outside living as it relates to Los Angeles , says Debrina . Incidentally , when we first moved here we were somewhat disappointed that we were east-facing , but its turned out to be a blessing in disguise , she continues , referring to the blistering summer heat . <p> A modernist southern Californian design influence is at play throughout the house .

I think its very important to design inside and outside , says Bell . I think the best architecture and design is almost always approached that way . The building does n't  end at the facade . Its not just about the building as an object. Large , manual , outdoor shutters were designed by Bell to help block out the sun on hot summer afternoons , and to help capture the cascading LA winds that percolate in the canyons around the city when the temperature drops in the evenings , sometimes by 25 to 30 degrees . <p> The fireplace in the main room , which was designed for entertaining guests , helps create a chic yet inviting SoCal ambience .

We came here on vacation , and Alessandro was meeting all these interesting people , and things seemed to be moving , and so we upped and moved here. <p> There was a level of trust on both sides , says Bell . We both love tall spaces , I knew that from working with them on the house in London . They wanted tall spaces in the entertaining areas like the 16ft windows and doors for dramatic effect . It came together nicely . My parents are Australian , so I grew up mostly there ; the climate and the way people live there is a little like LA. <p> Bell visited LA and the site with the clients in the early stages .

In London , shed nearly always worked with listed buildings and/or in conservation areas . Planners can withhold approval if they think the aesthetic of a design does not fit with its surroundings , she says . But this project was a clean slate . <p> Naturally , there is refining in design , she continues , but buildings should be well resolved before any construction commences .

' Some of us remain in a kind of denial , ' says Niccolini , who began working at the restaurant in 1977 , four years after arriving in the US . ' I 've basically grown up within these walls , and Ive seen the restaurant through many different chapters of New York history . ' <p> From its inception , The Four Seasons Restaurant was a restaurant of singular ambition . A pair of vast rooms at the base of Mies van der Rohes Manhattan masterpiece , the 38-storey Seagram Building , the restaurant opened in 1959 . Like the building itself , the restaurants construction was overseen by Seagram owner Samuel Bronfman and his architect daughter Phyllis Lambert , who lavished fastidious attention on every detail , birthing a truly modern Gesamtkunstwerk . <p> In keeping with the worlds foremost International Style building , the restaurant marries rectilinear clarity with an exquisite material palette . When an exhausted Mies retreated to Chicago , Philip Johnson , who would one day be considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants interior . <p> Faced with the scale of a small European train station , Johnson divided the space into two large dining rooms . In the Grill Room , he added magisterial 20ft-high panels of French walnut and installed a square bar beneath a Richard Lippold sculpture of hanging bronze tubes . For the somewhat more romantic Pool Room , a raised pool of white Carrara marble was installed as a visual anchor . Connecting the two spaces is a long , thin travertine-clad passageway known as Picasso Alley because it housed a 19ft x 20ft Picasso curtain created in 1919 . <p> Johnson and Lamberts design dream team also included lighting expert Richard Kelly ; industrial designers L. Garth and Ada Louise Huxtable ; and landscape architect Karl Linn . The projects final budget amounted to the then-unprecedented sum of $4.5m , said to be more than the cost of the entire Guggenheim Museum . <p> Here , in the heart of Midtown Manhattan , was a new kind of establishment . Undeniably glamorous , but never gauche or glitzy , the restaurant was a paean to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quintessential backdrop for the citys post-war ambitions and dizzily status-conscious denizens . Heads of state , visiting royalty , newly minted yuppies and titans of industry all parked up to discuss business and seal deals . <p> Thankfully , the tables were far enough apart to facilitate dealmaking yet still allow for just a soupton of eavesdropping ( to be breathlessly reported by Page Six ) , while generous sightlines facilitated discreet stargazing . With a setting that never eclipsed its supernova clientele , The Four Seasons Restaurant always seemed to be the social arena of the moment . In 1962 , the newly inaugurated President Kennedy celebrated his 45th birthday party in one of the restaurants private rooms , hours before Marilyn Monroes famous raspy serenade . In the 1980s , it was Chanel power suits , Ivana Trump and naked romps in the marble pool . The 1990s saw it become the de facto CondT Nast canteen ( where US Vogue editor Anna Wintour , a regular diner , was once served a dead raccoon by a PETA protester ) . <p> ' Everybody has eaten here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebrities who have not dined here ( ' Weve fed every president except Richard Nixon ' ) . In 1979 , Esquire coined the term ' power lunch to describe the restaurants sui generis blend of power and status . Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis christened the Grill Room ' the cathedral . ' <p> But it could n't last . In recent years , this seat of 20th century might has become the object of much public combat , with von Bidder and Niccolini pitted against Aby Rosen , the Seagram Buildings owner . Rosen has also clashed with preservationists and Lambert , the restaurants visionary creator , by pushing for the removal of the Picasso curtain ( which was painted for the ballet Le Tricorne and is now installed in the New-York Historical Society ) and proposing structural changes to its landmark protected interiors . Unable to reach a new lease agreement , the owners decided to shutter the restaurant and reopen it elsewhere under the same name . Nevertheless , The Four Seasons Restaurant , as we know it , will cease to exist . <p> While most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its contents are due to be sold in a sale conducted by Chicago-based auction house Wright . ' The Four Seasons is the epitome of Power New York , ' says founder Richard Wright . ' Having a drink at the bar , where I always felt obligated to order a martini , felt impossibly urbane . The richness of the interior , the hushed environment and the hypnotic ripple of the metal window treatments refute the idea of modernism being cold and clinical . The space elevates and inspires , which is why it has played a part in the important life moments of so many . ' <p> For those whove celebrated a milestone at the restaurant or simply enjoyed a business lunch , its rich furnishings and tableware possess both intrinsic and talismanic power . ' It reminds me of when the Yankees relocated and the stadiums contents were sold to the fans , says Niccolini . ' Our guests are desperate to own a piece of the citys culinary and social history . ' <p> Among the lots up for auction are the Grill Rooms five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habituTs . ' Each day , Philip Johnson would take his lunch right here and order a single negroni , ' says Niccolini , pointing out the Grill Rooms southernmost banquette . Other pieces for sale include upholstered ' Brno ' chairs , originally designed for Mies Villa Tugendhat in Brno in the Czech Republic ; polished bronze-topped ' Tulip ' tables by Eero Saarinen from the bar area ; Hans Wegner chairs from the Grill Rooms mezzanine , including the chair that JFK sat on during his birthday dinner ; and the sofas that Johnson designed specifically for waiting guests . <p> ' The Bronfman family and Phyllis Lambert , in particular , were like the Medicis of their time , ' says Niccolini , listing the sheer number of items that were commissioned for the restaurant by its founders , determined to cast off the tradition-bound hauteur that was then standard in predominantly French fine dining restaurants . The Huxtables table and cookware , which features in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art , also reflects this spirit of strident modernity . <p> Depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its expensive , indistinct food , expansive spaces and muffled ambience is either completely dTmodT or more relevant than ever . What 's certain is that it wo n't remain the same after the last service on 16 July , four days shy of its 57th birthday . ' This all will come to an end , ' says Niccolini with a sanguine shrug . With help from advisers , including architectural critic Paul Goldberger , the owners have engaged a world-class architect to create a new iteration of The Four Seasons Restaurant . ' Again , the architecture will come first , ' stresses Niccolini , almost conceding that the food has always been beside the point . ' People do n't  go to restaurants just to eat ; its a place for magic , tremendous architecture and beauty . We could never recreate this , but we will do something special .

Pictured : The Weight Of Scars , byOtobong Nkanga , 2015 . Photography : Miriam O'Connor . Courtesy the artist and Eva International <p> As far as the cyclical nature of invasion , subjugation and colonisation goes , its a familiar tale in our species short history . When the Anglo-Normans invaded western Ireland in 1172 , such was the direness of the natives situation that whole settlements were burned to the ground to prevent the invasions progress . When the area was finally captured , the invaders constructed a grand castle named for their ruler , King John , that presided dauntingly over the area on the banks of the River Shannon in what was to become the city of Limerick . <p> While today , the structures impressively preserved external walls and towers are a marvel to both scholars and tourists alike , the castles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion and oppression . Its this subject matter that Koyo Kouoh , the curator of Irelands Biennial ( referred to as EVA , short for Exhibition of Visual Art ) , has taken and explored via the medium of contemporary art , with the intention of encouraging dialogue within the artistic community around topics surrounding todays postcolonial aftermath and scattered diasporas . <p> Entitled ' Still ( The ) Barbarians ' , after Constantine Cavafys 1898 poem ' Waiting for the Barbarians ' , the 2016 Biennial coincides with the important centennial of the 1916 Easter Rising , an armed insurrection mounted by Irish Republicans while Britain was occupied by the First World War . Kouohs background as the founding artistic director of Dakars RAW Material Company and curator of 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fairs education programme makes the discussion a natural one , and she draws parallels between Irelands history of oppression at the hands of the British and todays postcolonial narrative . Ireland is the first and foremost laboratory of the British colonial enterprise , that was subsequently exported across the globe , she says . <p> Artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals , and have been installed throughout the city , from the sprawling complex of a former condensed milk factory to the more accessible Limerick City Gallery of Art .

Accompanying mannequins are clad in a straitjacket and a fluorescent orange jumpsuit , recalling a penitentiary 's finest , albeit woven from pretty commercially-produced lace in a striking visual representation of commercial enslavement as colonial legacy , while juxtaposing the citys manufacturing heritage with the materials status as a luxury item in Ghana . <p> Other artists were similarly direct in their engagement of the subject matter . Korean-American artist Michael Joos three-part installation This Beautiful Striped Wreckage ( Which We Interrogate ) ... sets up shop at the citys historical Sailors Home , a 19th century building stripped bare save for a few select pieces .

Uriel Orlows work with microhistories brings Nelson Mandelas incarceration on Robben Island into focus with the installation Grey , Green , Gold , which refers to the garden the prisoners were allowed , and one that concealed a manuscript of the biography that was to become 1995s Long Walk to Freedom . A slide projection and wallpaper of the prison garden and the events surrounding it culminates in a tiny flower grown from a seed , which was renamed ' Mandelas Gold ' and symbolises a new era in post-apartheid South Africa . <p> Similarly , Canadian duo Public Studios film Road Movie has been staggered and projected onto sweeping screens in a vast factory space , depicting a system of segregated roads that have been built as part of the Israeli military control over the West Bank .

The city is bidding for European Capital of Culture in 2020 , with the Biennial a core part of its application , and while a few artists have put Ireland at centre stage notably , Deirdre Power and Softday , as well as Jonathan Cummins and his complex trio of films the mood is far more global in outlook , as the curator invites us to draw historical comparisons between far-flung regions like Southeast Asia and the Congo , and not merely in isolation . <p> The colonial enterprise from the Western Europe perspective was understood as a capitalistic and social project played out in faraway " uncivilised " societies as opposed to one played out next door , she replies when asked about Irelands modern relationship with its colonial past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to recognise that the country served as a laboratory of imperialism before its global expansion . Another may be that the extended duration of the British occupation of Ireland brought about a strong degree of assimilation , which finds its most visible expression in the contemporary situation of Northern Ireland divided between Unionists and Republicans. <p> Its an enormously complex subject to grapple with and as ever , one with deleterious aftershocks that reverberate through the fabric of the contemporary news cycle . Europe can not exonerate itself from the conduct and consequences of imperialism through denial and silencing , Kouoh concludes . The current refugee crisis is just the tip of an iceberg of intricate and entangled fraught relationships forged during that era of massive exploitation . Their impacts continue to define our present day. 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

FM : Ferrari does n't  want to make anything that follows a trend . We are not followers . I do n't  think an SUV can be a supercar . Every time we work on a new Ferrari we try to improve every aspect , including the centre of gravity so an SUV is not a Ferrari . I do n't  understand why so many other brands are doing them . In my opinion it shows a lack of courage . <p> Does Ferrari have a design philosophy , and if so , what is it ? We never follow one philosophy like kinetic design , flame-surfacing etc . These are slogans . Design is a form of language , that needs to transmit the soul of the project , so were not so strict on the use of a family feeling . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repeated one hundred times . This does n't  work . We have to be more free , to take care of the processes of the brand . Its a subtle balance . <p> With your enlarged in-house team do you still work with independent firm Pininfarina to design new Ferraris ? Its a combination , but I have to say the results of the Ferrari design team are so high , its almost natural to develop most of the production projects in-house . Pininfarina is maybe going back its roots working as a coach-builder for one-offs and limited edition projects where the skill is to create a new body for an existing Ferrari . Due to the increasing complexity of our cars its much more useful to take advantage of the synergy of working in-house with the departments . Geographically there are a lot of advantages too ; we can meet immediately to discuss design engineering issues , its so fast . We work at the same speed as a Formula 1 department . <p> What abilities do you seek when recruiting new designers ? Normally what I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to sketch , to find something . The capability to dream and think about something that is completely new is not easy . Most of the students today are too cautious . There is a mental pollution . <p> How do you find inspiration for new designs ? Curiosity about the world , not just cars , means you have a more creative mind . A humble approach is really important too . I 'm a bit upset about so-called novelties that are not new . I would like to see more boldness . We never make fake things . Every air intake we make is because we need it . Look around and there are so many fake air intakes , even closed ones .

Pictured : an abstracted take on the room 's bed , mirrored across a double-page spread <p> A multitude of folds structure these areas formally and functionally . Pictured : the cut to the fore represents the room 's room divider/shelving <p> The space is in transience and fluctuates between two extreme states ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings ; and another that is unfolded , dispersed and interlocked with its environment <p> Furniture and architecture are integrated and mobile ; increased variety and possibilities for habitation are revealed and possibilities for habitation revealed as the ' Lotus ' sheds and unveils its embedded parts as reflected in the multi-page , cut-out magazine iteration of the design <p> ' I ask her about the original artwork shes making for Wallpaper* , ' Matthew Collings wrote at the time .

What has she done , what does her stuff look like , why is it good ? Post-modern deconstruction , forms always surprising but never silly , responding differently to different sites , cities and societies , never allowing a mere style or brand to stand for her , but always being incredibly stylish , making you feel amazed and uplifted by the sight of , say , tower blocks . The two blocks she 's done in Dubai , for example , where curving organic speed lines merge with minimal rectangles , so the towers look like they 're flickering or bending . Its no mirage : they really are built like that . Or at least they will be , when they 're completed in 2011 . And so , is architecture the greatest art form of the present ? It can often seem more uplifting than art , which seems to want to ditch the one thing that made it great in the past : beauty . Contemporary architecture says a big yes to amazing visual impact , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With such buzzing thoughts in my head , I step into an old school building in Londons Clerkenwell , which has been turned into the great architects practice . <p> The spaces havent been done up outrageously just white paint . It still looks like a school . Only , instead of children at desks , its 20- and 30-somethings at computer screens , nearly 200 of them in all , the architects employees . They 're churning out the supplementary magic stuff that is needed to finalise the architects designs . The primary stuff comes out of the architects head . I wonder if theyve all got degrees in architecture , or what it is you actually need to work here : if , like the boss , you need originality , vision , energy , difference , attitude , but also wisdom and a sense of history and an ability to communicate and to impress and to please people . Even though you have the reputation of being incoherent and a bit frightening . <p> Having arrived at the appointed time , I 've been asked to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press officer says even to expect to have to come back on a different day . On the other hand , it might be OK : She might like you. <p> After glasses of water and a longish browse through magnificent publications featuring Zaha Hadids work , with the sound of muted keyboard tapping all around as well as the worker-geniuses at their computers , there 's a bank of beautiful male and female receptionists with bright friendly faces and occasionally an interesting musical growling coming from somewhere on the opposite side of the large light-filled space , Im taken to a big room and ushered a couple of feet inside the door . <p> Far away the Big Z sits in black at a white table . A plate of biscuits and a Diet Coke before her , some men in suits standing nearby . Roger consults , Zaha speaks , and , as I suspected , this is the source of the growling sounds Ive been aware of . Roger returns across the room : She says not today. When I say OK , I 'm genuinely not offended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art world , all you ever meet are preposterous poseurs whose achievements are dubious , but here 's someone who really has done something . On the other hand , I cant say relief was n't entirely absent . Now I can swot up more on the kinds of things her work is about , its super-modern terminology and weird and wonderful aims not just to provide protection for fire engines or industry people or works of art or trains whizzing in and out of cities , but to express the moment , define what we are , leave an imprint for the future of what bugs us and fires us up today . <p> I look at a picture of her first built building , the Vitra fire station in Germany ( built on the Vitra premises and manned by Vitra volunteers ; it was considered necessary following a fire at the factory ) . I laugh at her great comment on it from the time : The whole building is frozen motion ready to explode into action at any moment. It really does look like it is ready to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if expressing the mind of someone whose very being is synonymous with action and willpower . Reassuring for a place that is in charge of putting fires out . <p> Roger says , as he guides me back to the reception area with a fresh armload of Hadid-glorifying glossy publications , You probably know more about her than I do. I say no , I wish , ha ha , and nervously get down to studying the articles , just in case I am called back today . <p> What does deconstruction in architecture mean ? Like fashion at the end of the 20th century : a sense of something ordered and classical , but an elegant unravelling of the same thing , so you feel you 're getting both , neither stuffy nor silly . She has a sense of an ordered building , she undermines it by inserting a whole new set of contemporary values , and the result is convincing . <p> Her design for the compressed spaces of Cincinnatis Rosenthal Contemporary Art Center , built for nearly $30m in 2003 , causes city life to flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass-walled public area on the ground level , with a lot of electric light strips , seems to stand for a kind of staged everyday city space : a delightful architectural metaphor for the clichT of blurred boundaries between art and life . <p> Inside , on different stages , are the galleries eight of them a series of changing spaces , appropriate to an art centre that has no permanent collection of its own , and is devoted to a constant stream of changing exhibitions . Some are taller than others , some have daylight , some have none , but most have a sloping or zigzag shape , few are ordinary spaces . They 're all connected by a kind of trick staircase that appears to be tilting . As a visitor , you 're not allowed to forget the space ; you 're under attack in a way . But its a pleasurable way . In Abu Dhabi , she 's got a museum of performing arts being constructed on a pleasure island full of museums created by architectural hot shots : hers is easily the most striking , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its only an hour or so later . Roger appears : Shes been talking about cement all day ; she wants something different. ( As if it might be something different to eat . ) I gulp and we return together to the big room , where she is telling off a lot of assistants who dart in and out of the door . They vaporise and telling-off merges into interview . <p> Born in Baghdad in 1950 ( to a liberal democratic Muslim family who left Iraq in the 1960s ) , she has lived and worked in London for more than 40 years . But it turns out that , as well as the low growling speaking voice that often makes her hard to understand , she has a peculiar way of talking in solid concepts , just serving up meaning-clusters and not bothering with grammar . I know what an axonometric drawing is and what topology is and , of course , what complexity and voids are , but when they are just stuck together in a clump , I do n't  know where I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not at all pretentious ; she knows about something difficult , her area , and she appreciates someone wanting to hear about it , even if they are a bit bewildered by what comes out . <p> It reminds me a little of interviewing Andy Warhol a few months before he died . I only realised much later how out of my depth I was and that he was actually being quite kind in tolerating me . He was doing something new that had a lot of complicated levels , and if he needed his verbal mode to be wow and gee that did n't  mean he was n't a formidable thinker . He had the right . And , likewise , if Hadid does n't  go in for verbs and tenses , its petty to complain . <p> I ask her about the original artwork shes making for Wallpaper* . She wants a shape cut out of the magazine , literally a cavity in the middle . I do n't  know if this is exactly what 's going to happen in the end I thought of my friend in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who told me that when Hadid had her 30-year retrospective there in 2006 , she wanted a similarly logic-defying circular catalogue . She also said that Hadid used to shout at her staff in front of the publications team , and now here she was doing exactly that in front of me Im not sure they really minded that much , though . <p> She is the real thing , my friend had thought , and I do too : this amazing-looking figure , like a female Wizard of Oz , a wizard of the night , in striking black and gold Prada , with her big eyes and deep , growling voice . <p> The artwork for Wallpaper* relates to a set of ideas about space and fluidity that she 's been developing for the last ten years . She says these ideas include all sorts of notions , but , while I understand their literal meanings , I do n't  exactly know how they all add up : carving , layering , the void , space , archaeology and landscape ( which certainly sounds how her buildings look ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she rumbles . <p> We get on to her paintings . Shes famous for doing them geometric abstracts . I like them because of their balance of forms , not so much for the handling of paint , which is rather anonymous . But I 'm impressed by the sense of pattern , the play of shapes , the balanced asymmetric distribution of intensities and more muted bits : what it says to me is sensitivity , experience , knowledge , feeling and a genuine mental-jumping-about energy ( all rare in the Turner Prize world ) . <p> The paintings are not really abstract art , but plans for architecture ; they 're her personal way of working through ideas . She started doing them in the 1970s at the Architectural Association ( AA ) School of Architecture when she was studying there under the architects Rem Koolhaas and Bernard Tschumi . Hadid is thought of as a postmodernist , but at the same time as someone for whom modernism is a burning issue , not something to be merely ironic about or jokey towards . Modernism was progressive and optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the postmodernist received idea : nothing is more true than anything else , and everything is relative . Hadids architectural spirit was formed at a time when anyone creative was on fire with postmodernist cleverness . But while she mines modernism for forms , she does n't  use them to laugh at the days of sincerity and belief . She is a great believer in progress herself . <p> Painting , the influence of Russian constructivist Kasimir Malevich and her first sense that she really might have something the world might want , all happened at once for her , with Koolhaas presiding . He gave her a project , solving some problem of space , and her solution was to re-employ spatial ideas that Malevich had come up with in the run-up to the Russian revolution . <p> Malevich was a visionary . He wanted Russia and the whole world to move into the future , with him in the lead . He called himself The President of Space . But his ideas were too hot for the new regime , and under Stalin after Malevich died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot student , was going to revive them . The first blast of Malevich-return , or neo-modernism , was going to be a project on Hungerford Bridge : a hotel spanning the Thames , made of pure white , geometric , modern-art forms ( similar to the ones in white relief on the wall in the room I 'm sitting in with Hadid now , which turn out to be her original plans for Cincinnati ) . <p> It was just a student project , and although it earned Hadid a prize , and eventual employment by Koolhaas when she left the AA , there was never any expectation of it actually being built . However , the 1970s was a funny time at the AA , because no one actually expected anything to be built . The big architectural stars designed buildings and towns that challenged all existing buildings and towns , and were really a kind of heroic conceptual-art version of architecture . Then , in the following decade , the same iconoclasts gradually became real builders . <p> For Hadid it was very gradual . She won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realised : she was considered too radical and difficult by the powers that be . The most prestigious prize was in 1983 for a design for a leisure centre in Hong Kong , called The Peak , but then another architect was given the gig instead ( perhaps because she proudly called her design for The Peak a suprematist geology ) . Even as late as 1994 , she had a major prize-winning design ( the Cardiff Bay Opera House ) turned down for actual building by a board of conservative bores . <p> She was used to being put down by such types , but convinced she would get somewhere in the end . She kept going on about complexity , she was big and bold , she really went for it , and eventually she won . Her first built building , the fire station , went up ten years after The Peak rejection . Ten years later , she had buildings under construction all over the world , and now she 's a byword for Now . <p> She laughs when I ask her if Malevich is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She has the greatest respect for him , but her mind is more her own now . If the typical Hadid look is elegant , slinky , organic and flowing , there is still a great range to how those characteristics are manifested : one building does something , while another one does something else . ( Her predecessor , both as great guru of the art of building and great beneficiary of information technology , Frank Gehry , does a sort of computer-generated knitting , which is fun , but its the same knitting each time . ) <p> What is greatness ? All the past art and architecture styles that go into the Zaha Hadid product constructivism , futurism , expressionism have had their original ideologies taken away as they ( kind of ) merge with what we might call computerism . Is it that they just fit , as everything must , into the new global ideology : consumerism ? The information ages big belief is : no belief , just buy . But this is a social change that Hadid whose overriding pre-occupation right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is social housing can not be attacked for . <p> You could ask where she stands on the emptiness of our age , its emotional flatness and lack of ambition to do anything about social injustice , but does art really work like that ? Her architecture is the greatest art of the moment . It expresses the age , but that means it has contradictions , too . Just as Malevich did n't  paint the revolution , but expressed a vision of change in abstract forms , or by abstract allegory and abstract metaphors , so Hadids buildings are metaphors for new rising optimistic ideals that fight apathy : especially a new fascination with nature , not just lovely trees , but natures intricacy and deep structures , its internal complexity , its processes . Her ambition is to push forward her ideas about space , to make fluid forms even more stately and surprising and moving , in order to offer society models of change . And the power and joy of the way she goes about all that is what makes her great . <p> As originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Bold use of materials , interplay between light and shadow , and creative use of space , showcases the architects ability to have fun , while creating a top quality , highly functional family home . <p> The house appears to float above ground , and lifting it might make for a striking move but it was far from merely an aesthetic choice . Making the house float over the terrain was the key action that makes sense to the house , says Galera explaining that the absence of a ground floor helps create a sheltered outdoor area , which the whole family can enjoy to relax and entertain friends . <p> The minimalist ground floor provides the main access to the upper levels , also linking the house to the garden . Climbing towards the first floor , glimpses of the surrounding pines are visible through the breaks within the stairwell 's concrete . The spectacular views of the surrounding nature only fully unfold when reaching the houses main living area . Towards the rear of the property lies the spacious master bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room divider that can create a separate playroom for the children when needed . <p> Light plays a pivotal role in the design . The architects studied the effect of the changes of light in each season ; this informed the design in different parts of the house . Different visual elements were added to celebrate these changes , such as iron slabs with rectangular perforations that cast playful shadows within . <p> Concrete is the project 's material protagonist . Polished concrete floors offset the rough textured concrete walls and are a welcome contrast to the homes warm wooden tones and sporadic flashes of marble . The addition of expanded polystyrene within the walls , cleverly helps regulate the structure 's internal temperature throughout the winter and summer months . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

How many Nike shoe boxes were used exactly and how did they get here ? JH:I think there are between 20,000 and 25,000 boxes . Let 's just say its a lot . <p> You trained as architect and sit on the board at Herman Miller , so Salone del Mobile has long been on your radar , but why is it important for Nike to be at Salone in among all the furniture and kitchens ? The Nike team has come to Salone for many years as observers and we felt , because of the nature of the focus on design and creative excellence , and unique innovations , it was time that we presented something ourselves . For us , ' The Nature of Motion ' is a discourse , a point of view a dialogue with the city of Milan and its assembled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focussed on three things : collaboration , sports innovation and the notion of imagination . To begin to get a glimpse into the not too distance future , showing where we think the world of design is going . <p> The exhibition has been two years in the planning , right ? Yes , almost two years . But really , this is a journey we 've been on for 40 years and its a journey that is never complete . Its a pursuit of thinking about how we study the body , how we create products footwear , clothing etc . Our mission is to create a symbiotic , one-on-one relationship that is in perfect harmony with the body in motion . Where the athlete is free from distraction . Its dynamic design ; we operate on the principle that if we can design a cohesive system that works together , we can effectively reduce or eliminate all meaningful distractions and allow the athletes mind and body to focus solely on performance . <p> Some of the conceptual pieces in the exhibition are pretty wild . As outlandish as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those concepts becoming integrated into Nike production models in the future ? The concepts take us to the edge of what 's possible . Its all about letting your dream of design overtake your logic of design . What I see are glimpses in those exhibits , details and ideas that will begin to point us in certain directions in the future . Many of them deal with the sensation of sending signals up through the body via the soles of the feet and that is something that is very fundamental to us at Nike . Yes , some of the shoes are absurd but if you are honest as a designer , dreaming unencumbered by logic is the right way to be . <p> How did you arrive at the collection of collaborative talent for the exhibition ? They are all people with whom we believed we could engage and exchange , people who could challenge us and vice-versa . They are helping take us someplace new , helping us with our dialogue . <p> What brief did you give the collaborators exactly ? The brief was pretty simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion of mobility , motion and movement . Each piece is a unique exploration , a piece of poetry expressed either by form and surface , scale , equilibrium , the nature of gravity or rhythm , of how the body reacts to heat and cool all of which happen to be narratives synonymous with the narratives of athletes , by the way . Each one has taken us into a different vein of thinking . <p> Away from nature , what else has influenced the Nike design team recently ? Nature and the body is always a foundational thought for us but we will study anything that moves anything that has intentional motion that involves power and grace . Recently , we went to Kyoto to study the intention of craft and how craft works with nature . We 've also visited lots of different engineers , artists , designers . We are wide open we have spent time with zoo keepers , to look at animal movement , with couturiers , tailors , automotive designers . Even Google . <p> You talk a lot about ' performance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we are taste-makers beauty . And we believe that the unique juxtaposition and harmonising of those two ideas is Nikes distinct advantage . We do n't  sacrifice either beauty or function . For us , the goal is goose bumps , a visceral reaction to something beautiful , because the best design should captivate at first glance We want to make iconic , hypnotic products so that people will be inspired by the form and surface , but also thrilled by the intention and function . The perfect balance of art and science . When we do it really well , its hard to know where one starts and the other stops . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

But the vision it fulfills is much older than that . <p> In 1915 , black veterans of the US Civil War proposed building a national memorial to African-American achievement . The idea languished for decades , and attempts to revive it in the 1970s and 80s met with political opposition . Finally , in 2003 , the US Congress authorised a museum dedicated to the African-American experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , close to the Washington Monument . <p> A competition in 2009 narrowed the museums possible designers down to just one : the Freelon Adjaye Bond/SmithGroup , consisting of The Freelon Group , Adjaye Associates , Davis Brody Bond and SmithGroup . <p> The challenge facing lead designer David Adjaye was daunting . Dreamed up by Washingtons original planner , Pierre LEnfant , and enshrined under the 1901 McMillan Plan , the Mall is a hallowed landscape for Americans , replete with iconic structures , including the US Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial . How do you add to one of the most important master plans in the world ? asks Adjaye . <p> He proposed a stately ziggurat clad in a decorative facade , its tiered floors inspired by the crowns that top columns in the Yoruban architecture of West Africa . The museums architects call this form the corona , and they angled these tiers at precisely 17 degrees to match the Washington Monument pinnacle . <p> Last summer , workers installed the 3,600 panels of the corona . Made of aluminium coated in a bronze-coloured finish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artisans in 19th-century New Orleans and Charleston . The filigree patterns are a computer-generated , modern interpretation , says Philip Freelon , the museums architect of record . The design team chose a range of opacities varying from 65 to 90 per cent . The skin is not monolithic in the way its perforated , Freelon says . It varies , which gives the building its complexity. From the outside , the appearance of the wrapper changes depending on the weather and time of day . <p> The skin will also help to control heat gain on the south , the direction from which most visitors will arrive . This side of the 400,000 sq ft museum features a deep canopy inspired by vernacular African-American architecture . In front of the porch , a reflecting pool will relieve the heat of DCs muggy summers . <p> Once inside , visitors will proceed to the galleries above and below a full 60 per cent of the interior space lies underground . There will be sections devoted to history , culture and community ( including sports and military history ) . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance . They wanted to represent the injustice of slavery and discrimination , but also to celebrate black achievement . <p> When it opens this autumn , NMAAHC will convey both uplift and recognition of despair , according to Lonnie Bunch , director of the museum . On the concourse level , visitors can look up and see five storeys rising into the sky . That notion of resiliency , of belief in a better day , is captured in that , Bunch says . Other spaces will be more difficult to experience . A darkened triangular room will display artifacts from a slave ship and project the stories of people involved in the slave trade . To allow for quiet reflection , the architects put an oculus-like fountain with seating at the north end . <p> Bunch also says one of his priorities for the new building was that it be of the Mall and not just on it . Often , you walk into buildings on the Mall and you 're in the building you forget you 're on the Mall , he says . The team strove to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openings , visitors can look out at the graves of black war heroes in nearby Arlington Cemetery , or , discomfitingly , at the former site of a slave pen on the Malls grounds . <p> For Adjaye , the moments of both pride and unease reinforce a larger point , that the migration of a group of people changed a nation . The museum stands with and against the other institutions on the Mall , he says , echoing Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes , with exactly this purpose : to say that this , too , is American history ; this , too , is America. <p> As originally featured in the February 2016 issue of Wallpaper* ( W*203 ) 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

A smart move from chef Nicolai Nrregaard and his two partners , whose intention was to create a sense of intimacy for the re-opening of Kadeau , the city outpost of their original restaurant of the same name located on the shores of Bornholm , a picture-perfect island in the Baltic Sea .

' We wanted to place the kitchen right in the middle , so that everyone has to walk through it to get to the dining room , ' explains Nrregaard . But while an open kitchen is not uncommon , designing a professional version that gives the impression of being domestic is .

' Here , the notion of courtyard is somewhat different in that in the center of these radiating wings of the house , there is a big open area . It 's an open-air courtyard and the radiating wings create courtyards themselves , which are completed on their third side by nature .

Numerous living green walls , water features and a swimming pool at the heart of the space bring a serene , contemplative feel to the house 's avant-garde form , while uniting it with its luscious surroundings . <p> In addition to creating a home that is at one with nature , Tsao &amp; McKown went to great lengths to create a sustainable and environmentally responsible dwelling for the client - an achievement that was recognized with a sustainability award given by the Singapore government . <p> ' The house is actually designed to be used in sections , ' McKown explains , ' When it 's just the couple , they basically just use their portion of one wing and the kitchen , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're entertaining , then they can open up other parts of the house . ' <p> At the Astrid Hill House , rooms are laid out to make use of cross ventilation . Its connective three-story atrium is also completely open air . The green walls provide evaporative cooling , while sun shading helps to reduce heat gain where possible . Light wells in the roof allow natural light to filter through to the basement . Rainwater is collected for the fountains , while plenty of photovoltaic panels and a geothermal exchange-powered cooling system helps to conserve energy where possible . <p> ' It 's a tropical environment , so the cooling is an issue , not heating , ' adds McKown , ' The rooms are still air-conditioned , but the owners use it sparingly .

After acquiring it in 1988 , the Tarantinos restored the 1,700 sq ft , open-floor-plan structure to its original splendor - Philippine mahogany woodwork , clerestory windows framed by perforations of stylized Sycamore pods , concrete in Wright 's signature ' Cherokee red , ' nautically scaled hallways and bedrooms that give way to expansive , double-height living spaces - but were endlessly challenged by their beautiful yet menacing next-door neighbour : the Millstone River . <p> ' The house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the second story , so it was a matter of preservation , and a pretty urgent one , ' says Eccleston , who led the reconstruction project with architect Ron Shelby and contractor Bill Faber . In putting the house back together , opportunities to take shortcuts emerged around every mitered corner . All were eschewed , down to the decision to thread nails through the original 1956 holes and to bring a local mason out of retirement to match Wright 's old-school concrete mix for the block wall that fronts the home in a cool contrast to the open-to-nature back , now positioned to overlook the natural water source of Crystal Spring . <p> ' People always emphasize horizontality when they describe Wright 's work , but he punctuates it with vertical elements , ' says Dylan Turk , a curatorial assistant at Crystal Bridges .

@@40481606 @481606/ <p> A new train at the Eurostar Temple Mills depot in London . It boasts the company 's trademark yellow and blue , as well as a band of silver which , according to the designers , gives a sense of speed to the livery <p> At the end of this year , a new fleet of Eurostar trains will make its debut journey between London and Paris , soon to be joined by more trains to cover the companys other European routes . Although these are the now-familiar Siemens-designed e320 Velaro trains , they have been given a radical makeover by Italian design and engineering firm Pininfarina . <p> For the past six years , the Turin-based company has been working closely with Eurostar and Siemens to apply its signature design touch to the coaches interiors as well as to the trains exterior , through a new livery that enhances the trains aesthetics using colours and lines . We developed a striped colour composition , integrating the trains windows and giving a fresh interpretation of the Eurostar colour identity , explains Fabio Filippini , Pininfarinas vice-president of design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow hues that are Eurostars signature , as well as a band of silver that , the designer explains , is closer to automotive design , offering an aesthetic that goes beyond functionality and giving a sense of speed and quality to the new feet . <p> But the coaches interiors are where the new design identity is fully expressed : the teams starting point was Eurostars desire to increase capacity ( the new trains will carry 900 passengers , versus the 750 of the old feet ) , while at the same time improve each passengers personal space , comfort and environment . Its an apparently contradictory request , notes Filippini , which is , in a way , the life of a designer : working with conflicting conditions to find the best solutions. <p> The new interiors are a combination of vision and pragmatism : Pininfarinas concept involved creating an environment that feels more open and fluid , while working within the constraints that come with the request for increased space , ergonomics and safety , and the companys commitment to passenger experience . The design focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team thought it was important to create a continuous flow throughout the coaches , achieved via rich burgundy and ochre shades on the ceilings and floors and a subtle alternation of different hues on each row of seats . The latter , Filippini explains , is both to enhance the feeling of a private space but also a practical matter : by diversifying each rows colour , it will be easier for passengers to spot their seat when they return to it . <p> The practical elements of the seats design were also tackled by Pininfarina with its usual 360-degree approach : the slimmed-down seats are now part of a clear , intuitive layout integrating all accessories , from plugs , reading lights and storage to cup holders . Although materials had to be compliant with restrictive regulations , the team managed to sneak in some quintessential Italian design details , borrowed from contemporary furniture as well as from the automotive world : for example , the leather headrests are trimmed with a signature Eurostar-yellow stitching , a high-quality handmade trimming which is typical of Italian carrozzeria , explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle vibrations that make everything a bit more dynamic . <p> The approach to the project was the same the Italian company offers when it works on luxury cars for Ferrari or Maserati . Filippini notes that everything it designs follows the three principles of Pininfarinas DNA : elegance , purity and innovation . These are all the more relevant here , with a new fleet of trains that has to be durable both from a manufacturing point of view and also , perhaps most importantly , from an aesthetic perspective . The engineering background of Pininfarina allows for an innovative approach to design problem-solving that breaks boundaries . Everything in the train answers to a functional demand , Filippini concludes , but we try to answer it with the most elegant , simple and pure gesture. <p> As originally featured in the October 2015 edition of Wallpaper* ( W*199 ) 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

We wanted them to be in the background but provide fantastic height , spaces and daylight.

The building is about openness and transparency says Haworth and a dramatic bridge is now the crossing point between two buildings , allowing views into the spacious workshops and process spaces on both sides below . <p> Haworth Tompkins is known for collaborating with artists on many of their projects . On this occasion designer and former RCA graduate Max Lamb has created a set of gates between the Sackler and the Woo buildings that mark the main entrance to the campus .

It was n't , after all , just Pesce working from his imagination . He used a figure model to get the form . Tight-lipped about confirming the models identity , he has , over the years , conceded this much : it was a famous architect someone we would all know . <p> Thanks to the efforts of art collector and patron Valeria Napoleone , who recently launched her own initiative , Valeria Napoleone XX , dedicated to equalising the gender imbalances in representing art , the butt is now a reality . The piece is the first sponsored commission for the Sculpture Center and marks the start of a series of ' Valeria Napoeleone XX Sculpture Centre ' commissions that will be produced for the institution every 12-18 months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptor Anthea Hamilton made Project for door ( After Gaetano Pesce ) , as part of her solo exhibition at New Yorks SculptureCenter , Lichen ! Libido ! Chastity ! . The nearly 10-metre-high work builds what Pesce had only imagined : a mans backside , hands clutching each half of his gluteus maximus , set into a brick wall . The similarities do n't  end there . Picking up cues from Pesces approach , Hamilton chose her model carefully , based not only on his anatomy , but also on his professional circumstances . For her model , Hamilton chose a well-known graphic designer , 3-D scanning his backside . Like Pesce , she has revealed little of her source , save for his profession and that he s in his mid-to late-thirties and often works with contemporary artists . <p> Even though mums the word on the subject , its bound to get people wondering and maybe a little piqued at their next graphics meeting .

Finally this building came onto the radar and thank goodness it happened. <p> Having recently completed the redevelopment at Tate Britain as well as Damien Hirsts soon-to-be-unveiled gallery in Vauxhall , the practice are in demand when it comes to gallery design , and for Grosvenor Hill they have a few new tricks up their sleeve . <p> Clad with handmade light grey Roman bricks , which are elongated and flatter than standard stock , the building is punctuated by a series of towering double-height steel-framed windows . The original 1960s structure 's podium exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entrance is located on the west side , where a floor has been removed to create a sequence of four double height gallery spaces including two main galleries , each measuring 18m long and 4.8m high . <p> On the east side off-limits on the day we visited directors offices and two private viewing rooms are located on the first floor level . These spaces are designed to accommodate the bulk of the Gagosians London operations , which are currently housed in the gallerys Britannia Street location in Kings Cross . <p> In the gallery spaces , Caruso St John teamed up with lighting designers at Arup to install a lighting scheme harnessing state-of-the-art LED technology . Installed in the ceiling , a set of laylight panels are programmed to use two colour temperatures a cool array and a warm array and can be set at anything from 50 to over 1000 lux . In addition , a set of sensors installed on the outside of the building are able to read and then replicate the external lighting conditions inside the gallery . <p> We do a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the fact that natural light can be created without natural light is great , says Gagosian director Stefan Ratibor . Fellow director Gary Waterston adds , Ultimately it was about being able to light the walls perfectly , without us having to add more and more to the ceiling. <p> Aside from the impressive proportions and cutting-edge lighting design , one of the gallerys most distinctive features is the fumed end-grain oak block flooring that is used throughout the lower level . Eschewing the concrete flooring found in many of the Gagosians other outposts , the engineered timber floor offers a solid but more refined aesthetic . This is , in the best sense , a West End gallery , says Caruso , referring to the spaces more delicate nature . Although all of the internal walls can be moved , and entrances can be made wider to accommodate larger pieces , there are restrictions : You could n't do a Serra show like we did in Brittania Street , you 'd have to prop the floor , Caruso continues .

@@40481624 @481624/ <h> High functioning : the next generation of minimalists defining a new , easy-going , all-day elegance <p> High functioning fashion is back in business . On the left : dress by Lemaire , top by Duan . Right : tunic , shirt and skirt , all by The Row . Sandals by Newbark . <p> On the left : jumpsuit by 1205 . Right : coat , shirt and trousers , all by Duan <p> Fashion can sometimes be read as a contest between the Roundheads and Cavaliers , the minimal and the baroque , opposing forces cycling in and out of favour . It 's just that the Cavaliers , inevitably , make for better pictures . They get the attention , as is their wont . <p> There is a new kind of minimalism on the rise right now , if you know where to look for it . Gone , though , is the deconstruction of gender norms that preoccupied designers working at the height of minimalist fashion in the early 1990s ( Helmut Lang , Jil Sander and Martin Margiela for HermFs were exemplars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by nomadic kimono-style jackets worn with wide-legged trousers and Moroccan slippers as seen at The Row . The clinical starkness of black and white has been swapped for a more seductive palette of navy and grey as seen in the collections of 1205 , the cult label that quietly insists on tactility and intimacy in the digital age . <p> The relaxed sensuality of everything designer Christophe Lemaire shows for his namesake brand in Paris makes the same argument . With influences from classic Mongolian costume , with its fat patterns and deconstructed softness , to the aloof glamour of 1970s Sonia Rykiel and Guy Paulin , Lemaire 's style is a kind of haute essentialism . <p> In many ways this new easy-going elegance is a nod to the pioneering minimalist Zoran Ladicorbic . The Yugoslavian-born designer arrived in New York in 1972 and premiered his Five Easy Pieces collection in 1976 with the gossamer and glitz of the Studio 54 era in full swing . Including just one pair of black trousers , a black skirt and three ivory tops , the collection was revolutionary . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were then radical in their less-is-moreness . <p> He thought of the collection as distinctively American - ' Simple shapes , confident and uncluttered is the American way , ' he said , way back in 1993 - and his infuence on Calvin Klein and Donna Karan and their sportswear-inspired minimalism of the 1990s is clear . Ladicorbic , a prickly , private character , withdrew his clothes from traditional retail in the early 2000s , and he now only sells to a select ( and very wealthy ) clientele . His influence , though , is perhaps stronger than ever . <p> ' These clothes require a woman with character , someone with great confidence , ' says the Serbian-born , Milan-based designer Duan Paunovic , who worked with Ladicorbic for six years before establishing his own eponymous label in 1999 . Paunovic 's collections , too , have largely remained a secret only known to gallerists , designers and architects . ' I strive to make clothes that are modern without directly reflecting the times , ' he says , offering an essentials wardrobe that questions the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels like an older minimalism revisited , there are aspects of it that are utterly contemporary , in a counter-contemporary way . ' I think that with an overload of information , we have lost our instinctive sense of touch , ' says Paula Gerbase , the designer behind 1205 . ' My fabric choices are consciously unreadable from a distance , and totally truthful to this search for intimacy . This move towards a simpler way of being is a rebellion against our time . ' <p> As technology makes our lives and relationships more varied but virtual , it has encouraged designers to deliver textures , cuts and silhouettes intended to inspire a deeper connection to the body . Whimsical , frothy clothes ca n't compete with the whimsy and froth available to us through modern technologies . ' What we place onto our bodies should neutralise the images and sounds that constantly flash in our faces , encouraging a clearer and more focused mind , ' argues the motion designer Julien SimshSuser , whose clients include Chanel , Google and the National Trust . ' So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> More people , it seems , are seeking an understated , quiet functionality , even in clothes incorporating technology or the very latest high-tech fabrics . ' I really appreciate the advantage of new fabrication techniques where you do n't directly see the tech but you can feel it , ' says SimshSuser . ' In such a classic discipline like fashion , technology should n't be the detail . It should be invisible . ' ( The design world , which has embraced new technology in design and production but stubbornly resisted trying to incorporate it into actual product , is ahead of fashion in some ways . The British designer Jasper Morrison , the godfather of super- functionalism , is the hero of the hour . ) <p> Along with new ways of living , the white-out blur of life and work , the role that clothes play in our day-to-day lives has also changed . ' Our lives in some ways have become simpler , less defined by rules of social etiquette , ' says Maria Lemos , founder of Rainbowwave fashion agency and owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable to wear the same clothes from morning to night , to wear fats in the evening , and to wear jewellery in the morning .

Clothes should defy time and seasonality and get better as they wear . Lemos cites Japanese labels such as Arts &amp; Science and 45rpm as leaders of the style ; clothes that resist the seasonal whim of fashion . <p> For the ultimate in pared-back precision , you ca n't go far wrong with Duan 's pleated silk shift , a leather bucket bag by LA-based multi-medium design studio Building Block , and 1205 's tailored dress in soft baby alpaca , which propose a luxury that is both exacting and eloquent , understated and quietly useful . <p> As originally featured in the September 2015 edition of Wallpaper* ( W*198 ) 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

My appreciation of the Nakashima aesthetic and profound craftsmanship deepened . What struck me about working with my dogs and the Nakashima furniture is how alike they are . Dog and furniture blend together and at times become one and the same . <p> We arrived in New Hope by midmorning . The dogs bolted out of the car and made a beeline for the woods .

Here , in the grounds of the Nakashima compound , I had no choice but to let them be dogs . I wondered what Mira Nakashima would think of these beasts roaming the property like they owned it . <p> As I was attempting to photograph Flo on a very interesting chair with a narrow back safely located outside the reception area , Mira appeared .

The dogs calmed down long enough for me to pose and photograph them , their elegant nuanced texture playing off the natural beauty for which this wood had been chosen by Nakashima .

And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new show curated by Martino Gamper at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery is ' interesting things collected by interesting people on interesting shelves ' . <p> ' I did n't want to do an historical show , ' says Martino , walking me around the exhibition . ' And I did n't want a " what design is now " kind of show . But I did want to use design to display design . ' <p> Simple enough . And given that the Serpentine gave Gamper an open brief and three months to get the show ready , you can see why he resisted unnecessary complication . Except it is n't really simple of course . To work well , and the show works very well indeed , Gamper had to get all the elements , all these stories , working together . <p> He started with the shelves . Now that Gamper is a central and influential figure in the British design scene , it is easy to forget that he is actually Italian . But an immersion in Italian design , especially in the work of designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while their peers embraced industrialisation , is clear in his selection . Many of the shelves are rare one-offs , secured from private lenders with a lot of help from Milan 's Nilufar Gallery ( given the time restrictions , this made more sense than trying to deal with institutions , Gamper says ) . <p> There are shelves from Franco Albini , Ettore Sottsass , Ponti , Andrea Branzi , BBPR , where the R stands for Ernesto Rogers ( cousin of Richard ) , Michele De Lucchi and Vico Magistretti , as well as Charlotte Perriand , Alvar Aalto for Artek , Vitsoe , Ercol , a number of Gamper 's own shelves and a bit of Ikea thrown in . <p> The collections come from friends , friends of friends , tutors and students who Gamper knew were inveterate hoarders of inspirational objects . Most of them are also designer makers . In the simplest terms , Gamper wants to show how the collections , the materials and the mechanics influence that making . <p> Some of these collections suggest a collector and a maker immediately ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoothed and shaped by time and nature , has been borrowed from Michael Anastassiades , as you might have guessed . So too the pop-bright plastic fantastic of Bethan Laura Wood 's haul . <p> Some collections are tightly focused , personal/professional obsessions ; Maki Suzuki 's bricks ; Jurgen Bay 's bestiary ; Max Lamb and Gemma Holt 's collection of Bernard Leach ( and acolytes pottery ) ; the heavy-duty hoes and other gardening equipment collected by the artist Richard Wentworth ; and the wooden spoons collected by the photographer Jason Evans ( disappointingly Konstantin Gric could n't locate his box full of prized coat hangers in time for the show ) . <p> Some of the displays are more eclectic , such as Ron Arad 's knuckle duster to carved cat collection for instance . Perhaps the most remarkable collection though has a space all to itself : Enzo Mari 's found object paper weights . <p> Design is a State of Mind is only the second dedicated design show at the Serpentine , following on from Konstantin Grcic 's Design Real , which opened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Grcic 's qualified techno-optimism set against Gamper 's idea of design as bricolage , a messy assembly of what was and what is , of objects that appeal for reasons we do n't entirely understand . Gamper is against taste systems but for taste , in the fullest sense . After all , a shelf , however beautiful , is only half a story , if that . It is the bits and bobs , the magpie hauls , that make sense of it . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Its not a come-hither slogan from one of the islands clubs trying to tantalise the hedonism-seeking revellers that flock their each summer , but rather , a work from a new collaborative exhibition by the artists Tobias Rehberger and Douglas Gordon . <p> At the Museu dArt Contemporani ( MACE ) , Gordon and Rehberger contemplate their own Ibiza experiences , honing in on the post-party comedown , or the notion of After the After ( as the exhibition is named ) . To wit , many of the works explore sentiments of emptiness and abandonment though not to suggest the exhibition is a melancholic affair . I like to party . He likes to party . We know what happens after the fat lady sings ! quips Gordon . <p> The pairs relationship spans some 20-odd years , after being introduced in Rotterdam by fellow artist Rirkrit Tiravanija . Surprisingly , in two decades of close friendship this is the first time their practices have intertwined so formally . <p> We started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a friend and colleague , namely having ideas about how somebody elses work could develop . So we told each other what kind of work we should make , explains Rehberger of how the collaboration came about . From that it went into all kinds of directions . Making work together , making work about each other and each others work , making work starting where the other one stops <p> Their fondness for one another is evident in the shows homoerotic undertones , which also nods to the islands reputation as a liberal sexual enclave ( both artists , for the record , are straight ) . At the entrance of the museum , Rehberger has rendered a vast , pixelated mosaic of two naked men in a lusty embrace . Gordon responded directly to this work with a pseudo-pornographic video projection . Inside the museum , the artists present sculptures , paintings and film works , in addition to portraits they have created of each other . <p> In addition to the pieces at MACE , the artists have vandalised the billboard that normally advertises Ibizas infamous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaming pair . The gallery should not end where the walls start , explains Rehberger . The whole thing is about opening it up - opening up the idea of the gallery but also opening up the idea about the limits of oneself and the work that one makes . It is about realising how much ones self exists in the other and how much the authored exists in yourself. <p> Ibizas bacchants may be looking to go down the rabbit hole , but Gordon and Rehberger make a convincing case that the island has more to offer than bottomless booze and a bad hangover . Its their compelling artworks that provide a welcome foil to Ibizas mindless debauchery . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Its 100-year-old namesake grows on site from the time when this part of Dulwich used to be a Victorian fruit orchard this was key to director Jake Edgley 's design strategy . ' The tree by its location forced me to split the house in two , but this created an internal courtyard that brings light and air into the centre of the plan , and a natural sculpture which is part of the daily experience of the ground floor , ' he says . The house the architect 's own family home was built around the mature tree , the courtyard flanked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Clerkenwell-based architect was keen to ' turn the house inward ' , so that it remains private from the surrounding terraced houses . In order to achieve this , he created a fully glazed courtyard , while both side elevations feature no windows to avoid a sense of being overlooked . A cloister-inspired bridge connects the two volumes . The first one features a hall , playroom and four bedrooms . The second houses the main living spaces , which flow out into the garden , as well as a guest bedroom and study . <p> The building 's concrete base and external walls are complemented by a timber-framed top level . There is a clear emphasis on vertical elements ' that echo the experience of looking through trees ' , explains Edgley . Such features , like the vertical plank arrangement , also help the house blend into its wooded environment . Local larch used in the structure further highlights its links to its locality . <p> Concrete and timber also make up the dominant material palette inside . The board-marked concrete of the ground floor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rougher skin . In contrast , the central , top-lit staircase is ply , leading up to the slightly ' softer ' private rooms . Oak veneered ply joinery is in fact used in several places throughout the house , including the kitchen , matched with brass detailing . <p> The design is heavily informed by its surroundings , but takes its sustainability credentials just as seriously . Concrete , for example , was chosen as it helps regulate internal temperatures ; many of the building site 's materials were reused , keeping waste low ; and thermodynamic roof panels were employed for hot water production . The use of green roofs on both volumes helps reduce surface water wastage and increase biodiversity . At the same time , they add to the area 's verdant nature , helping the low structure blend into its surroundings . <p> Edgley 's practice is highly experienced in residential design .

What I like about London 's infill plots is that they demand a creative approach . ' 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

The exhibition presented 44 designs dating as far back as the 1950s , on display inside the Galleria dArte Moderna , an 18th-century palace restored in the 1950s by Ignazio Gardella . <p> On the occasion of this year 's London Design Festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces to the city , continuing the year-long celebration of their manufacturing heritage . <p> Founded in 1934 , the company rapidly moved to the forefront of manufacturing and modern design , but its full story has rarely been told as it often happens when a company is much more focused on its future and its products , explains Francesca Molteni , granddaughter of founders Angelo and Giuseppina Molteni . <p> With the brands anniversary coming up , the Moltenis decided to take a proper look back , enlisting two archivists to collect information and testimonies from the past eight decades , as well as prototypes from the familys homes and other private collections . Francesca herself also interviewed an extended family of former employees , craftsmen and designers to piece together the brands timeline . In fact , this is n't the first time Molteni &amp; C has explored the past ( its 2011 collection of Gio Ponti reissues acted as a stimulus for this project ) , but it is the first time it has been done in such an encyclopaedic manner . <p> The shows narrative followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer of modern design pieces , such as its collaborations with the likes of Aldo Rossi , Richard Sapper and Angelo Mangiarotti , among others .

Perhaps the most intriguing works to be displayed are prototypes that were designed for the Selettiva del Mobile di Ca n't , an initiative debuted in 1955 that speaks of a golden era of Italian manufacturing . <p> For the annual contest , young international designers were invited to the industrial region of Brianza ( Molteni &amp; Cs home turf , just north of Milan ) to work with local manufacturers on prototypes that were presented to a jury including , over the years , design heavyweights such as Alvar Aalto , Finn Juhl and Carlo De Carli . Molteni &amp; Cs involvement in the contest demonstrates its commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought modernity and aesthetic innovation to the regions industry . <p> Two prototypes from the competition that were shown in Milan were a 1955 chest of drawers by Swiss architect Werner Blaser and an impressive curved wooden bookshelf by Yasuhiko Itoh , a Japanese designer , submitted in 1959 . The latter is Francescas favourite , a family heirloom of sorts that featured in her fathers childhood bedroom and later in her own private house . The pieces reissue is now in development . Its the kind of project that Molteni &amp; C was not ready to produce in the 1950s , but that we are able to manufacture now , and it is still a very modern piece , says Francesca . <p> The exhibition itself was designed by Jasper Morrison , a neutral voice who dissected and edited the Molteni &amp; C history . We chose an international designer , who would be able to look at our history with less nostalgia , says Francesca . And given the location , we also needed someone with a design sensibility , who could conceive a set-up that synthesises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gio Pontis D.357.1 bookshelf to act as a common thread linking the display stands . It seemed to work as a quiet but visually pleasing background , he explains . His design made the most of the Galleria dArte Modernas narrow halls , and ensured the pieces could stand out while engaging with the ornate , neoclassical environment . <p> The retrospective show and its current London iteration demonstrate how quality and modernity have long been in conversation at Molteni &amp; C. Looking back at innovations such as the developments in technology and materials brought in by Francescas grandparents , and important encounters with the brands many designers is helping her and her family to understand Molteni &amp; Cs direction for the years ahead .

He wanted to be closer to the actual creation process and by chance stumbled upon glass making during his student days . He was hooked . I like the mental focus and physical coordination needed , he explains . Glass is fluent , and contrary to what many people think , you can not really control it , but rather only make suggestions with your hands and tools towards the shape you are striving for. It seems he must be very good at making suggestions . This becomes clear if you look at the level of precision exhibited in all his pieces for example , the perfect fit of the cups and bottles for the Wallpaper* Handmade whisky set , or the lids for his coffee bean and rice jars . <p> Ivy had a clear idea of what he wanted to do from the very beginning . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , referring to the Japanese spirit , and had wanted to work on a version for whisky for a long time . This was the perfect excuse to do so. Our initial idea was to have him make a bottle and glass set and use granite ice cubes to cool the dram . However , through his research , Ivy learned that such stones werent the best solution for anyone serious about whisky . Instead , he came up with the idea of using custom-made copper weights to cool the drink . When considering which materials to use , I thought of the process of how whisky is made , he explains . The copper stills used during distillation led him to the idea . Copper has the added benefit of being an excellent thermal conductor and matches perfectly with the copper-coated steel wire mechanism Ivy settled upon to hold the bottle and glass , or glasses , together . <p> Rather than theorise a design , Ivy likes to get right down to it and work on the idea to find the perfect shape .

Once he had decided on the general form , it was just a matter of perfecting each element . <p> Ivy worked on two versions , a one-glass and a two-glass set . In the first , the glass sits snugly over the top of the whisky bottle , while in the second , the bottle appears to float mid-air between two glasses by way of a small fold in the middle of the bottle , which rests on the edge of the bottom glass . These pieces are all made from recycled glass reclaimed from fluorescent tubes . Ivy likes this low-grade , hard-to-use material , because of the textural quality that the many small imperfections ( bobbles , unevenness ) give to his final product . He made grooves in the bases of each glass to accommodate the simple , almost flimsy , wire mechanism with a small bamboo handle that holds them together with the bottle . <p> To cool the whisky , Ivy had a friend mill two copper weights , which are presented in a small carrying box made of Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Jack marks ( lines left from the tool used to open the glass ) circumvent the top 2cm or so of the glass and are deliberately not smoothed out , remaining as clues as to how the set was made .

Victoria Sambunaris : My process begins with an unmitigated curiosity inspired by a piece of literature , an article , an image or a conversation having to do with industry , culture , history , anthropology , geology and ecology . Once I depart from New York , I spend between three and seven months on the road pursuing an idea in the form of a landscape which reveals something to me about landscape and our existence within it .

I do research , however , there is spontaneity in the work once I am on the road . There are expectations about what I think I want but sometimes those expectations are not met and I find something else . Occasionally one thing leads to another , someone sends me in a new direction or I discover something I did n't know exists . But when finally I do find it and shoot it , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel very transient and fragile . Do you feel your work is a historic record as much as it is about the art of composition and printing ? I am not setting out to make a historical record . However , the fact that the world is constantly changing means the work inevitably becomes a historical record . There are towns that I return to five years later and nothing is familiar - maybe a mine has reopened or an industry has left and the place transforms . This keeps me interested in coming back for more . <p> We get a strong sense of place from these images , but not so much an idea of your journey . We were especially interested in the juxtaposition of your photographs with found ephemera from your travels . How do you feel these support the photographs and their interpretation ?

The ephemera adds a layer to the work in revealing the experience of life on the road . On a side note , I take every opportunity to stop at geology and historical museums to learn about the places where I am working . <p> Which landscape photographers ( and other artists , in any genre ) do you admire ? Do you feel your work is a continuation of a long-standing tradition ? The photographers who have inspired me the most are the ones whose work has been about the land and people - many of them making a life for themselves on the road . I call them ' road warriors ' , starting with the US Geological Survey photographers in the late 1800s and the Farm Security Administration photographers in the 1930s . <p> As for other artists , in the car I always carry an abundance of books and literature that reference the places I am working .

Books such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Bowden and The Devil 's Highway by Luis Alberto Urrea when I am working the US/Mexico border . <p> As far as people outside of photography and literature , I am inspired by many .

The exhibition covers a century of performance art from the theatrical experiments of Kazimir Malevich and Vsevolod Meyerhold to the protest works of Pussy Riot . <p> ' Exhibitions of performance art are often monotonous and dull , with endless descriptions of the projects and low quality photographs , ' says Sasha Obukhova , fellow curator of the show and head of the research department of Garage Museum . ' We aimed to make sort of a quest , so that even people who do n't  care about details of history would get involved . ' <p> That quest starts in 1913 , when Russian Futurists painted their faces and went onto the streets of Moscow to ' slap public taste in the face ' and ends with Pussy Riots performative protest at the policies of Russian president , Vladimir Putin . <p> Between these two tension points lies 100 years of the history of Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete examination of this art form in this country : featuring the works of more than 150 artists , including the seminal Collective Actions group , created in 1970s but active for over two decades , the 1990s aggressive actionism of Oleg Kulik , Anatoly Osmolovsky , Alexander Brener , and their contemporary followers like the Voina group and Petr Pavlensky . <p> The curators have smartly created 12 thematic paths through the show , from ' slogan ' and ' sound ' to ' city ' and ' interactive object ' . They are also encouraging visitors to try their hand at performance art , a tactic that may be the most revolutionary gesture in Russias contemporary exhibition practice . <p> ' Performance is the most provocative and radical art form , its history is a series of scandals and conflicts , ' says co-curator Yulia Aksenova of the show . ' It is always a test of the limits of what is permitted both in art and society . ' <p> We spoke to co-curator Sasha Obukhova to find out more ... <p> Wallpaper* : It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the history of performance art , what makes this one special ? Sasha Obukhova : Most of the previous projects were about Western experience and actual performance practices . We decided to consider the Russian history of this art form . It is also concurrent with the centenary of the first Futurist theater performances . Russian avant-garde artists revolutionised theater and drove it beyond its limits . They drew two vectors one directed from life to art , another from art into life and on the junction , performance emerged as the new art form . <p> Is there anything uniquely Russian in Russian performance art ? We found how the so called eternal ' Russian questions ' the relationship to utopia , reality and future are reflected in the Russian performance . The Russian tradition of performance is also more inclined to an act or deed , rather than performative mastery . The second characteristic feature of Russian performance is an almost absolute neglect of corporeality or body language . With rare exception , Russian performances are bodiless and asexual , which you can see in the legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was an outburst of actionism in Russian art in the 1990s . That decade is associated with aggressive actions by Anatoly Osmolovsky , Oleg Kulik , Alexander Brener and others . While in the 2000s , artists seemed to loose interest in performance . Why do you think this is ? For many reasons , but especially the growth of the art market . In Russia performance as well as readymade and album art and diary graphics has never been considered an academic . In other words : easily capitalised tradition . So the dominant positions were taken by more commercial kinds of art , like painting , installation , designer objects and such . <p> In contemporary Russia performance is the art of conflict . If we talk about performance today , we have to talk about Pussy Riot or Petr Pavlensky with their politically driven actions . But you are actually doing a museumification of the protest gesture . What the government brings to criminal court , you place into history ... We ca n't simply ignore the actions that are subject of public and art-critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them within the exhibition . Not that we encountered any ideological pressure from the authorities , but strangely we faced obstruction from the artists themselves . <p> This exhibition is made by the Garage Research department , based on the archive of contemporary art that you 've collected for 20 years . Some time ago this archive became part of the museum and the foundation for the Research department , library and videotheque . What are your objectives today ? The Research department is not only about collecting and archiving information on the history of contemporary Russian art . It is even more about active propagation and education through exhibitions , publications and other forms of professional activity . And ultimately , to show the world that Russia still owns the energy of post-avant-garde experiment . Performance is action , and as it was written in the manifest of the seminal 1990s actionist group Expropriation of the Art Territory - ' action is revolution ' . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

@@40481659 @481659/ <p> Deeply engrained within the broader movement of conceptualism , the ephemeral phenomenon of Mono-ha was concerned with the relationship between the industrial and the natural , as exemplified by this rock pierced by a neon tube , by Tatsuo Kawaguchi <p> Other overarching ideas and concerns for Mono-ha included the fear of rapid modernisation , entailing a sense of alienation . The series of photographs portrays precisely this : a sense of nostalgia and detachment from the physical world <p> The show moreover focuses on what surrounds the movement of Mono-ha and the contextual history supporting it . In this perspective , artworks from the 70s as well as more contemporary pieces are featured , in an effort to demonstrate the historical and artistic evolution which took place after the 70s , but also the diverging paths which were independently undertaken by the four artists <p> Koji Enokura 's stained curtain attached to the wall metaphorically represents the tendency to place barriers between man and matter . It evokes tension and frustration , further developing the sense of alienation he had worked on with his photographs <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exacerbated here , as the materials used to fill the canvas are not the traditional paint or pastel but rather rope and polyurethane <p> ' Fallen Wing - Headless Scenery , ' achieved in 2015 by Noboru Takayama , is perhaps the most evocative piece of the show . Its wooden composition and elongated shape reminds of the Japanese wood railway ties which evoke , in turn , the tragic collective memory of soot-stained casualties <p> In 1965 the artist Tatsuo Kawaguchi brought together nine artists to dig a hole by the Nagara River in Kobe , Japan . ' Hole ' was one of the first ' happenings ' in the Far East and one of only six works by the collaborative group that called itself ' i ' . By the end of the performance , the group would fill the hole back up making it indistinguishable from its earlier state . The process was key , the work ephemeral , leaving only a memory in the mind of the viewers - not that there were many . <p> Kawaguchi went on to become a proto-figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history lasting only three years . Because Mono-ha constituted only a brief flash of productivity , from 1968 to 1971 , the London gallerist Simon Lee has called in works from five decades surrounding it , illustrating the movement 's origins and influence . This he 's done with input from Taka Ishi Gallery in Tokyo . <p> Only four artists appear in ' Five Decades : Sculpture and Works on Paper ' , but they offer a decent primer on the School of Things , as the name translates . Each in his own way , the figures depict a fraught period in the country 's history , post-Hiroshima , pre-boom , during a time of rapid urbanisation and alienation from traditional forms of art , culture and domesticity . <p> Kawaguchi encapsulates the legacy of Mono-ha with works that investigates modern materials that escape their brutal purpose .

His layers of rusted iron ( ' Untitled ' , 2003 ) display the effects of weather on a precise , machine-cut block . <p> Noboru Takayama , who arrived at the Mayfair gallery this week to help with the installation , shows the latest and most affecting work . ' Fallen Wing - Headless Scenery ' ( 2015 ) encompasses 25 wood railway ties stained with creosote and piled in a pick-up sticks formation . They recall the soot-stained casualties of the Japanese railway but also allude to the bodies the artist witnessed being pulled from a collapsed mine in his youth . Suitably buried in the basement gallery , they are requiems for the sacrificial human pillars of Japanese modernisation and perhaps a lament for the ever-distant ' i ' . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

It was a landmark project , the first time most of these rooms had ever been seen by the general public . <p> In the spring of 2009 , with the world already in the grip of financial crisis , the Dutch-born , New York-based artist decided to take another look at Europe 's economic landscape through its boardrooms , and to see how boardroom design , revenue and employee numbers in Europe 's upper corporate echelons had changed . <p> ' The Table of Power 2 ' , Hassink 's fourth project with creative director Irma Boom , is an intriguing study of power from an altogether unexpected perspective that provides a rare glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to Hassink about her work . <p> There were many hurdles to overcome , but I think because of the internet and mobile devices , our boundaries of private and public spaces have changed , which means it 's easier to access people in the corporate world .

One could say that that is a masculine way of thinking . <p> What was the goal of the Laboratory section of the book ? Was it simply an interesting compilation of figures or ranking of corporations by country , or were you trying to see if there was some kind of connection with the boardroom ? <p> The idea of the Laboratory section was a logical step . Travelling around photographing these rooms , I found I wanted to know the facts about the changes in the European corporate landscape . In New York , I worked with three research assistants collecting data from issues of Fortune magazine published over the past 15 years .

And on how many continents and in how many countries and territories did the top 10 European corporations on Fortune 's Global 500 have operations over the 15 years since the first ' Table of Power ' ? We ended up creating 15 maps . <p> What surprised you the most about the numbers/rankings ? <p> The huge increase in volume and the stagnation in growth around the crisis .

The Serpentine 's latest stab at making art accessible to all is an inspiring collection of wallpapers . Made up of 13 patterns , mainly produced specifically for the project , by seven artists and architects , the inaugural collection brings the long tradition of artists creating wallpapers bang up to date . <p> Under the fine curatorial eye of Julia Peyton-Jones and Hans Ulrich Obrist , co-directors of the Serpentine Galleries , the Maharam Serpentine Galleries wallpaper collection includes previously unseen work from artists such as John Baldessari , Marc Camille Chaimowicz , Rosemarie Trockel , Lawrence Weiner and Ai Weiwei , as well as architects Toyo Ito and SANAA , as featured in our June 2015 issue ( W*195 ) . <p> ' Wallpaper is something many artists and architects have been interested in , ' explains Obrist , who visited artists such as Beatriz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his early research of the idea . <p> ' We found it interesting that this partnership with Maharam could be an exhibition of wallpapers that might be seen in houses all over the world and would actually lead to a dissemination . ' ' It is possible for all of us to commission architects , designers and indeed artists , to do something specifically for us , ' Peyton-Jones says . ' However , having wallpaper that you can buy by the roll , to cover a wall , a room , or a whole house or apartment , means that you can be your own curator in your own home . ' <p> The collection 's vibrant patterns range from the abstract to the photorealistic , and are all realised using the fine-art grade , digital printing techniques that Maharam has finessed since launching its Maharam Digital Projects arm in 2009 . Each artist 's design is printed with UV-resistant inks onto a latex- reinforced substrate .

While the choice to include designs from SANAA and Toyo Ito might seem an unusual turn , the architects ' involvement highlights the increasing cross-pollination between art , design and architecture , which the Serpentine Galleries has long pioneered . <p> Everyone involved in the collection was given creative carte blanche . Maharam provided only technical guidance to ensure a distinguishable pattern was created .

' <p> Cappello 's new ' Streetscape ' collection of public benches , bike racks , litter bins , planters and bollards is the result of an open brief set by the university gallery as part of its annual Design Fellowship . Rather than wanting to invent anything totally new , the ECAL- and RCA-educated designer set upon improving this typically anonymous and often overlooked area of design .

' A little bit of generosity needs to come back into the design of our cities , ' warns Cappello , ' or else we 're going to end up with such blunt and tasteless environments . ' <p> Another important aspect for Cappello was that the pieces are , where possible , made in London , ' It was really important - being able to have that control , being able to produce without any shipments and to support local industry is priceless .

' Loneliness and solitude are not often depicted nowadays , ' says Elmgreen . ' There 's too much culture today that tries to please its audience .

@@40481698 @481698/ <h> Design Awards 2015 : best of the rest <p> Raf Simons ' polymath credentials are well established but nowhere better illustrated than in his ongoing collaborations with the textile specialist Kvadrat . Simons first turned to Kvadrat while still design chief at Jil Sander , cutting and shaping its textiles into catwalk-friendly forms . Kvadrat in turn asked the Belgian designer to create a collection of furniture fabrics . Launched earlier this year , the collection includes sculptural fabrics in mohair , polyester , cashmere and wool , as well as home accessories such as throws and cushions . And as a confirmation of the fabrics ' versatility , swatches of Simons ' Kvadrat effort were used in the A/W14 collection , created in collaboration with US artist Sterling Ruby . <p> When it comes to sourcing unique raw materials , jeweller Monique PTan always digs deep . In fact , the New Yorkers procurement process is akin to an archaeological expedition , given that her petrified creations star an avant-garde offering of fossilised woolly mammoth and walrus ivory , along with agatised dinosaur bone . Since 2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigenous Alaskans in the Arctic Circle to gather ivory fossils , which are the result of 10,000 years of mineralisation . When ice in this region melts and shifts , the fossils rise to the surface and are collected by PTans community of fossickers . The designer sets these one-of-a-kind organic forms with 18ct recycled gold and ethically sourced or repurposed diamonds . <p> The name of this Barcelona-based lighting company was inspired by a visit to Parachilna , a remote settlement north of Adelaide . We ca n't see the link between high-end lights and the Australian outback either , but at least the brand 's intentions are clear . ' Parachilna was born from our love of luxury , ' says its team . ' For us , luxury is about the quality of the materials and the craftsmanship that creates it . ' Stephen Burks ' ' Anwar ' lamps , made from welded steel rods , have been followed by collections by Jaime Hayon and Jordi Veciana using hand-blown glass , ceramic and metal . We think it 's a bright start . <p> Best Smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated pavilion <p> Having a dedicated space for each favourite activity is a hallmark of luxury - think a library , a games room , a spa . Commissioned by a private client for a Zurich townhouse , this smoking pavilion is a worthy addition . Designed by London-based architect Gianni Botsford , it allows the owners to admire the garden while enjoying a postprandial puf and without affecting other residents . Botsford was drafted in by landscape architect Todd Longstaffe-Gowan . ' Our idea was to create a simple structure possessing a richness and complexity in its materiality that would develop relationships with the surroundings , ' Botsford says . The first self-supporting translucent concrete building made from engineered precast panels , it seems solid yet light . Altogether as smooth and striking as the Philipp Plein suit we chose to spark up in . <p> Space may be the final frontier , but a group of adventurous designers has been boldly going where few designers have gone before , with some rather stellar results . Germany 's Jan Kath started the space race by taking images from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did no one think of that before ? ) , while his fellow countrywoman Elisa Strozyk has been turning her tables to give them an uncanny resemblance to pictures of Earth from space . Not to be outdone , Diesel Living has collaborated with Seletti on a dinner service called ' Cosmic Diner ' , with designs based on the solar system - a planetary theme shared by Milan-based Dimore Studio 's cast-resin ' Lampada 061 ' . And for Minotti , Rodolfo Dordoni all but eclipses the competition with a circular metal tabletop that orbits 360 degrees over its elliptical ebony base . We have blast-off ! <p> We can accept a unisex scent or two , and skincare technology works whatever the gender , but with men 's faces having gone in an unwaveringly bristly direction of late , there 's less room for product sharing . We 've gathered the best recent launches to tame and tidy , from a sweetly scented beard oil from the studiedly stubbly Tom Ford to a fine new fragrance from Guerlain , its bitter almond note balanced with unmistakably masculine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bergamot . As for the perfect male groom room , ours shapes up nicely with Doshi Levien 's mix-and-match geometric mirrors for Hay , and Jean Louis Iratzoki 's elegant shelves for Retegui , our pick from the Basque marble company 's first foray into furnishings . <p> For his S/S15 menswear show for Burberry Prorsum , Christopher Bailey referenced the literary spirit of 20th-century English writer and adventurer Bruce Chatwin . Illustrated graphics , scribbled across wanderers ' satchels , trenches and leather-bound sketchbooks , were inspired by vintage travel-book typography and watercolours uncovered in flea markets . Classic English hardback covers similarly frame travellers ' scarves and tees , featuring titles such as British Birds of Prey and The History of English Tailoring . The designs were hand-painted at Burberry 's London studio and printed for Bailey 's spring offering in Italy . Wherever your travels take you , these bookish pieces should give you something to write home about . <p> Best Boardroom A racetrack-style table shows thoroughbred form , while a birch swivel chair has us in a spin <p> Executive suites should be dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the decorative equivalent of a downmarket suit with a low wool content . So Jasper Morrison 's ' Arena ' table for Marsotto Edizioni was a welcome launch last year . Showcasing the company 's winning way with Carrara marble , the modular system features slim worktops supported by sturdy tapered columns , and can be configured to fit boardrooms from the modest to the megalomaniac . We 've teamed it with Artek 's ' Rival ' chair , Konstantin Grcic 's first design for the brand . With laminated birch arms and back , and solid birch legs , it has a classic Finnish feel , but Grcic , our joint Designer of the Year , has added a touch of playfulness by hiding a swivel function under the circular seat . <p> Some people may use their office only to work in , but we like to have the option of kicking back after a bit of hard graft . So we were pleased to come across Doshi Levien 's ' Almora ' armchair and footstool for B&amp;B Italia , with a merino-wool headrest that designer Nipa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while being wrapped in a soft , warm blanket ' . Still , no office would be complete without a desk , and among the niftiest new models is Rodolfo Dordoni 's executive furniture system for Poltrona Frau , with a concealed wiring system and oak-and- leather surfaces . Bathe everything in a gentle glow with Joan Gaspar 's clever ' Ginger ' lamp for Marset , which fuses layers of wood and paper to create an ultra-lightweight shade . <p> Denim is proving a surprising ally in the push towards sustainability , with fashion and furniture projects cleverly devising new and environmentally friendly ways of dealing with the material . London-based design pair Matteo Fogale and Laetitia de Allegri launched -Ish , a collection made of Denimite , a marble-like material created from post-industrial denim scrap ; another version of the material , called Marblus , is made from scraps of cotton taken from discarded sheets and clothing . Lightweight , mouldable and extremely resistant , they give a new face to recycled materials . Also concerned with denim and the preservation of the environment , G-Star Raw enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textiles . His designs , developed in collaboration with Aitor Throup acting as creative consultant , transform plastic collected from the ocean into a ' Bionic Yarn ' that is used in jackets , jeans and accessories . <p> It 's not often the design of a comb piques our interest , but this series of hair tools reeled us in . There 's more than simply the elegance of their forms to admire ; the material story is equally compelling . The combs are part of a collection called ' Hair Highway ' , designed by London-based Studio Swine for Pearl Lam Galleries . It 's the culmination of a material research project in which the design duo considered the seemingly disparate facts that China is the largest importer of hardwoods and the largest exporter of human hair . They decided to seek some balance , finding a way for China to reduce its reliance on diminishing resources . Their invention is a composite made from Asian hair and resin that mimics the tones of tortoiseshell and the grains of polished horn or exotic hardwoods . The synchronicity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the project all the sweeter . <p> The first sight of Ilse Crawford 's polished brass and oak cocktail cabinet inspired us to find a snug corner , install it , pull up a chair and create our own whisky den . Our chair is the ' Metropolitan ' , by Ejner Larsen and Aksel Bender Madsen , recently reissued by Carl Hansen in cocooning oak and leather , while our crystal is a collaboration between J Hill 's Standard and Martino Gamper . The most essential ingredient , though , is the Scotch from the cellars of Glenmorangie . Pride 78 is a newly released single malt with marzipan , wood and tobacco notes . Its rareness is celebrated with a Laurence Brabant decanter bottle . The supporting artists are a peaty Caol Ila 30 and a spicy Balvenie . The scene is set . <p> Best Brand ExtensionVipp 's new prefab steel shelter is the perfect place to showcase its classic homeware <p> A prefabricated steel shelter is not the most obvious new design for a company whose signature product is a pedal bin , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Danish homeware manufacturer , renowned for its bin designed in 1939 by Holger Nielsen , has now launched the Vipp Shelter , ' a battery-charging station for humans , ' as the brand 's MD Kasper Egelund affectionately describes it . Egelund worked closely with Vipp chief designer Morten Bo Jensen to create a structure that follows Vipp 's adherence to Dieter Rams ' motto of ' less but better ' . It 's all about ' going back to nature with basic functions defining a dense , compact space with a clear aesthetic , ' says Jensen . The prefabricated shelter , which can be installed anywhere , is inspired by the design of airplanes , submarines and ferries . The 55 sq m steel-grid structure boasts a large living area and kitchen with a corner fireplace and sliding glass doors , a bathroom and a loft bedroom . It comes equipped with a full range of Vipp products , including the lighting , kitchen accessories and bed linen . <p> Lighting up French maison Lancel 's spring offering is a new series of metallic evening accoutrements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed by Albert Lancel - son of founders AngFle and Alphonse Lancel - in 1932 . The said fame-bearer , which features a working clock face , won the Frenchman a Grand Prix at the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in Paris . After being reacquired recently by the house at auction , the lighter 's graphic guillochT print has been hand-stamped onto this season 's metallic leather clutch and engraved into a handsome metal minaudiFre . <p> Some beds are made for extended stays . Walter Knoll 's ' Jaan ' bed by Eoos , part of the manufacturer 's first foray beyond seating into sleeping , is one such cocoon . So holing up with Baxter 's new night table by Draga &amp; Aurel by our side , CTO Lighting 's ' Acropolis ' lamp illuminating our reading matter and B&amp;O Play 's new Bluetooth speaker providing the sounds , we thought we 'd bring to the slumber party a breakfast fit for a king . Served on Mattia Fossati 's ' Ics ' table is perfectly proportioned toast , made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , topped with morning-changing Negroni marmalade by Melbourne 's newest gin distiller Four Pillars . The juice , cold-pressed by Toronto 's Greenhouse Juice Company , blends orange , grapefruit , lemon and liquid cayenne pepper . We 've got our finger on the snooze button . <p> The long and short of sight have been sporting horn-rimmed specs since the 16th century . However , most opticians have long since abandoned actual horn in favour of more easily tamed replica materials . Three years ago , Danish spectacle maker Lindberg , always up for a challenge , took on the task of bending , or rather , unbending genuine horn to its will and minimalist aesthetic . The company uses specially treated laminated strips of buffalo horn , bonded with its secret recipe glue . And , in the latest collection , Lindberg has matched it with a titanium nose bridge , temples and hinges to create specs that offer horn 's unique glow and colouration but with unprecedented lightness , sleekness and comfort . Proper horny . <p> Pictured : glasses , from 720 , by Lindberg Horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Best Hotel Amenities Who 's awash with style <p> With lofty standards for our own toiletries , we felt it was time to commend the hotels also getting them right . New favourite is New York Park Hyatt 's collaboration with Le Labo , which has created a range in its Tubereuse scent , inspired by the city . Milan 's Armani Hotel produces its own offerings : generous-sized bottles are accompanied by an amber soap and black Q-tips . And at Kyoto 's Nine Hours capsule hotel , creative director Fumie Shibata ensured the coherent design of amenities in a collaboration with Tamanohada , known for its fig-scented products . <p> Hiroshi Nakamura understands the contribution architecture can make to truly memorable nuptials . His latest project , the striking , upward-swirling form that is the Ribbon Chapel in Onomichi , Hiroshima Prefecture , is a wedding venue located halfway up a hill in the lush garden of a resort hotel . With two mutually supporting , spiralling staircases that come together at the top , Nakamura 's architectural concept nods to the joining of two individual paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the traditional Japanese notion of akai ito , or ' red string ' , that invisibly links two soulmates . Unlike a traditional building , this chapel 's ' ribbons ' twist and turn to become its roof and eaves , walls and floors . The bride and groom each walk up their own separate staircase , so that they remain hidden from each other until they meet at the top , while guests observe this part of the occasion from the garden below . While the architect 's design is the perfect setting for a wedding ceremony , he did n't intend the chapel to serve only that purpose . It can also be used for concerts and private parties , or even turned into a restaurant , says Nakamura . ' It 's a simple building composed of paths , along which sceneries of ocean , mountain , sky and distant islands successively appear and disappear . ' It certainly marries form with fantasy . <p> Besides seasonal colour trends , fashions in beauty move slowly . Not changing fast this year is a tendency towards complexions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips that are natural or matt . But we 've also fallen for the stand- out colour trend of the year . Blue , from royal to aqua , smudged , winged or flashed in a bright line across the top of the eyelid , is back after a 30-year hiatus , and it 's looking fresh . Here are the best tools to achieve the year 's fashionable face . <p> Occasionally , furniture design veers away from solid certainty and adopts a more illusive bent . Flitting between illusion and confusion , design duo Raw-Edges devised a series of rugs that can appear either vivid or calm , depending on the viewer 's orientation . Equally playful is +ric Chevallier 's collection of apparently ' floating ' seats , each one identified by a different shade of green and angle of inclination . Nodding to nature 's optical artfulness , meanwhile , Jean-Baptiste Fastrez was inspired by the iridescent shell of a beetle to create his eye-boggling vase . <p> As part of its ongoing reinvention , Spanish luxury brand Loewe recently unveiled a fresh identity developed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . ' Past , Present and Future ' is the mantra guiding the house 's creative renaissance , and the new look nods to both its heritage and its contemporary vision . The original logotype has been redesigned in a typeface inspired by the work of German-born typographer and calligrapher Berthold Wolpe , while the brand 's motif ( informally known as el cangrejo , or ' the crab ' ) , designed in 1970 by artist Vicente Vela , was reimagined following a study of traditional cattle-branding practices . Redrawn with characteristic M/M ( Paris ) finesse , the new , streamlined monogram is a faithful adaptation of Vela 's work , all done with a light touch . <p> Pictured : Contrasting with a 1940s logo ( top right ) , loewes latest identity includes a redrawn Crab motif ( centre ) and logo ( bottom ) . The motif is seen here embossed on a large pouch , 425 , and coin purses , 150 each <p> Photography : Kate Jackling ; Writer : Rosa Bertoli <p> Best Office Accessories Small wonders and a bright idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , but we 're especially tempted by its Argent de Poche collection of sterling-silver , pocket-sized products . Designed by Pauline Deltour , it riffs on the interplay between circles and squares , between grooved and mirror-polished surfaces , in a contemporary take on the art deco aesthetic of the company 's founder Jean Puiforcat . Equally pared down , but in an entirely different mode , Jean Nouvel 's ' Equilibrist ' lamp for Artemide is his interpretation of a ' high-tech traffic light ' . Two lights - one square , the other circular - rotate around a vertical axis . The perfect desktop distraction . <p> Chef Shinobu Namae , of Tokyo 's L'Effervescence , has created another must-try eatery in the city , La Bonne Table . While the basic premise is informal French ( Namae has worked with Michel Bras ) , Namae 's fondness for New Nordic cuisine is seen in his use of local produce and the Scandinavian-inspired interior . Vegetables , from Etsuo Asano 's farm in Chiba , are given deserved attention , while Namae 's stint as The Fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pictured : Shinobu Namae won Wallpaper* over with this plate of lightly grilled mackerel with Saikyo miso-and-sorrel sauce , served with black olive earth , turnip and propagules of Japanese mountain yam . <p> Just as we were starting to feel jaded by the notion of gourmet ice cream , New York parlour Morgenstern 's , opened last year by chef Nick Morgenstern , had our taste buds tingling all over again . What sets it apart is its succinct yet adventurous menu . Classic vanillas , chocolates and coffees ( several varieties of each ) jostle with experimental favours like salt and pepper pine nut , and banana curry , and there 's an array of sundaes and collaborative limited-edition favours to boot . <p> Wallpaper* is particularly alert to displays of geometric rigour . So we were drawn to Minimalux 's first foray into furnishings , which includes this precisely composed bookshelf made of 33 interlocking metal bars . Milanese architect Vincenzo De Cotiis took the graphic theme a step further with his ' DC1406 ' lamp , which at first glance may seem like a random composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gridded metal panels . Scholten &amp; Baijings ' table collection saw the duo 's signature graphic patterns subtly engraved on Carrara marble . Meanwhile , Stefan Diez 's chair for Emu and Claesson Koivisto Rune 's wallpaper offer a classic interpretation of the geometric theme in 3D and 2D respectively . <p> Best Neoclassical This year 's new classics are keepers that combine rigour , lightness and timeless good looks <p> Piero Lissonis sofa is a well-executed combination of clean lines and traditional shapes . Its wide seat and classic details make it a masterpiece of design and comfort . This collection of wooden panelling and panelled doors by Robert AM Stern Architects for Italian brand Lualdi features unconventional proportions . Meanwhile , Belgian designer Michadl Verheydens elegant side table consists of bronze legs and a locally sourced marble top ; its size and height can be customised . A low cabinet by Antonio Citterio is an exercise in discretion . The mahogany piece is balanced on aluminium legs and conceals three wide drawers within . <p> Sustainability is now a key driver of material innovation . And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Marmoreal ' , an engineered multicoloured marble devised by designer Max Lamb for Dzek . The marble is built to be suitable for flooring and wall covering , but can also be used to construct furniture . Similarly , Swiss design duo StTphane Halman-Voisard and Philippe-Albert Lefebvre , aka Terrazzo Project , have just released ' TP-Panels ' , taking cues from Italian terrazzo floors . Although aesthetically faithful to the original , their panels are made of resin , cement and stone cast onto corrugated aluminium sheets and , in a significant update of a classic , they are stain-proof , UV stable and suitable for both indoor and outdoor use . <p> For ' Salinas ' , her first kitchen , Spanish designer Patricia Urquiola went back to her roots . ' Salinas is the beach of my childhood , ' she says . ' A long sandy beach along the Bay of Biscay , with huge crashing waves and intense colours . The kitchen in my grandfather 's house , which commanded a view of that beach , brings back fond memories . ' A mix-and-match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be assembled in single materials or colours , or in any combination of the materials and colours available for each element . Dekton , ceramic and decorated lava stone are among the worktop selection , while door choices include PaperStone ( made from 100 per cent recyclable material ) , wood and concrete . <p> We are less than an hour out of Adelaide , where the foothills that ring the city meet the coast and the suburban streets come to an abrupt end as they hit a wall of dark , glacial rock . At this intersection , on a site overlooking the vast Gulf St Vincent , stand the home and new studio of Max Pritchard , one of Australia 's most interesting architects . Some 25 years separate the completion of the house , a linear steel-framed glass box perched on steel pilotis , and the studio , a timber construction that stands amid blue gums and acacias . The studio 's structure is simple yet sculptural : cylindrical , 6m tall , 4m in diameter , and topped with a roof that shades the workspace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ground level is a storage area . Above is a studio lined with bookshelves and fitted with breezy windows that offer views of the sea . The building brings together three key elements of Pritchard 's work : sculptural fair , affordability and expressed structure . ' The radiating battens on the ceiling reflect the building . You 're seeing the whole structure , ' he says . ' I like circles , the pure form , ' he adds . ' It suits the function of a simple , contained office . But then a lot of sweat went into it , so I might be biased . ' Biased maybe , but it does work . And the pleasing news is , Pritchard is using his new studio . ' I 've done a few designs there - good ones , ' he says . <p> Photography : Sam Noonan ; Writer : Gordon Knight <p> Best Film Set By Jensen &amp; Skodvin Architects and Mark Digby , as seen in Ex Machina , directed by Alex Garland <p> In Ex Machina , the fabulous new artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author and screenwriter behind films such as Sunshine and 28 Days Later , thresholds are crossed courtesy of electronic keycards , and internet billionaires have acquired impeccable taste in art , architecture and interior design . The film , almost in its entirety , plays out inside a spectacular cliff-side home with a facade of glass and timber , a precise , modernist intrusion of the man-made into nature , somewhere in the wilderness of Alaska . The house belongs to Nathan ( played by Oscar Isaac ) , the billionaire CEO of ' the world 's biggest internet company ' , who likes vodka , Jackson Pollock , tinkering with AI , and sushi made by Kyoko ( Sonoya Mizuno ) , his seductive Japanese housekeeper . In reality , the house is not a single residence , but a cinematic synthesis of a set built at Pinewood Studios , near London , the Juvet Landscape Hotel and a privately owned summer house , both located not in Alaska but in north-western Norway , and designed by Oslo-based Jensen &amp; Skodvin Architects . Inside the house , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been built around it , jagged panes of glass disappearing into its surface , separating the exterior from the interior . Upstairs , endless windows offer exquisite views onto the surrounding woodlands , creating an expansive space . In contrast , a concrete-heavy subterranean level reveals one low-lit , isolated room after the next . The interiors throughout the house are muted if not somewhat anonymous , revealing a version of tomorrow that is foreboding , but stylish . Ex-Machina is released on 23 January in the UK . <p> Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad has a habit of putting his name on the many cultural buildings he commissions . Recent examples include the Broad Contemporary Art Museum at LACMA and the Broad Stage in Santa Monica . But one building is so close to this art-collecting billionaire 's heart that he is simply calling it The Broad . Designed by acclaimed New York architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro ( DS+R ) , the 120,000 sq ft , $140m museum also happens to be one of LA 's most anticipated new buildings . Set to contain almost 2,000 contemporary art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its final stages , with an opening scheduled for this autumn . The Broad appears dizzyingly complex , with its intricate fatade , but it is based on a simple construct . The Vault is the heart of the museum and contains art storage and conservation facilities , while the Veil is a three-dimensional structure made up of hundreds of honeycomb-shaped openings that cover the roof and flow over the glass fatade , touching down on the pavements . Every other element of the museum ( with the exception of an adjacent 24,000 sq ft public plaza ) stems from those two starting points . The lobby , which opens to Grand Avenue via two exposed corners behind the Veil , appears almost cave-like , shaped around the underside of the Vault , with curves meant to create a sharp contrast to the highly angular exterior . Wandering around the lobby , glimpses can be caught through the tunnelled escalator into the piFce de rTsistance , the building 's 35,000 sq ft third floor galleries , which feature 23ft tall ceilings and no columns . The roof is instead held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the viewer 's perspective . And thanks to hundreds of angled skylights , the space changes its mood dramatically as daylight transitions . <p> Pictured : a view of The Broad , still covered in scaffolding , at the junction of Grand Avenue and Second in Downtown Los Angeles . <p> Stretched over a million square metres , the building sites for Expo Milano 2015 deserve accolades , at the very least , for their mammoth dimensions . From May , the Expo will host more than 140 countries for a six month period , during which a frenzy of activity will centre on the theme of ' Feeding the Planet , Energy for Life ' . Among the national pavilions , there will also be thematic areas dedicated to core Expo issues , including Pavilion Zero , by architect Michele De Lucchi , which is set to make a striking impact at the fair entrance . It appears now as a maze of steel bars , but will eventually be covered in stepped strips of fIr and oak . The concept centres around the idea of a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake to the slow build-up of the earth 's strata . Explaining his valley of crispy-skinned , cave-like dwellings , De Lucchi says , ' I was enchanted by this idea of the inner earth . We 're constantly looking at our trees , mountains and skies , but rarely think about what 's underfoot . ' When the Expo closes in October , Pavilion Zero will be dismantled and recycled , a fate that does not worry the architect . ' The great message of this Expo is that the world needs to be adjusted to our future , ' he says . ' We ca n't continue to fill the world up . I 'm happy to give a good example of designing something that will go back to nature .

Smiling sagely with paternal pride , the retired Italian couturier , who was in London yesterday for the preview of a major new exhibition of his life and work , was referring to the treasury of over 130 couture creations that are currently installed in Somerset House 's Embankment Galleries . Opening today , the intimate showcase of fifty years of haute couture by Valentino is supported with the likes of personal photographs and film , giving viewers a behind the scenes glimpse into the atelier , revealing the intricate couture techniques involved in creating the hand-crafted looks that have dressed everyone from Grace Kelly to Anne Hathaway . The real bones of the matter , of course , are the couture designs , including those commissioned by private clients ( many which have never been see outside the Valentino atelier ) . - Exhibition curators and long time Valentino collaborators Patrick Kinmonth and Antonio Monfreda ( together known as Kinmonth Monfreda ) have designed the space ; Kinmonth is , among other things , a set and costume designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and art direction . Together they have evoked an inviting manifestation of Valentino 's world . The door of Palazzo Mignanelli , Valentino 's palazzo in Rome , has been rebuilt in the space . And a bespoke couture atelier takes visitors on a trail along a 60m-long central catwalk , surrounded on either side by an ' audience ' of mannequins dressed in the evening gowns , dresses , trouser suits and capes that Valentino has produced since he started his fashion house in Rome in the 1950s . And , as testament to the timelessness of Valentino 's designs , Kinmonth Monfreda have eschewed chronology , instead arranging five decades of couture by the visual connection between the pieces . Nonetheless , the mannequins subtly vary in shade , from mint to parma violet , indicating the decade from which the corresponding dress originated . Mimicking a couture presentation , numbered circles on the wrists of mannequins relate to captions in an accompanying programme .

Unlike those former couture designers , Jan Nehera was a Czechoslovakian entrepreneur renowned for his garment manufacturing in the first half of the 20th century .

Drira , a French stylist and creative consultant who has worked with top tier luxury brands including HermFs , The Row and Christophe Lemaire , is also founder and editor of the Parisian magazine Encens , which portrays and discusses fashion as an art form , operating outside of seasonal trends . <p> Indeed , that 's precisely the tack Drira is taking with Nehera . ' The title of the first collection for S/S 2015 was " Blank Canvas " ; we had to invent everything from scratch , ' he explains . ' We spent two months thinking about the basics ; like " What is a white shirt ? How should the collar be ? The pocket ? The cut ? " I do n't think a designer anymore is someone who just makes a beautiful sketch , that 's a clichT , and that 's what I learnt from the designers I worked with in the past .

Rather than focusing on individual garments , Drira considers the whole silhouette , taking care to position details like trouser pockets in line with vents in an accompanying jacket or shirt . ' The shape of a comma provided the framework the silhouette . The finished look had a very narrow shoulder ; there were elongated jackets with a big slit on the back so you can tie it and keep some volume . ' <p> The benefit of reinvigorating an under-the-radar brand means Drira can design without the shackles of history or an extensive archive . ' It 's not like working for a designer like Yves Saint Laurent , ' he readily admits . But , he is quick to point out , original founder Jan Nehera was a visionary in his own right .

Dating from 1990 to present day , the collection features more than 70 works , ranging from recent acquisitions to large-scale sculptures that were previously never shown because of space restrictions .

A thread of obsession ties all the exhibited works together . In the show , the process of object-making - an act that is intensely pursued by artists with an erotic-level of infatuation - is as important as the object itself . The artists showcased are repeatedly drawn to certain forms , processes and materials with corporeal associations - an aspect that recurs throughout their careers . <p> ' We kept going back to the idea that the fetishised object for many of these artists is linked to the obsessive nature of his or her practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah Wilke 's vaginal repetitive forms that she creates in various permutations or Alina Szapocznikow 's lip-shaped resin lamps , which she made twenty of , there is a compulsion to revisit the object many times .

But the place in his native Vancouver he called home - now under threat unless sufficient funds are raised to ensure its restoration - was a relatively understated abode in a bucolic , residential neighbourhood , where raccoons and sparrows were just as likely to turn up as any grander visitors . <p> A converted garage on a double lot he purchased in 1957 , and transformed into an elegantly executed contemplative space , was really more of an appendage to his rather extraordinary garden . <p> Although his garden parties were legendary , 4195 West 14th Avenue was above all a sanctuary for Erickson , who would return from LA or Baghdad and stay cocooned in his small green paradise , contemplating his next project . <p> Simon Scott , an architectural photographer who worked with Erickson and is a director of the Arthur Erickson Foundation , remembers in the late 1970 's , when Erickson began designing projects in the Middle East , ' Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the simplicity of his home . ' <p> And yet the 90 sq m house and 650 sq m garden are seminal to understanding Erickson 's work ; glimpses of his buildings can be seen at every turn in tiny , micro gestures - a raw concrete leg of a garden bench that recalls a wall at his magnificent Simon Fraser University , or the pond with moon viewing platform that resonates with water elements at the Museum of Anthropology . A chrome-plated , mirror-like post inside his residence brings to mind his steel heavy Eppich house , while tendrils of ferns dripping over a kitchen skylight evoke his use of light and greenery at his Robson Square courthouse . <p> This is where it all began , where his ideas and sketches were born and even where deals were made , performances hatched and celebrations had . Margaret Mead did a reading here , Rudolf Nureyev danced in the garden around a pond filled with black swans , as Erickson and his life partner Francisco Kripacz remained impeccable if eccentric hosts to a moveable feast of artists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , despite Erickson 's iconic status as Canada 's answer to Frank Lloyd Wright ( who inspired a young Erickson 's move from painting to architecture ) , the historic house and garden remain in jeopardy . Unless funding is found for a necessary million-dollar restoration and the mortgage ( paid to a private lender after Erickson was forced into bankruptcy in 1992 and the bank put the property up for sale ) , the large double lot could end up bulldozed and transformed into a lucrative residential development . <p> As Vancouver 's residential real estate prices continue to be amongst the highest in the world , there are new pressures on this small footprint wonderland that housed Canada 's finest modernist . <p> Liz Watts , a landscape architect and board member of the AEF , helped sound the alarm when the Erickson property was put up for sale in 1992 . Watts , who lives a few blocks away , was told by a local estate agent that an intriguing double lot property was on the market . ' When I discovered it was Arthur 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember an agent speaking to a potential buyer on his mobile phone saying " yes of course the trees are a problem but they can all be cleared . " ' <p> Watts galvanized a group of local designers and gradually with national media exposure and the assistance of cultural heavyweights like Phyllis Lambert , current head of the CCA ( Canadian Centre for Architecture ) and chair of the AEF , stopped the house and garden from being sold . <p> But after Erickson 's death in 2009 and a restructuring of the foundation to include his wider legacy , a renewed emphasis has begun on securing national heritage status for 4195 West 14th and on paying off the still onerous mortgage . ' Even with heritage status , there 's still no guarantee of preservation , ' notes Watts . <p> Phyllis Lambert notes that in Montreal , Moshe Safdie 's apartment built for Expo 67 has heritage status , but that British Columbian provincial law is less aggressive about protecting modernist architecture . <p> And while Frank Lloyd Wright 's Taliesin West has become a teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , its value as an historical cultural landscape remains undeniable . Entering the place , hidden by towering cedar hedges , laurel and fir , through an unassuming wooden side gate - is like walking into Erickson 's mind . <p> As you come inside , you notice the little house to the North , its back to the laneway , but the big reveal is the garden . It unfolds with a Japanese sense of amplified space , often unfurling itself in a shape and scale-shifting manner . <p> To make the space feel larger than it was , Erickson used the trick of layered horizontal lines - a common one in Asia where the architect spent much of WWII working for British intelligence and preferring long conversations with Japanese POW 's about Zen to actual interrogations . <p> And the garden - filled with many native plants that Erickson sourced himself from riverbanks and nurseries - exemplifies the concept of wabi sabi , the merging of the rough and the smooth , the wild and the refined . A micro-climate , it features ten different species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and native fir , cedars and arbutus trees , their textures layered against one another to great effect . <p> With the original fussy English garden leveled by the architect , and a berm and pond thick with lily pads and ornamental grasses created , the genius loci of the place is really a kind of clearing in the forest ; a celebration of West Coast wilderness with a Zen sensibility . As you walk along the clockwise circular path , framed views and contemplative spots reveal themselves like small green epiphanies . <p> Inside the tiny house , a kind of wabi sabi is evidenced in the mix of materials : a simple wash of concealed incandescent lighting illuminates living room walls covered in sumptuous beige suede , Thai silk adorns walls sitting on a primitive wood foundation , and in the bathroom a black fiberglass shower stands opposite mahogany cabinets and leather clad walls . Erickson 's tiny bed - a loft accessed via a childlike ladder- overlooks an arboretum that opens up to garden views and sits under a skylight with a silk covered baffle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in this place : ones that should rightly be preserved for Canada 's next generation of architects , and not erased forever in the name of property values . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569

Executives at Singapore Airlines have been known to say ; ' If you stay still you 're essentially moving backwards ' . Wise words , considering the aviation landscape is getting more competitive by the day . The war of the fully-flat beds , luxury in-flight shower rooms and fine dining at 32,000ft is in full throttle as airlines battle it out in the sky , and this week Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) revealed revamped seats in its First , Business and Economy classes in a bid to come out victorious . <p> Rather than a bold , revolutionary overhaul , the airline has taken the gentler , quieter , more evolutionary approach . The business class seat is the cornerstone of SIA 's product range ; it 's currently the widest full-flat seat that money can buy you . Speaking of the seat at the launch , Mak Swee Wah , SIA 's executive vice president of commercial noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've looked at the features , improved the storage , and overall we 've updated the look and feel and aesthetics of it , so that you can have an overall good cabin ambience and travel experience .

It now boasts bold modern metallic accents and high gloss finishes . There are also two added seating modes for lounging - the ' Lazy Z ' and the ' Sundeck ' , taking the recline angle from the existing 125 degrees to 132 degrees . <p> Designed by James Park Associates - the firm responsible for bringing opulence to the interiors of the Orient Express - leather seats now come in a refreshed colour palette of aubergine or taupe , cradled by a contoured silver fixed-back exterior shell .

' What we 've done this time is to take what we know is a good seat , and make it even better . ' <p> Going one above that is first class . It 's still a sector that is going strong for SIA , despite the fact that some other airlines have abandoned that class entirely . Question is , how do you top the drama , sheer luxury and sense of occasion that is the suite - or rather ' personal cabin ' - that the airline launched in 2006 to mark the introduction of its A380 fleet ? ' The suite is quite unique to the A380 because of that particular plane , and the space within it , so that will remain ' , said Mak . ' What we have proposed today is a first class for the rest of the fleet , which is a good product for long-haul and for the aircraft type that we have . ' <p> Thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first class travellers will enjoy seats equipped with an extended curved side panel for added privacy . With rich chocolate leather seats and orange accents on headrests and cushion trimmings , the warm tones of the interior of the space have been deliberately designed in contrast to the cool metallic grey palette of its exterior . Better ambient lighting , more stowage space and a passenger control unit that now has a switch for cabin crew to turn off the LCD monitor without disturbing the passenger nicely complement the two inches of extra legroom that SIA has thrown in for good measure . <p> The redesign extends past the premium classes . In economy , new backrest seat cushions with side bolsters have been brought out for better back support , and wider 11.1-inch monitors are now equipped with a touch-screen graphical user interface ( GUI ) and handset . <p> The new interiors are also accompanied by a rejigged entertainment system , and the entire ' next generation ' proposition coincides with the introduction of SIA 's latest aircraft , the Boeing 777 .

' We always take a long-term view of our business model ' , said Mak . ' We are confident that the segment will recover , and there will be a demand for the airline that provides the best travel experience . ' <p> SIA has been a leader in the premium sector for some time , but in recent years , the Singaporean airline 's middle-eastern and Asian counterparts have been nipping fiercely at its heels .

Photography : Nicholas Alan Cope <p> Leaping to Spain , Lotti cites Frank Gehry 's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao as an influence on the audacious Magista design . ' It 's a stark example of a piece of architecture that 's strong and substantial but also has grace and soft fluidity ' <p> After extensive reserach , Nike turned to its Flyknit material , born of a micro-level process that employs computer-controlled ' knitting ' technology to form a shoe upper with woven strands of polyester . ' We had 140 testers , ' recalls Lotti . ' More than 3,000 hours on the pitch . And some players refused to give back the shoes when the test was over ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soccer boot concepts tend to operate within a four-year cycle . Creative director Martin Lotti and his staff at Nike started work on 2014 's revolutionary new Magista boot back in 2010 , straight after the last ball had been kicked at the Soccer City-stadium final in Johannesburg . ' We began with a blank sheet of paper , ' says Lotti . ' We asked ourselves , if we were designing a football boot completely from scratch , without any knowledge of what had gone before , how would it look ? ' <p> This policy of year-zero radicalism prevails everywhere at Nike headquarters . Lotti is into collaborative cross-pollination and wall-length moodboards , seeking influence from beyond the conventional sporting arena . ' We will look at anything and everything except the category that we will be working on . If we 're going to design shoes , we 're going to look at anything but shoes . That way you 're more likely to end up setting trends rather than chasing them . ' <p> So , before a single sketch was made , a rendering submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lotti arranged a trip to Iceland to look at nature - geysers , icebergs , glaciers and molten magma - and then onto Paris to immerse his creative team in architecture . ' We look at culture , geography , buildings and people and translate it all into product . ' <p> This is a tactically astute game plan that has worked for Nike before . Back in 2002 , during a visit to Kyoto , Lotti conceived Nike 's first ever yoga shoe after becoming entranced by the ' fine lines , beauty , simplicity and grace ' of the Zen gardens and watching , mesmerised , as young people dressed in kimonos walked into temples . <p> In 1988 , Tinker Hatfield , Nike 's legendary vice president for design and special projects ( originally hired by the sportswear behemoth as its ' corporate architect ' to work on its shops and offices ) , had been similarly fired up by the sight of the externalised heating ducts , exposed metal bracings and denuded lift shafts on Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano 's Centre Pompidou in Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panel from the Nike Air Max 1 's sole wall to reveal the bubbled cushioning inside . Lotti , in turn , cites Frank Gehry 's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao as an influence on the audacious Magista design . ' It 's a stark example of a piece of architecture that 's strong and substantial but also has grace and soft fluidity . ' <p> Of course , Nike also consulted its stellar roster of brand ambassadors and sponsored footballers during the 180-prototype research and development process . Initially , the question was as wide open as the last ten minutes of a cup final : ' What do you want from a football boot ? ' <p> Quickly , a podiatric mantra of ' fit , touch and traction ' emerged . The likes of Brazil 's Neymar and Spain 's Iniesta , club colleagues at FC Barcelona , talked of a desire to play barefoot . ( Or at least to mimic that liberated sensation through their footwear . ) The dazzling pace and intensity of the modern game was discussed : a need for a shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be controlled and then speed it up again . <p> ' This is all done in one moment , ' says Lotti . ' There 's no time to settle , take a touch and then pass or shoot . It 's not a conscious thing or reasoned thought process . It happens instinctively . We knew we had to make a boot that was similarly fluid , a true extension of the foot . The player and the shoe becoming one . ' Then , a pro footballer - Lotti claims he does n't remember exactly who - delivered the definitive craving . ' What I really want , ' said the striker , ' is a sock with cleats . ' <p> ' We now had a clear vision of where we wanted to go , ' says Lotti , grinning broadly . Weapons-grade hosiery - a sock-a-boot , if you will - armoured and weatherproofed but super-light and engineered for goals was the way forward . Nike looked at the form of a glove , the way that it supports a hand beyond the wrist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its Flyknit material , born of a micro-level process that employs computer-controlled ' knitting ' technology to form a shoe upper with woven strands of polyester . ' By using different yarns of differing strengths , stretch and flexibility , Flyknit allows us to engineer each boot differently , ' says Lotti . The complete shoe upper emerges from the multiple-spooled weaving machine and there 's none of the last-making , templating and cutting out you associate with conventional cobbling . <p> Certainly , Nike and Wallpaper* are in the right place to discuss the technicalities of the beautiful game . Our interview with Lotti takes place in a VVIP box high up in the bleachers at Barcelona 's Camp Nou stadium . The magnificent ground is deserted right now , but the palpably theatrical atmosphere it generates helped convince Nike to make a boot that would deliver not just control and goals but would also engender an emotional connection and generate a visceral reaction to its performance . <p> Months ago , key Barcelona players were involved in highly covert testing trials of the Magista/Playmaker boot ( actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault of footwear that also includes Hypervenom/Attack , Mercurial/Speed and Tiempo/Touch ) . <p> Testing was done over a three-year period . ' We had 140 testers , ' recalls Lotti . ' More than 3,000 hours on the pitch . And some players refused to give back the shoes when the test was over . ' He was at the training ground when a Barcelona pro scored a goal for the very first time wearing the finished Magista ' sock-with-cleats ' boot . ' A clean low strike in from outside the penalty area , right into the bottom corner , ' beams Lotti . ' It was quite a moment .

Some have a tale to them , while others are more abstract . There 's the lonely sailor who finally finds company , then there 's the flower seller who turns into a flower himself . <p> Why do many of your sculptures show people battling with clothing , trapped inside jackets , sweaters and dresses , and struggling to get out ? There 's something very beautiful about a struggle to me . But my sculptures are also a game of hide and seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their identities are obscured by the garments . <p> As with your pieces for Wallpaper* and your One Minute Sculpture series , your works are often fleeting and their only record is a photograph . Why do you like to create sculptures that do n't last ? I like to explore the boundaries between sculpture and performance and examine whether it is possible to draw a line . <p> Many of your pieces are about people or things in a process of transformation . What prompted this fascination with shape-changing ? I 'm interested in the relationship between the form and the content . If you put on a piece of clothing , you can either define or distort your figure . When we change volume we also change content , like with my Fat Car series .

And RIBA 's Welcome To The Social , created by architecture practice HawkinsBrown , highlights the transformative effect of life - and design 's - social aspect . <p> After all ' change ' has always been part of the Festival 's agenda . The theme was even reflected in the keynote debate organised by RIBA London earlier in the month , entitled ' London Architecture : what would you change ? ' . ' I 'll consider the festival a success if it generates debate and discussion about architecture , deepens our understanding of the subject and makes us think about it in new ways , ' says Richardson . ' I also think it 's a chance to break down the artificial barriers that often exist between architects , clients , and the public . ' <p> And while most exhibitions opened during the festival 's first week , events will be running throughout the month in both the core program and the fringe . More treats are in store for later too - the Barbican 's playfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not opening till the 26 June - so stay tuned . 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569 @qwx474569 
@@40481742 @481742/ <h> ' Lightness of Being ' exhibition <p> Lightness of Being is the fifth major exhibition at the new Initial Access Gallery in Wolverhampton . Frank Cohen , fast-building a name as one of Britains most exciting and extensive private collectors , has lent the gallery his neon collection , the idea being to she 'd some new light on the extensive use of neon in contemporary art.Click here to see more of the exhibition . Since Bruce Nauman 's neon poetry of the 1970s , neon lighting has become something of a post-modern artistic staple . The materials inherently kitsch associations have captured many artists imaginations because of its allegorical potential challenging what the coloured tubes can deliver beyond the ubiquitous fast food or motel signage . Four artists work is on show here : John Armleder , Dan Attoe , Jason Rhoades and Tracey Emin . Each has quite a different take on the medium . Armleders minimalist pieces stand in high contrast to Attoes deliberately crude neon caricatures scrawled on the walls of the gallery . Likewise , Jason Rhoades textual light pieces , that combine sexually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer something quite different to Emin 's work . In I know , I know , I know Emin , with trademark , bare-all frankness , has simply scribbled in white neon a snippet of her endless interior monologue . What stands out is the surprising fragility of the medium . When the fluoro tubes are switched off , they 're remarkably dull and devoid of any impact , regardless of the slogan or cartoon . Hence there 's an overriding sense of temporality to each of the pieces , which stops the neon seeming brash or kitsch . And like moths to a flame , whilst the lights are on , its hard not to be drawn in. 64561 @qwx474561 64564 @qwx474564 64566 @qwx474566 64569
