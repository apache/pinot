After KickassTorrents was shut down by the U.S. Government , meta-search engine Torrentz.eu also said farewell yesterday . Looking back over the years , they are not the only torrent giants to have fallen . <p> At TorrentFreak we have been keeping a close eye on the torrent ecosystem for more than a decade . <p> During this time , many sites have shut down , either voluntarily or forced by a court order . <p> This week meta-search engine Torrentz joined this ever-expanding list . In what appears to be a voluntary action , the site waved its millions of users farewell without prior warning . <p> The sites operators have yet to explain their motivations . However , it would n't be a big surprise if the continued legal pressure on torrent sites played a major role , with KAT as the most recent example . <p> And let 's be honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an FBI investigation , facing over a dozen years in prison , is no joke . <p> Looking back at the largest torrent sites of the past 15 years , we see a familiar pattern emerge . Many of the sites that make it to the top eventually fall down , often due to legal pressure . <p> Suprnova ( 2004 ) <p> Suprnova was one of the first ever BitTorrent giants . Founded by the Slovenian-born Andrej Preston , the site dominated the torrent scene during the early days . <p> It was also one of the first torrent sites to be targeted by the authorities . In November 2004 the sites servers were raided , and a month later Preston , aka Sloncek , decided to shut it down voluntarily . The police investigation was eventually dropped a few months later . <p> Lokitorrent ( 2005 ) <p> When Suprnova went down a new site was quick to fill its void . LokiTorrent soon became one of the largest torrent sites around , which also attracted the attention of the MPAA . <p> LokiTorrents owner Ed Webber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donations to pay for the legal costs . With success , as he raised over $40,000 in a few weeks . <p> However , not long after that , LokiTorrent was shut down , and all that was left was the iconic " You can click but you cant hide " MPAA notice . <p> TorrentSpy ( 2008 ) <p> In 2006 TorrentSpy was more popular than any other BitTorrent site . This quickly changed when it was sued by the MPAA . In 2007 a federal judge ordered TorrentSpy to log all user data and the site opted to ban all U.S. traffic in response . <p> March 2008 TorrentSpy owner Justin Bunnell decided to shut down completely and not much later his company was ordered to pay the Hollywood studios $110 million in damages . <p> Mininova ( 2009 ) <p> After TorrentSpys demise , Mininova became the largest torrent site on the net . The name was inspired by Suprnova , but in 2008 the site was many times larger than its predecessor . <p> Its popularity eventually resulted in a lawsuit from local anti-piracy outfit BREIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site had to remove all infringing torrents , a move which effectively ended its reign . <p> Today the site is still online , limiting uploads to pre-approved publishers , making it a ghost of the giant it was in the past . <p> BTJunkie ( 2012 ) <p> In 2012 , shortly after the Megaupload raid , torrent site BTJunkie shut down voluntarily . <p> Talking to TorrentFreak , BTjunkies founder said that the legal actions against other file-sharing sites played an important role in making the difficult decision . Witnessing all the trouble his colleagues got into was a constant cause of worry and stress . <p> " Weve been fighting for years for your right to communicate , but its time to move on . Its been an experience of a lifetime , we wish you all the best , " he wrote in a farewell message . <p> isoHunt ( 2013 ) <p> The shutdown of isoHunt a year later was n't much of a surprise . The site had been fighting a legal battle with the MPAA for over a decade and eventually lost , agreeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As one of the oldest and largest sites at the time , the torrent ecosystem lost another icon . However , as is often the case , another site with the same name quickly took over and is still operating today . <p> EZTV ( 2015 ) <p> The story of EZTVs demise is quite different from the rest . The popular TV-torrent distribution group shut down last year after a hostile takeover . <p> Strangely enough , many people do n't  even realize that its " gone . " The site continued to operate under new ownership and still releases torrents . However , in solidarity with the original founders these torrents are banned on several other sites . <p> YIFY/YTS ( 2015 ) <p> What started as a simple movie release group in 2010 turned into one of the largest torrent icons . The group amassed a huge following and its website was generating millions of pageviews per day early last year . <p> In November 2015 this ended abruptly . Facing a million dollar lawsuit from Hollywood , the groups founder decided to pull the plug and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged , the real YIFY/YTS is no more . <p> KickassTorrents ( 2016 ) <p> Three weeks ago Polish law enforcement officers arrested Artem Vaulin , the alleged owner of KickassTorrents . The arrest resulted in the shutdown of the site , which came as a shock to millions of KAT users and the torrent community at large . <p> Out of nowhere , the largest torrent index disappeared and there are no signs that its coming back anytime soon . The sites community , meanwhile , has found a new home at Katcr.to . <p> Torrentz ( 2016 ) <p> Torrentz is the last torrent site to cease its operations . Although no official explanation was given , some of the stories outlined above were probably weighed into the founders decision . <p> <p> So what will the future bring ?

" Carriers in the US are what powers most of our Android phones , and that model works really well for us , " he said . <p> So if you take Pichai at his word , Google is n't planning to upend the wireless market and go full throttle after Verizon and AT&amp;T .

For one , Google wants to create a " seamless " link between cellular data and Wi-Fi networks . Doing so could eliminate headaches like dropped calls , or at least make them far less of a hassle . " We 're trying to show innovations , like calls automatically reconnecting if someone drops on one end , " said Pichai . " Those are the kinds of ideas we 're pursuing with this project .

Consumers can expect to see " some of our ideas come to fruit in the next few months , " he said .

@@22459056 @2459056/ <p> Earlier this week I reviewed NESoid , a tidy little Android app that let 's you play the vast library of NES games on your smartphone . It 's no surprise that my 600MHz smartphone can emulate the NES 's 8-bit 1.8MHz ( really ! ) processor -- but boy was I shocked when I installed PSX4droid and found I could ( almost ) play Final Fantasy VII on my phone.Note : just like the NES emulator , it 's almost pointless to play PlayStation games on a phone without multi-touch capabilities . PSX4android will work on your Android 1.6 phone , but do n't try to play anything more complicated than Tetris clones . <p> First things first , PSX4droid is n't a free app : it costs $5.99 on the Android Market . That said , given how gaming experience will vary wildly depending on what phone you own , I would recommend you torrent PSX4droid first before spending money on something that might not work . There 's also a non-exhaustive list of compatible phones that you can check beforehand . In general , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PSX4droid should work . <p> Update : you can also buy something from the Android Market and get a full refund within 24 hours -- so you can do that instead . <p> OK , now on with the actual review ! <p> Getting PSX4droid to run is a lot harder than other emulators out there . It is n't simply a matter of installing the app and grabbing a few ROMs . Even if you buy PSX4droid , it wo n't work out of the box : you need to get a PlayStation BIOS BIN file first . Search the Web for ' scph1001.bin ' . Transfer the file it to your phone 's SD card . ( If you need help , there 's a walkthrough at the end of Android Tapp 's review . ) <p> Then you need to find some game ROMs ! Unlike NES and Sega games , PlayStation games are pretty big ( the size of a CD ! ) This means that ROM sites do n't tend to host the files themselves , so to find PlayStation ROMs you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad-ridden pages to find your games . Couple in the fact that not every game works on the emulator , and you can see how playing PlayStation games on your Android might be more effort than it 's worth . Still , if you want to push ahead , here are some good ROM sites : <p> Once you have a ROM or two , transfer them to your phone 's SD card . You are finally ready to play some games ! Note in the screenshot below that I have to set the PSX BIOS file to the ' scph1001.bin ' file that I transferred to my phone . <p> I wo n't lie to you , the gaming experience really is n't great -- at least on my Android 1.6 phone . With a newer HTC or Motorola smartphone ( one with a hardware keyboard ! ) it might be better , but I bet it still pales in comparison to the real thing . On my phone the graphics were OK ( around 10-15 FPS ) , but the audio sucked ( very crackly ) -- probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . <p> There are two special input methods worth checking out : the Nintendo Wiimote ( or indeed any Bluetooth gamepad ) , and the capability of using the phone 's internal ' tilt ' sensor . You can push ' up ' on the on-screen gamepad while tilting your phone to the left , and your character moves diagonally ! The Bluetooth input method is much more exciting -- you get the Wiimote 's complete functionality ! -- but it seems to require Android 2.0 , and even then it does n't work on HTC phones . <p> With all that said , I actually managed to play through the first few combat sequences in Final Fantasy VII . PSX4droid might not be as smooth as the NES or Sega emulators , but given a year or two and 3GHz processors in our mobile phones , the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP might seem a little redundant . <p> PSX4droid Tech Specs <p> Installed Size -- 1.35MB , but PlayStation ROMs vary from hundreds of megabytes to a couple of gigabytes ( Final Fantasy ! )

' And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas . " <p> I. Apple Alters Reality With Photoshop <p> But stealing other competitors ' ideas is n't the only thing Apple is good at . Of late it 's shown itself to be a burgeoning master of Photoshop . It was caught in Germany doctoring images ( playing with perspectives and stretching pictures ) to make its competitor 's product look like its own . <p> Now Apple has been caught yet again engaging in egregious editing images -- quite literally " stretching the truth " -- in the Netherlands . <p> The Netherlands court filing came as part of Apple 's legal crusade against Google Inc .

Unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free market , Apple has come up with the creative solution of trying to use lawsuits to remove Google from the market altogether . <p> But it appears , in reality , that it was Apple who was " slavishly " copying and pasting the Galaxy S into Photoshop . The Galaxy S is a bit larger than the iPhone 4 ( 122.4 by 64.2 mm ) and looked decidedly different , so Apple had its work cut out for it in order convince a judge that the phone was " copying " the iPhone 's patented look -- a key claim in its case . <p> So it shrunk the Galaxy S down to iPhone size -- 115.5 by 62.1 mm . It also cherry-picked an image of the iPhone 3G , a defunct model it has not produced since 2009 , as that model had more rounded edges -- like the Galaxy S -- and unlike Apple 's current production iPhone ( the iPhone 4 ) . <p> A careful read would reveal flaws in the visual exhibit -- Apple did at least admit in the text , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the slightly larger dimensions .

Images Played Key Role in Sales Ban <p> The recent incident , like the previous photoshopping , was identified by Dutch IDG publication Webwereld.nl . IDG quotes Mark Krul , a lawyer at the Dutch firm WiseMen and a specialist in IT and intellectual property law , who says the visual evidence was critical in a German court 's decision to ban Samsung 's tablet sales in the European Union via an ex parte injunction . <p> Mr. Krul was astonished that doctored images appeared in a separate filing , stating , " It surprises me that for the second time incorrect presentations of a Samsung product emerge in photographic evidence filed in litigation .

" <p> The EU court has since changed its ruling to only banning sales in Germany . And Samsung is actively fighting to reverse that ban . A Samsung lawyer in the EU , Bas Berghuis of Simmons and Simmons , accused Apple of " manipulating visual evidence , making Samsung 's devices appear more similar to Apple 's . " <p> A legal expert who spoke to IDC anonymously said that in patent law cases often visual exhibits are the main thing judges look at , as they 're considered the point that the plaintiff wants to emphasize -- more so than the text . <p> While the discovery of its " creative " alterations may be bad news for Apple 's legal chances , on the plus side its legal team may be able to find jobs for themselves as graphics designers , should they lose the case .

" Yeah , that was the only one , and it was directed by James Cameron . Your typical Hollywood dross is n't , in fact , directed by Cameron , nor does it take very obvious cues from Segas Panzer Dragoon series . Cameron has hit out at lazy Hollywood studios that think they can make a quick buck by converting their 2D movies into 3D at the last minuteClash of the Titans being the worst offender . If you want a good 3D movie , he said , it has to be shot in 3D from the word go . Otherwise , do n't  even bother . You 'll recall that Avatar was planned as a 3D film from the very first days of pre-production , the result being a reasonably OK movie , but one where the 3D effects did n't  look tacky or rushed . Like with anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ran it into the ground . How many vampire and/or zombie movies and TV shows have been produced in the past few years following the success of the Twilight books and movies ? Too many , exactly . So maybe we really should thank Christopher Nolan for not bothering to film the next Batman movie in 3D ? Rather than waste time ( and money ) trying to tack on rubbish 3D effects , Cameron says that movie producers would be best served either A ) leaving 3D to movies that are 3D from the beginning or B ) converting old , classic movies into 3D . Not movies like Casablanca , obviously , but Cameron suggested movies like Jaws and Indiana Jones . These movies are actually good , and you can take your time , maybe work with the director , and see how you can make it a 3D wonder .

I 'm not sure how much diehard Indiana Jones fans will like that , but its not like Hollywood ever goes out of its way to please diehards anyway . <p> 3d seems to look less realistic . Often characters look like paper cut outs etc . Its also been shown than even with the new tech 2d still has superior pq . I was really wound up about 3d at first but now do n't really care about it . <p> True . Also another factor to take into account is that some people have trouble seeing certain types of 3D . <p> Avatar was great in 3D . I watched it again in 2D and it just did n't have the same effect as the 3D version . However saying that , I agree that there are ALOT of crap movies in 3D as the already mentioned Clash of the Titans . That movie was horrible on so many levels , it was n't even funny . It sure as hell did n't even come close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the original . <p> I must be real old cause this is the 2nd time 3D has tried and fell flat again . what 's next smell-a- vision ( yes it was done too ) <p> Really ? I 've never seen 3D being pushed in the way it is nowadays . Sony , LG , Panasonic , etc ... all of the big players , are pushing 3D as hard as they can . Movie theaters are showing 3D movies and film makers are producing them . <p> Anyway , my opinion on the subject is that 3D rarely adds any effect to the story . It is mainly there for special effects and individuals that crave those effects will go through lengths to see them . I also hate wearing those horrible 3D glasses and the tickets are more expensive . <p> You will never see me buying a 3D monitor or TV unless the glasses disappear ( which they 're working on now ) and prices go down . <p> 3D with Avatar was nice , 3D with How to train a dragon also and 3D with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last airbender somehow redundant and 3D with Alice more of a nuisance . Not to forget the Clash of the titans 3D debacle . Shrek 3D was the worst of all Shrek movies . The 3D with Piranha did n't make any difference - it was simply crap . <p> That 's it for me - I did n't watch that owl stuff or Despicable me even if they seem to be nice .

" A scammer could use this information to build a profile of a person and then target them with convincing phishing messagesperhaps referring to specific purchases on another website , " writes TechnologyReview in response to the study .

The usernames they used were not unique . In fact they corresponded perfectly with ones they used on other forums where they had been less careful about disguising who they were .

From that information we were able to discover not that he had infringed , but had just come into some money valuable information to a law firm looking to screw someone for hard cash . <p> In another recent case which ended particularly badly for one confirmed file-sharer , armed with nothing but an email address and a forum post we were able to follow a trail which led into highly personal aspects of the individuals life .

Others with common usernames are far more difficult to track down and in our quick tests we have to agree .

I am saving this answer in a notepad file so I can just paste it in over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in track 1A Step 2 : Copy the clip and paste it into track 2 Step 3 : Create a track matte in Photoshop with the desired shape and size Step 4 : Create a Video Track 3 Step 5 : Import the matte and put it into track 3 Step 6 : Apply the Mosaic effect ( in Stylize ) to the clip in 1A Step 7 : Change the transparency of the clip in track 2 to " Track Matte " Step 8 : Apply motion to the matte in track 3 if needed to keep it centered on the subject Step 9 : Alt-Scrub to see if you got the motion correct Step 10 : Wait a long time for a render Basically , the track matte transparency allows the modified clip in track 1A to show through the unmodified clip in track 2 wherever the matte is black . The hard part is using motion to keep the matte centered on the face or license plate . You will probably need one heck of a lot of keyframes if the subject moves a lot . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file , the " New " dialog box asks you to name it , and asks you for an image size . On my system , when I change the " inches " to " pixels " it automatically changes to 720X480 . The PAL folks need to use their own frame size . I leave the resolution at 72 and the mode as RGB . The contents needs to be checked as " Transparent " . Then just draw a simple circle , square or oval - in black . Nothing else . Do n't fill in the rest of the area . You can draw it dead center . It will make it easier to use the motion later .

Just please get this into your head that you cant remove them and have perfect image underneath because yours is a conversion from original that had the boxes which means those boxes are more like holes in the image . <p> Its like taking a painting and holding a black box infront of part of it ... Ok it can be moved and your left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in the painting so you would have to full this in with your own data ..

( Can you say Bukkake and eels gone wild ? ? ) <p> Well , Some have the idea , but they want to know what kind of media your trying to do this on , and perhaps the title , so that we can see this diva too .. Oh ! and what software your trying to use to do this on .. Be detailed , and you 'll get a detailed answer <p> So , where was I .. <p> Depending on the video format , The censorship blur could be a simple layer in the file . Almost like audio or subtitling can be a layer in some formats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer and allows you to display the content you " Really " wanted to see .. <p> If you 've used adobe photoshop and played with layers in macromedia flash , you understand the concept .. <p> Others ' sell ' the uncensored versions of the media , outside the country , where they wo n't get jail time for it .. <p> However for 90% of the videos , aka non layering media your SOL .. The layers were " Flattened " .. <p> This is also true for what sounds like what you 've got .. It Appears You " RIPPED " a DVD and now have the copy on your HD .. You may not have pulled all the " SUB CHANNELS " or tracks from the media and therefore not all of the VOB 's that could have been stored there .. It could also be that the company who made the media did some clever copy protections and when you ripped it , you copied one of the vob 's with blank space , or trash in it .. Macrovision had a interesting whitepaper about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into copy-protection of media here .. While it 's possible to place the VOB in a diffrent channel of the media , or in a diffrent track of the media , or even fill a vob with trash data that dose n't " show " while on the real media I 'd fail to see how that would help you , unless you had a special player to read that data and it did something with it . Needless to say 99.99% of people with dvd players would be SOL . <p> So there goes the incentive for companies to put that kind of protection on the media unless they can get paid from using it .. <p> Based on your comments about how the blurr is moving slightly evertime you play the media is a bit odd too .. Perhaps you should explain if your able to see anything under that blurr or post a screenshot or something with more detail .. <p> Hell it could even be a VOB that 's playing based on the region your in .. Again , Special software would have to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company that had to press something like that .. That 's just way off base . I should probably patent that ... ; ) <p> This dose n't mean that if you had a very large and expensive computer with some decent " interpolation " softare that you could n't remove the blocking or bluring , frame by frame .... but there again , based on your post here your are not working for the NSA , and you probably do n't have cash to burn . <p> This kind of sounds like a lost cause .. We do n't know what format your using , or how you got the media , or what your playing it on . Some will tell you it can not be done , and they may be right .. From what you told us , I do n't have any better answers for you .. <p> IF HOWEVER .. You referring to the fact that you can hear the file but not see it , or the entire video looks like it 's totaly pixelated .. <p> ( Remeber as a teen looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of non distored goodness ? ? ) <p> Then You may have a actual codec issue ..

I am a long-time Empornium user , and I am and have been connected with most of the admins since I joined . I myself am not an admin . <p> Please see also " Who is TargetPoint ? " <p> Before TargetPoint <p> Before TargetPoint , Empornium was run by saz , and also somewhat of a republic of admins . Saz generally made good choices about the site and who got what control over it . The admins were fine with this arrangment , just as in many many other sites where a loose dictatorship lives . <p> Beginnings of TargetPoint Control <p> Saz made a choice to take on investors . By taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use their resources to make the site better with better servers , a complete rebuild and a potentially wider audience . This contract gave TargetPoint a lot of legal control over Empornium , including control over the domain . The first thing they did was to put additional ads on the site , which was generally acceptable as they did n't get in the way nor cause problem with using the site . <p> Pushing the Big Cheese Out <p> On Empornium , TargetPoint started making bigger decisions about the site , and started to lock down and control the site more , adding more advertisements and other such things . Saz had n't been the sole owner of the site since the initial deal , but only now did that become a problem . After the move to . nl , he no longer had any control over what TargetPoint did with the site . They put up more and more ads , and changed the site to add yet another page for ads to be placed . They also did nothing to stop the extreme slowdown of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowing to over 6 seconds . Saz and the other admins were not consulted on any changes that were made . <p> In early 2006 , TargetPoint built a site called " ImageFap " - an image hosting service that is also filled to the gills with ads , very different from the commonly used image hosts named HideBehind ( previously &lt;a href= " http : //pleaseeat.us " target= " blank " **26;91;TOOLONG and imagehero ) , Fapomatic and JPGHosting . TargetPoint added a permanent link to the top of every Empornium page , linking to ImageFap as the host for images on Empornium . <p> In the forums , TargetPoint threatened to ban anyone ( including admins ) who badmouthed TargetPoint in the forums . Many threads were deleted mentioning the problems with TargetPoint and ImageFap . The information on this is fuzzy , but the general consensus is that saz deleted the newer threads to keep some users from being banned , and that TargetPoint employees deleted the older threads mentioning TargetPoint in a bad light . <p> The " New Look " <p> Recently ( July 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire site design was changed , and by appearance the main goal of this design is to maximize ad coverage , in a layout not unlike ImageFap . The decision to do this and the decisions on how it should look and work were made without any warning to the users , and little warning to admins or moderators as to when it would happen . Months before this , a TargetPoint employee told the IRC channel about the site redesign , but no such warning was given when things actually changed . This broke various aspects of the site , including 3rd party search tools , uploader descriptions ( which depended on the site 's layout ) , some of the IRC bot 's functions , and many many other tools that were made for Empornium that depended on the layout ( such as aNemia 's tEMPlator ) . <p> Now What ?

@@22459109 @2459109/ <p> WASHINGTON The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to regulate broadband Internet service as a public utility , a milestone in regulating high-speed Internet service into American homes . <p> Tom Wheeler , the commission chairman , said the F.C.C. was using " all the tools in our toolbox to protect innovators and consumers " and preserve the Internets role as a " core of free expression and democratic principles . " <p> The new rules , approved 3 to 2 along party lines , are intended to ensure that no content is blocked and that the Internet is not divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for Internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else . Those prohibitions are hallmarks of the net neutrality concept . <p> Explaining the reason for the regulation , Mr. Wheeler , a Democrat , said that Internet access was " too important to let broadband providers be the ones making the rules .

" There is no problem to solve . " <p> The impact of the new rules will hinge partly on details that are not yet known . The rules will not be published for at least a couple of days , and will not take effect for probably at least a couple of months .

The F.C.C. will not get involved in pricing decisions or the engineering decisions companies make in managing their networks . Mr. Wheeler , who gave a forceful defense of the rules just ahead of the vote , said the tailored approach was anything but old-style utility regulation . " These are a 21st-century set of rules for a 21st-century industry , " he said . <p> Opponents of the new rules , led by cable television and telecommunications companies , say adopting the Title II approach opens the door to bureaucratic interference with business decisions that , if let stand , would reduce incentives to invest and thus raise prices and hurt consumers . <p> " Today , the F.C.C. took one of the most regulatory steps in its history , " Michael Powell , president of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and a chairman of the F.C.C. in the Bush administration , said in a statement .

@@22459115 @2459115/ <p> Microsoft 's new Internet Explorer 9 ( IE9 ) browser will require Windows 7 Service Pack 1 ( SP1 ) , a not-yet-released major update to the operating system , the company said today . According to a FAQ posted on the company 's site , Windows 7 users will need to install SP1 prior to adding IE9 . People running Windows Vista must have that operating system 's SP2 in place . The Ars Technica technology site first reported on the Windows 7 SP1 requirement Thursday . Microsoft has not divulged the release dates of Windows 7 SP1 or IE9 , but both are expected to appear in the first half of 2011 . That six month window covers Microsoft 's current plans for Windows 7 SP1 , while many experts believe the company will ship the final of IE9 in April 2011 to coincide with its annual MIX conference . <p> The FAQ suggests that the final versions of both two products will ship simultaneously , or nearly so . The beta of IE9 that launched September 15 requires four already available Windows 7 updates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are primarily graphics-related bug fixes or that add support for IE9 functionality . But the final will apparently demand more , a curious move since Microsoft has repeatedly characterised Windows 7 SP1 as nothing more than a collection of previously-released security patches and other fixes . Unlike 2004 's Windows XP SP2 , Windows 7 SP1 will not include new features . " Organisations must plan , pilot and deploy Internet Explorer 9 as part of or after a Windows 7 SP1 deployment , " Microsoft maintained in the FAQ . The SP1 requirement may be derived from the four updates already available , they would be packaged in SP1 , or from future , not-yet-released updates or a combination of the two . This is n't the first time Microsoft has blocked some users from running IE9 . The new browser will not run on Windows XP , the still-dominant nine-year-old OS . Earlier this week , Microsoft urged companies not to wait for IE9 to migrate their PCs to Windows 7 , a recommendation the FAQ repeated . " Microsoft recommends that organizations do not disrupt ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 , " the FAQ stated . Pushing enterprises to upgrade to Windows 7 now , not at some point after IE9 's launch , is to Microsoft 's benefit , of course , since the sooner it gets customers onto the new operating system , the sooner it reaps revenue from the OS and associated products , such as Windows Server 2008 R2 and SharePoint 2010 . Microsoft made a point to stress that even though companies moving to the Windows 7/IE8 combination may use that browser for only a limited time , the work would not be wasted . " Your Internet Explorer 8 migration investments will be preserved when you are ready to deploy Internet Explorer 9 , " argued Rich Reynolds , Microsoft 's chief Windows marketing executive , in a post to a company blog Tuesday . <p> Even so , Microsoft does n't want to dissuade users from trying out IE9 . " Regardless of your organisation 's stage of Windows 7 deployment plans , we still encourage you to explore the Internet Explorer 9 Beta , " added Reynolds . The IE9 FAQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployment tools for IE9 , including a blocking utility to prevent Windows Update from automatically downloading and installing the new browser . Microsoft has released such blocking tools for other browsers , including IE8 in 2009 and IE7 in 2006 . Microsoft did not immediately reply to questions on the IE9-Windows 7 SP1 ties , including why SP1 is necessary to run the new browser . The IE9 beta can be downloaded from Microsoft 's site . <p> Update : Microsoft has been reaching out to various sites to she 'd some light on the situation . In reality , SP1 will not be required : <p> " Internet Explorer 9 will work on Windows 7 RTW and Windows 7 SP1 . When you install Internet Explorer 9 on a system that has Windows 7 RTM installed , additional operating system components are included as part of the installation of Internet Explorer 9 .

@@22459120 @2459120/ <h> FST Links <h> Record Label Boss Is a Former Notorious Warez Scene Pirate <p> During March , Sumerian Records boss Ash Avildsen made the news on a couple of piracy-related occasions . First , he orchestrated a hoax to trick BitTorrent users into downloading a fake band promo , then later got serious with a YouTube broadside against music piracy . As Sumerian gets ready to launch their own music store , TorrentFreak has discovered that they have Long John Silvers skeleton in the closet . <p> In recent years , its become fashionable to use online file-sharing networks to generate publicity for both well-known bands and those with a lower profile . If done properly its a great and free way to reach a large audience . <p> Early March , the Sumerian Records label decided to utilize an increasingly popular method of getting some free publicity for a band on their label , i.e tell everyone that their music has leaked to file-sharing networks and all concerned are very angry about it . " Hey all you jobbers who like to steal our albums word out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the BOO Born of Osiris album has leaked .. perhaps the pirate ship will leak too and sink in to the sea . In any case , enjoy pirating the record and hopefully you guys choke on a cannonball . Happy torrenting you cowards ! " label founder Ash Avildsen declared . <p> As it turns out , the entire tirade was a hoax designed to get people to download a copy of the album but with the band chatting , farting and generally messing around over the top . Apparently the whole thing was quite funny , especially the Charlie Sheen samples . Welcome to music marketing 2011-style . And why not ? However , just a few days later Avildsens attitude towards file-sharing networks changed somewhat . In a YouTube video which began with the industry line that music piracy robs the United States of 71,000 jobs and $12.5 billion in economic output , Avildsen asked people for just 3 minutes of their time to open their minds . <p> This was quickly followed up by the cover of the upcoming Born of Osiris album merging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only good for unsigned bands to get publicity and established bands and labels only suffer at their hands . At around the 2 minute mark , Avildsen sank his teeth into torrent sites and their " corporate " advertisers . " Let 's call a spade a spade there 's nothing more pathetic than making a living off being a thief , " said Avildsen . His anti-piracy message was widely reported in the music media and you can see the full thing at the bottom of this article , but for something rather more eye-opening , read on . " I used to run in the same circles as Sumerian Records founder , Ash Asvilden , " Jason Fisher of heavy metal music site The Gauntlet told TorrentFreak this morning . <p> They 're both in the music business , so perhaps nothing too surprising there ? But rewind a few years and things get very interesting indeed . Fisher now admits he was a member of multiple warez groups Amnesia , the mighty Razor 1911 and ROR ( Release on Rampage ) . " As I listened to Ashs statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more pathetic than making a living off of being a thief. So as Ash puts it , let 's call a spade a spade , " Fisher explained . " What Ash does n't  tell you is that when he was in high school , we ran in the same circlesthe software piracy/hacking circles . " Surprisingly , Fisher and Asvilden had crossed paths with their shared connections to ROR ( Release on Rampage ) . Having existed in other forms , 1995 saw ROR transform into a games release group and was taken over by a new leader known as The Krazy Little Punk ( TKLP ) . He and the group became infamous in warez circles for claiming to have pre-released the most-anticipated game of the time Quake the follow up to I 'd Softwares massive hit , Doom2 . <p> However , when the dust settled it was discovered that the release was actually a repackaged beta version of the game . ROR was banned from the scene for their sins and TKLP was forced to start a new group called Reflux ( more background here ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that relate to Sumerian Records ? Well , according to Jason Fisher , the leader of ROR ( The Krazy Little Punk ) is none other than Sumerian Records founder , Ash Asvilden . <p> " When I first heard Ash was starting Sumerian Records , I thought he was probably the one guy out there smart enough to change this lagging industry around . I was interested to see what new ideas for running a record label he would have . I thought surely if anyone could do it , it would be Ash , the dude is brilliant , " Fisher explains . " But it turns out he is going to go down the same road that so many others have gone down and never recovered from . Let 's hope it is n't too late . He is right , piracy is a huge problem in the music industry , I 'd just like a little more disclosure coming from a guy who has cost software companies millions of dollars . " He ended up getting busted for releasing the alpha source for some major I 'd software release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received " visits " from the FBI . <p> Whether these brushes with the law led to a Road to Damascus-style recovery for Asvilden remains to be seen . But let 's not forget , this was many years ago and a lot has altered since then . Times change , attitudes change .

@@22459139 @2459139/ <p> Want to know what the future workforce thinks of technology , how it uses search engines , social networking , and online collaborative tools ? The recently released ECAR Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology gives some excellent insights into trends in college students ' technology ownership , perceptions , skills , and habits . The 2010 report was recently released by EDUCAUSE , a non-profit organization that supports the advancement of technology in higher education . The report is based on a survey from the spring of 2010 of over 36,950 freshmen and seniors at 100 four-year institutions and students at 27 two-year institutions . <h> Student Ownership of Technology <p> EDUCAUSE has been conducting these surveys for almost a decade now , so the results offer an interesting look at how students ' attitudes to technology have changed - and have n't changed - over time . Consistent with previous years , for example , about half the respondents say they consider themselves to be mainstream adopters of technology . But about half of the male respondents see themselves as early adopters while only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past four years , the percentage of respondents who own computers has stayed roughly the same : around 98% . But desktop ownership has declined by more than 25% over that period , with laptop ownership increasing accordingly . In 2010 , 89% of students said they owned either a laptop or a netbook . More than half of respondents said their computers were less than a year old . Despite the prevalence of laptops , eReaders have yet to make much in-roads with the college set , with only 4% owning a dedicated eReader . But two-thirds of the respondents say they own an Internet-capable handheld device . <h> Students ' Use of Technology ( For Social Networking , Not for Studying ) <p> Students report they use technology primarily to study . OK , not really . Communications - especially via text-messaging and social networking - is the primary usage ( and daily usage ) of technology . 96% of students said they were on Facebook. 23% said they were on MySpace . And of students active in social networking , fewer than 7% said they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women and only 40% of men said they 'd put some restrictions in place as to who could view their social networking information . <p> Despite the very high percentage of students who said they use social networking for personal reasons , very few said they use these sites as part of their coursework . Only 3 in 10 said as much , most of whom said they did so to collaborate with fellow students in their classes . Only 8% of respondents said they used social networking sites to interact with their instructors . When asked if they would like to see more social networking in their classes , slightly more than 25% said they would . And while 90% of institutions said they used online Learning Management Systems , students ' participation was not that high . While most students said they had used an LMS at some point , only two-thirds said they were using one during the semester when this survey was taken . And their experience was not positive . Over the last few studies that EDUCAUSE has undertaken , the percentage of respondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dropped from 77% in 2007 to 51% in 2010 . In terms of other technologies being used by students , 36% said they used web-based productivity tools like Google Docs , 12% said they used blogs , and only 4% said they used microblogging services like Twitter in their courses . As far as how their college experience is preparing them for their future technology usage , slightly fewer than half of the students agreed with the statement " By the time I graduate , the IT I have used in my courses will have adequately prepared me for the workplace .

@@22459140 @2459140/ <p> As the largest file sharing service on the Internet , MegaUpload downloads represented 30-40% of all file sharing . In the space of an hour , Internet traffic globally plummeted by an astounding 2-3% . Press releases heralded a major blow to the theft of intellectual property . So what happened to Internet file sharing traffic after the MegaUpload arrests ? <p> Today were publishing the results of three month research effort that provides some of the clues . More details are available in our NANOG presentation and earlier academic paper . <p> First , some definitions . As the New York Times observed , " file sharing sites " ( particularly those focused on distribution of copyright infringing content ) can be difficult to distinguish from the dozens of legitimate sites helping enterprises and consumers share internal documents , homework , and the like . The web sites for copyright protected and legal file sharing look nearly identical with similar graphics , sales messaging , and perhaps ironically ( or cynically ) , DMCA policies and warnings against illegal file sharing . The only exception was MegaUpload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in retrospect , possibly a mistake ) . <p> But if you spend a few minutes searching to download the latest Hollywood movie release ( or movies not even released yet ) , patterns quickly emerge . File sharing search sites like FilesTube , RapidManiac , and Filesbay link to many dozens of file sharing providers , but generally not , say , DropBox nor Box.net . ( In the above example , I searched for " Man on a Ledge " which you should not download from FilesTube if for no other reason than its a terrible movie ) . In our study , we were particularly interested in the infrastructure behind file sharing , i.e. the hosting / colo facilities , payment partners , etc . The conventional wisdom is that file sharing is distributed across huge swaths of the Internet basically everywhere . <p> No . <p> In fact , though there are hundreds of file sharing sites , an extremely small number of colo-location providers ( six of them ) provide infrastructure to these sites that generate more than 80% of all Internet file sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved with a specialized ecosystem / cyber supply chain . <p> The below graph shows the Internets file sharing topology in the early hours of January 18 , 2012 . The links represent North America Internet file sharing traffic where the width of each link is proportional to the traffic volume . Green indicates traffic to the file sharing sites and red is traffic to the hosting or colo-location provider . Note that the different file sharing sites share much of the same Internet infrastructure and hosting companies ( namely LeaseWeb , NForce , Carpathia , Choopa , and Softlayer ) . <p> On January 18 , MegaVideo was clearly the king with 34% of all file sharing traffic . In turn , most MegaVideo servers leveraged US based servers in Carpathia Hosting with some traffic going toLeaseweb servers in the Netherlands and other European providers / facilities . According to the indictment , the gigantic MegaUpload sprawled over more than 1000 servers and 25 petabytes of data in Carpathia facilities ( with another 700 MegaUpload servers in Leaseweb hosting centers ) . The next graphic shows Internet file sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Overall , a significant re-allocation of Internet file sharing traffic . MegaVideo is gone . Sites like PutLockerhave gained significant marketshare . <p> The main impact of the MegaUpload takedown ? <p> Well , file sharing has not gone away . It did not even decrease much in North America . Mainly , file sharing became staggeringly less efficient . Instead of terabytes of North America MegaUpload traffic going to US servers , most file sharing traffic now comes from Europe over far more expensive transatlantic links . 
@@22459141 @2459141/ <h> FST Links <h> BitTorrent Still Dominates Global Internet Traffic <p> A new Internet traffic trends report released by the Canadian broadband management company Sandvine reveals that global P2P traffic is expanding , with BitTorrent as the key player . In North America , more than half of all upstream traffic ( 53.3% ) on an average day can be attributed to P2P . The report further signals some really interesting regional differences in P2P use , such as the dominance of Ares in Latin America . <p> Sandvine , the company that 's best known for manufacturing the hardware that slowed down BitTorrent users on Comcast , has released their latest Internet traffic report . The company has looked into the traffic consumption of Internet users all around the world , and in this article were going to highlight some of the emerging trends in the P2P landscape . The overall conclusion we draw from the data is that BitTorrent , and P2P traffic in general , is still dominant in all geographical regions . In North America , Latin America and Asia-Pacific , P2P traffic is responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of downstream traffic is significantly lower , thanks to the streaming video sites that have gained popularity in the last years . Despite the global nature of P2P there are some striking differences in the preferred applications and protocols that are used . Well discuss the various trends and statistics below , starting with North America . <h> P2P in North America <p> BitTorrent remains the most used file-sharing protocol in North America , and the total amount of P2P traffic is still very significant . Sandvines research reveals that on an average day , 53.3% of all upstream traffic can be attributed to P2P applications . P2P is less dominant on the downstream side . It is currently at 13.2% , following real time entertainment ( 45.7% ) and web browsing ( 24.3% ) . The bandwidth usage patterns during peak hours are slightly different , but still a massive 34.31% of all upstream traffic can be attributed to BitTorrent at these times . The BitTorrent percentage of downstream traffic lies at 8.39% during the busiest time of the day . What 's further noteworthy is that the Gnutella protocol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly large in North America . It currently lies at 11.18% of upstream traffic and 2.12% of downstream traffic during peak hours . In most other parts of the world Gnutella has vanished completely . The normalized aggregate of all traffic ( up/down ) during peak hours puts P2P traffic at 19.2% during the first months of 2010 . Interestingly , this is up from 15.1% in 2009 , which shows that P2P traffic is growing strongly , not only in absolute numbers but also as a share of total Internet traffic in North America . <p> Overall , it can be concluded that P2P traffic is still on the rise in North America , with BitTorrent being the dominant protocol . <h> P2P in Europe <p> In common with North America , BitTorrent also remains the most used file-sharing protocol in Europe . The report does n't  give any exact stats , but roughly 40% of all upstream traffic and 10% of all downstream traffic can be attributed to P2P applications on an average day . Bandwidth usage patterns during peak hours show that of 29.97% of the upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus 8.29% of downstream traffic . PPLive , the popular peer-to-peer streaming video network , also has a significant share with 11.76% of all upstream traffic and 4.41% of downstream traffic during peak hours . Strangely enough , Sandvine categorizes PPLive as real-time entertainment rather than P2P file-sharing . In Europe , the normalized aggregate of all traffic ( up/down ) during peak hours puts P2P traffic at 11.0% during the first months of 2010 . This is down from 22% in 2009 , which indicates that P2P has lost half its share of the total Internet traffic there . <p> The relative downward trend of P2P traffic during peak hours does not have to mean that the absolute traffic has gone down as well . What is clear , however , is that relative to other traffic sources P2P has decreased in Europe , while it has increased in all other regions . <h> P2P in Latin America <p> Latin America is the only region where BitTorrent is not the preferred protocol to share files . Even though BitTorrent has a pretty decent market share there also , Ares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic is huge in Latin America . On an average day , 73.3% of all upstream traffic can be attributed to P2P applications . P2P is less dominant on the downstream side . It is currently at 23.1% , following real time entertainment ( 35.2% ) and web browsing ( 28.3% ) . The bandwidth usage patterns during peak hours of the day show that 11.91% of all upstream traffic can be attributed to BitTorrent at these times . This is dwarfed by the 54.74% Ares is credited for . The BitTorrent percentage of downstream traffic lies at 6.80% during the busiest time of the day , compared to 12.98% for Ares . What is further noteworthy is that eDonkey is still fairly large in Latin America . It currently lies at 6.29% of upstream traffic and 1.82% of downstream traffic during peak hours . In most other parts of the world eDonkey has vanished completely . The normalized aggregate of all traffic ( up/down ) at peak hours puts P2P traffic at 36.7% during the first months of 2010 . Interestingly , this is up from 31.9% in 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in absolute numbers but also as a share of total Internet traffic in Latin America . <p> We can conclude without a doubt that Latin America is the winner when it comes to the share P2P has of overall Internet traffic . <h> P2P in Asia-Pacific <p> BitTorrent is the most used file-sharing protocol in Asia-Pacific , where P2P has a traditionally high market share . The report does n't  give any exact stats for this region , but roughly 60% of all upstream traffic and 25% of all downstream traffic on an average day can be attributed to P2P applications . The bandwidth usage patterns during the peak hours show that 37.63% of the upstream traffic can be attributed to BitTorrent , versus 16.91% of downstream traffic . PPLive and PPStream , two popular peer-to-peer streaming video networks , also have significant shares with 18.83% and 11.06% of all upstream traffic respectively , and 7.90% and 7.14% of downstream traffic during peak hours . In Asia-Pacific , the normalized aggregate of all traffic ( up/down ) puts P2P traffic during peak hours at 25.7% in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 , which indicates that P2P is still increasing its share of total Internet traffic there . <p> As can be seen from the table below , at the busiest time of the day BitTorrent has the largest market share of Internet traffic in Asia-Pacific compared the other regions . <p> Data : Sandvine <p> USA <p> 8.39% <p> 34.31% <p> Europe <p> 8.29% <p> 29.97% <p> Latin America <p> 6.80% <p> 11.91% <p> Pacific Asia <p> 16.91% <p> 37.63% <p> In conclusion , we can say that Sandvine reveals some intriguing statistics , with the overall conclusion that BitTorrent and P2P in general are still going strong . Although there are regional differences , BitTorrent is responsible for a significant share of total Internet traffic in all regions . That said , we have to keep in mind that Sandvine might benefit from overestimating the percentage of P2P traffic because they sell the traffic shaping applications .

The iPhone 4 is much more expensive , especially taking into account AT&amp;Ts contract , and as a result you get more hardware despite relatively similar up front costs .

There are some really old and rare things , I 'm sure you wo n't be able to find anywhere else .

Zamunda has the following categories : http : **36;541;TOOLONG BROWSE : LONG ... Top 10 Active Torrents : LONG ... As you can see there are lots of leechers/seeders on all the torrents so it 's fairly easy to maintain a good ratio .

Speeds : 3.5/5 ( 5/5 for Bulgarians . Though there are many seeders on all the torrents , foreign users may find the speeds a bit low .

" . I already see people claiming that it was not Osame bin Laden and that Obama just needed this victory . <p> I doubt in the end really matters much whatever he is dead or not . I mean it is good that such a person is removed from that organisation , he was afterall a key figure and clearly know how to provoke people in doing what he wanted and know how to orginised these attacks , but at the end you just killed the queen and the other bees are now mad at you ready to sting you . <p> megabyteme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There have been attacks after 9/11 and I am pretty sure that he has had his hand in some of them .

Yes , it is probably good that he is no longer a mythical rebel evading the all mighty US . However , he was not nearly as key as he has been made out to be .

He had become a symbol of ' resistance ' in certain extremist cirlces and now that symbol is gone .

He 's another death ( among thousands ) , but at least his was not entirely senseless . I 'm just worn out on this . I can not get " excited " to hear of anyone dying . I mentioed his poor health because someone else ( an uninformed , earlier poster ) questioned how I knew he was old ( uhmmm , his birth date of 1957 ) and his poor health ( news reports discussing his poor health and how he would be able to receive dialysis in caves ) . As I said , rough decade . My body aches after a weekend of camping with a tent ... <p> I 'm completely sick of this war . One does not even need to be a " conspiracy nut " to now we went in to the wrong country , and have been mowing down " terrorists " with small arms who became " terrorists " only after we invaded their country with Apache helicopters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I ask you this , pro-war , dead Bin Laden celebrators : if another country invaded yours and flew over your homes with helicopters , and roamed your streets with armed military personnel , would you not become " terrorists " and protect your homes , and your sovereignty ? I sure as fuck would . <p> I 'll repeat : we are in the wrong country if we are hunting down those responsible for 9/11 . Hint : the terrorists responsible were almost all from Saudi Arabia ... As for " terrorist training camps " , any of those would have been obliterated in the past decade . All we have forming are those who are now pissed off that we wo n't leave . <p> I do imagine this will be a well-celebrated day in communities with pick-up trucks , gun racks , cheap beer , and a lack of accurate , in-depth news sources . For those among us , feel free to C&amp;P this , it will save you the misspelling : " Yeah America , we got that son of a bitch ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> As someone who masterminded and sanctioned the killing of thousands of innocents , he had to be hunted down until the day he died . That only happened 10 years later , and at the cost of many lives , but it sends a clear signal to all the terrorist organizations who may want to attack another sovereign nation : we will go after you , no matter how long it takes . <p> Basically , it 's the same retaliation policy Israel has been doing for decades .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) -- Germany was in a state of shock on Tuesday after their " oracle octopus " Paul picked Spain to win the World Cup semifinal match against Germany in South Africa on Wednesday . <p> " This is not a good omen , " wrote Bild newspaper 's online edition after the news of Paul 's pick flashed across Germany . <p> The octopus has turned into an international celebrity after accurately picking the winner of all five German World Cup matches to date -- including its 1-0 loss to Serbia . <p> Two national networks interrupted their programming on Tuesday for live coverage of Paul 's latest forecast , and groans of disappointment rang out across Germany after Paul went for a container with a morsel of food in it bearing the Spanish flag . <p> " We were all a little bit shocked when Paul picked Spain , " said Tanja Munzig , a spokeswoman for Sea Life in Oberhausen . " To err is not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope Paul got this one wrong . " <p> The octopus , considered by some to be the most intelligent of all invertebrates , was again given the choice of picking food from two different transparent containers lowered into his tank -- one with a German flag on it and one with a Spanish . <p> The container Paul opens first is regarded as his pick for the match .

They proceeded to set up my server anyway . I 'm now in the process of attempting to get a refund and will try to update with how that goes . <p> You ordered first before getting an answer on LVM .

If there are slots available it will remove the " 9+ " and " &lt;72 hours " and quote 15 minutes . The number available is the exact number that are available . <p> I think it 's pretty sneaky to write " availability : 9+ " and " setup time : &lt;72hrs " when you might have to wait a week or two before getting a box . <p> There have only been a couple of instances where the set up times have exceeded 3 days , but even then it 's not been as bad as a week .

What I mentioned to someone on IRC today was that if the user edits the configuration files so that they are dominating sever resources ( in one case someone tried to specify 1000 available peers ) I will come in and tweak them to give others a fair chance . <p> When you 're looking at using torrent speeds greater than 100Mbps you will find that the people who can fill it also have similar connections so having a huge number of peers will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feel free to drop me a line via e-mail : joshua@feralhosting.com or a support ticket LONG ... via our website . <p> I am also working on permanently correcting the set up time thing .

( from receiving the welcome to feralhosting-detals ) to receiving the order confirmation from google checkout . <p> Setup took roughly about 2+ day or so , but according to the website , 72 hours was stated , so that 's definately okay . <p> In terms of seed cap , I was told as well ( by Joshua ) that adjusting the amount of seeds pr torrent would n't make any speed difference . Obviously , this is in my opinion a false statement . Right now my fastest download have been at 4.8 mb/s I think , while connected to 10 seeds , obviously being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more private trackers would probably increase this speed as well . <p> Also , I wrote how to do this , and I got a nice email describing in detail how to adjust seeds/torrents - But no warning regarding adjustment of the speeds . ( I was gon na bump it to 25 pr torrent in stead , which is also what I use at home whenever I download/upload stuff on my uTorrent client ) . <p> At first feralhosting can seem a bit confusing , but I think I am getting the hang of it and so far it seems reasonable . <p> Right now the page is down : ( - which sucks . Ca n't connect to anything unfortunately . Might be the firewall where I work , not sure though . <p> EDIT : <p> Seems like it 's the firewall where I work that 's blocking the traffic . I am able to connect using the Remote GUI through an open proxy somewhere in Germany . <p> monkeyseat <p> 08-10-2009 , 01:25 PM <p> There have only been a couple of instances where the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not been as bad as a week . I 'll happily offer a refund if that does happen though.Yeah , I understand that it can be a bit clogged up from time to time if the supplier does n't have enough servers available , but if that is the case I think you should rather put out a notice about it on the site . I would n't mind waiting a few days extra as long as I were informed about the server status . <p> I recieved my account within the given time ( &lt;72hrs ) , but as I said , I spoke to guy who had already waited three days when I placed my order and I am assuming he recieved his account at around the same time as me . <p> I 'm not in any way racking down on you , I am just giving suggestions to try to improve the service for the users . <p> As for the capping , it is n't done . What I mentioned to someone on IRC today was that if the user edits the configuration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one case someone tried to specify 1000 available peers ) I will come in and tweak them to give others a fair chance . <p> When you 're looking at using torrent speeds greater than 100Mbps you will find that the people who can fill it also have similar connections so having a huge number of peers will not dramatically increase speeds.I 'm not neccessarily looking to max out the connection , but as previously stated I have n't been able to get more than 1MB/s upstream , even on popular torrents with one seeder and many leechers . That was however back when the peer limit was 20 . I have yet to try out the new limit ( 40 ) , but I am assuming ( and hoping ) that I will be able to get at least a bit better speed upstream . <p> The downstream speeds have been insane , peaking at about 60MB/s ( yes , 60MB/s ! ) . <p> Also , I have n't quite understood the whole " resource hogging " thing . Would n't it be possible to limit the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Gbit line ? That way , people would be able to max out the connection without having to worry about causing trouble for the other users . It feels a bit weird to have to limit the torrent speeds yourself . <p> Right now my fastest download have been at 4.8 mb/s I think , while connected to 10 seeds , obviously being connected to 20 or 25 seeds on some of the more private trackers would probably increase this speed as well.Then the peers you are connected to have pretty slow connections . I was able to max out a torrent at a whopping 60MB/s , downloading a file of 8GB in a matter of minutes . That was also when they had the 20 peers per torrent limit . It has now been increased to 40 per torrent , which means better speeds ( assuming the people you are connected to have slow connection ) . <p> At first feralhosting can seem a bit confusing , but I think I am getting the hang of it and so far it seems reasonable.I am of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this whole seedbox deal , but I am also pleased with the service ( especially for the low price they offer ) . <p> I have yet to find a host that matches their plans and prices . <p> Right now the page is down : ( - which sucks . Ca n't connect to anything unfortunately . Might be the firewall where I work , not sure though.They have been having some DNS issues , but it should be fixed very soon and then there will be no connection problems . : ) <p> On a side note I can mention that the reason why you ca n't reach the site is because your DNS has n't been updated , the " problem " is in other word not server side and there is nothing feral can do to speed up the update process . AFAIK no DNS updates take more than 72hrs , so everyone should be able to fully access the site/servers within a day or so . <p> EDIT : For some reason , the peer limit is 20 on some torrents and 40 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way ? Could it have something to do with the torrents size ? The torrent which is &lt;1GB has a maximum peer limit of 40 , but the larger torrent ( 5GB+ ) has a limit of 20 . <p> Rart <p> 08-10-2009 , 03:14 PM <p> The site seems to be down atm =/ <p> I have one question for you lemon , will you guys be affected by the new change in OVH plans ? <p> Lemon <p> 08-10-2009 , 05:47 PM <p> I 'm not in any way racking down on you , I am just giving suggestions to try to improve the service for the users . <p> It 's very much appreciated . I do consider all the feedback given and really , this has come up a few times . The " 9+ " is confusing and could be replaced with something a bit clearer . However I 'm in the school of thought that I really should be investing ahead in having many more servers up and ready available . Bring on the 15 minute set up times ( basically the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes ) ! <p> EDIT : For some reason , the peer limit is 20 on some torrents and 40 on others . Does anyone have any idea why it is this way ? Could it have something to do with the torrents size ? The torrent which is &lt;1GB has a maximum peer limit of 40 , but the larger torrent ( 5GB+ ) has a limit of 20 . <p> There is n't anything to say " less peers for larger torrents " in rTorrent or Transmission as far as I 'm aware . It could be quite simply a matter of not having that many peers available for the torrent -- ca n't make them want to connect to you . <p> The site seems to be down atm =/ <p> DNS issues ( DNS is hosted at Leaseweb currently ) . Refreshing constantly until until it decides it does want to work seems to get things working just fine . <p> I have one question for you lemon , will you guys be affected by the new change in OVH plans ? <p> Only the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better than before but only time will tell . I plan to double the disk space on the speed plans and then sell off the old Kimsufi L servers that I have on a first come first server basis . <p> redguard <p> 08-10-2009 , 06:43 PM <p> ' DNS issues ' <p> Open a command line prompt and type ' ipconfig /flushdns ' . That should clear it , and it should also flush the toilet , he he he . <p> Lemon <p> 08-10-2009 , 08:00 PM <p> ' DNS issues ' <p> Open a command line prompt and type ' ipconfig /flushdns ' . That should clear it , and it should also flush the toilet , he he he . <p> Ahhh unfortunately it 's nothing to do with your own computer . It 's all Leaseweb 's side of things as they 're running it . <p> I think things have cleared up now , should be OK within 24 hours . <p> monkeyseat <p> 08-10-2009 , 09:22 PM <p> There is n't anything to say " less peers for larger torrents " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could be quite simply a matter of not having that many peers available for the torrent -- ca n't make them want to connect to you.I 've been doing some testing and it appears as if rtorrent automatically places a limit of 20 peers per torrent when leeching and then bumps it up to 40 once it starts seeding . <p> Is it possible to change the limit manually ? As I said , I 'm not out to hog resources , but would n't it be possible for you to put out a global connection limit and then let the users decide how they want to distribute them ? I 'd prefer running a single torrent with 50 or maybe even up to 100 peers than a whole bunch of torrents with 20 peers each . <p> Also , do you offer RSS support ( in form of RSSDler or similar ) ? I added an RSS feed to the webGUI of rtorrent , but apparantly it is simply an RSS-reader which displays new torrents . <p> Lemon <p> 08-11-2009 , 06:52 AM <p> Is it possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not out to hog resources , but would n't it be possible for you to put out a global connection limit and then let the users decide how they want to distribute them ?

On the Power Plan ( 160gb storage gigabit for $25/month ) <p> Down speeds go from 2-7MB/s . Up speeds on a somewhat active torrent is between 1-2.5MB/s . Tried a speed test on the FTP to wget a file from another server and that averaged at about 9MB/s . <p> I really like the fact that they have an active IRC channel , with staff there to help if needed . <p> I tried them out for a month . They were n't for me , since they did n't allow any additional program installations outside of what came with the server . Other than that , speeds were decent and so was support . I 'd recommend them if you 're just looking to torrent and willing to use their software package . <p> ovhftw <p> 08-21-2009 , 10:49 PM <p> For price Ferahosting offers it 's best seedbox I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan.First week speeds was not that great , but then they slowly picked up and now it 's averega 10-30 MB/s down speed and same with uploud.Best results was like 50 MB/s UP/ 55 MB/s DOWN simultaneously couple of days ago .

I had a shared box with 6 other i believe but not matter what i could never get the speeds i expected , which was at least 5&gt;10MB/s on brand new torrents from a top private tracker . I have now moved to Customseedbox.com and am very happy .

Sorry for my bad english btw . <p> tehKitten <p> 03-28-2010 , 06:25 PM <p> I have the " Speed " slot for more than a week now , and I think it 's awesome ! I get 10MB up and down at max. ( 10MegaByte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner ( Joshua , Lemon in the IRC channel ) did n't see the payment , so I gave him the payment number ( or how you call it ) and I had access to my slot within 5 minutes ! The support is awesome , most of the time you got an answer within 10 minutes . You do n't have to do it with one client , rTorrent . If you still want to you can use it with wTorrent or ruTorrent . You can also choose Transmission or Deluge as an client . I prefer Transmission with a Remote , so it looks and feels like a torrent client running at your home pc . <p> I asked to install Irssi on my slot , and they did it without any questions . In that way you can run an IRC bot . I have now an IRC bot running with only triggers , but you can use it for files too ! You got full SSH access to your slot . <p> Rapidleech is also allowed to run on your slot . you can use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the plan I chose has also unlimited traffic . <p> The downtime is like 10 minutes every 4-5 days , but still , it 's the most awesome price/quality hosting I have ever seen on teh intrawebs ! <p> faster04 <p> 03-28-2010 , 06:44 PM <p> anyone here tried the new BURST offer on feral ? ? <p> Does it still suffer from the slow transfer problems as the previous plans ? <p> I 've had the Burst Plan for 2 1/2 weeks now , and I got to say it 's fantastic !

External traffic is still unlimited but I save 5GBP compared to Neon . But Neon is a good deal by itself since you 'll have more than 4x the HDD space to use compared to Speed ... that is , if you do n't mind the 5GBP difference . <p> Thelen <p> 07-22-2010 , 06:29 AM <p> The specs of the server they use for the 101Mbps slots is : Some quad xeon 8GB ram 11x1TB hdd Gbit NIC , with iptables being used to limit each user to 101Mbps ( so it wo n't help to just run multiple torrent clients , they limit PER USER ) 2-6 users per HDD , average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to their old/discontinued plans , BUT you get a tonne more space . I never saw more than 5MB/s in either direction , the load on the server was just too high ( lack of RAM , 30 users 8GB is too little ) . Apart from that , had a small issue with setup , had to manually make a ticket for Joshua/Lemon to fix it , but shit happens it was fixed in 24 hours . <p> For speed I 'd definitely recommend other providers , but if you just want to seed 2-3MB/s ( 6TB a month roughly ) then it might work . Of course , you can also get OVH based services that are unmetered with far less users per server , so depends if you want the space or not . <p> freak12345 <p> 07-22-2010 , 09:05 AM <p> The specs of the server they use for the 101Mbps slots is : Some quad xeon 8GB ram 11x1TB hdd Gbit NIC , with iptables being used to limit each user to 101Mbps ( so it wo n't help to just run multiple torrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HDD , average of 30 users per server . <p> Overall the speed sucks compared to their old/discontinued plans , BUT you get a tonne more space .

They sound like I 'm listening to my music through a tin can .. so I 'm looking for something with a better frequency range that is n't like 100$+ . I listen to mainly metal/rock/alternative stuff so treble clarity is more important than bass . : mellow : <p> Skiz <p> 11-30-2008 , 08:05 PM <p> I have sorta big ears and the Apple ear buds fall right out of my ears , so I go some of these . They are made by Philips and only cost something like $20 . The sound is far beyond any other ear bud I 've ever used and they come with the soft , removable over-the-ear part as well . They are a couple of years old , but Philips still likely makes a good ear piece . <p> http : **28;1435;TOOLONG <p> FX2908 <p> 11-30-2008 , 09:39 PM <p> Sennheiser PX100 - i use those and they are gorgeous : ) <p> Skiz <p> 11-30-2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are gorgeous : ) <p> Those are n't ear buds . <p> Sanka113 <p> 11-30-2008 , 10:45 PM <p> Honestly , with an Ipod touch you really do n't need headphones that cost more than $50 . With the limited soundquality that the ipod outputs combined with typical mp3 quality an expensive set of headphones wo n't really be all that much better . For the money I 'd recommend going with the cheapest set of Senniheusers with the foam fitting earbuds if you need comfort , or the 2nd tier Skull Candy 's if your ok with rubber tips . <p> S !

Compare and contrast them on bestbuy.ca 's website with some of the other headphones they have on there . They 've got some pretty descent specs and good reviews too . <p> leaveapath <p> 12-04-2008 , 08:09 AM <p> i 've been using sennheiser cx300 and they 're really great for the price , i 'd recommend them <p> Deadrock <p> 12-05-2008 , 12:22 AM <p> The Sennheiser CX300 are really good for their price . You can also look for Creative EP630 , they look very similar to the CX300 but should be cheaper . If you prefer a lot of bass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12-05-2008 , 01:39 AM <p> I use a $15 pair and they 're good enough for my burned out ears . There called " Skull Candy " and you can get them at most electronic stores , Staples had them for $10 after thanksgiving so I bought two extras . The reason I like them so much is my work was very noisy and I could take those sqeezable ear plugs they give you ( the straight cylindrical kind ) , cut them in half with a razor blade , and punch a hole in the middle with a punch set I bought at a crafts place . When squeezed down and placed into the ear canal they expand and really block the sound from outside so I do n't have to turn the music up loud and burn out my batteries in 4 hours , not too mention my poor ears . <p> That 's rich . They give out awful earbuds for free with their $300 product , then push quality ones on you for an addition $80. : dry : <p> Make 's a lot of sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 12-09-2008 , 01:16 PM <p> I got really nice pair of Phillips for my Zune , and I 'm in love with them . The sound quality is just amazing for earbuds ( actually they 're the in-the-ear style , which are so much better than earbuds in my opinion , they form a nice seal in the ear which I like ) . <p> I do n't have them with me right now , but I 'll post the model tomorrow . I believe they were either $35 or $40 . <p> So I would defintely check out some in that brand . I am ordering a pair of Sennheiser earbuds(in-ear) soon , but I just ca n't imagine them sounding much better than the ones I have now . But I like Sennheiser a lot ( got a really nice pair of cans ) so I want to try out their earbuds . <p> Appzalien <p> 12-09-2008 , 03:52 PM <p> You would never catch me paying the mega bucks for ear buds from BOSE or Sienhauser . I do n't care how great they sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an extremely fragile tiny wire is just inexusable to me . The first time you accidentally tug on that wire and destroy one side of your stereo , you 'll be crying all the way to the bank to get money to by a new set . Mine are always throw aways , its just practical . <p> Funkin ' <p> 12-10-2008 , 04:51 AM <p> That 's your opinion . Some of us like paying a few extra dollars to have our music sound just that much better . I do agree that the Bose earbuds are a complete rip off for the quality they offer . My girl bought , and for $99 ( which really is n't " mega bucks " ) , I was expecting something much more . You 're paying for the name . But the Sennheiser in-ears that I 'm looking at , are the CX300 and CX400 , and they are $50 and $60 . And for quality Sennheiser , I think those are very descent prices . <p> Anyways , the Phillips I have are the SHE 9500 . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out . And that $30 is less than what I paid for them by a few dollars . <p> Artemis <p> 12-10-2008 , 11:05 AM <p> I prefer Skullcandy earphones myself , and have Skullcandy Smokin Buds for my MP3 player . Skullcandy design a set of earphones specifically for the iPhone/iPod touch and their headphone designs are some of the best with rave reviews .

And then tries to fabricate multiple " tiers " of hdmi cables when they 're really all the same ? Would n't exactly be a company I would exactly trust to give an anywhere near decent bang for your buck . <p> At any rate , I 've had a great experience with the Klipsch Image S4 earbuds . A helluva lot cheaper than the monster earbuds ( and cheaper than most high end earbuds ) yet provide great sound rivaling earbuds 4-5x its price . The only downside is that the cable is a little flimsy and does n't seem like it would be as durable as others , although I have n't had issues as of yet . <p> jamankhan <p> 02-27-2011 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earbuds for my iPod touch ( it has the update so it is bluetooth compatible ) ?

I got up at 5am this morning , got a train , plane and then taxi to here then worked for ages on an empty stomach . Dinner was going to be epic .

Steam Link appears to just do the basics : $40 for hardware that will stream your Steam games to your television at up to 1080 and 2.0 sound . <p> Nvidia Shield TV is an entire system . It runs on Android . It can be your local Plex media server , you can put Kodi on it straight from the Play Store , it does all the standard media streaming as well like Netflix , YouTube , HULU , HBO , ( etc x 1000 .... think Roku ) , as well as games . So it has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular games or you can subscribe to something for a monthly fee that allows you to play them . Or like I just discovered you can play all the stuff already on your PC . So I 've only tested three of my games so far , but those three are from different sources : GTA V ( Steam ) , BF3 ( Origin ) , and Fallout 4 ( independent ? ) . <p> But on top of all those additional capabilities , it 's more powerful , does 4K , full surround capable , comes with a remote with a mic for voice activated stuff and searching .

Thanks . <p> In short , you ca n't " make " what you 'd call a high quality picture out of a low-resolution one . That only happens on CSI .

I did notice on YouTube that my non-HD video was uploaded and displayed by someone else this time as an HD video . Guess video can be converted to HD but not pics ... weird as video is a sequence of many pics . <p> You are asking a loaded question ... Example , If you have a old photo/picture of family members ( color not black and white ) , and you take it to a professional photographer known to edit and fill in colors , and charge you a arm and a leg , you sure can improve the quality of the photo .. ( I have done it many times on old family photos for special occasions ) But trying it yourself ..

But you can alter the photos in such a way that would n't look weired upscaled . The most simplest of the techniques would be to first upscale the pic to your desired resolution then apply the blur ( there are many types of blurring , you have to select the one that suits your pic ) and finally alter the " levels " There are numerous scripts for Photoshop/GIMP to remove noise from the image ( blurring ) with tons of different settings .

@@22459301 @2459301/ <p> I think the number one problem with usenet at the moment is that it seems far too daunting for new users . Even with guides , the massive amount of terminology and programs are a lot to take in , even for someone experienced in filesharing . I 'll try to keep this guide as short and to the point as possible , so hopefully even a complete idiot can understand it <p> The three things you need to start using Newsgroups : <p> Newsgroup Provider Client Indexer <p> Newsgroup Provider : Essentially a massive collection of servers that automagically download everything uploaded to usenet , and then allow you to download it from them . Three things to look for:Retention : How long the files are kept the servers.Connections : How many threads you can download from simultaneously . Usually 10 is good enough to max a home connection.SSL : Whether they allow you to DL from a SSL port or not . <p> Client : Simply a program that provides a GUI and connects to the server so you can download your desired file from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in RAR and PAR archives . RAR archives contain the files you want , and if they are incomplete ( servers store 100 ( 1000 ? ) s of terabytes every day , somtimes they screw up ) , the PAR archives are used to repair them . The great thing about these programs is that they will automatically repair the files if need be , automatically extract them for you , and then delete the archives . Pretty neat , huh ? <p> Most of the settings for different clients , so for the sake of brevity I 'll let you play around with them . Some things to pay attention to would be the maximum download speed , and where you wish to have the files extracted to . <p> Finally , the most important thing is setting up your client to connect to a server ( namely your provider ) . You will need to obtain the server address and the username and password that your newsgroup provider gives you . You will also want to specify a different port number if you wish to DL from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections you want to use . <p> Some examples of clients : SABnzbd , Grabit , Alt.binz , Newsbin <p> I personally recommend SABnzbd , it is very lightweight and free as well . <p> Indexer : This is just where NZB files are indexed . You can think of it this way : The provider is akin to Rapidshare , and the indexer is similar to Warez-bb . The indexer just helps you find files , and technically you do n't really need one , but to not use one is far more complicated and technical . There are two main types of indexers : <p> Auto Indexed Sites such as NZBindex , Binsearch , and Supersearch are auto indexers . This means it automatically indexes everything posted on usenet , including the spam . Similar to public torrent sites , while the selection is far more extensive , there are always the spam , fake and dupe posts that you must watch out for . <p> User Indexed Sites such as FST , NZBs.org , DOGnzb and nzb.su are user indexed . That means that actual users hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and index them on the site . Similar to private torrent sites , you can be assured the validity of the files . However , indexers are human and wo n't index everything , so you ca n't be assured the breadth and variety you would see on auto indexer . <p> NZB files These are handy little files that have made it far easier to download from usenet . I 'm not exactly sure of the technical aspects , but rest assured they have made usenet a far more user friendly experience .

@@22459328 @2459328/ <p> The US government hauled two members of the " most notorious Internet ' release ' group of the last decade " into court this month for a trialbut when it ended on Friday , both men walked away free . <p> The two men were Adil Cassim of California and Matthew Chow of Texas . According to the government , both had been active members of a prelease ripping groups called " Rabid Neurosis " ( RNS ) . RNS existed from 1997 through 2007 , at which point members hastily dissolved after European police snatched one of their servers . In the decade of its existence , RNS released nearly 18,000 copyrighted sound recordings onto the Internet , many of them before their official release . <p> The group was allegedly headed by Cassim , who went by the handle " Kali . " The group 's rippers included radio DJs , buyers who purchased albums from stores or countries with early release dates , and a pair of workers at a North Carolina CD manufacturing plant that made discs for Universal . <p> As for Chow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was first asked to spice up the art in the group 's . nfo files included with each RNS rip . Later , he allegedly served as a ripper , buying discs legally the day they were released and then ripping and uploading them . " Private financial gain " <p> While we focus most commonly on civil copyright infringement lawsuits and the massive damages at issue in those cases , this case was a bit different . This time , the federal government went after RNS and hit the group 's members with criminal conspiracy charges ( max of five years in jail and a $250,000 fine , along with possible restitution ) . According to US law , such charges could be brought only if a person 's behavior was done for one of the following three reasons : <p> * For purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain * By the reproduction or distribution , including by electronic means , during any 180-day period , of one or more copies or phonorecords of one or more copyrighted works , which have a total retail value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work being prepared for commercial distribution , by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public , if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution <p> Note that the government did not charge anyone with actual counts of copyright infringement ; the charge was simply conspiracy , and whether or not the group actually managed to infringe copyrights was a separate matter . <p> The government alleged that RNS members violated not one , but all three of the legal provisions cited above . The second and third items are fairly clear , but more interesting was the government 's insistence that all of this work done for a decade was performed for purposes of " private financial gain . " It does not appear that members of the group made money from their work , but the US copyright law so broadly defines " private financial gain that it can apply to " the receipt of other copyrighted works . " <p> The government claimed that RNS members were given access to huge bodies of infringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive software and movies still in the theater . <p> The group was busted up in 2007 , when FBI agents executed a search warrant on Cassim 's house and rounded up other RNS members . Several of those arrested pleaded guilty to the charges and in fact went to trial last week as witnesses for the government , testifying against Cassim and Chow . But Cassim and Chow decided to take their chances at trial , which got underway two weeks ago in a Texas federal court . <p> Before the trial began , Cassim 's lawyers filed an intriguing motion asking the judge to ban the government from using the term " music piracy . " <p> " The term ' music piracy ' is not evidentiary and , thus , has no probative value , " said the filing . " The term only serves to label the accused a ' pirate , ' a highly inflammatory label . Therefore , Cassim asks that the court order the government to refrain from using the term ' music piracy ' and to instruct its witnesses not to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The motion was denied . <p> The government brought out FBI special agents who had conducted forensic research on Cassim 's hard drive . It offered up evidence from an interview with Chow in March 2009 in which he " admitted to purchasing music CDs , copying them , and distributing music to other members of RNS on the Internet . " It also featured encrypted IRC chat logs of group members discussing operations and deciding to wind down RNS as the feds moved in . Not guilty <p> But last Friday , when the matter was sent to the jury , a unanimous decision came back : not guilty . The government had not met its burden of proof on the conspiracy charge . <p> In a statement issued by Chow 's lawyer , Chow said , " I am relieved by the jury 's verdict and I am grateful to my attorney for his hard work . We encountered some extremely complex factual and legal issues in this case . The jury was very attentive during the trial . Their verdict was just . " <p> The RIAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this decision is an anomaly . For context , during the last six years , the Justice Department has brought music piracy criminal copyright cases against 22 defendants who were involved in a variety of prerelease ripping groups like RNS and Apocalypse Production Crew .

Super Thanks to OP <p> zzzpt <p> 01-25-2014 , 10:51 PM <p> I was having a problem with my IPV6 connection over Teredo , after some failed attempts of using gogoclient ( because it blocks port 119 ) , I figured out that my teredo connection was using the ' **25;3203;TOOLONG ' server . <p> According to this : LONG ... <p> As we reported earlier , the host name for Microsoft 's Teredo server ( **25;3230;TOOLONG ) does n't resolve currently . This is appearantly part of a " test " to measure the impact of the service being turned off . As an alternative , Microsoft still offers the " test.ipv6.microsoft.com " hostname to connect to it 's Teredo servers .

Simply read the entire thread , the last post is priceless . <p> You should be able to use it . The speed is OK but the retention is where free tweak shines . I think it is the same as a paid Tweaknews account , 800-1100 days . <p> Xennanews has been offline for weeks now . I hope it is n't gone for good . I heard something about the XSNews IPv6 free server run has ended . Could be related ? I do n't know . <p> Be sure to also use port 119 after you turn off SSL . I forgot that and SABnzbd would n't connect ... <p> many thanks for sharing setting for xennanews . <p> sandman1 <p> 04-16-2015 , 11:58 PM <p> I have updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not using this free Usenet service , that you check it out .

@@22459334 @2459334/ <p> BitMeTV is widely considered to be the best tracker for TV series . It holds an unbelievable amount of series , and is a must of every TV junkie . Episodes are usually uploaded to the tracker within minutes after their release , and there 's also a requests section for specific torrents . Initial versions are usually the basic 350MB/45min episodes , followed by HDTV versions for most popular series . The interface of BitMeTV is very good , and makes it easy to find what you want . The coding of the site and tracker appears to be excellent - they are both very stable , with almost zero downtime . <p> Categories : <p> BitMeTV contains a huge amount of categories , some of which are general ( News/Drama/Cartoons etc. ) , while others are more specialized categories for certain ( popular ) TV series . <p> Forums : <p> The forums are very much alive and contain the usual categories . <p> Invites : <p> Recently ( Sep-28-07 ) , the invite policy was changed , apparently due to abuse of the invite system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up to 3 invites at a time . Used invite slots are automatically renewed every 30 days depending on the ratio and downloaded amount in the 30 days prior to the invite renewal , according to the following " formula " : <p> While there are a lot of BitMeTV invites out there , most newcomers may find it somewhat difficult to get one . This is probably caused by the fact that BitMeTV staff is known for their strict and efficient approach towards trading , and even towards free invites giveaways on public forums . Most BitMeTV members will think twice ( and often more than that ) before handing out an invite , especially to people they do not know . <p> Staff : <p> While it is generally a good idea not to cheat / trade / defy tracker rules in any way , BitMeTV is one of the trackers you really do n't want to do that on . The staff openly states that they scan all the major invite boards in search of invite posts and trades . If they catch you defying one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be banned ! Based on that , some people tend to fear the BitMeTV staff , as they have a reputation of people you do not want to mess with . That being said , I have to note that from my own personal experience , in the few times I 've been in their support channel on IRC , they 've been more than courteous and helpful . <p> Donations : <p> The tracker contains 2 different donation paths . First path is a simple donation , where the donators get an Elite status for a certain amount of time and a cute star next to their names . The second path is donation in exchange to upload credit . <p> Additional Available Features <p> RSS feed , IRC ( see site for details ) . <p> Additional Information <p> Download speeds are very high , as there seems to be an abundance of members with seedboxes / fast internet connections . To effectively upload on BitMeTV , it is advisable to catch the torrent very early after it is uploaded to the tracker , as after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hunders of seeders/leechers , and then it becomes an all out war . For the same reason , uploading can be somewhat difficult to people with small internet pipes . Every user can upload Made-for-TV torrents , other stuff must be approved by a moderator ( read : you ca n't upload non-TV material ) .

I knew I did n't  want any STDs . I was protecting myself in the proper ways to not catch STDs , the ways I was taught .

Also , some things like MP3s are often posted without any pars , so a person without a fill server needs a provider with good completion .

I strongly suspect that the main reason that Blocknews/UsenetNow and Ngroups/Usenetnews recently switched from Highwinds to Readnews was to save money , as other factors like completion and retention can be highly variable over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a substantial achievement that a small company like Readnews can beat a much larger provider such as Highwinds in retention , completion , and price , as Highwinds has the obvious economy-of-scale advantage . <p> Originally Posted by mesaman <p> I noticed that ' news.us.usenet-news.net ' ( **28;4183;TOOLONG ) resolves to 2 IP addresses , and that .14 ( reader1 in banner ) seems to have better completion than .71 ( reader7 in banner ) . Readnews shuffles their servers around and that could change before you know it . <p> Good to know , I was n't even trying any of those IP-address tricks revealed earlier . <p> Originally Posted by Beck38 <p> Highwinds started the long , winding road to .... when then moved out of Phoenix to the tech corridor outside Washington , D.C.

This weeks award goes to Blocknews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I remember that - Highwinds ' Phoenix server was usually pretty good . Then they shut down their New York and Phoenix servers and migrated everyone to the Atlanta farm they acquired when they bought Usenetserver a few months earlier , and things quickly went downhill , but finally improved again after the move to DC the following year . Retention , which had been stagnant for over two years while Highwinds was busy buying up companies , started climbing again and continues to increase to this day . <p> Server maintenance and upkeep -or lack of- is certainly a central reason for why problems occur . Perhaps it 's no coincidence that not long after Highwinds bought Usenetserver and Easynews , both went through a long stretch of hard times . After all , when it comes down to a choice between paying the bank loan or replacing aging hardware , we all know which takes priority . It seems that in their thirst to expand , Highwinds bit off more than they could chew , so maybe we should all be glad that ( as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few years , and are instead concentrating on servicing what they already own . I doubt that Highwinds could afford running any more companies into the ground , like they did with Easynews a couple of years ago .

@@22459392 @2459392/ <p> This guide was made for EAC version 1.0 beta 3 and will not completely work with earlier versions . Versions 0.99 or earlier should use the blowfish guide . <p> Anything with a green outline around it is a required setting . Anything orange is required but depends on your drive . Anything unmarked is optional . <p> This is meant to be a no-frills guide with little extra info . A more comprehensive ( but outdated ) guide can be found here:http : //blowfish.be/eac <p> Step 1 : Download and install EAC Download the installer and fire it up . <p> Eventually you 'll get to a screen like this . Make sure you install AccurateRip , CDRDAO , CTDB , and freedb as a bare minimum . FLAC will be useful as well if you do n't have it separately installed . GD3 is only useful if you want to pay for metadata results . I assume you do n't . <p> Step 2 : Start EAC <p> When you first start EAC , you 'll see a screen like this one . Hit " Cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , preferably not one that was recently released ( a few months old at least ) . You 'll see a window like the one below appear . If you have an older version of EAC or dBpoweramp installed , it 's likely AccurateRip was already configured , and this may not appear . <p> Hit Configure . It may take a few minutes . Hit " Ok " afterward . Once again , if you have an older version of EAC or dBpoweramp installed , it 's likely AccurateRip was already configured , and this may not appear . <p> Step 3 : EAC Options All of the options dialogs can be found from the EAC menu at the top of the screen . <p> Start with EAC Options . Any tabs not pictured are completely optional settings , or are irrelevant to ripping . <p> Make sure you set the green highlighted settings as shown . If you 're using an older version of EAC , make sure " No use of null samples for CRC calculations is UNCHECKED . The rest is optional , choose as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a bad idea though . <p> These settings are pretty much all optional and self explanatory . I 'd recommend using Alternate CD play routines and disabling autostart though . <p> The " Create log files always in english language " is very important for our international users . This will let you keep EAC 's language as your native one , but write the log file in English , allowing it to pass our logchecker without needing to be rescored manually . <p> If your drive is capable of reading UPC/ISRC codes and CD-Text ( you can only really figure this out by trial and error ) , you 're welcome to keep the top two options checked . Otherwise , uncheck them . <p> Other than that , these settings are pretty much ideal . I would n't recommend using more than 1 compressor thread even if you have a multicore computer . It does n't take very long compared to the track extraction anyway . Note that in tests run by punkmeup , disabling the queue of external compressors in the background fixed an issue where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've made that a required option . It should have no bearing on the rip quality . If rip queueing works for you ( it does for me ) , feel free to leave it enabled . <p> Friends do n't let friends normalize their EAC rips . Do n't ever do it . It will instantly be given a 0% by the logchecker . <p> This is the proper way to name tracks . The only difference acceptable here would be perhaps %tracknr2%. %title% if you prefer periods instead of dashes in the filenames . If you need track numbers to go into triple digits for some reason , use %tracknr3% instead . <p> A note on directory naming schemes : Do n't use a directory structure here , unless you want to go back and edit your CUE sheet later . When you add a directory to the naming scheme , it 'll put that directory path into the files . Then when someone goes to burn the files in EAC using your cuesheet , they 'll be unable to do so . If you do insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back , edit the CUE in a program such as notepad , and remove the folder name from each line . <p> Start by hitting " Detect Read Features ... " . This will actually take a few minutes . The only feature detection that actually matters is Accurate Stream . If your drive can use it , checkmark the setting ( most modern drives have Accurate Stream ) . If it ca n't , do n't . <p> Even if your drive does n't cache audio , just do us a favour and leave that checked . Not only will it stop you from having to have each of your uploads rescored by hand , but it does n't affect the audio quality at all . Yes , the rips take a bit longer with that setting enabled . Go watch TV or something while you wait . <p> Do not use C2 , even if EAC thinks you can . Most drives have terrible C2 error implementation . <p> If you did the AccurateRip configuration at the start of this guide , the top half here will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find your read offset correction from this list . Do n't use a combined read/write offset . <p> If you want to figure out whether your drive needs " Overread into Lead-in and Lead-Out " checked , you can check by temporarily unchecking " Use AccurateRip with this drive " . Stick a CD in the drive and hit " Detect read sample offset correction ... " . If you 're just doing this for the Overread , see below : <p> Originally Posted by blowfish.be <p> Check " Overread Lead-In and Lead-Out " only if the test result says that your drive can overread from both the Lead-In and Lead-Out , or if it says Lead-Out and your offset correction is positive , or if it says Lead-In and your offset correction is negative . Otherwise disable ( uncheck ) it . <p> Remember to check " Use AccurateRip with this drive " again once you 're finished . AccurateRip is always a good idea . <p> Pretty much every drive should work with the settings shown . If yours stalls on detecting gaps or detects gaps that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-live album ) , try Detection method B or C. If A , B , and C all fail , you can switch " Secure " to " Accurate " and try again . <p> Step 5 : Metadata Options <p> Here 's where you pick your metadata provider . If you did install GD3 , it 'll be in the list . You can only rip 10 discs before you have to pay for a subscription though . Otherwise , you have a choice between the MusicBrainz plugin ( CTDB ) , freedb plugin and EAC 's native freedb support . I 'm not really sure what the big difference is , I 'm guessing it 's the cover+lyrics . Anyway , change those settings above if you wish . <p> If you use EAC 's native freedb instead , the settings should look like this . Make sure you put an email at the top , it does n't need to be real . Hit " Get active freedb server list " . Then checkmark the last option . <p> Step 6 : Compression Options <p> Set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browse to the path where you have flac.exe , if you installed it with EAC it 's in C : Program Files ( x86 ) Exact Audio CopyFLACflac.exe . If you installed it separately it 's wherever you installed it . The bitrate and high/low quality have no effect on the rip . <p> The commandline parameters have changed in this version , so this will look new to most of you . The commandline recommended for optimal completeness is this : <p> Also , as of Beta 3 you may use the %tracknr1% variable instead of %tracknr% if you would like to have no leading zeroes in the track number field ( like XLD does ) . tracknr1 will use , for example , ' 1 ' instead of ' 01 ' . <p> A note on ripping to lossy formats like MP3 : So first off , this is a complete waste of time . In most cases , EAC is overkill for lossy files , and takes far too long to rip the CD to be practical . If your goal is to upload tracks here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then use a program like dBpoweramp to convert that rip to the other formats . Even if you do n't need a FLAC ( one already exists on site , or this is for your personal collection only ) , it 'll still be much faster to rip using any other program , and wo n't produce an audibly different result unless your CD has skips and bad scratches . <p> However , the MP3 and Ogg command lines are included below . You 'll need to browse to LAME.exe or oggenc2.exe , and set the extension to . mp3 or . ogg , respectively . The other settings remain the same , bitrate is still irrelevant . <p> Congrats ! EAC is now properly set up ! You may wish to save your settings in a profile by hitting " New " at the bottom of the screen . However , unless you 're changing your settings frequently there 's no need , EAC will remember all of this on next launch regardless . <p> Step 7 : Tagging <p> So now let 's look at the main window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these will be the tags on your ripped files . If you 're ripping a classical CD , you may wish to fill in the Composer/Performer fields . <p> Drag a cover image into the EAC window . I think 500x500 is a decent size in most cases . Google images is your friend here . <p> If you 're ripping a box set , you may wish to use the options under the cover image , otherwise leave them all as " 1 " . <p> Finally , if you want to add lyrics to the tracks , use the " Lyrics " button . <p> Note : I 've also highlighted the " New " button where you can save your settings . This is not a necessary step each time you rip . <p> Step 8 : Gap Detection and Cuesheets <p> The pre-rip stuff happens here . Make sure " Append Gaps to Previous Track ( default ) " is checked . It should be . Next , hit the options in the order shown . <p> First , hit " Detect Gaps " . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do not complete this step . If the first track is highlighted in red , you have a hidden track . You 'll want to look at this section of the blowfish.be guide . <p> Next , go to Create CUE Sheet -&gt; Multiple WAV Files With Gaps ... ( Noncompliant ) . This is usually where I create the folder for ripping as well . Do NOT rip your tracks to any directory containing your name . You should NEVER edit a log for any reason , especially now that we have checksums . A simple C : EAC Rips is fine . <p> However , as long as it contains the album name and no nested folders ( do n't do ArtistAlbum ) , you 're fine by the rules here . <p> Anyway , make the folder , save the . cue file into it . I usually just name mine Noncompliant.cue , it does n't really matter . <p> Step 9 : Ripping <p> Finally , the rip itself ! Make sure all the tracks are checkmarked in the main window unless there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Copy -&gt; Compressed . <p> Depending on your drive and whether or not the CD is scratched , this could take anywhere from ten minutes to four hours . Be patient . <p> Step 10 : Post-Rip <p> So you 're done ! You may wish to use a logchecker to check and make sure your rip is proper , but if you followed this guide , the only possible errors would be with the CD itself . It does happen ... some CDs are too badly damaged , even for EAC . Your best bet is to clean the CD and try again . <p> Other than that , it never hurts to make sure your files are tagged and named properly ( though they should be ) . Any extra stuff you want to include should be added now as well ... Additional artwork , an md5 fingerprint , an info.txt file , that sort of thing . <p> Appendix A : CueTools Plugin ( Optional ) <p> This is now installed by selecting " CTDB " in the EAC 1.0b3 options . Therefore , this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to update the plugin by hand to a newer version . <p> Starting with version 1.0b1 , EAC now supports plugins ! While they 've so far been few and far between , the CueTools plugin is quite handy . Not only does it give you a second opinion past the AccurateRip database and include the CueTools hash in the log , but it also gives you an option to get metadata from MusicBrainz if you prefer it to freedb . <p> Installation : Extract the files to EAC 's root directory ( containing EAC.exe ) . Usually this is located at C : Program Files ( x86 ) Exact Audio Copy . <p> Usage : None , it works automatically . You can check whether it 's installed under EAC Options-&gt;Audio Plugins . If you wish to use MusicBrainz , go to Metadata Options and select " CUETools DB Metadata Plugin " from the list . <p> Last edited by caaok ; 10-14-2011 at 08:26 PM . <p> Originally Posted by whatcdfan <p> u are somewhat fairer then the last occasions but still pal i give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  need anything from u or optimuscrime i get what i want coz u 2 guyes do n't  own bittorrent and i do n't  think i portrayed any image i wrote simple english and u are seems to be very good at making assumptions if someone is not a cheater and u assume he 's a cheater and write what u wrote and when u are proven wrong who u think will owe an apology then barack obama ? ? ? ? <p> Very nice guide , everything is well-explained with screenshots to boot .

@@22459400 @2459400/ <p> FTN Review Tracker LONG ... FTN is definately one of the top 0-day trackers around . The site has some of the best pretimes along with amazing speeds on most torrents . If you are interested in movies and TV , this is definately the place for you . One of the main features that makes this tracker so unique , is that there is no ratio/download and only upload is ever counted - which means the site is basically always freeleech ! <p> Despite the low amount of seeders found on most torrents , the speeds are still amazing due to most members have seedboxes/fast connections . The content found on FTN is mostly 0-day , but there is also a huge amount of exclusive content/packs ( which I have detailed below ) . <p> The community on FTN is very nice and helpful , the IRC is always very active and friendly and a great place to go and hangout . Lots of the users there are the top in the torrenting world and have much experience/knowledge of bittorrenting . <p> The design on this tracker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best out there - It is very easy to navigate your way through the site and generally the layout is simple and nice . <p> LONG ... I have included the latest stats below . Even though there is only 900 spots left on FTN , they fill up very slowly due to the very limited available invites . <p> LONG ... Below is a look at some of the latest torrents on FTN . <p> LONG ... I have included the main rules along with downloading rules . I think they are very simple and easy to follow . <p> LONG ... FTN has very strict invite rules , which is one reason this tracker is so rare . Invites are only handed out by staff if requested by the member . FTN Power Members and above may request an invite once per month - Getting an invite usually depends on how active you are on the site and if you are seeding all the torrents according to FTN rules . Staff are also very much against trading invites and there is a good chance by doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... In my opinion , most of the FTN staff are very nice and helpful on IRC . <p> One of FTN greatest features is that ratio and download is n't counted on your account , and only the amount you upload is ! The seeding requirements are either 1:1 ratio or 36 hours seeding required , apart from that its like a continuous freeleech ! FTN also has a active and fun IRC channel available for all its members . <p> Summer update review of summer update review . Nice pictures but how is that a review ? Here let me do it for you in 50 words or less . <p> It 's a ratioless bt scene tracker . It 's sort of hard but not impossible to get into . Some people like it , some people do n't and some people are meh . The " community " is ( pick one ) good , bad , indifferent . So in effect it 's then like pretty much any place else .

@@22459445 @2459445/ <p> In 1970 , after several successful years as a nightclub comedian and frequent &amp;#39 ; Ed Sullivan Show&amp;#39 ; guest , Richard Pryor grew tired of doing what he called " white bread humor " and walked off the stage during a show at the Alladin Hotel in Las Vegas and away from a career that had been building for several years . <p> The comic moved to Berkeley , California where he discovered the writings of Malcolm X and began developing edgier material . He also developed a cocaine habit . " I&amp;#39 ; d take the dope and pretend I was Miles Davis . But I couldn&amp;#39 ; t have been a junkie because when I wanted to stop I stopped on a dime . " ( We all know that didn&amp;#39 ; t turn out to be true&amp;#33 <p> A string of hit movies ( &amp;#39 ; Silver Streak&amp;#39 ; , &amp;#39 ; Greased Lightning&amp;#39 and comedy albums in the mid-Seventies made Richard Pryor a big star . On May 5 , 1977 Pryor hosted a brilliant special on NBC featuring guests LaWanda Page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their hits without any lead vocals ) and a powerful dramatic performance by poet Maya Angelou . Pryor played his drunk " Willie " character , " Iddi Amin Dada " , and a money grubbing television evangelist " Reverend James L. White " who gets the phones ringing off the hook when he announces he&amp;#39 ; s collecting money for a &amp;#39 ; back to Africa&amp;#39 ; campaign . <p> The segment with Maya Angelou may be one of the most profound moments in television history . Starting out as a very funny comedy skit with " Willie " getting into a drunken brawl in a bar , the piece suddenly takes a harrowing ( and enlightening ) turn when Willie gets home to his wife ( Angelou ) . This is something you have to see for yourself , truly one of those moments that remind you of the power that television can have . <p> The special was a critical and ratings smash . Richard Pryor&amp;#39 ; s appearances on &amp;#39 ; Saturday Night&amp;#39 ; Live over the last few years had been numeric gold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthinkable - giving the most militant and sexually-suggestive comedian of the Seventies his own weekly television series . <p> The network only gave the star a ten-week contract , in part because there hadn&amp;#39 ; t been a successful variety show launched in half a decade . For reasons only a network executive could divine , &amp;#39 ; The Richard Pryor Show&amp;#39 ; was scheduled on Tuesday nights at 8:00 pm , opposite &amp;#39 ; Happy Days&amp;#39 ; and &amp;#39 ; LaVerne and Shirley&amp;#39 ; . Why would network executives put their most controversial and adult star on during the newly designated &amp;#39 ; Family Hour&amp;#39 ; at 8:00 , especially when they specifically promised the star that his show wouldn&amp;#39 ; t start before 9:00pm ? You tell me . <p> This move caused Richard Pryor to have second thoughts about doing a series and he reportedly broke down in an early writer&amp;#39 ; s meeting , confessing : " I bit off more than I can chew " Reduced to tears , the comedian told his new staff , " I don&amp;#39 ; t want to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can&amp;#39 ; t do this . " The writers tried to convince him that he could do something special on television , and labored for days trying to convince the comedian to change his mind and go forward with the show . Finally Pryor relented , but only to do four shows , not the ten that he originally signed for . <p> A great roster of supporting players was assembled for the variety hour : Sandra Bernhardt , Robin Williams , Marsha Warfeild , Victor DeLapp , Jimmy Martinez , Tim Reid , Paul Mooney , Argus Hamilton and &amp;#39 ; Detroit&amp;#39 ; John Witherspoon . There would be no major guest-stars . The show was produced by John Moffitt and Rocco Urbisci for Burt Sugarman Productions . <p> Battles with the network censors started as soon as the show went into production . Pryor was shocked to find out that he wouldn&amp;#39 ; t be given free rein to do whatever he wanted after signing his lucrative contract with the network . " It&amp;#39 ; s bullshit - there&amp;#39 ; s no other word for it - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about six thousand of them , to do nothing but mess with people . " The frustrated star told Ebony Magazine at the time , " The problem with censors is that they don&amp;#39 ; t like for people to communicate . I think it is on purpose and very political . A lot of silly stuff went down about anything I tried to do . It was just frustrating . " <p> To spoof the situation he found himself in , Richard Pryor appeared at the beginning of his first show stating that he will never be compromised . When the camera pulls back , you see he is naked ( actually wearing a bodystocking ) and his dick is missing . <p> NBC ordered the &amp;#39 ; offensive&amp;#39 ; scene removed , so it ran instead on the evening news on all three networks . More people saw that &amp;#39 ; censored&amp;#39 ; clip on the news than ever saw the show itself . Another skit on the first episode that caused some flack had Pryor as a flamboyant rock singer who machine guns his all-white audience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second episode featured a long , slow sequence with a woman describing a lesbian experience in the park . One of the most revealing moments of the series came during the fourth show . <p> Part of the episode was done like a &amp;#39 ; roast&amp;#39 ; , only there were no guest celebrities to roast the host , just the supporting cast . It was a long , tense television moment as the regulars either kissed the host&amp;#39 ; s ass or burnt their bridges . Pryor just looked down much of the time , acting like he was writing something down - rarely looking up or sincerely laughing . This did not appear to be a happy group . <p> After the four episodes were shot , neither the star or the network was willing to continue - &amp;#39 ; The Richard Pryor Show&amp;#39 ; was one of the lowest-rated shows of that year . &amp;#39 ; Happy Days&amp;#39 ; and &amp;#39 ; Lavern and Shirley&amp;#39 ; on the other hand , were the number one and two rated shows in 1977 . They were unbeatable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable Cunninghams . <p> NBC and Richard Pryor announced that the remainder of the contract would be made up of a series of six specials to be broadcast over the next three years . Pryor promised , " I&amp;#39 ; m going to do them the way I want and then they can kiss my behind . " The specials were never filmed . <p> Was Richard Pryor bitter about his television &amp;#39 ; career&amp;#39 ; ? No , not at all - he had this to say : " One week of truth on TV could just straighten out everything . One hundred and twenty-seven million people watch television every night ; that&amp;#39 ; s why they use it to sell stuff . They&amp;#39 ; ve misused it a long time so now it&amp;#39 ; s just a business , that&amp;#39 ; s all . They&amp;#39 ; re not going to write shows about how to revolutionize America . The top rated shows are for retarded people . " LONG ... <p> I think each show is 60 min. long . Only 4 shows though . I don&amp;#39 ; t know what 's on the third disc yet .
