In fact , new independent businesses are blossoming in all corners of the city , helping to shape what looks to be an even brighter future for Manchester 's independent community . <p> We journeyed to Manchester ( on the day that storm Doris decided to strike ) to see three of our independent boutiques , visiting the shop owners and getting to the heart of the local community . <p> Founded by a creative husband and wife duo , Rachael and Alex Otterwell , the pair have been travelling the world since 2009 piecing together the story and the products behind their boutique , Object Style based in Chorlton , Manchester . <p> We were welcomed into the beautiful boutique by Rachael and Alex , looking every inch the Object Style man and woman . With a cup of tea in hand we talked retail , Manchester and honeymooning in Palm Springs . <p> We met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BSc at Manchester Metropolitan University . After graduation , Alex carved a career in luxury retail management working for global fashion house Burberry and luxury cycling brand Rapha . I ( Rachael ) worked in travel PR before starting my own events company . <p> We spent our honeymoon visiting America and fell in love with Palm Springs , the modernist architecture is like nothing we 've ever see before . We love to travel , especially to Scandinavia and the USA , it inspires so many aspects of Object Style . <p> Brexit is naturally a very unnerving time for small businesses like us , especially when we work so hard to source unique and interesting suppliers from Europe . With this in mind , we are looking to collaborate with designers closer to home and work on producing ranges that are exclusive to Object , so watch this space . <p> What is the best thing about your boutique ? <p> Everything about Object both in our store and on our website is so carefully considered . From the layout ( easy access for pushchairs as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our walls , store front and branding . We always go off our initial gut feeling when making decisions about our brand . We love nothing more than seeing the genuine surprise on people 's faces when they see products in our store and knowing it 's probably not something they 've seen before ; then we know we 've done our jobs right . <p> Why Manchester ? What do you love about it ? <p> Manchester is such a proud city . It is fearlessly independent , supportive and has an amazing sense of community . It 's an exciting place to work and live , it can be as fast or as slow as you like . <p> How has Manchesters retail landscape- changed in the last few years ? <p> One of the key reasons we decided to open a physical store is because we felt independent retail was underrepresented in Manchester . We have a thriving foodie scene , bar culture and an abundance of amazing traditional retailers like butchers and fishmongers but small concept stores like Object are quite hard to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? <p> We are slowly building up a loyal , regular customer base who choose to shop with us in our store and online because we give good , honest customer service . We know all our customers by their first names and try where possible to go the extra mile in exceeding their expectations . For example , if someone wants a dress in a different colour to what we have available in our existing collection we offer a bespoke service and order them the colour of their choice at no extra cost . <p> Next on our tour we paid a visit to Oklahoma , one of Manchester 's biggest independent shops based in the city 's Northern Quarter . With storm Doris raging outside , we stepped into the boutique and were enveloped in riot of colour and texture which made a welcome change from the wind and rain . The brainchild of Creative Director Nicola Payne , she has pioneered Oklahoma 's signature use of colour and vibrancy which has been central to the shop 's enduring success for the last 24 years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I went to Leeds Polytechnic and studied fine art and sculpture before moving to London and doing some assistant styling work . I was really inspired by the independent shops and creative spaces in London , so much so that I decided to move to Manchester and open up my own ; I was only 23 at the time . I loved the North of England and to me Manchester was a really creative and unpretentious city . When I found a great and affordable space it seemed a very natural step . <p> Who inspires you ? <p> Creative colourful countries , especially Mexico , India , Vietnam , Morocco and Ghana , and the people there who work with their hands and live bright , colourful lives . <p> Other shop owners with their unique buying eyes , running original independent boutiques with creative displays .

I love how it is a wildly colourful Aladdin 's cave full of unusual , surprising discoveries . <p> Why Manchester ? What do you love about it ? <p> I love the city 's rough edges and the fantastic industrial buildings . Unlike London , the pace of life is n't crazy and it 's easy to escape thanks to the countryside that surrounds the city . It has always been a groundbreaking city in terms of creativity ; it has an amazing cultural history and music scene plus I have always loved the Northern wit and straight-talking nature of Mancunians . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ? <p> There are lots more independent cafes bars and restaurants opening especially in the Northern Quarter which has mean an influx of tourism . Similarly , more people are moving up from the south because of more affordable housing which means shoppers with more disposable income . The city is constantly expanding and the regeneration of once deprived areas means those places have become shopping and eating destinations . <p> With the storm still raging , we headed out of the city centre towards Bolton to visit Cassie and Bev , the mother-daughter duo behind Room 356 . In true hospitable Northern style , we were greeted by the offer of tea and cake from Cassie and Bev as we admired their immaculate boutique , smelling beautiful thanks to their latest arrival of soy candles . <p> This is our second time round of working together .

Artisans who work creatively and independently producing beautiful individual handmade products for Room 356 . <p> What do you predict for the future of retail ? <p> We think there will become much more of a balance between bricks-and-mortar and online shopping . Retail businesses with an online presence only will increasingly look to complement their online business by opening physical retail outlets or pop ups .

There is such a strong sense of community and I am just so happy that I 've chosen to start a business here . It does n't  seem competitive and people on the whole are conscious of their choices , socially and morally . <p> What are your favourite independent businesses in Lewes ? <p> Flint for homeware , clothing and the most beautiful flowers , Flint Owl for a great coffee and cake , Freight for the best knitwear and candles , From Victoria for the loveliest selection of cards and plants , and The Swan for a family-friendly Sunday pub lunch in their garden area . There is also a market on the high street every other week and you can pick up fresh flowers and local seasonal fruit and veg . <p> How has Lewes ' shopping scene changed in the last few years ? <p> The people here are much more tuned in to supporting local enterprise and although many work and may have lived in London , they still choose to shop and dine here . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is you just ca n't get so many amazing things in one small area , it is just too expensive with business rates and rents that choke the life out of small creative businesses and give them little chance of surviving . <p> How do you see the independent community changing here ? <p> It is only getting stronger and more varied . Although you do see independents closing every now and then , you see more popping up and that is so encouraging in this economical climate . The people here are so creative , but also take risks and that is why we have such a strong independent community in Lewes .

Based on principles of conscious consumerism , mindfulness and embracing nature , the slow movement has gathered momentum and popularity thanks to a network of lifestyle bloggers including A Quiet Style , Me and Orla and Circle of Pines . Beautiful photography characterised by a stillness and serenity has become synonymous with the movement , alongside handmade products crafted from natural materials . <p> Jayson , from Trouva boutique Workshop , explains the concept in more detail : <p> " For us , the concept of slow living in todays modern society is to consciously simplify our everyday lives . In 2017 , we will continue to inform by working with artisans and makers who contribute to a simpler lifestyle through considered design , functionality and sustainability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has cast a spotlight on cork , as it can be easily recycled and sustainably produced . In terms of its aesthetic qualities , cork provides a subtle warmth and can be used as a natural contrast to ceramic , glass and metal . <p> As Susannah from Dowse boutique explains , cork provides an ideal backdrop to exhibit art and prints . <p> " Cork is a wonder material sustainable with excellent eco credentials . Aesthetically it has a texture and a natural warmth to it that compliments so well with recent high trend textures such as marble and brass . <p> In our studio shop we have a wall clad in cork wallpaper and it offsets our prints and wall pieces beautifully . " <p> In 2016 , Danish label Ganni carved itself a stylish niche as a go-to label for a range of contemporary clothing , based on their popularity we believe Ganni will dominate the fashion landscape in 2017 . Whilst influenced by their Scandinavian heritage , the creative team behind Ganni are n't bound to a monochromatic colour palette ; instead colour , pattern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Merchandising , Nell , shares what she thinks has shaped Gannis success : <p> " Theres something inherently effortless about Gannis clothing ; the oversized shapes coupled with their unique use of texture , print and colour separate Ganni from other designers on the market .

Design is looking to the colour yellow for its brightening , uplifting qualities , seeking to banish the last of the gloomy cobwebs leftover from last year . <p> The owner and creative director of PAD Lifestyle in Edinburgh , Anna Atwal , advises on how best to incorporate those mellow yellows into your home . <p> " Yellow is great when used as a zesty accent colour for a muted grey and charcoal or navy Scandi scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than wall colour to keep the look modern . <p> This season I would pair bold yellow textiles and accessories with tropical palm accents from Lacroix , with an otherwise strong monochrome palette .

We 're fully on board with the rising trend for photographing shop fronts , for example Richard Lee Massey and Ellie Dyduch who beautifully document exteriors of independent shops and cafes in their local communities .

The combination of the two really compliment each other as people often come in for a coffee and buy a plant , or come in for a cushion and buy a coffee . <p> 2 . Can you tell us a bit about yourself ? <p> I studied anatomy , as I am obsessed with the body and I was brought up holistically . <p> When I finished studying I moved to Paris for 10 months before returning to London to manage a boutique in Spitalfields . I also assisted an artist and inventor in getting patents for his many inventions and I now sell one of them in the shop . We lived down the road from artists Tracey Emin ( who would complain at our many loud terrace parties ) and Gilbert and George . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gained inspiration for one of my teas at T&amp;Shop whilst working at a charity event there . An alcohol sponsor pulled out at the last minute and we ended up with an extremely revolting cava ! I bought rose jam to add to the cava and put rose petals in and it became an extremely elegant drink . Our black tea with rose petals and rose essence is now one of our best selling teas . <p> I then moved to visual merchandising and styling for the fashion company Browns but I really wanted to start my own shop which has now become a reality . <p> 3 . Who are your favorite designers/makers/artists and innovators of all time ? <p> The German industrial designer Dieter Rams For the perfect combination of form and function . <p> The designers Charles and Ray Eames It sounds a cliche but what inspires me about them is that they worked so well together as a couple and were both very different . Ray was a hoarder and liked to group things together ( which I can relate to ) whereas Charles was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of beautiful objects . They hung artworks from the ceiling as they had run out of wall space . It really was a lifeworth full of character . <p> A lot of shops have a similar range of products and crossover but T&amp;SHOP feels quite homespun as it is just me behind it all . I did n't have a big budget when I was launching the shop . I painted the walls and the floor and even installed the toilet and taps myself . It would n't be my first choice for space but there are many things that I am really proud of like the baking trays from which my plants hang on the ceiling . I love my beautiful indoor garden . <p> 5 . If you could open a store anywhere in the world where would it be ? <p> I just came back from Copenhagen and although I did really love it I could n't leave this community here . I would open another boutique in Barcelona but always keep my base in Stoke Newington . <p> 6 . What is special about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , they really make my day . Lots of them are friends and I know them so well . I hold their kids and play with them outside . I even teach one of my customers how to make coffee . <p> 7 . What are your top product pick and 5 top product picks from T&amp;SHOP ( that represent who you are as a boutique ) ? <p> Lavender and chamomile skin balm . It smells amazing and is really good for healing the skin . <p> Hanging planters . If you have limited space and need to introduce some greenery they can really transform a space . <p> 8 . What knowledge can you share about different types of tea and which is best for certain moods etc ? <p> Before I opened the shop I went to a Japanese tea ceremony at the British Museum . I was jumping out of my seat with excitement and they picked me to be a recipient of the tea . It was such an amazing experience and made me appreciate how beautiful the tradition is . The way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a huge fan of matcha tea , as it is a real multi purpose drink and is a softer form of caffeine that always makes me feel better after drinking . The matcha mochi ice cream is a green tea ice cream ball surrounded by gelatinous rice loose jelly and is incredible . The matcha coconut milk latte is a T&amp;Shop special and is always so refreshing . <p> The other drinks that have beneficial properties are caffeine free fennel , nettle , chamomile and mint teas as they are all quite cooling and good for an upset stomach or anxiety as they are more calming on the digestive system. - Chai with chilli tea and the Buddha Blend contains ginger and warming spices which is very invigorating and great on a cold morning or when you are feeling sluggish . It will definitely kick you into action . <p> When we were doing up the shop my dad would not let me clean his enamel mug and it got SO dirty . He loves a builders tea . If you 're hungover or get knocked off your bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling tea in the shop that only costs -1 as it is important to me that there are things that are accessible in terms of price . I would n't want it to feel like an overpriced hipster cafe . <p> 9 . How does it feel to be a part of the Trouva community ? <p> It feels like a really slick process . I appreciate all of the hard work that goes into it and having photoshoots and press in top magazines as I just do n't have the time to do that . I also really like the other boutiques on Trouva !
