A third condition , prostatitis , flies under the radar even though it affects up to one in six men at some point in their lifetimes . It triggers more than two million visits to doctors and untold agony each year . <p> Prostatitis , which means inflammation of the prostate gland , is an equal opportunity disorder . Unlike prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , which predominantly affect older men , prostatitis affects men of all ages . <p> Prostatitis refers to a loose assemblage of syndromes characterized by urinary problems such as burning or painful urination , the urgent need to urinate , trouble voiding , difficult or painful ejaculation , and pain in the area between the scrotum and rectum ( known as the perineum ) or lower back . Although it causes some of the same symptoms as BPH and can occur at the same time , prostatitis is a separate condition . <p> Some types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often accompanied by the classic symptoms of infection , such as fever , chills , and muscle pain along with urinary problems . As a result , they are relatively easy to diagnose and treat , and they usually respond well to antibiotics . Unfortunately , such straightforward forms of prostatitis are the minority . <p> Physicians are n't  sure what causes the rest . Potential culprits include difficult-to-detect bacteria , inflammation , depression and stress , and mechanical or neuromuscular problems in the pelvic muscles that irritate the general area . This uncertainty is what can make the treatment of prostatitis so maddening . <h> Types of prostatitis <p> Prostatitis is classified into four categories , each with its own treatment approach <h> Acute infection of the prostate <p> This sudden-onset infection is caused by bacteria that travel from the urethra , and perhaps from the rectum , to the prostate . Its the least common but most dramatic form of prostatitis , beginning abruptly with high fever , chills , joint and muscle aches , and profound fatigue . In addition , you may have pain around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower back , and the feeling of a full rectum . As the prostate becomes more swollen , you may find it more difficult to urinate , and the urine stream may become weak . ( If you ca n't urinate at all , its a medical emergency ; this usually means the prostate is so swollen that its completely blocking urine flow . Depending on the severity of symptoms , hospitalization may be necessary . ) <p> Antibiotics are the standard treatment and are highly effective for this form of prostatitis Typical choices include fluoroquinolones " such as ciprofloxacin ( Cipro ) , levofloxacin ( Levaquin ) , and ofloxacin ( Floxin ) " and **29;0;TOOLONG ( Bactrim , Septra , Cotrim ) . Its important to continue your medication for the entire prescribed course , even if you are feeling better . This will help prevent your infection from returning . <p> To help ease any discomfort , try sitting in a hot bath , take stool softeners , and use over-the-counter pain relievers , such as aspirin or ibuprofen . Drinking plenty of fluids can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chronic bacterial prostatitis <p> This type of prostatitis is also caused by bacteria . Its more common in older men who have BPH . It sometimes follows a bout of acute bacterial prostatitis . Unlike the acute form , however , chronic bacterial prostatitis is a subtle , low-grade infection that can begin insidiously and persist for weeks or even months . <p> A man with chronic bacterial prostatitis usually does n't  have a fever , but is troubled by intermittent symptoms such as a sudden urge to urinate , frequent urination , painful urination , or the need to get up at night to urinate . Some men have low back pain , pain in the rectum , or a feeling of heaviness behind the scrotum . Others have pain after ejaculation , and the semen may be tinged with blood . These symptoms wax and wane , and they are sometimes so understated that they are n't  noticeable . <p> Treatment requires the same antibiotics used for the acute form , usually for one to three months , but even with the prolonged treatment , the infection often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be controlled with another course of antibiotics . <h> Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis <p> Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis , also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome is the most common form of prostatitis . Its symptoms resemble those of chronic bacterial prostatitis . Yet no bacteria are evident , and pinpointing a cause or causes has been difficult . <p> Research suggests that chronic nonbacterial prostatitis may result from a cascade of interconnected events . The initiating event may be stress , an undetectable infectious agent , or a physical trauma that causes inflammation or nerve damage in the genitourinary area . Over time , this may lead to heightened sensitivity of the nervous system . In other words , CP/CPPS may be an overactive pain syndrome . What 's more , some physicians and researchers are beginning to think that the condition may affect the entire pelvic floor " all of the muscles involved with bowel , bladder , and sexual function " not just the prostate gland . <p> Because men often suffer from multiple symptoms simultaneously " such as pain and difficulty urinating " they may require several types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms . These include antibiotics , Pain relievers , a medication to reduce the urge to urinate , a medication to ease urine flow by relaxing the muscles at the neck of the bladder , and even some alternative therapies such as myofascial release . ( **28;31;TOOLONG will explore treatments for chronic nonbacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome in a future article . ) <h> Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis <p> This is usually discovered during tests for another medical condition , such as infertility or other prostate disorders . White blood cells are present in the urine or prostate secretions , but there are no symptoms . With no symptoms and no known cause , it is n't treated . 
@@100736229 @4936229/ <h> How reliable is the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) test when it comes to detecting prostate cancer ? <p> Although PSA testing can help catch prostate cancer at an early stage , having an elevated PSA ( generally considered more than 4 ng/ml ) does n't necessarily mean that a man has cancer . Noncancerous conditions , including benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , or an enlarged prostate , and prostatitis , can raise PSA levels . In fact , studies have shown that about 70% to 80% of men with an elevated PSA who have a biopsy do not have cancer . However , many men undergo an ultrasound and prostate biopsy , to be certain . <p> Conversely , the PSA test does n't detect all cancers . About 20% of men who have cancer also have a normal PSA ( less than 4 ng/ml ) , so the test may give some men a false sense of security . For this reason , some experts take a man 's age into account when considering a PSA level . And most doctors observe how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called PSA velocity , rather than using it as a one-time indicator . PSA scores tend to rise more rapidly in men with cancer than in those with BPH , for example . <p> Some doctors also measure the level of free PSA . The PSA protein circulates in the blood in two forms : bound to other proteins or unbound ( free ) . Several studies suggest that men with elevated PSA levels and a very low percentage of free PSA are more likely to have prostate cancer than a benign condition . Knowing your free PSA level wo n't give you a definitive answer about cancer , but it may be useful when considering whether a biopsy is an appropriate next step . <p> Researchers are developing new screening tests for prostate cancer . Like the PSA test , they rely on biomarkers , such as antigens or proteins , which are elevated or may only be present in men who have prostate cancer . The hope is that these tests will better detect existing cancers without raising the alarm for cancer when it is n't there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correct any medical condition ; am in excellent health ; 5 ' -10 ? , 180 lbs ; workout in a gym regularly ; no noticeable urinary or sexual problems .

Likely caused by your meds for BPH weakening the bladder sphincter muscle so you can pee better . Wikipedia has a good article on it . <p> Mike Z About 2 years ago , with a PSA of about 11 or 12 , my Doctor arranged an appointment with an Urologist who performed a biopsy . There was no real discomfort in the procedure which confirmed cancer on one side . He recommended X-Ray Radiation treatments combined with hormone treatments . However , only radiation treatments ( 35 @ 5 per week ) were done , as recommended by my Oncologist . My PSA result 6 months later was 0.71 and the one year result was 0.55 . Another test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am now 77 , play table tennis regularly , look after a large garden with a 300 foot hedge half-way around , shovel snow etc. despite 2 hip and one knee replacements . I feel fortunate especially since a close and much younger friend ( 61 ) is on heavy chemotherapy for his much more advanced condition . At the " prostrate cancer support group " we all have learned that PSA results are only a " guideline " . <p> I am a 58-year-old healthy man . I was diagnosed with prostatitis in early November 2016 . I was discharged from hospital four days later , feeling good . Just prior to prostatitis my PSA was 0.8 , coincidentally I had had my annual blood test a few days before diagnosis of prostatitis . One month later my PSA was 4.0 ( is this high number an expected PSA level following prostatitis ? ) At this time the GP conducted a DRE and no nodules were detected , but a larger than normal prostate was mentioned . Following discharge from hospital my thirst was higher than normal and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . This has settled down ( thirst normal and urination only once per night now ) . Six weeks later ( last week in January 2017 ) the PSA reading was slightly higher at 4.1 . Urine sample detected no infections . I am waiting another four weeks for the next PSA to see if the reading goes down . Typically , would this be normal that the PSA level is so high following prostatitis ? Could this be cancer , BPH or something else ? Should I go for a prostate biopsy now or should I wait until March to consult with a Urologist ? Thank you . <p> The PSA is individually based . I had my prostate out late December 2016 . First biopsy in February 2016 showed Gleason 6 . The PSA at that time was a 2.1 . Second biopsy in October 2016 revealed Gleason 7 BUT my PSA DROPPED to a 1.5 . PSA is not universal <p> I am 81and in good health.I walk two to three Km . Daily and agile enough to play table tennis . A month back i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very hard fall . I developed a bad lower back ache . As the ache is persisting the Doc suggested a PSA test which gave an alarming reading of 25 . The urologist did a DRE and advised a biopsy . I do not have any symptoms of p . Cancer like frequent urination etc . Can the high psa result of the fall ! Should i subject myself to biopsy.Are there any non intrusive alternatives . <p> My husband had a surgeon do a radical retropubic prostectomy with nerve sparing in 2011 September He was put on high dose of Cialis to take when sexual relations were to happen . This gave him headaches and flushing so they changed his dose to everyday Cialis . Our question is this " why is his erection now fleeting , it comes then it goes " He has admitted to missing a few pills here and there , would this be the reason ? <p> Guys , if you care at all about your health and living , and your family , you owe it to yourself to spend a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fairly complete physical exam each year . At my last yearly physical , for reasons completely unknown to me as I had no symptoms whatsoever , no family history , and no known risk factors , I asked ( almost had to insist actually ) , to have a PSA test for prostate cancer done . Its a simple blood test and can be done along with all the other blood work during a physical . Sadly , this test showed my PSA number had gotten very high . <p> My last PSA test had been done 8 years previously , but right about that time many family practice doctors , mine included , stopped giving this test . Their reasoning is that the test sometimes gives a false positive , and having a positive means that you then need to then have a biopsy done by a urologist to determine whether you do or do not have prostate cancer . In my opinion their abandonment of the PSA test is DEAD wrong , and I am one who almost wound up DEAD because of it . Although any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if needed , is a simple routine out-patient test done at a hospital . I was put to sleep for the procedure , total time spent at the hospital was less than 4 hours , and most of that time is spent being put under and then slowly waking up again . I had very little pain afterwards , I was back doing whatever I wanted the same day , and was given antibiotics to take for 3 weeks . <p> Another reason I have heard for doctors not giving PSA tests anymore is that they feel patients who have to have a biopsy , and find out from it that they do not have prostate cancer will be angry . This is absurd and defies common sense , I would have been elated to have the biopsy and find out I did not have cancer , just as I think any guy would be . <p> Anyway , my biopsy showed I DID have advanced fast growing prostate cancer . My ONLY option was to have my prostate completely removed as soon as possible , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I had probably had this cancer for over 4 years , and if I had been having yearly PSA tests the test would have shown a large spike 4 years ago when the cancer started . I could have then been treated AT THAT TIME with much simpler , cheaper , less invasive procedures , and not needed what turned out to be a $100,000 operation and its possible complications . They also told me that I had saved my own life by asking for a PSA test when I did , and if I had waited even one more year it would have been TOO LATE . One urologist even told me that 26,000 guys are dying needlessly each year due to PSA testing not being done . <p> So please guys , despite what your doctor may tell you , ask for a yearly PSA test and watch for a sudden rise in the number each year and if that occurs get to a urologist quickly . And if your doctor tries to talk you out of a yearly PSA test , my advice is to absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to an MRI , its time to move on to another urologist . <p> Its as simple as that . <p> " One urologist even told me that 26,000 guys are dying needlessly each year due to PSA testing not being done . " <p> But they do n't  tell how much damage was done by a needless biopsy . <p> I went to two urologists as a result of an increased PSA . Both wanted to perform a biopsy . Discussed with my GP and she suggested that it just might be an infection and was surprised that neither urologists considered that possibility . In about 40 days the PSA , with meds , went from 12 to 5 . ( I am 70 ) . <p> Second time PSA climbed when to another Urologist let 's do a biopsy My GP suggest a picture rather than a poke . One can always poke . And if there is an issue , the pokes will be fewer ( less damage ) because the image indicates where to poke . ( usually , 3 vs 12 ) <p> Result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong would be proud of . <p> Sorry guys who are writing that a PSA test caught their cancer . A routine prostate exam will usually indicate whether a ultrasound of the prostate is needed . This should be the first test after an abnormal prostate exam , NOT a biopsy . <p> The PSA test lacks two important measures of relevance to medical diagnostic procedures : sensitivity and specificity . Consider that the PSA level in your blood can vary widely throughout the day , hence its lack of sensitivity . And an elevated PSA can indicate cancer , prostatitis , BPH , that you have had sex sometime in the last 12 hours or that you havent had sex in several days . Hence the lack of specificity . <p> The PSA test is not reliable and too many urologist do unnecessary biopsies , which are extremely painful and potentially dangerous . They can cause serious infections and , if you have a slow-growing cancer that is well encapsulated ( little chance of metastasis ) , the biopsy itself can rupture the capsule making metastasis much more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The physician who developed it no longer recommends it . <p> In 2011 I had a PSA test that gave a reading of 3100 I have never had a biopsy . It is now 2017 I have hormone injections off and on over this period and some radio therapy on two occasions . I now have a PSA reading of over 1300 after having been down as low as 3 . I have no Idea what is going on and the oncologists can not understand how I manage to survive such high PSA readings Early in 2011 I got a very bad mosquito bite in Dili East Timor that reduced to a cripple as in a very bad case of Dengi or Ross River virus and every thing progressed from there . <p> I do n't  know what to make of my situation and the oncologists want me to start on chemo , I do not want to do a chemo course as I am not 100% sure I even have cancer . 46996 @qwx906996 
@@100736236 @4936236/ <h> Prostate Cancer Survival Rates : What They Mean <h> In this Article <p> As cancer diagnoses go , prostate cancer is often a less serious one . Prostate cancer is frequently slow-growing and slow to spread . For many men , prostate cancer is less serious than their other medical conditions . <p> For these reasons , and possibly because of earlier detection of low-grade prostate cancers , prostate cancer has one of the highest survival rates of any type of cancer . WebMD takes a look at prostate cancer survival rates and what they mean to you . <h> Prostate Cancer Is Common With Aging <p> After skin cancer , prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men . About 1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime . And these are just the men who are diagnosed . Among very elderly men dying of other causes , a surprising two-thirds may have prostate cancer that was never diagnosed . <p> Only 1 in 36 men , though , actually dies from prostate cancer . That 's because most prostate cancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be slow-growing and non-aggressive . The majority of these men eventually pass away from heart disease , stroke , or other causes -- not their prostate cancer . <h> Prostate Cancer Survival Rates Are Favorable Overall <p> Thinking about survival rates for prostate cancer takes a little mental stretching . Keep in mind that most men are around 70 when diagnosed with prostate cancer . Over , say , five years , many of these men will die from other medical problems unrelated to prostate cancer . <p> To determine the prostate cancer survival rate , these men are subtracted out of the calculations . Counting only the men who are left provides what 's called the relative survival rate for prostate cancer . <p> Taking that into consideration , the relative survival rates for most kinds of prostate cancer are actually pretty good . Remember , we 're not counting men with prostate cancer who die of other causes : <p> For the more than 90% of men whose prostate cancer is localized to the prostate or just nearby , the prognosis is even better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . <h> Continued <p> Another way to put this last point is nine out of 10 men with prostate cancer have localized cancer . Almost none of these men will die from their prostate cancer over five years . <p> Fewer men ( about 5% ) have more advanced prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis . Once prostate cancer has spread beyond the prostate , survival rates fall . For men with distant spread ( metastasis ) of prostate cancer , about one-third will survive for five years after diagnosis . <p> Many men with prostate cancer actually will live much longer than five years after diagnosis . What about longer-term survival rates ? According to the American Cancer Society : <p> The relative 10-year survival rate is 91% . <p> The relative 15-year survival rate is 76% . <h> Staging , Spread , and Survival Rates <p> As with all cancers , doctors use the term stage to describe the characteristics of the primary tumor itself , such as its size and how far prostate cancer has spread when it is found . <p> Staging systems are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostate cancer , uses three different aspects of tumor growth and spread .

Doctors use this information for studies and to decide on treatments . <p> As far as survival rates for prostate cancer go , however , the staging system is pretty simple .

These men may need more aggressive treatment for their prostate cancer . Fewer of these men -- about one-third -- will survive their prostate cancer for more than five years . <p> In a good way , these figures are already outdated . Prostate cancer treatments are improving , and men are being diagnosed earlier than in previous years . Men diagnosed with prostate cancer today might have even better survival rates than these . For example , the five-year relative survival rate for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 was 92.9% , and now it 's 99%.

Almost all men will experience erectile dysfunction for several months to a year after a radical prostatectomy , although todays nerve-sparing operation has decreased the number of cases when its permanent . <p> But orgasm after radical prostatectomy ?

@@100736247 @4936247/ <p> Concern that getting a vasectomy could lead to prostate cancer flared in 1993 when the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study reported that men who had undergone vasectomies were about one-and-a-half times more likely to develop prostate cancer than men who had not had the operation . The study was careful and large , including 10,055 men who 'd had vasectomies and 37,800 who had not . Still , many experts were skeptical , pointing out that there were only 300 newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer in the entire group . Some also noted that men who had undergone vasectomy were more likely to be under the care of a urologist and undergo tests leading to the diagnosis of early , clinically silent prostate cancer . <p> Indeed , many studies since 1993 have failed to find a link between a vasectomy and prostate cancer , and scientists have been unable to identify a biologically plausible reason why vasectomy might increase a man 's cancer risk .

But when they compared men who took metformin to those who managed " or tried to manage " their diabetes with diet , metformin again came out looking like it was protective ; the metformin takers were 46% less likely to have died from prostate cancer than the dieters . <p> All the usual warnings about correlation not equaling correlation apply . And keep this mind : only men with diabetes were included in this study . It is an open question whether men with prostate cancer who do n't  have diabetes might benefit from metformin .

So by lowering circulating insulin levels , metformin may be taking away some of the stimulus for prostate cancer cell growth . <p> Metformin may also have more direct effects .

The dogs undoubtedly earned their rewards : they correctly identified the urine samples with prostate cancer 99% of the time and those without cancer 97% of the time . <p> " If true , these accuracy figures are far better than any tests currently available short of a prostate biopsy in detecting the presence of prostate cancer , " comments prostate cancer specialist Dr. Marc B.

In the first reported case , published in The Lancet in 1989 , a Border Collie/Doberman Pinscher mix relentlessly sniffed and nipped at a single mole on her owners leg ( but not other moles ) . The one that attracted the dogs attention turned out to be malignant . <p> Taverna speculates that cancers emit chemical odors with tumor-specific " signatures .

Determining the specific compounds given off by prostate cancer that dogs detect is the next phase in his research . <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health delivery implications , " Garnick says .

@@100736268 @4936268/ 46989 @qwx906989 <p> Two early warning signs of possible prostate cancer are a high level of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) in the bloodstream and an abnormal digital rectal exam . When either occurs , a prostate biopsy is usually done to see if that warning sign is being caused by prostate cancer . A new study indicates that images from an MRI scan can help improve biopsy results . <p> A standard biopsy is done like this : A doctor inserts an ultrasound probe into a mans rectum . The probe uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the prostate gland . These images help the doctor guide several small , hollow needles into the gland . These needles grab samples of prostate tissue that are later analyzed to determine if prostate cancer cells are present . <p> One drawback with this method is that ultrasound cant readily distinguish cancerous tissue from healthy tissue . That means the needles could miss a section of prostate tissue harboring potentially aggressive cancer cells . In fact , ultrasound-guided biopsies miss such high-grade tumors about 40% of the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports promising results from a more targeted way to biopsy the prostate . Researchers call it " fusion-guided biopsy " because it fuses ultrasound images with high-resolution pictures of the prostate made by a newer technology called multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MP-MRI ) . Prostate tumors show up on MP-MRI as dark spots . By adding MP-MRI images taken beforehand to the real-time ultrasound images , doctors can target suspicious regions of the gland while steering clear of healthy tissue . <p> The JAMA study set out to compare the two approaches independently . Mohammad Minhaj Siddiqui , an assistant professor of urologic surgery at the University of Maryland , and his colleagues recruited 1,003 men with either a high PSA level or an abnormal digital rectal exam and at least one suspicious spot identified by MP-MRI . All the men had two biopsies during a single session : a fusion-guided biopsy by one doctor , followed by a standard biopsy by a different doctor who was n't shown the MP-MRI images . <p> Prostate cancer diagnoses were almost identical in both methods : fusion-guided biopsy detected 461 cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , fusion-guided biopsy detected 30% more high-grade cancers , which are potentially more dangerous , and 17% fewer slow-growing , low-risk cancers than standard biopsy . <p> " The fusion-guided method allowed us to reliably find more high-grade prostate tumors , " said Siddiqui , who did the study while he was a fellow at the National Institutes of Health . " And it also reduced the diagnoses of indolent tumors that are n't  likely to harm the patient . " <p> The combination of fusion-guided and standard biopsies detected an extra 103 cancers , or 22% more than either method alone . But the vast majority of these additional cancers were slow-growing , low-risk tumors . " This suggests that fusion-guided biopsy by itself is sufficient , " Siddiqui said . " Combining the two biopsies likely exposes the patient to more discomfort and even a higher risk of complications such as infection and bleeding , with limited clinical benefit . " <p> In an accompanying editorial , Lawrence H. Schwartz , of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , and Ethan Basch , a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor of JAMA , wrote that fusion-guided biopsy promises " more appropriate treatment recommendations , such as higher-intensity treatment for high-risk disease and active surveillance for men with low-grade tumors . " <p> Yet Schwartz and Basch emphasize that additional studies are needed to determine whether the fusion-guided biopsy has any influence on long-term survival , a point with which Siddiqui agrees . <p> Marc Garnick , the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Editor in Chief of **28;121;TOOLONG , said results from the study suggest that fusion-guided biopsy " along with newer molecular tools for characterizing prostate cancer " could help patients make more rational treatment choices . But he emphasized that data about the final outcomes of patients who undergo fusion-guided biopsy are desperately needed . " We need to know if these diagnostic aids will lead to both short-term and long-term clinical benefits , " he said .

Do my girlfriend and I still need to use condoms to protect against sexually transmitted diseases even though I no longer ejaculate when I reach orgasm ? <p> In a word , yes . Even if a man does n't ejaculate , sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) can still be passed from one partner to another during sexual activity . Some diseases , such as HIV/AIDS , gonorrhea , chlamydia , and trichomoniasis , are transmitted when infected vaginal or urethral secretions come into contact with surfaces that secrete or contain mucus " the vagina and cervix in women and the urethra in men . That means a man who has had a prostatectomy can become infected if , for example , vaginal secretions from a woman with chlamydia enter his urethra . <p> Other STDs can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact from sores , ulcers , or infected skin that looks normal , including genital skin . These STDs include syphilis , genital herpes , and human papillomavirus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women and cervical cancer in women . Proper use of condoms helps lower the risk of these diseases , though HPV can infect skin not covered by a condom . Latex condoms are best ; condoms made from animal tissues do not prevent STDs , so if either partner is allergic to latex , use polyurethane condoms . <p> Many people infected with STDs do not have any signs or symptoms of disease and are n't aware that they are passing an infection to their partner . Some people can harbor a virus like herpes and transmit it to their partners even if years have passed since the infection was contracted .

But whether repeat biopsies are really needed " and if so , when they should be done " are unanswered questions . To add to the debate , British researchers studied 119 men with untreated disease who had a biopsy to diagnose the condition and a follow-up biopsy 18 to 24 months later . Among the 28% of patients whose disease advanced , two histological factors proved key predictors of cancer progression : PSA density of 0.2 ng/ml/ml or greater ( PSA density is the PSA level in the blood divided by the volume of the prostate ) , and any tissue sample considered 15% cancerous or more .

But it reached a new height when actress Angelina Jolie revealed in The New York Times that she had both of her breasts removed . She did this not because she had breast cancer , but because she carried a gene called BRCA1 that put her at high risk of developing breast cancer in her lifetime .

Under these circumstances , many men in the United States " and their doctors " might have considered treatment , whether or not they had the BRCA mutations or not . <p> Jolie , in contrast , made her decision to have both breasts removed based solely on her BRCA gene status . No biopsy had shown the presence of early stage breast cancer . <h> BRCA1 and BRCA2 <p> BRCA1 and BRCA2 belong to a class of genes known as tumor suppressors .

To better understand why , Italian researchers measured the length of the flaccid and stretched penis in 126 patients at five time points : just before surgery , when the catheter was removed 7 to 10 days later , and at 3 , 6 , and 12 months postoperatively . They reported that shortening peaked at the time the catheter was removed and continued , though to a lesser extent , for at least a year . ( The average reduction in length after one year was just over a half inch when flaccid and nearly an inch when stretched . ) Interestingly , men who had nerve-sparing surgery , as well as those who recovered some erectile function during the year of follow-up , lost less length than other study participants . <p> The researchers theorize that the death of nerve cells and reduced blood flow ( and thus a loss of oxygen ) to the penis during surgery and recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they suggest that it might help temper shortening , a conclusion supported by a study from a team of researchers in Minnesota .

Here I am 15 months later and my most recent PSA results are still 0.01 non-detectable . I for one , hope that those of you who are much younger than me can get some medical help or therapy to overcome the problems associated with your shortened penis ( I have little comprehension of how I would feel if I were 20 or 30 years younger ) but I can assure you and all other readers of this rather lengthy post , I am totally accepting of my shortened penis &amp; inability to achieve an erection . At least I am still alive . Good luck to all . <p> In 2014 I underwent nerve sparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Score was 8 with a PSA of only 4.7 .

He said it would clear up . The pain increased daily and the night sweats and testicular swelling became unbearable . I went to the surgeons office for a 3 month follow up and discussed the issues and the intense pain . He had a CT scan performed in his office .

He was also not prepared for the lack of bladder control after the operation as again , his doctor failed to discuss this side effect .

Then you make a salad with two cups of greens , throw on a half-cup of carrots and a half-cup of peppers , and the number of servings is quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is that color is an indicator of phytonutrient content . <p> What are phytonutrients ? <p> KENNEDY : Phytonutrients are plant-based nutrients . Its really an umbrella term for all of the good things that are found in plant foods . <p> McMANUS : The deeper the color , the more vibrant the color , supposedly , the higher the phytonutrient content . For example , lettuce that 's deep green has more nutrients than iceberg lettuce . <p> KENNEDY : People have probably seen fancy words like " flavonoids " and " lycopene " when they read about fruits and vegetables . These are considered phytonutrients . <h> What counts as a serving ? <p> Many organizations and government agencies publish guidelines on what constitutes a serving . The USDA guidelines are the most widely accepted . here 's how they define serving sizes for the food groups in this article : <p> Grains <p> 1 slice of bread <p> 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal <p> + cup of cooked cereal , rice , or pasta <p> Vegetables <p> 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables <p> + cup of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice <p> Fruits <p> 1 medium apple , orange , or banana <p> + cup of chopped , cooked , or canned fruit <p> + cup of fruit juice . <p> Should people eat specific types of fruits and vegetables ? Or does that not matter much beyond substituting a darker lettuce for iceberg lettuce ? <p> KENNEDY : I think there are two key points here . One is quantity . We definitely want fruits and vegetables to be more prominent in our diet in our meals and in our snacks . In addition , eat " by the rainbow . " That means choosing things that are red , orange , yellow , dark green , blue , and purple , as well as things that are white such as garlic , onions , and cauliflower . You want to have the entire color spectrum because each color represents different and important nutrients for reducing disease risk . There are other groups of vegetables that are n't  sorted according to color . For example , there 's some preliminary research showing that cruciferous vegetables broccoli , cabbage , cauliflower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kale may help to decrease the risk of aggressive prostate cancer . <p> What about tomatoes ? Some studies have shown that tomatoes , which contain the nutrient lycopene , might help prevent cancer ; others have come to the opposite conclusion . What do you recommend to patients ? <p> KENNEDY : Lycopene may or may not turn out to be a nutrient that is particularly important when it comes to prostate cancer . But there are many beneficial nutrients in tomatoes besides lycopene . You can get folic acid , you can get vitamin C. There are lots of good things in tomatoes . Because we know tomatoes are a healthy food for several reasons , I think it would make sense to try to include some cooked tomatoes and tomato sauce in your diet if you 're at risk for prostate cancer or if you 're a prostate cancer survivor . I do n't  think we can conclusively say , " Youre definitely going to benefit from eating tomatoes , " but we can say that eating more tomatoes is n't going to be harmful . <p> Should the tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat cooked or raw fruits and vegetables ? <p> KENNEDY : That 's a great question . With tomatoes , the body absorbs more lycopene if they are cooked in the presence of a healthy fat . But in general , you 'll absorb or get different nutrients depending on whether a vegetable is cooked or eaten raw . We certainly do n't  want people overcooking vegetables , or fruits for that matter , because that degrades the nutrients . Eating fruits and vegetables lightly cooked or eating them raw are both good choices , but for different reasons . <p> McMANUS : I do n't  think we want people to get too hung up on whether vegetables should be eaten raw or cooked . Our main goal is to get people to eat more fruits and vegetables . How they 're prepared is less important . Mix it up . Salad is obviously raw vegetables , but you could have some roasted vegetables , or you could stir-fry them in a little bit of olive oil and garlic . Make them appealing . Make them taste good . That will really help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What strategies can our readers use to work more fruits and vegetables into their diet ? <p> McMANUS : Well , part of it is taking small steps . When you tell people to get five to 10 servings a day , they can feel overwhelmed . So you have to think about it in simple ways . Add extra diced vegetables into soups , casseroles , and spaghetti sauce . That 's an easy way to do it . If you 've got something cooking in the oven , throw in some vegetables . If you 're roasting a chicken , throw in some carrots , sweet potatoes , peppers , and onions . That 's quick and easy . Try a stir-fry . Make vegetable stews and veggie wraps . Those are great ways to really pack in extra vegetables without a whole lot of extra effort . <p> People always talk about having something sweet for dessert . A great way to do that is to choose fruit berries , melon , or clementines . Think about fruit as a great way to end a meal . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hummus , black bean dip , salsa , or light dressing . That can be a good way to get in some extra vegetables . Try the same thing with fruit . Slice up some fruit and dunk it in yogurt or put a little bit of peanut butter or almond butter on it . Smoothies are a great way to eat on the run . If you want to have a quick and healthy breakfast , you could blend some yogurt and fruit . <p> Is there any difference between organic and conventional produce ? Is there any benefit to eating organic produce ? <p> KENNEDY : Well , the research on that is still very new . We can not say conclusively that choosing organic necessarily translates into any health benefit . The evidence certainly supports eating more fruits and vegetables the average American eats two to two-and-a-half servings a day ; were recommending five to 10 . The studies that have been done havent really looked at organic versus conventional produce ; theyve looked at fruits and vegetables over all . Certainly if you have access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have some benefit , we would be supportive of that choice . Its really a personal decision . <h> The " dirty dozen " <p> If you 're worried about pesticide residue on produce but cant afford to purchase every organically grown food , limit your organic buying to these 12 fruits and vegetables . When grown conventionally , these items tend to have the highest levels of pesticides on them : <p> peaches <p> apples <p> bell peppers ( red and green ) <p> celery <p> nectarines <p> strawberries <p> cherries <p> lettuce <p> grapes ( imported ) <p> pears <p> spinach <p> potatoes . <p> What about the pesticides used to grow conventional produce ? <p> KENNEDY : Theres a list that 's referred to as the dirty dozen , the 12 fruits and vegetables that tend to carry the most pesticides . See " The dirty dozen . " If you eat some of the fruits and vegetables every day that are on the list , you might want to look at organic options . So if you 're eating conventional spinach and strawberries all the time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can try frozen varieties . <p> That having been said , there 's certainly no evidence that we need to choose organic . When you look at the evidence , maintaining a healthy weight , engaging in physical activity , and eating a plant-based diet far outweigh the theoretical concerns about organic versus conventional foods . <p> Ca n't people just take supplements to get the nutrients they need ? <p> KENNEDY : Research from the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research supports getting nutrients primarily from foods , rather than looking to supplements to prevent cancer . Of course , there are reasons why an individual might want to take a supplement . For example , a person with a low blood level of vitamin D might want to take vitamin D to help correct the deficiency . That 's different than grabbing supplements as a panacea and taking them in place of eating a healthy diet . <h> Eat the W-H-O-L-E grain <p> What 's the difference between refined and whole grains ? <p> McMANUS : Refined grains and carbohydrates are easily and rapidly absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blood sugar . At the same time , there 's a rise in insulin , which can actually drive the blood sugar , or blood glucose , too low . When that happens , the gut and brain start sending out hunger signals , and the inclination is to grab more food and potentially overeat . In the long run , we think this constant barrage of spikes in blood sugar and insulin production can lead to type 2 diabetes . Whole grains help limit the dramatic peaks and valleys in blood sugar , so insulin production is steadier see Figure 1 . <p> Fiber is another benefit of whole grains . There are good data from both the Nurses Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study showing that men and women who ate the most cereal fiber from grains about 7.5 grams a day , which is equivalent to a bowl of oatmeal and a couple of pieces of whole-grain bread were 30% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who did n't  eat much fiber . Other data show that those who eat the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , are 30% less likely to develop heart disease than those who eat few whole-grain foods . So you can see that whole grains are beneficial . We also know that whole grains and high-fiber foods can help improve gastrointestinal health and help prevent constipation . Data linking whole grains and cancer prevention are n't  really there , but were looking at the entire diet and how it can help prevent chronic disease in general . That 's extremely important . <p> Carbohydrates in food are converted to simple sugars , such as glucose , in the intestines . <p> Glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to cells to provide energy . <p> The pancreas produces insulin , which helps cells use glucose . <p> Normal glucose absorption <p> Insulin binds to receptors on the cell membrane , much as a key fits into a lock , signaling glucose transporters . <p> Glucose transporters move to the cell membrane and bind to glucose . <p> Glucose enters the cell . <p> Type 2 diabetes <p> Cells develop a resistance to insulin ( some insulin " locks " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Glucose builds up in the bloodstream . <p> What makes whole grains so effective at controlling blood sugar ? <p> McMANUS : They have n't been stripped of the intact bran . When grain gets refined , that gets stripped away . With the intact bran , whole grains take longer to digest , keep you feeling full longer , and control spikes in blood sugar . <p> What should people look for on the label ? <p> McMANUS : The one thing that you want to look for is actually the word whole , W-H-O-L-E , with the first ingredient . Men should also know how much fiber they need . The fiber goal for men 50 years or younger is 38 grams a day . For men older than 50 , its 30 grams a day . The key is for people to not fall for the " come-ons " on the packages , even though they may sound enticing , because the fiber content may not be high enough . The FDA has some specific guidelines for what labels can claim , based on nutrient content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good source of fiber " must contribute 10% of what they call the daily value , the amount that one should consume daily . <h> Figure 2 : Its all in the label <p> That does n't  seem like very much . <p> McMANUS : Exactly . If you consume 2,000 calories a day , the daily value for fiber is 25 grams . If a food has 5 grams of fiber per serving , it contains 20% of the daily value for fiber . At 20% , the manufacturer can claim that the food is " high in fiber , " " rich in fiber , " or " an excellent source of fiber , " and yet you 're only getting 5 grams . <p> If you 're trying to get 35 grams of fiber a day , eating foods like fruits and vegetables foods that do n't  have labels can be very helpful . A plant-based diet is going to get you to your 35-gram goal faster than the traditional Western diet , which is loaded with red meat and dairy , foods that are very low in fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work at it slowly over time . And when you 're looking at the Nutrition Facts label , look at the number of grams of fiber per serving see Figure 2 . <p> When it comes to making all of these healthy changes , how can our readers up their chances of success ? <p> McMANUS : Start with small steps . Making too many changes at once can be difficult . Make one change and stick with it for a while . Then take another step . Youll be more likely to succeed . 46996 @qwx906996

Interfering with the bodys ability to make and use this hormone , also known as an androgen , has been a mainstay of treating advanced prostate cancer since the 1970s . This approach is called androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) because it cuts off the supply of testosterone to prostate cancer cells and the rest of the body . <p> In men with cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland , radiation therapy plus ADT can ease symptoms and improve survival . But some doctors give ADT by itself to millions of men with localized tumors that have n't spread beyond the prostate . Some experts see this as an alarming trend because ADTs side effects can include impotence , bone fractures , weight gain , diabetes , and heart disease .

A recent article on healthy aging in the Washington Post suggested that taking vitamin E can help men prevent prostate and other cancers . That certainly is n't what the evidence shows . In fact , a key clinical trial of vitamin E was stopped early because it showed that taking a vitamin E supplement failed to prevent prostate cancer and could " emphasis on could " promote prostate cancer . <p> Early cell culture and animal studies put a spotlight on vitamin E.

That 's because the ATBC trial was n't specifically designed to evaluate prostate cancer risk , and almost all of the participants were Caucasian smokers . <p> To clarify the ATBC results , the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial ( SELECT ) was specifically designed to assess the effect of supplemental vitamin E on prostate cancer risk .

It may be an entirely harmless signal , or it may mean the cancer has n't  been entirely eradicated and is beginning to regrow . Some men want to start hormone treatment immediately , others are okay waiting for other signs like the appearance of prostate cancer symptoms . A study presented this week at the American Society of Clinical Oncologys ( ASCO ) annual meeting in Chicago indicates that waiting for up to two years poses little risk to survival . <p> Since PSA is made only by prostate cells , there should n't be any in the bloodstream after a radical prostatectomy , the operation done to remove a cancerous prostate gland .

@@100736417 @4936417/ <p> If you have been diagnosed with prostate disease , chances are that you 've thought about trying some type of complementary therapy in addition to conventional medical treatment from a physician . If you have , you are not alone . Various studies have found that anywhere from 27% to 43% of American men with prostate cancer use at least one form of complementary therapy . Similar findings have been reported in Canada and Europe . Although statistics are harder to find for how many men use complementary therapies for benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , erectile dysfunction , or prostatitis , it is likely that the practice is common . <p> Unfortunately , the issue of complementary therapies does n't  often come up during a visit to the physician . Patients tend not to mention the complementary therapies they are using , while doctors may not ask about them . Often this is a function of time : A man and his doctor may have only 10 or 15 minutes together in a typical office visit . <p> To learn more about what physicians think about various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited three experts to participate in a roundtable discussion on this important topic . The panel consisted of these people : <p> Dr. Edward Giovannucci , a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health whose research has focused on how lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity contribute to the development of cancer , particularly colon cancer and prostate cancer . Dr. Giovannucci is considered one of the nations pre-eminent experts on nutrition and prostate cancer . <p> Dr. David S. Rosenthal , a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School , director and chief executive officer of Harvard University Health Service , and medical director of the Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute . In addition to serving on the editorial board of Perspectives , he is the author of numerous scientific articles and several publications for laypeople . <p> Dr. Harvey B. Simon , an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School , a member of the Health Sciences Technology Faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prostate Disease , he has authored numerous scientific articles and textbook chapters and is the founding editor of the monthly newsletter Harvard Mens Health Watch . <p> Here you will learn what these experts had to say about the issue of complementary therapies in general , as well as their interpretation of what the published evidence shows about the effectiveness of specific foods , herbs , and other complementary remedies . <p> But first , a brief explanation of the terminology that will be used . The panel agreed to use the language as defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) , a division of the National Institutes of Health . NCCAM defines alternative medicine as therapies used in place of conventional medicine , while complementary medicine consists of therapies used together with conventional medicine . Although an even newer term , integrative medicine , is becoming popular with physicians and patients who want to fully integrate both conventional and complementary practices , for the sake of simplicity this article will use " complementary " to underscore a point our experts all agreed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rather than as a substitute for conventional medical therapy . <p> How do you advise your patients when they ask about complementary therapies ? <p> ROSENTHAL : The major role of a physician is to provide advice about two areas , efficacy and safety . I tend to divide these therapies into three categories based on safety and efficacy : the first category consists of those that are both safe and have evidence of effectiveness ; the second includes those that are safe but lack evidence of efficacy ; and the third consists of those that are unsafe and have been proven ineffective . The middle category is by far the largest . It includes herbs such as saw palmetto , which some men take for BPH . These herbs and botanicals are probably safe when used alone . But in many cases there is no evidence that they actually have any effect , or the only evidence has come from small pilot studies rather than from randomized clinical trials . So the evidence is suggestive , not conclusive . <p> SIMON : I think its also important that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any complementary therapies the patient is taking . Of course , how to do all that in the allotted 10-minute office visit is another matter . <p> ROSENTHAL : ( Laughs . ) That 's exactly why I started doing integrative medicine consultations , which take up to 45 minutes to an hour . <p> SIMON : Another issue that both patients and physicians need to be aware of is that herbs can interact with other herbs , and with drugs that we prescribe . <p> ROSENTHAL : One of the most common interactions involves herbs and botanicals that affect the liver , by acting on cytochrome P450 enzymes see below . Many herbs , such as St. Johns wort , affect this system . So its important that patients understand that some herbs can enhance the effects of medications , or sometimes negate any beneficial effect . <p> When I do integrative medicine consultations , I advise people not to try too many supplements at one time . Try one herb or botanical first , and see if you tolerate it without any side effects before adding anything else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any medication . <h> Cytochrome P450 enzymes <p> Cytochrome P450 enzymes , most often found in the liver , help people metabolize drugs and herbs . But health problems may occur when you are taking a drug metabolized by cytochrome P450 and then take another drug or herb that interferes with this process . Some drugs and herbs inhibit the function of cytochrome P450 enzymes , which can lead to increased effect of a drug and possibly toxic side effects . Other drugs and herbs stimulate cytochrome P450 , so that any other drugs you are taking may be metabolized so quickly that they have little or no beneficial effect . <p> A partial list of drugs , herbs , and foods that affect cytochrome P450 follows , but you should check with your own doctor to avoid problems . <p> Antidepressants <p> Fluoxetine ( Prozac ) Sertraline ( Zoloft ) <p> Antifungals <p> Ketoconazole ( Nizoral ) Itraconazole ( Sporanox ) <p> Other medications <p> Cimetidine ( Tagamet ) Omeprazole ( Prilosec ) <p> Foods and herbs <p> GarlicGinsengGrapefruit juiceCharcoal-broiled meat <p> When it comes to vitamins and antioxidants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food or take them as supplements ? <p> SIMON : In studies done in adults , a finding that high blood levels of antioxidants correlate with a good health outcome does n't  mean at all that people will get the same good effect by taking a pill or a vitamin . <p> GIOVANNUCCI : Thats generally correct . Blood levels of particular carotenoids usually reflect a diet consistently high in fruits and vegetables , rather than any benefit from taking a supplement . <p> ROSENTHAL : And I always warn patients that nothing is standardized with respect to over-the-counter substances . The PC SPES story is a glaring example of what can happen because there is no standardization see " PC SPES : A cautionary tale " . Patients lost faith . And clinical researchers lost a great deal of time and energy . <p> SIMON : Exactly ! PC SPES was heavily promoted as a treatment for prostate cancer . But it turns out that the product contained not only the eight Chinese herbs listed on the bottle , but also a little estrogen and some other contaminants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the quality of these products . We cant verify what ingredients are in a particular bottle . So unless there 's a pretty good reason to think that something may be useful , I tell my patients , " Caveat emptor : Buyer beware . " <p> Let 's look at particular prostate diseases . What does the research show in terms of what men can do to help themselves ? <p> GIOVANNUCCI : My research focuses on lifestyle factors , which include nutrition , physical activity , and body weight . The studies show that these basic lifestyle factors actually have a lot of impact on the risk of developing various types of prostate disease . For example , there 's more and more evidence that cardiovascular disease contributes to erectile dysfunction . To lower risk for developing erectile dysfunction , or even to alleviate it , the best advice is to start exercising more , maintain a normal body weight , and avoid smoking . And some of this advice is probably also important for prostate cancer and BPH . <p> SIMON : We also need to educate physicians about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best example , since its basically a manifestation of atherosclerosis , which is a highly preventable disease . <p> GIOVANNUCCI : There is also some evidence that metabolic syndrome might be a factor in prostate cancer progression see " Metabolic syndrome " . And you can prevent or ameliorate metabolic syndrome by following the same basic advice : more exercise , a better diet . I know that 's going to sound like the same old boring message , but following this advice can have a huge benefit on overall health and on prostate diseases in particular . So patients do n't  have to go searching for exotic herbs , especially when there is essentially no evidence that they are beneficial . <h> Metabolic syndrome <p> Anyone with three or more of the following attributes meets the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome , which increases the risk of diabetes or heart disease : <p> waist size greater than 40 inches in men , or 35 inches in women <p> blood pressure of 130/85 mm Hg or more <p> HDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dl in men and less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more <p> fasting blood glucose level of 110 mg/dl or more <p> What do the studies say about the impact of lifestyle factors on prostate cancer ? Is there any way for a man to adjust his diet to reduce the risk of prostate cancer or slow its progression ? <p> GIOVANNUCCI : Unfortunately , not all of the answers are in for preventing prostate cancer , and there 's even less evidence about how to stop its progression . Again , what seems to be most important is reducing body weight or keeping body weight normal . There 's a little bit of evidence that physical activity may be helpful , but probably only at a fairly high level . Walking is probably not sufficient to reduce risk . <p> In terms of specific foods , there is reason to believe that fish , selenium , and tomatoes might all be important in reducing risk of developing prostate cancer see Table 3 . But there 's almost no evidence that changing your diet after diagnosis will have any impact on prostate cancer progression . Of course , eating a healthy diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do harm and would improve overall health , which would help men going through treatment for prostate cancer . <p> SIMON : The studies done to date on this issue are preliminary , and they do n't  produce solid evidence that something really will slow the progression of prostate cancer . But I 'm all for giving patients a ray of hope . An example is that I now advise my patients to consider selenium and possibly pomegranate juice . They 're not going to hurt you , and a small study suggests pomegranate juice might slow progression . But I also advise them not to expect too much from it . <h> PC SPES : A cautionary tale <p> PC SPES is now off the market , but in the 1990s this herbal product was promoted as being good for " prostate health . " After anecdotal reports and preliminary laboratory studies indicated that PC SPES might help men with advanced prostate cancer , the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) funded four research studies including one in patients to determine its efficacy , safety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 , however , when the FDA issued a warning about PC SPES , based on reports that men taking the supplement developed blood clots ; some patients died . Shortly after the FDA warning , NCCAM halted all four studies ( although it eventually restarted the laboratory trials ) . The U.S. distributor issued a voluntary recall and eventually went out of business . <p> Researchers analyzed samples of PC SPES to determine what went wrong and discovered that some batches were contaminated with DES , an estrogen . This helped explain a puzzling side effect many patients had experienced while taking PC SPES breast enlargement and soreness that could result from taking female hormones . Scientists discovered that other batches of PC SPES contained indomethacin , a pain reliever , and warfarin , a blood thinner . <p> Harvards Osher Institute , which conducts research into complementary therapies , is currently trying to develop a research " bank " of purified , standardized herbs so that future studies can avoid these problems . <p> GIOVANNUCCI : I agree . And just one further point is that for prostate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good prognosis , such as localized cancer , its much more likely that a man will die of something else , possibly heart disease , before he dies of prostate cancer . So I think that its probably worth putting more energy into the basics , such as diet and lifestyle , to prevent conditions like heart disease . <p> What is the current thinking about lycopene , which has certainly received a lot of attention in the press ? <p> GIOVANNUCCI : The evidence is still mainly from epidemiological studies , so its suggestive , not definitive . But the important point is that even if you go by the epidemiologic evidence , the benefits are really based on tomato consumption , and tomatoes contain many nutrients besides lycopene . So I would probably recommend slightly or somewhat increasing consumption of tomatoes or tomato products , such as tomato sauce . <p> GIOVANNUCCI : The epidemiologic data provide good evidence that cooked tomatoes enhance absorption of lycopene . There 's also evidence that oil enhances absorption of lycopene but that does n't  mean people should eat fatty pizza . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 've found that when I tell patients to eat more tomatoes , they 're not impressed . But if someone else tells them to go to the health food store and buy some lycopene pills , they dash right over . And the data suggest that eating tomatoes can help reduce risk of prostate cancer , but the evidence is not there for lycopene supplements . <p> GIOVANNUCCI : Another problem is that we have no idea how much of the lycopene contained in a supplement is absorbed by the body . <p> ROSENTHAL : We advise patients that , because of the unknown nature of over-the-counter supplements , the best way to get all of the vitamins and antioxidants you need is to eat healthy foods . <p> GIOVANNUCCI : I think that definitely makes sense because lycopene is not the only dietary factor to think about . Studies show that you may also be able to reduce your risk of prostate cancer by eating more fatty fish , which are full of omega-3 fatty acids and also contain vitamin D. Theres also some evidence that cruciferous vegetables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> SIMON : Whole grains have also shown some potential benefit for preventing prostate cancer , perhaps because they contain selenium . But we do n't  know for sure . <p> GIOVANNUCCI : Right . And if patients want to take selenium supplements , its important not to overdo it . <p> SIMON : Taking a daily multivitamin is probably good insurance for all men . For the most part , its a way to ensure that you get adequate daily requirements of vitamins without overdoing it . But there are three possible exceptions to be aware of . The first is selenium , since most multivitamins contain less than the 200 mcg that appears protective in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial see " What may work for prostate cancer " . Second , most multivitamins contain 400 IU of vitamin D , but many experts now recommend 600800 IU a day . Finally , multivitamins do n't  contain any fish oil , but men with coronary artery disease , or with major risk factors for heart disease , may benefit from 1,000 mg of omega-3 fatty acids a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they do n't  get that amount in their diet . <p> ROSENTHAL : I think another important piece of advice for patients is that they should not go on a diet while undergoing treatment for cancer . Its not healthy to lose significant amounts of weight , which a lot of fad diets will cause . <p> SIMON : Although if someone is obese and has prostate cancer , it might be a good idea to she 'd some body weight . <p> ROSENTHAL : Thats true , but once you 've been diagnosed with prostate cancer its important not to go on a crash diet , but instead adopt a healthy one . <p> How should people react when they read about something new in the paper , whether its about pomegranate juice or some new herb or botanical ? <p> SIMON : The answer is simple : React with caution . As physicians , I think we first have to point out that medicine is science , that therapies can be evaluated , and that there are big bucks involved in the selling of herbs and other unregulated remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds too good to be true , it is . <p> ROSENTHAL : I think that we should obviously also advise people to be skeptical of anything touted as a cure for cancer . And yet there are still some people out there who are going to prey on patients hope that something is going to work , and encourage them to use an alternative therapy instead of proven medical therapy . <p> GIOVANNUCCI : Maybe people get tired of hearing the same old message , but the fact is , we do know a lot about prevention of various diseases , and I think people get distracted . They are confronted every day with news about something that 's different , and may , in fact , have promise down the road . But even if it does , its effect may be relatively modest compared to what we know is effective diet and physical activity . <h> Reliable online resources <p> More and more men with prostate disease are going online to find information about health topics , including complementary therapies .

Web access costs $9.97 per month , or $92 per year . <p> What large studies on complementary therapies for prostate disease should men be aware of ? <p> ROSENTHAL : The SELECT study is the big one , which everyone is waiting for , because it will help determine whether taking selenium and vitamin E might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . But the results are n't  going to be known for years . <h> SELECT study <p> SELECT ( Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial ) is the largest prostate cancer prevention study ever undertaken , with more than 35,000 men participating . Participants have been randomly assigned to take 200 mcg of selenium or 400 IU of vitamin E or the two in combination , or a placebo and will be followed for a minimum of seven years and a maximum of 12 years . By that time it should become clear whether taking selenium or vitamin E , or both together , will reduce the risk of prostate cancer . <p> To read more about the studies cited in this table , see " What may work for BPH .

But a randomized trial involving 225 men who took saw palmetto for a year , published in 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine , found no evidence that saw palmetto was any better at improving urinary symptoms than placebo . <h> Table 2 : Complementary therapies for erectile dysfunction <p> To read more about the substances discussed in this table , see " Assessing the evidence : Erectile dysfunction . " <p> Substances that may work <p> Substance and possible mechanism of action <p> Assessment <p> Korean red ginseng <p> Derived from a plant root ; not clear how it may help alleviate erectile dysfunction , but one theory is that it increases levels of nitric oxide , a chemical that occurs naturally in the body and contributes to erections . <p> Safety considerations : Some formulations may lower blood sugar levels and alter the effects of blood pressure or heart medications ; may affect the cytochrome P450 system . <p> Three small studies suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but further study is necessary . <p> L-arginine <p> A precursor to nitric oxide ; may help erectile function by increasing blood levels of this substance . <p> Safety considerations : May increase risk of bleeding when used with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs , or with herbs such as ginkgo biloba , garlic , or saw palmetto ; when used with nitroglycerin or erectile dysfunction drugs , may cause blood pressure to drop ; may increase blood sugar levels . <p> Three small preliminary studies indicate that this substance may benefit men with low levels of nitric oxide , but larger studies are needed . Men at risk for heart disease should avoid taking this substance , as a study of possible benefits of taking L-arginine to treat heart attack survivors was stopped early when six volunteers taking this substance died . <p> Vitamin supplements <p> May have a synergistic effect when used with erectile dysfunction medication . <p> A small study of men who did not respond to medication alone found that erectile function and patient satisfaction improved in many who took daily folic acid and vitamin E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table 3 : Complementary therapies for prostate cancer <p> Many complementary therapies used for prostate cancer , such as vitamins and particular nutrients , are found naturally in food . Our panel of Harvard experts agreed that men seeking to reduce their risk of developing prostate cancer or of having it progress , if its already been diagnosed should eat a healthy diet and engage in regular physical activity . These " lifestyle " habits offer the best all-around protection because they reduce the risk of the number 1 threat to men heart disease . <p> Nevertheless , epidemiologic studies ( which follow large groups over time ) have identified a number of specific dietary factors that appear to affect risk of prostate cancer development . Data are limited , however , about whether dietary changes made after diagnosis will have any impact on cancer progression .

" <p> Substances that may reduce risk <p> Substance and possible mechanism of action <p> Impact on prostate cancer risk <p> Impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be protective ; one theory is that omega-3 fatty acids contained in fatty fish may inhibit a particular molecular pathway involved in cancer development . <p> Fair to good evidence exists that eating fish may reduce risk of prostate cancer .

A 2006 study found that men with the highest intake of fish after diagnosis were 27% less likely to have their cancer progress than men with the lowest consumption . <p> Selenium <p> May inhibit several biological pathways that encourage cancer growth , such as cell proliferation and angiogenesis . <p> Safety considerations : Taking too much can cause nausea and vomiting ; consult with your doctor if you are undergoing radiation treatment , as this supplement ( and any antioxidant ) may interfere with treatment . <p> Strong evidence exists that selenium reduces risk . A 2003 randomized controlled study found that men who took selenium supplements were 50% less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills . Several other studies reported similar findings . <p> Insufficient evidence exists regarding impact on progression . <p> Tomatoes <p> Contain a number of nutrients ; it remains unclear whether the antioxidant lycopene , some other nutrient , or combinations of nutrients underlie protective effect . <p> Good evidence that consumption of cooked tomatoes may reduce risk . A 2002 study found that men who regularly consumed two or more servings of tomato sauce per week could reduce their risk of developing prostate cancer by 35% compared with men who ate tomato sauce less than once a month . A review of 21 studies found anywhere from a 10% to 20% reduction in risk among men with the highest intake of tomatoes , with cooked tomatoes offering the most protection . <p> Increasing consumption after diagnosis may reduce progression but data are more limited . A 2006 study found that increased intake of tomato sauce after diagnosis might reduce risk of prostate cancer progression by 30% to 40% . Other studies reporting a protective effect from increased tomato consumption after treatment have been small or poorly designed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; supplements contain alpha-tocopherol , a form of vitamin E. <p> Safety considerations : May increase risk of bleeding if you are taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications ; may interfere with treatment if you are undergoing radiation therapy ( ask your doctor ) . <p> Good evidence that this may reduce risk , but the benefit is seen only in men who smoke . The Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene study , for example , reported that men who smoked and took 50-IU vitamin E supplements a day reduced risk of prostate cancer by 30% to 40% .

One study reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beta-cryptoxanthin , and zeaxanthin had a 70% to 80% reduced risk of prostate cancer . But a randomized clinical trial found that men who took beta carotene supplements had an increased risk of prostate cancer if they already had high blood levels of this antioxidant . <p> Limited data exist regarding impact on progression . <p> Melatonin <p> Inhibits prostate cancer cell growth in test tubes . <p> Safety considerations : Avoid if you are taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications ; may increase or decrease blood pressure , and may increase blood sugar levels in people with diabetes . <p> Insufficient evidence , although some studies have suggested that men with prostate cancer have lower levels of melatonin than other men . <p> A small study involving 14 men with advanced prostate cancer who were not responding to hormone therapy alone found that taking melatonin supplements in addition to hormone therapy improved response .

A large epidemiologic study found that intake of more than 1,500 mg of calcium per day might increase the risk of aggressive and fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , localized cancer . <p> Studies suggest that high calcium intake may increase the likelihood of progression . One theory is that calcium has different effects , depending on the stage of cancer development or progression . <p> Meat consumption <p> A number of studies have found that increased consumption of meat , especially red meat , increases risk of developing prostate cancer , possibly because of high fat content or the way the meat is cooked . <p> Insufficient evidence regarding impact on progression . <p> Zinc <p> Because zinc contributes to many bodily functions , including healthy immune functioning and wound healing , zinc supplements have sometimes been touted as a cure for various prostate diseases . However , there is no evidence that zinc supplements help and in prostate cancer , such supplements may cause harm . <p> Limited evidence that zinc supplements may increase risk .

@@100736418 @4936418/ 46989 @qwx906989 <p> The prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) test can generate more questions than answers . If your level is high , it could mean that your prostate is enlarged or infected . It could mean that you have prostate cancer . It could also mean that your prostate gland is healthy , since normal PSA levels vary widely from one man to another . Because of this variability , PSA tests often lead to prostate biopsies among men who do n't  have cancer . That 's why doctors would prefer that only men at high risk for prostate cancer have PSA tests . A study published this month in the journal European Urology suggests that men who have defects in a cancer-suppressing gene known as BRCA are at high risk for aggressive prostate tumors , and so could benefit from PSA testing . <p> The BRCA gene comes in two forms , BRCA1 and BRCA2 . Both make proteins that repair the genetic damage that all cells experience thousands of times a day . When these genes carry the wrong code , they do n't  work as intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . " Bad " BRCA genes ( BRCA-positive ) lose their DNA-fixing ability . As a result , genetic damage can accumulate to the extent that healthy cells turn cancerous . <p> In women , miscoded BRCA genes are well-known risk factors for breast and ovarian cancer . This new study shows that they can also pose problems for men . The authors of the study recommend that men with miscoded BRCA genes have routine PSA tests . <p> " PSA might detect early stage cancers in these men while they 're still curable , " says William Isaacs , Ph.D. , a professor of urology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore , who was not involved in the study . <p> An international team of researchers has been following nearly 2,500 men as part of a study called IMPACT . It includes some men with miscoded BRCA genes and others with normal BRCA genes . Of these , 199 had high PSA levels , of whom 162 had prostate biopsies to look for prostate cancer . Biopsies revealed prostate cancer in 59 men . The cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with normal BRCA genes . Equally important , men in the BRCA-positive group " especially those with BRCA2 mutations " tended to have more high-grade , aggressive tumors . <p> What remains unclear is which men should have their BRCA genes checked . Men whose mothers or sisters have or had breast or ovarian cancer might consider BRCA testing .

@@100736421 @4936421/ <p> Over the past four years , I 've read numerous studies and spoken with several experts on the connection between nutrition and prostate cancer . Although their recommendations for men concerned about prostate health havent always been consistent , most agreed on two things : eat more healthy fat , particularly the omega-3 fats found in fatty fish like salmon , and eat less unhealthy fat , namely trans and saturated fats . So I did a double take when I came across a study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that came to the opposite conclusion . <p> Chronic inflammation may play a role in the development and progression of prostate cancer . Omega-3 fats tend to be calm inflammation , while trans fats tend promote it . So researchers analyzed data and blood samples from 3,461 men ages 55 to 84 in the nationwide Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial to examine the relationship between the levels of these and other fats and prostate cancer risk . <p> Men with the highest levels of DHA , a type of omega-3 , were 2.5 times more likely to have developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with men who had the lowest levels of DHA " the exact opposite of what the researchers had hypothesized . Another surprising result was that men with the highest blood levels of trans fats , often found in processed foods , were 50% less likely to have developed aggressive , high-grade prostate cancer compared with those who had the lowest levels . <p> Should these results prompt men to scale back on fish and eat more processed food ? I put that question to Stacy Kennedy , senior clinical nutritionist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , and Dr. David Rosenthal , director of Harvard University Health Service and medical director of the Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies at Dana-Farber . Both gave me an emphatic " no . " One key reason : the risk of dying from heart disease is much higher than the risk of dying from prostate cancer . <p> Eating moderate amounts of wild salmon , walnuts , pumpkin seeds , and other foods rich in omega-3s is a healthy strategy , Kennedy told me . The best " medicine " for men who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy weight , eat plenty of fruits and vegetables , exercise regularly , and control stress . The good news is that taking these steps will promote heart health , too . <p> What would be a moderate amount of salmon ?

If so , it would be interesting to know of the prostate cancer incidence rate in those populations . <p> I wish the absolute risk increase had been given . This report does n't  give sufficient information to make an informed judgment . What is the value that is increased by a factor of 2.5 ? If it is very low then its not a big deal . If it is not so low then there is reason for concern . <p> just basing research on diet and food without looking at pesticide residues in fat and lipid production and the resulting endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no greater cause of oxidative stress in my view than the continued use of excess pesticides with associated penetrants or surfucants designed to permeate the plant waxes possibly causing chaos in the human fat and lipid chain . <p> Once again the epidemiologists have stirred up some cloudy soup ! The contrairian results of this study are so outstanding that they have to be approached with great caution . The statistical analyses shows confidence limits around the mean values big enoug to drive a truck through . <p> So before anyone dumps the accepted wisdom regarding omega 3s and their ilk , let 's see if anyone replicates the results . Keep the grill hot and the fresh fish broiling ! <p> I too would be interested in knowing the incidence of prostate cancer in Japan and surrounding areas that consume large amounts of Omega 3 . <p> I am a nutritionist and have learned that men that consume large amounts of omega 6 increase their risk of prostate cancer ? <p> My husband has had prostitis for 6+ months .

@@100736430 @4936430/ <p> Researchers have answered these questions and countless others through clinical trials , scientific studies that compare novel drugs and treatments with the current standard of care to determine what 's best for patients and improve medical practice . <p> But launching a clinical trial is n't easy , and it requires more than simply coming up with a testable hypothesis . Its costly , too . Today , a pharmaceutical company seeking to test a drug may spend tens of millions of dollars to recruit study participants , provide them with the drug , track their response to the drug over time , and analyze mountains of data . <p> Decades ago , individual investigators decided that they might find a cure for cancer more quickly if they collaborated on clinical trials . They started cooperative groups networks of medical centers , universities , community hospitals , oncologists , laboratory scientists , statisticians , and administrators to develop and sustain trials . The goal : find new strategies for the prevention , detection , and treatment of cancers and improve understanding of the biology of the disease . Several cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , including the Southwest Oncology Group ( SWOG ) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) , European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) , Cancer and Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) , and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) . <p> At the American Urological Associations annual meeting in May 2008 , Dr. E. David Crawford , chairman of SWOGs Genitourinary Committee since 1980 , highlighted some of the current trials under way around the world in urologic oncology . He also spoke about the need to enroll more patients in clinical trials and the many challenges investigators face in completing a trial . <p> After hearing his presentation , editors at Harvard Medical School invited Dr. Crawford to share his thoughts on prostate research with readers . In addition to being a principal investigator on many studies that have shaped our thinking on prostate diseases , Dr. Crawford is a professor of surgery , urology , and radiation oncology , and senior associate director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest in SWOG ? <p> SWOG began about 50 years ago as a leukemia study group . It has evolved into a multidisciplinary group that studies melanoma , leukemia , and gastrointestinal , genitourinary , lung , and breast cancers . We also have committees focused on biology , pathology , and translational medicine , which focuses on moving discoveries from the laboratory bench to the bedside and vice versa . That 's an area of intense interest right now . <p> SWOGs mission is to ask and answer difficult questions through clinical trials to advance cancer care . SWOG has several thousand members , representing just about every state in the United States and many countries around the world . Members include physicians , researchers , and clinical investigators who can enroll patients in studies . <p> What are some of the highlights of SWOG studies in general and with respect to prostate cancer ? How has SWOG changed urologic practice ? <p> Well , I think the first highlight has been our ability to bring together a strong multidisciplinary team , including medical oncologists , radiation oncologists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an important part of the team because they often see the patients first . Theyve contributed a lot to prostate research over the years . Many people in the Southwest Oncology Group have made significant contributions to our understanding of prostate cancer and have become internationally known . <p> In the area of prostate cancer , you 're probably very familiar with the concept of combined androgen blockade . Much of what we know about the combined androgen blockade comes from a study we did that was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. * More New England Journal of Medicine studies on hormone therapy followed that first one . Our work got the anti-androgen flutamide approved . And we 've also studied the use of chemotherapy prior to surgery . <p> Another one of the star trials that the Southwest Oncology Group did looked at the use of finasteride in preventing prostate cancer . In the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial ( PCPT ) , we showed that the drug could reduce the risk of cancer by about 25% . But because the initial analysis of the data also indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subset of men , its use for cancer prevention never caught on . <p> As you know , we went back and did a new analysis of the data and prostate tissue samples . In addition to reducing overall prostate cancer risk by 25% to 30% , finasteride showed no tendency to increase the risk of high-grade tumors . In fact , it decreased the rate of aggressive tumors by 27% . There 's nothing else out there that comes close to that . <p> What " caused " the aggressive tumors in the first analysis of the PCPT data ? Why the discrepancy between the initial findings and the recent results ? <p> If you put six needles in a prostate for a biopsy , you 're more likely to find cancer in a smaller prostate than in a larger prostate . Because finasteride shrinks the prostate , you have a higher chance of detecting cancer including high-grade cancer in men who take it compared with men who have larger prostates and do n't  take the drug . Its like looking for oil : if you can narrow your search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find it . <p> Also , finasteride takes BPH out of the picture . When men take it , their PSA should drop by half . If it does n't  , you 're going to have a higher chance of detecting cancer . In my mind , there 's no discrepancy , but not everybodys convinced of that . <p> Do you prescribe finasteride for all of your patients ? <p> No , I do n't  . Nobody does . Finasteride and dutasteride , which belong to a class of drugs called 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors , are wonderful drugs . They can help men keep their hair , * prevent BPH from progressing and ease its symptoms , and reduce the risk of prostate cancer . But men are n't  going to go on them wholesale . I discuss these drugs with men who are over 50 , have a family history of prostate cancer , or have urinary symptoms . <p> In the PCPT , we gathered a wealth of data , including lots of blood and tissue samples . Using that data , I think we will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will benefit from the drug . <p> *Note : The hair-loss drug Propecia contains a low dose of finasteride . Physicians prescribe higher doses of finasteride ( Proscar ) for the treatment of BPH , also called an enlarged prostate . The PCPT did not specifically look at hair loss , but researchers suspect that the finasteride in Proscar regrows hair , or prevents further hair loss , like Propecia does . <p> How are you going to do that ? <p> There are new markers coming out . You could have a molecular chromosomal profile to determine prostate cancer risk . Some people are doing that now , but I do n't  know how accurate it is . Well put PSA , family history , molecular information , and a bunch of other factors into a risk calculator . Were not there yet , but I think well be able to tell a patient , " Heres what your risk is , " and determine when it would be appropriate for him to go on a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor like finasteride or dutasteride . <p> Do you receive requests to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We do receive requests . How do we sort them out ? Its a democratic system in that the information is passed around and discussed . Things have a way of either smelling good or smelling bad . Something may sound like a great idea at first , but once it gets circulated and people talk about what the challenges will be , you see that it is just not going to make it into development . <p> What resources do you need to complete a trial ? For example , what did it take to complete the study of leuprolide plus placebo versus leuprolide plus flutamide ? <p> Well , that 's an older study , and things have changed a lot since then . If you turn back the calendar to the 1980s when that study was designed , you had some physicians with enough data from patients to show that a certain dose of flutamide was safe and that it might be effective when combined with leuprolide . What they wanted to do was challenge the gold standard of taking leuprolide alone . So they did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was pretty straightforward . The variable was an anti-androgen , flutamide . And it was relatively easy to enroll patients because , unless they wanted to go to Canada , they could n't get flutamide . <p> Now , it takes a lot more paperwork and effort to get studies approved by institutional review boards and activated . On the one hand , that protects patients and ensures that the data you collect are uniform and can be submitted as part of the drug-approval process . But that also means that the whole process has gotten extremely complicated and expensive . The amount of paperwork is just mind-boggling . So we have to pick studies very carefully . We do n't  have unlimited resources . <p> How are the SWOG studies funded ? How much does it cost to do a study ? <p> We are supported almost exclusively by the National Cancer Institute . There 's a competitive renewal of grants every year . Its hard to put a price tag on a study because its financed through a cooperative group , but its expensive . Trials are particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsored by a pharmaceutical company that 's been ongoing in prostate cancer has cost over $300 million to do . I think trials are less expensive when they 're done through a cooperative group like SWOG because the investigators are already in place and all of the mechanisms are in place . But they 're still expensive and time-consuming . <p> What 's the largest phase III SWOG prostate cancer study under way now ? <p> The one that 's ongoing right now will be another blockbuster trial . It was designed to answer the question of whether intermittent hormone therapy might be better than continuous hormone therapy for patients with advanced disease. * Were looking to enroll about 2,300 participants in this study . <p> *Note : To learn more about this study , log on to www.clinicaltrials.gov and click on " Search for Clinical Trials . " Then enter the protocol identification number SWOG-9346 . <p> Weve been wondering whether we could cycle patients on and off hormone therapy , not only prolonging survival , but reducing side effects and costs as well . Its a great question . The idea was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There was n't a lot of argument about it the idea was very well received . There was discussion , though , about how long people should be treated , how long they should be off treatment , and what the PSA nadir should be before temporarily halting treatment . <p> The trial has been activated , and its been accruing pretty steadily , though not as rapidly as wed like to see . One reason is that if people think they know the answer to the question about which treatment regimen is better , they are going to pursue that regimen on their own . Given a choice , patients will say , " I know I want this , not that , so I 'm not going to enter the trial . " The second reason is that the pool of patients with advanced prostate cancer has shrunk substantially . We just do n't  have as many as we used to . And even though they 've been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer , a lot of them do n't  have any symptoms . But I think were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data Safety and Monitoring Committee to say that they have some preliminary results . <p> What hormonal therapies were chosen for the trial ? <p> Its a combined androgen blockade for nine months . After that , those with a PSA less than 4 ng/ml randomly receive either continuous or intermittent hormone therapy , with a combined androgen blockage throughout . <p> There are parallel studies ongoing in another cooperative group in Canada . They are looking at intermittent versus continuous hormone therapy for biochemical failure after radiation , so we should get some answers there , too . <p> Can you ask multiple questions or test multiple hypotheses in one trial ? <p> Well , we do collect a lot of data that we mine for other information . For example , one of the things that came out of a recent trial that was presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology is that people with metastatic disease who lowered their PSA to undetectable levels lived longer than people who did n't  get their PSA to less than 4 ng/ml. * So we defined a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Researchers are now interested in doing clinical trials to evaluate drugs in these patients . <p> We do n't  have all that data yet , but yes , it does . The faster you reach your nadir , the better your outcome as long as the PSA nadir is undetectable . <p> Do you always get enough patients to enroll to have statistically significant results ? <p> Occasionally and more often than I like to see we have great ideas and activate studies , but we do n't  get patients enrolling . One example is the START study . This is a phase III randomized trial comparing active surveillance with radical treatment either surgery or radiation therapy . Its an excellent , state-of-the-art study attempting to answer critical questions , but since it started about a year ago , I think only a few dozen men have enrolled . <p> Another example is a CALGB study called the PUNCH trial . Its comparing the rate of biochemical progressionfree survival in high-risk patients with localized prostate cancer who have a radical prostatectomy with or with out chemotherapy and hormones beforehand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before surgery slows the cancers possible return ; its a critical question . But this study is not accruing well either . <p> I think its sad that these studies exist but patients are n't  enrolling .

" For details on the START study , enter the protocol identification number NCT00499174 . For details on the PUNCH trial , enter the protocol identification number CALGB-90203 . <p> Part of the problem is also that even though we have well-designed studies , we do n't  market them . By " we , " I mean cooperative groups , individual researchers , and , to some degree , pharmaceutical companies . This is where we fall behind . We do n't  have CDs , pamphlets , or reminders .

Its not that they close because we are n't  asking great questions . We are . Its that patients do n't  know about the trials or that they are n't  willing to enroll . One trial that closed was SWOG 8890 , which looked at radiation versus surgery , an age-old question . But investigators did n't  put patients on it . Another such trial was to compare brachytherapy with surgery . That one did n't  accrue enough patients . Another one was looking at hormone therapy prior to radical prostatectomy . That one did n't  accrue enough patients . <p> For SWOG , it used to be that I would decide that pursuing the trial was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee tracks accrual . If it looks like were not going to have enough people , they say its futile and the trial closes . <p> One of the more recent trials to close was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company . They were studying Taxotere ( docetaxel ) , a type of chemotherapy , in high-risk patients after radical prostatectomy . The trial was supposed to accrue several thousand patients , but only about 1,700 enrolled in a few years , so the company closed it . As for when to close a trial , that varies , but you get to a point where you realize that you 're not going to have enough patients to get a statistically significant answer . Continuing the trial at that point is a waste of resources and not the right thing to do for patients . <p> So patients should ask their primary care physicians and specialists about participating in studies ? <p> Prostate research is about 10 to 15 years behind research into breast and colorectal cancers because , in general , men are more reluctant than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the number of women who go on breast cancer trials versus men on prostate cancer trials , you are looking at about 30,000 versus 9,000 a year . That 's why we 've learned so much about breast cancer in recent years . Hopefully , we can encourage more men to consider participating in a clinical trial . <p> What exciting developments can prostate cancer patients expect in the next five years ? What does the future look like in terms of prostate cancer treatment ? <p> I think were going to continue finding prostate cancers early on , but well use less aggressive treatments than we have right now . All of the talk has been about surgical robots and how much radiation we can use without destroying surrounding tissues . But robots in particular have been a lateral step , not a step forward , in the treatment of prostate cancer . There 's no question that in some peoples hands , robotic surgery may be a little bit better than a traditional approach . But its the person who performs the robotic procedure that matters , not the robot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made more progress by focusing on other areas , such as less aggressive treatments with targeted , or focal , therapies . I think we really need to look at whether we can treat just part of the prostate something equivalent to a lumpectomy , instead of a mastectomy , in women with breast cancer . <p> Youve talked about the male lumpectomy in the past and now it seems to be coming to fruition . <p> Yes , the train has left the station , so to speak . The problem is that people are doing it , but I do n't  think some of them are doing it right . Some people are looking at eight biopsies , or cores , in a patient with prostate cancer ; most of those biopsy samples were probably taken from one side of the prostate or were only positive on one side of the prostate , so they only treat half of the prostate . Weve shown that that is n't going to work because small but significant cancers can be missed . You simply cant rely on a few biopsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do biopsies at 5-millimeter intervals aided by a grid like those used for placing radioactive seeds during brachytherapy. * If you biopsy every one of those 5-millimeter holes where the seeds would go , you will not miss the cancer . We found this out through autopsies of men who werent known to have prostate cancer and from men who had a radical prostatectomy . That was the first thing I did before we embarked on focal therapy : prove that we werent going to miss the cancer . <p> So that means we might do 60 to 90 biopsies , or more specifically , mapping biopsies . We map very precisely where the cancer is in three dimensions and then treat just the cancer , not the whole prostate . <p> Right now , were using cryotherapy to freeze cancerous tissue . We will be using HIFU , which stands for high-intensity focused ultrasound , to heat tissue . We will also be using a technique called irreversible electroporation , which uses two electrodes and an electrical current to " drill " microscopic holes in tumor cell membranes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membrane . If we can kill all the cancer cells with electrical pulses , we would n't need to use toxic chemotherapy drugs . That 's why this is such exciting technology . <p> Who is a candidate for targeted focal therapy ? <p> The average patient I see right now is a 58-year-old man with a PSA of 5 ng/ml and one positive biopsy with a Gleason 6 cancer . This patient will generally have a radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and be cured . But then I start wondering whether I 've overtreated the patient . So what I do is take patients who probably have low-risk cancers and do the mapping biopsies . We find that about 60% of them have bilateral disease cancer that 's on both sides of the prostate that 's more extensive or of a higher grade than we originally thought . I do n't  think we can accurately treat them with targeted focal therapy . But about 40% of patients who have mapping biopsies have low-risk cancers that can be treated this way . <h> Figure 1 : Mapping biopsy <p> Doctors use a grid like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy called brachytherapy . The grid can also aid doctors performing a mapping biopsy . Tissue samples are taken every 5 millimeters , front to back and side to side . ( Each dot on the grid represents a hole through which a needle can be inserted . ) This allows doctors to map the location of tumors in three dimensions and determine if a patient might be a candidate for focal therapy . <p> Are n't  those patients also candidates for active surveillance ? <p> Yes , they could pursue active surveillance . But most men , given the choice between active surveillance and focal therapy , will choose focal therapy because they want to do something . That 's what makes focal therapy so appealing . <p> What 's on the horizon in terms of advanced disease ? What about hormone therapy and chemotherapy ? <p> In terms of advanced disease , I think we 've come as far as were going to go with chemotherapy . Its just going to be a matter of reducing toxicity . In the future , well be looking more at combining chemotherapy with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels feeding the tumors or the spread of cancer into bone . I think well also see chemotherapy used earlier on in high-risk patients and not just in patients who have exhausted other treatment possibilities . <p> There is renewed interest in androgens and androgen receptors . Its almost as if we 've rediscovered that the lower a man can get his testosterone and the longer he can keep it down or block it , the better off he is . And people whose cancers would have been considered hormone-refractory in the past really are n't  termed that anymore . They are now hormone-insensitive cancers . We can try different hormones for them . Were also developing new agents to attack testosterone development early on . <p> Can you make some comments about your work on BPH and what you see on the horizon there ? <p> I think that we have made a great deal of progress in the understanding of BPH over the years , and we understand a lot more about the role of medical therapy in treating BPH . Patients do n't  need to wait until their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help with symptoms like urinary retention . <p> One thing that we 've been able to do is identify men who are at risk of progression men with BPH who have a PSA of 1.6 ng/ml or greater and a prostate that weighs 31 grams or more. * They are on the slippery slope , meaning that they are more likely to have continued prostate growth and urinary retention and need surgery . So its important to identify men in that group and institute medical therapy . <p> *Note : See " BPH progression . " <p> The two most common therapies are alpha-1 blockers the most common of which is tamsulosin ( Flomax ) and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors the most common of which is dutasteride ( Avodart ) . These drugs are capable of arresting the disease and providing almost instant gratification in terms of symptom relief . <p> We need to get the word out to family practitioners that an elevated PSA is a surrogate for an enlarged prostate . Even if you do n't  have symptoms , if you have an enlarged prostate , then you 're at risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've made a lot of progress against prostate cancer in the last two decades . Screening has resulted in the discovery of early-stage disease . And we 've made strides in hormone therapy and established the value of chemotherapy in men with advanced prostate cancer .

It is located in front of the rectum and just below the bladder ( see illustration below ) .

Counterintuitively , the top of the prostate is called the base and the bottom is called the apex . <h> Location of the prostate gland <p> In general , doctors divide the prostate into three zones ( see image below ) : the peripheral ( 1 ) , central ( 2 ) , and transition ( 3 ) zones . Most prostate cancers arise in the peripheral zone , the outer area of the prostate , which is next to the rectum . Doctors can sometimes feel a prostate tumor through the rectal wall during a digital rectal examination . Semen stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the urethra for ejaculation . The transition zone is the innermost section of the prostate . Prostate tissue in this area wraps around the urethra . <h> Zones of the prostate <p> Because the prostate is located so close to urinary and sexual organs , prostate problems can affect urination and sexual function . For example , when men reach their 40s , the prostate often begins to enlarge . Over time , it can press on the urethra and slow or even prevent the flow of urine , in much the same way that bending a running garden hose halts the flow of water . This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia , or BPH ( see image below ) . <p> To function properly , the prostate requires adequate amounts of certain hormones , including testosterone , produced by the testicles , as well as others produced by the pituitary and adrenal glands .

In some cases , PIN can progress to cancer . The condition is usually diagnosed following a prostate biopsy or surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . But the diagnosis , which is based on a pathologist 's reading of the tissue sample , is rather subjective , resulting in large differences in the reported incidence of PIN . <p> To study the magnitude of overdiagnosis , researchers in Virginia reviewed 251 patients who had been diagnosed initially with PIN .
