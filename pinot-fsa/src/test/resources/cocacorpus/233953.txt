Is there NO way to have capital letters for a ... <p> Are you talking about typing in a domain name using capital letters or posting a link that has capital letters in it ? Do n't worry about it and I do n't think there is anything you can do about it anyway . 31684 @qwx891684 31684 @qwx891684 <p> Domain names are technically all lowercase , although all of the browsers ( at least the recent ones ) do n't care what case you use . You can use all uppercase , all lowercase , or mixed or camel case without a problem . Browsers generally convert it to lowercase after you hit &lt;enter&gt; , though . <p> Nonetheless , go ahead and make your links with uppercase letters for readability . I think people look at what you put on your site or print in your advertising more than they look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter if the capitals are used or not when typing an addy into a browser ( except AFTER the domain name ) <p> Of course it does n't matter when you type it in ; the domain name portion will just all get converted to lower case and WORK just fine . As I said , it 's a branding issue for my client . They 'd like the URL to show up the same way in a browser as it looks in their promo . <p> But my question is WHY is this the case ? Why ca n't capitals be used ( and stay that way ) in domain names , whereas they not only work , but are crucial when referencing directories and files ( at least on UNIX systems ) ? Is it everyone 's browser doing the converting , or is that happening on the server ? If it 's the server , why does the server do this ? <p> There are two exceptions that I know of . www.Doamin.com or www.domain.com , and e-mail addresses . In regard to the actual domain name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exception to a Unix server . If it is browser based then I have to wonder why the exception also works for e-mail addresses . 31684 @qwx891684 <p> If you create your links correctly , they will work . Not sure what happens in firefox . <p> http : **26;0;TOOLONG will redirect to http : //jaguarpc.com/support/ because " jaguarpc.com " is the domain name in apache 's virtual host . If it was JaguarPC.com , it would still change to lower case . It can be on browser end as well and web server end as well . The above is from server end redirecting to lowercase . <p> On the server end this may be changed on a vps or dedicated server by patching Apache . Not sure what is the behaviour of IIS . <p> And if the browser also changes to lowercase , you can always develop your own browser <p> 3.2.3 URI Comparison When comparing two URIs to decide if they match or not , a client SHOULD use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire URIs , with these exceptions : - A port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default port for that URI-reference ; - Comparisons of host names MUST be case-insensitive ; - Comparisons of scheme names MUST be case-insensitive ; - An empty abspath is equivalent to an abspath of " / " . Characters other than those in the " reserved " and " unsafe " sets ( see RFC 2396 42 ) are equivalent to their " " % " HEX HEX " encoding . For example , the following three URIs are equivalent : http : **28;28;TOOLONG http : **28;58;TOOLONG http : //ABC.com : /%7esmith/home.html <p> So , the domain name portion does n't matter since one is limited to a narrower character set ( no special characters allowed for registration with registrar ) with both upper and lowercase characters getting " downcased " by default . The rest of the path is supposed to be case-specific and allows some special characters ... all characters of which must be encodable to some universal standard . <p> Make the domain whatever you want . Clients , to be operating within spec , will automatically assume it is all in lowercase anyway to correlate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ICANN if you want ) and the rest of the path after the root demarcator " / " is case-specific . <p> If you create your links correctly , they will work . Not sure what happens in firefox . <p> Yes , it works in IE. You can type in the domain name with uppercase letters and it stays that way . In Firefox , the domain gets lowercased , so that must be the browser that 's doing it . <p> I installed a RewriteRule in htaccess to switch to the domain name with uppercase letters , and it works beautifully in IE 5 ( type in lowercase , gets switched to uppercase ) , but not IE 6 ! If you type in the domain with uppercase letters in IE 6 , they stay there , but once you click on a link , even links with uppercase domain hard coded into them , it goes back to lower case . <p> I did n't do any patching in Apache -- this site is on a shared server -- so I ca n't test that method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links on JaguarPC.com because they all seem to have " www.jaguarpc.com " hard coded into them ( no relative links ) . <p> I suggest you make the domain name visible in a title of the website . As what you are trying to do now , will most certainly be a problem later on when you get new versions of software , as you are not following RFC regulations . <p> No , what he 's doing is n't against the RFC . Case in domain names is n't sensitive for comparison , but it says nothing about it being preserving . Software are free to preserve the case at their discretion . However , plenty of software does n't preserve case , from browsers to search engines to servers , so it 's probably not worth fighting for .

@@99682441 @3882441/ <h> Blog 31685 @qwx891685 <p> By Sabrina August 15 , 2014 , 7:02 AM <h> Add Protection and Security to Your Dedicated Server <p> Using a secure and dedicated server hosting service offers users a great deal security and protection upfront . Yet , if you are looking to add more security to your already secured dedicated server hosting service from JaguarPC , there are some additional steps you can take . Below are a few tasks that you can perform to reduce your servers risk of an attack . <p> Tip 1 : Change the SSH ( Secure Shell ) Listen Port Within your server , change your port to a number other than 22 . Since 22 is the default SSH Listening Port , it would be wise to change this number to something different or obscure . By completing this fairly simple task , you will prevent automated brute-force attacks from trying to guess the usernames and passwords within your secure and dedicated server . <p> Tip 2 : Use Only TLS ( Transport Layer Security ) Another way to give your server more protection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfaces for your server administration . Transport Layer Security is a protocol that will ensure privacy between the communication of your server and your computer . Your privacy is maintained through TLS because this protocol encrypts the data that you send between your secure and dedicated server and your computer . This handy protocol prevents hackers from gaining access to your login information , which they would then use to attack you . <p> Tip 3 : Keep Your Software Updated This may seem like a no brainer , but if your website is going to stay secure , you need to perform software updates when they become available . Just remember that it is much easier for a hacker to gain access to your server when your software is outdated . This is because when your software is outdated , it is much easier for hackers to find and exploit entry points in your software . So keep this in mind the next time you are about to decline a software update . Consider subscribing to JaguarPCs RSS feed to learn about the latest bug fixes and other tweaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tip 4 : Your Username and Password Another more obvious tip , but having a password that is difficult to crack is probably the most essential aspect of your sites actual security . However , if you are like most people , you probably created a password that is very easy to remember . For instance , it might be the name of your relative , friend , pet , or an important date . If no one has ever told you before , having a very common and guessable password is a big no-no . Hackers have special tools to perform a cryptanalytic attack on your dedicated and server to retrieve your password . This type of an attack will continue to try possible words until the right one is located . Thus , do yourself a favor and make your login password strong . Have it include different cases of letters , symbols , and numbers in a random assortment . Finally , remember to keep this password safe and change it regularly .

@@99682451 @3882451/ <p> This is a discussion on How long does it take FSCK to run ? ! in the Dedicated and Cloud Servers forum 2AM last night Jaguar support sent me a ticket saying FSCK was running on my &amp;quot ; hardware node&amp;quot ; and that it would be completed &amp;quot ; shortly&amp;quot ; . That ... <p> FSCK runs will run as long as is needed to repair and check the filesystem , so depending on the how large the arrays are on a system , and how long ago the previous FSCK was done , and how much data did change . Really no way to tell you this , especialy not if the hardware RAID is also trying to do its job as a disk did fail . <p> I must say that 8 hours would be quite some time for a FSCK , but it seems that other hosting companies have exactly the same problem when a disk fails . Maybe they should make more filesystems to avoid this from happening , but then i do n't know if that would be a good sollution or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does n't carry on for much longer , I too have been offline for over 8.5 hours now , and that does seem a lot more than the message <p> The VPS node draco.nocdirect.com is displaying some filesystem problems and is undergoing file system check FSCK at this time . The node should be back up shortly . Thank you for your patience <p> leads us to believe . <p> Is there an anticipated time of completion for this yet , I do n't want to disturb Support , because the more times they get bothered the longer this repair could take and I am sorry to have to say , surely this has already taken too long.Whilst this may be an overnight job in the USA in Europe ( where I am ) this has taken the whole day already and we are well into the evening . <p> now its almost 11+hrs since the service is down , i thought the downtime will be minimum but now its feeling like it is taking forever ... I contacted support 10min ago they said they can not give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still more downtime to go ... as if there was little more left they would have said 1 or 2hrs or moreless ... <p> I wish there was something we could do to reduce , or better yet elliminate , them . This is one benefit a dedicated server has over vps , if you had your own 40-60gig drive or better it could work/repair that at worst in a few hours , usually much faster . <p> As a vps client on a node , your just a fraction of a much larger array . If there are problems from a poor shutdown it wont go until its all checked . By all means we are open to ideas on how to approach or better deal with this type of impact to you , the client . From a client point of view you just see downtime and silence ... fsck , fsck , fsck ... all we see is a flying cursor fixing files . I still cant beleive an fsck takes this long either if I did n't  see it for myself . <p> We just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to avoid the need for fsck 's but its something that ca n't be outright escaped nor should it . This happens as inodes get lost , corrupt , etc during use as a machine is improperly or abruptly shut down . The machine can usually do an fsck if things are n't  too bad very quickly and move on . When its looking like there could be sevre problems if it allowed things to continue then it wont even boot until you talk the long walk through each partition ... and on a vz node the /vz partition is a big nasty hog . <p> All that technical stuff is great , Jag , and I appreciate it because I understand it , but it does n't get back the two clients I lost during the downtime . Downtime I was n't responsible for , downtime I did n't cause , and downtime I could do nothing about . But who suffers ? You ? No. 31684 @qwx891684 <p> Looks like that 's where these big ass machines really come to a halt : these checks just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right : smaller arrays are the only way out . Guess that means either smaller machines or multiple arrays per server . In the latter case a hard shut-down could still corrupt all ( two or three ) arrays , but at least you would have the option of plugging one ( or two ) into a test machine to get the checks done at twice ( or thrice ) the speed - I do presume these are all hotpluggable drives anyway . 31684 @qwx891684 <p> Well yeah , it is unusually hot around here and will remain so for more than a week . But ehm .. I do n't think you 're refering to that , are you ? <p> In other words : care to elaborate on the enigmatic statement ? <p> Or should I on mine ? What I meant is that generally with these multi-cpu systems with their big memory banks and all , twice as big a system gets twice as much work done in the same amount of time . So you can have twice as many users on it , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with low tide on others and everyone is happy with the awesome power at their fingertips . <p> Not so with these darn arrays , it seems . Twice as big an array takes twice as long ( or longer ? ) to check up . Nothing the bad ass raid controller and massive cpu power can do to alleviate it . In addition to that , it would seem that twice as many users means twice as many system crashes relating to user activity and it seems that such hard crashes of the hardware node are what make an extensive fsck necessary . And of course , twice as many users means twice as many users affected by the outage . Then , to top it of , it appears such a big VPS machine takes a lot of time ( one or two hours ? ) to bring all VPSses ( back ) up after a system restart .. <p> So , perhaps over the top bad ass , maximum redundancy machines are NOT the best way to go with these VPSses after all ? <p> I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better yet elliminate , them .

For one , what do you mean by " the poor shutdown " ? How did that happend ? Do n't you have UPS and dual power supply on these servers ? I guess no . <p> For two , why putting all your eggs in one basket ? Make smaller data partitions , for example , 1 partition for each VPS . Have a small root and /usr partitions . If you do - it 's not true that the server wont boot if you skip fsck . You can boot just fine with root and /usr and mount each VPS partition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get NAS or ( may be ) DAS . It 's not that expensive these days . <p> And last , have a daily backups and a spare server readily available . If a server goes down for whatever reason and is not expected to be back in 15 mins , unplug the failed server and let it do fsck off line . Use the spare server with the backup data instead . Most users would n't mind to lose changes made during the last 24 hours if the alternative is losing 12-24 hours of uptime . And for those who want to recover every single bit of changes , you can grant temporary access to the failed box when it completes fsck ( some time in the next century , that is ) . <p> After " unclean " shutdown , all partitions are marked " unclean " , prompting fs check . However , small root and /usr partitions are checked/fixed fast and they are just enough to get the server started . You get in trouble only if you have 1 big partition , which was probably the case here .

Are you about to throw your computer out the window ? If you have been running into a lack of resources and an up tick in traffic then it might be time to invest in a VPS web hosting plan . <p> Businesses can quickly outgrow shared hosting plans when they experience the need for more resources to handle an influx of visitors , have advanced security settings requirements and specialized software needs . As your business grows so does your demand for more resources . <h> Slow Website <p> If your site is slow you most likely need more resources like bandwidth and disk space .

Shared hosting is generally a starting point for small sites and blogs . If you have a large and complex site with growing traffic then shared hosting is n't the best choice . Shopping carts , heavy dynamic content sites and video streams are not suitable for shared hosting plans . As your business website evolves , you want the best performance possible and a VPS can deliver advanced needs with incredible results . <h> Bigger Budget , Better Business <p> Online businesses need the advantages that a larger budget can deliver .

@@99682457 @3882457/ <p> There are many reasons you may select a dedicated server hosting plan for your business , but a common factor is control . Unlike shared hosting , a dedicated server is yours to configure and maintain in a way that fits your business . But although a dedicated server comes with full remote desktop and console access , this level of control brings with it a lot of responsibility . <p> If there are multiple accounts on a hardware server , such as in a shared hosting or virtual private server ( VPS hosting ) plan , your hosting provider should ensure the ongoing performance and security of your server . In the case of dedicated server hosting , it is your obligation to protect your server against a variety of online threats and take the necessary steps to remedy a security breach . <p> To help you understand the security landscape that surrounds your dedicated server hosting service , JaguarPC shares our years of experience and expertise below . Read on to learn the three most common types of security breach on a dedicated server hosting plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server from these attacks . <p> Denial of service attacks can cripple your dedicated server hosting service <p> Some security threats your dedicated server faces are designed to steal data and , ultimately , facilitate other crimes , such as credit card fraud or black market data sales . However , one common form of attack is designed to do little more than cause large-scale disruption of your business . <p> If you require a dedicated server , it is likely that your website has a growing online reputation . However , a growing reputation makes your server a prime target for denial of service ( DoS ) attacks . <p> A denial of service attack causes server failure and unavailability by overwhelming the system with traffic . One type of DoS attack , the distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) , has multiple malicious computers working together to flood your server with traffic , waste your hardware resources , and damage the experience of legitimate customers . <p> The first line of defense against a DDoS attack is ensuring you choose a dedicated server that is deployed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should also do the following : <p> Monitor your server for the first signs of unexpected traffic increases <p> DoS attacks are one of the most common external threats to your servers stability . But some of the most devastating security breaches are those that begin from within your server . <p> The threat of malware on your dedicated server <p> Since a dedicated server allows customers to install applications with ease , this type of service is prone to malware . <p> Malware describes a wide range of software that is coded to create disruption or steal data from your server . The term is regularly used to refer to spyware , viruses , worms , and trojans . The functionality of these applications varies , but can include recording your every keystroke or copying your most sensitive and confidential databases . <p> Sometimes , malware can be bundled with legitimate applications and scripts . As a result , you should always scan files before you run them on your server . You should also do the following : <p> Look for a hosting provider with ongoing vulnerability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including invisible frames and unusual advertisements <p> Consider testing all software on a secure , isolated home device before uploading to your website <p> Malware is software that is carefully designed and programmed to breach your dedicated server security . Unfortunately , some dedicated server hosting users make the work of criminals easier . <p> Do not forget the risk of a dedicated server hosting password breach <p> Hackers and criminals are becoming more sophisticated , with advanced tools and technology to help them destroy your data , and also your online reputation . However , many attackers can penetrate your dedicated server hosting account with the most effective tool of all : your password . <p> Unfortunately , many dedicated server users do not implement a robust password policy and find that , with or without the help of software , hackers can obtain their passwords and gain access to their data . <p> There are essentially two elements of a good password strategy . First , you should not use words , phrases , or terms that can be found in a dictionary for your password . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far more difficult for a criminal to deduce . Second , avoid keeping the same password for a long period of time . Every two weeks , change your password to an entirely new string . <p> You should also do the following : <p> Implement different passwords for each element of your dedicated server . Choose one password for mail access , one for your control panel , one for your FTP account , and so on . This ensures that a hacker can not gain complete access even in the event of a password breach <p> Where possible , log in through a secure SSL connection <p> Whenever you enter your password , check that the web address and page content is as you would expect , not a phishing website <p> Never access your hosting control panel from a link in an email . Instead , enter the web address manually <p> These are just three common security concerns in a dedicated server hosting plan . As with all online security topics , be sure to take the time to research new and developing risks regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control and security are two major selling points of a dedicated server hosting plan , too much control without experience often leads to gaps in the security of your server .

Actually SSL provides the information that is required to encrypt the contents and it SSL is not available encryption can not be done . For more details please open a ticket and Techs will assist you . Thank you . <p> I am not sure what you 're asking . If you want information exchanged between the browser and the server to be secure , excluding some possible exotic approaches you will need to purchase and install an SSL certificate , and then your pages and forms that you wish to be secure will all need to be run through the secure protocol httpS : <p> This does not by itself make your website itself secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . It simply prevents man-in-the-middle from reading the exchanged data ( including passwords during login ) . <p> So HTTPS has no benefit or additional security without an SSL certificate ? What I am trying to ask is whether the HTTPS protocol in itself , provides encryption ? Will have any additional security by using HTTPS and HTTP even though I am not using and SSL certificate ? <p> So HTTPS has no benefit or additional security without an SSL certificate ? What I am trying to ask is whether the HTTPS protocol in itself , provides encryption ? Will have any additional security by using HTTPS and HTTP even though I am not using and SSL certificate ? <p> The protocol only ensures that your connection to a particular server is " signed . " It requires that the server posses a certificate that identifies explicitly who it is and present it upon initial connection with a client . The protocol does not encrypt , but the certificate itself is encrypted . <p> HTTPS just validates the server-client connection . A self-signed certificate ( the server produces its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a third-party one but produces a warning to most clients . You purchase third-party certificates in order to avoid producing those warnings ( and scaring visitors ) and to provide an extra dose of insurance to potential consumers . No communication , again , is encrypted . <p> Typically , in order to actually encrypt data , your web application must provide the mechanism . <p> Typically , in order to actually encrypt data , your web application must provide the mechanism . <p> I do n't think that 's quite correct . Support for HTTPS with various level of encryption is built into the webservers ( like Apache httpd ) and browsers . It does n't require much - if anything - special from your application itself . <p> The capabilities of server and browser determine what encryption levels can be used . Settings at both ends determine which of the possible options actually is used . I do n't think there 's any browser or server on the market that - without heavily messing with those settings - will setup an https connection without any encryption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communicating over a securely encrypted connection so no eavesdropping is possible along the way . What I just covered : both ends figure out what they can do ( technically ) and are allowed to do ( by their owners ) and usually come to an acceptable encryption level . <p> Knowing who you 're communicating with : not much point to the nice safe tunnel if you 're not sure who 's at the other end . That 's what the certificate is for . <p> Typically , in order to actually encrypt data , your web application must provide the mechanism . <p> I 'm no expert in this area , but these statements do n't agree with what I think I know . <p> My understanding is this : When you communicate over https : , your communications are encrypted . When you see the little locked symbol on your browser , you can rely on the fact that your communications are encrypted. ( frames and accepted warnings notwithstanding ) <p> " Data encryption " is something else , except to the extent you consider communications to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anybody to be able to read the data -including the visitor themself- coming out of a client side application or applet or whatever , then the app/whatever will need to encrypt . <p> Thanks for all the comments . A question about Apache httpd , does that come with a JPC VPS plan ? Also , if my server does have Apache httpd , the server itself can encrypt communications ? How do I capitalize on this without purchasing an SSL certificate ? <p> You can only capitalize on it with an extremly limited set of users , that can judge and accept the self signed certificate . For example : for the admins of your site , whom you could mail " a certifcate was installed today , please accept it " . <p> For the general public , there 's no point in a self-signed certificate . But frankly , if you want to use it to exchange sensitive data with a larger audience , why would the $30 or so for a certifcate be the hurdle ? 31684 @qwx891684

There are millions of online stores scattered around the Web , from giants like Amazon to the smallest virtual boutiques . Nevertheless , with all the competition , there is still room for more players in the ecommerce industry . Its still relatively easy to find an under-served niche or even an entirely untapped market that is yours for the taking . <p> To succeed in the ultra-competitive ecommerce business , you will need more than a bright idea . With online stores , its vital that you do things right from day one . The slightest inconvenience to the smallest kink in the user experience may cause shoppers to leave your web store and never come back . <p> To build an appealing , trust-inspiring website that impresses shoppers and seamlessly guides them toward checkout , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name these elements and explain them in detail , providing you with the entire knowledgebase you need to succeed in setting up your own ecommerce site . You will see why its important to invest in a good ecommerce web server , learn about the various shopping carts available , and get a quick overview of the technical aspects that you will need to know before setting up your first ecommerce web hosting account . <p> Get a good ecommerce website hosting plan <p> In the real world , one of the first steps you would take to set up a new shop would be to find a suitable location : one with great traffic , a nice appearance , and a reasonable lease . In online commerce , the location of your store is the ecommerce hosting account . <p> Make sure that your ecommerce web host has the physical resources needed to run an online store without problems . And the last thing you need when you run a store ( or any website for the matter ) is glitches and downtime . Unpredictable website behavior will drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To prevent downtime and error messages , invest in an ecommerce hosting plan that gives you plenty of processing power , RAM , and disk space . Even if you start small , be sure to take into account the growth that you project over the next year or two . Also , consider that you may experience unforeseen traffic spikes . Accommodate for these situations , too , and not only for regular traffic . <p> Your choice of ecommerce web hosting plan will also influence the other important elements that we cover in this article . For example , most ecommerce website hosting providers only offer a few features such as a merchant account and a shopping cart ( more on this later ) . The bottom line ? Do your due diligence , ask questions , and make sure you get a good package right from the beginning . Its much more difficult to fix things once you have turned down a wrong path . <p> Choose a merchant account services provider <p> A merchant account is a special type of bank account that allows you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant account is what you need to process debit and credit cards on your website . <p> When a shopper makes a transaction , the money does not move instantly from the buyers account to your merchant account . More accurately , several complex verification and processing operations take place in the background , all in a matter of seconds . To enable these operations , you will need to sign up for a payment gateway . Think of the payment gateway as a virtual tunnel that is created between your merchant account and the account of the merchant bank . All communication and data transfer is made through this tunnel , which is encrypted to ensure privacy . Typically , you will purchase the merchant account and the payment gateway services as part of a single package . <p> There are many providers of merchant services , and all of them will process payments for you , in exchange for a fee . When selecting a service , take into account what type of cards are supported for instance , some services only accept MasterCard and Visa cards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operation fees ( including setup fees , minimal fees , operation-specific fees , and transaction fees ) are obviously just as important , especially for a newly established business . <p> Generally speaking , its a good idea to opt for a reputable payments processor , such as Authorize.Net . Working with a well-known provider will give you the peace of mind that you are protected from fraud and erroneous transactions , and that the company will not go out of business in a few months , leaving you high and dry . <p> The shopping cart <p> In ecommerce hosting , the software used to create the actual virtual store is called a shopping cart . The shopping cart handles everything required to process the selling of a product or service , from displaying the catalog of products , to calculating the total amount of a purchase , collecting information about the buyer ( name , credit card number , etc. ) , and finalizing the order . <p> There are many types of shopping carts available , both proprietary and open source . Although proprietary solutions have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can find great solutions for your ecommerce web host , free of cost . Usually , your ecommerce web host will come with a few shopping carts preinstalled . Some of the most commonly offered ecommerce applications are X-Cart , osCommerce , Magento , and Agora . <p> The choice between various shopping carts is complicated and beyond the scope of this article . If you are having trouble deciding , its better to consult a professional or to ask the advice of your ecommerce web hosting service provider . <p> Ensure that you have SSL support <p> When you 're dealing with credit card numbers and other sensitive information , you need to go the extra step for safety . Without adequate security , its only a matter of time before hackers target your ecommerce server , with potentially disastrous consequences . <p> Secure Sockets Layer certificates are used to encrypt the connection between your ecommerce website host and the customers that visit your site . When SSL is used , nobody can eavesdrop on the data that is being exchanged , which ensures the safety of the transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ websites which communicate to the browser that the visited website is authentic and secure . <p> Make sure that you choose an ecommerce web hosting solution that supports dedicated SSL certificates ( which you will have to acquire separately ) , or at the very least , shared SSL certificates ( which are issued to the ecommerce web host provider , who , in turn , makes them available to you ) . <p> Simple , secure , and affordable ecommerce web hosting with JaguarPC <p> JaguarPC provides integrated ecommerce website hosting solutions that provide everything you need to establish your own successful online store .

As a result , it is becoming a more popular career choice for people who see there is potential to provide great services and enjoy lucrative earnings . It does n't  matter whether you 've started your own business or are simply freelancing . If you cant advertise your services , the potentially lucrative earnings are sure to find their way into someone elses pocket . <p> What do you need to do to get it right ? <p> Make Your Own Site Great Ever heard the joke about the web designer who tried to make a living even though his or her own website looked awful ?

In this article we analyze reseller hosting services and focus on what reseller hosting is , how it works , why you should choose reseller hosting , and who reseller hosting is best suited for .

Although some shared web hosting packages allow you to host an unlimited number of domains under a single account , reseller web hosting is different in the way that it gives you the ability to set up separate client accounts for each individual website that you are hosting . With a reseller hosting package , you also get extra tools to help you resell hosting space in a way that is more organized and easier to manage . <p> Managing your reseller web hosting account is a virtually trouble-free experience . As a reseller web host you do not need to have any special technical knowledge on how to manage servers or run DNS servers and mail servers .

Most reseller web hosting packages provide every tool you need to run and manage your reseller hosting account . As a web hosting reseller , you get access to a reseller control panel , Web Host Manager ( WHM ) . WHM enables you to customize your own hosting packages and provide your customers with their own user control panel . <p> Hosting companies offering reseller web hosting services typically give a reseller host full freedom to divide up the hosting plan purchased as they wish . As a reseller web host you can create custom reseller hosting packages , set the desired prices , and run special offers . You also have the ability to choose a particular set of features for each custom web hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each individual hosting account . This way you can directly target clients with specific online demands , as you will be offering exactly what your clients need while they will only be paying for the services they actually use . <p> Why choose a reseller web hosting service ? <p> Reseller hosting services also provide you with resources that are much greater than standard shared web hosting services . In fact , reseller hosting accounts come with plenty of disk space and bandwidth , greater technical control via the WHM control panel , an automated billing system to help you invoice your clients , and other extra features you need to successfully provide reseller web hosting to your clients . Some of those features include : <p> And more to help you with every aspect of your reseller web hosting service . <p> Reseller web hosting also allows you to charge your customers what you want for sign-up , set-up , renewal , add-ons , domain registration , etc .

If you are experienced enough in promoting your reseller hosting services , you can earn substantial sums of money from reselling web hosting to your own customers . <p> Who is reseller web hosting best suited for ? <p> Reseller web hosting is typically used by web designers , developers , web or system-integration companies , entrepreneurs or anyone for that matter , who wants to offer hosting services as a value added service to their customers . If you provide web design or development services , you can easily offer your customers a complete package that includes design and hosting . Your customers will appreciate the lower price points and convenience and you can start building a business that generates recurring monthly income . <p> Reseller hosting services are also suited for customers looking to host websites for others or those who want to host a number of websites for themselves .

So all dns look ups go through google name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for RBLs this is not working well . You can ask support to change them to our internal ns resolvers : <p> nameserver 69.73.181.168 nameserver 69.73.181.166 <p> You could also edit the file yourself via root ssh access , however that edit may not survive reboots on vps as they are set in vps configuration as well ( good for testing ) . <p> Is there a way to have the URIBL test ( and maybe other RBLs ) use the local nameserver so I can leave the google nameserver resolution in place for everything else ? It 's ( almost ) all working so well at the moment , I 'm nervous to make that change . <p> The dns resolvers are not set by cPanel . They are configured when provisioning VPS . <p> I do not think it is possible to have SpamAssassin lookups go through another name server . They will go to whatever is set in operating system ( /etc/resolv.conf ) . <p> If you are really into it , you do have the option to install your own " non-forwarding caching nameserver to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote from SpamAssassin link ) . I wo n't recommend it unless you know what you are doing <p> Thanks for the pointer to the man pages . I see there 's also an option " ROTATE " that causes the load balancing behavior . Awesome . <p> When there was a problem on manticore with DNS lookups timing out , I thought that it took quite a long time , like 15 or 20 seconds for a timeout . Were the timeout and retry parameters set differently on the reseller machines ? <p> I have noticed this too that it took more than 5 seconds when resolver was overloaded/slow , although we did not change the default settings . It is possible older kernel had different timeout . Or both resolvers were slow at that time .

In fact , if you are not online , you can not be found . This is true regardless if you are a freelance professional using the web to market your services , or a small-business owner looking for a new way to reach out to prospective clients . But with ever growing competition , simply having an online presence is not enough anymore . Your website should convey a message of reliability and professionalism to your visitors , and make them want to come back for more . Sure , a good design and clever copy are important for the success of any website , but without a reliable web hosting service to keep it online , the user experience may be compromised . <p> Because the web is flooded with the aggressive marketing efforts of thousands of web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting the right web hosting service for your site may seem daunting . Aspects such as the quality of service and the initial and recurring costs of the hosting plan should be carefully balanced with your particular hosting needs . This article will guide you through the most important aspects of choosing a web hosting plan , from assessing your current web hosting needs to building a solid base for your future growth including how to find reliable web hosting services from a reputable web hosting provider . <p> What type of web hosting plan is the best option for your hosting needs ? <p> For most small and medium businesses , as well as for individuals , shared web hosting plans provide the optimal balance between performance and costs . With shared web hosting , several sites are hosted on the same powerful server . The resources of the server ( powered by Linux or Windows ) are divided among the hosted sites , meaning that each site has a certain amount of resources allocated to it such as disk space , bandwidth , processing power , memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously , without affecting each other in terms of performance . <p> The beauty of shared hosting plans comes from the fact that the costs of running the server are also divided between the sites hosted on the specific server . Thus , the costs for each client are less and allows quality web hosting at affordable prices . <p> Shared web hosting is the ideal solution if you do n't  have extensive performance needs . For example , corporate sites , online portfolios , and blogs typically do not need a large amount of resources at their disposal , so a shared web server is the best hosting solution . <p> With growing needs in terms of traffic ( thousands of visitors a day ) or performance ( web applications , large databases ) having a more expensive virtual private server or even a dedicated server makes more sense . Nevertheless , for most personal sites and many business sites , a quality shared web hosting plan is perfectly capable of handling day to day traffic , at an affordable price , and with minimal hassle . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In order to project reliability and professionalism to your visitors , your website must run properly at all times . There are few things more damaging to your reputation than a website that frequently crashes or displays error messages . <p> One of the most important factors that you should pay attention to is the guaranteed uptime . Uptime is the period when your site is live and available to visitors . The ideal uptime is 100% , which means that during a certain period of time ( a year let 's say ) the site is available 100% of the time no interruptions whatsoever . Many web hosting service providers advertise a 99% or 99.5% uptime , and some even offer a 100% network uptime guarantee . <p> At first glance , the one percent difference may not seem that important , but a 1% downtime over a period of a year translates to more than 3.5 days when your site is not available . Downtime is especially damaging when your website generates an income through online sales or displaying ads . In this case , a day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it will also affect your revenue . <p> To offer a consistent experience to your visitors or users , your web hosting service should provide adequate resources . The web server that hosts your website should have plenty of power processing power , disk space , RAM , etc. , and the network infrastructure that connects it to the Internet should be able to handle the incoming traffic . Cheap web hosting service providers sometimes host as many websites as possible on a single server in order to drive down costs and maximize profits . This can have devastating effects on the functioning of a website as its performance is compromised when hundreds of neighboring sites compete for the same pool of resources . Visitors dislike slow-loading pages , and some will even leave your site for this reason . To avoid this problem , make sure that you pick a reputable web host , with a modern infrastructure and servers that are not crowded . <p> What are the selling points of a good web hosting plan ? <p> In addition to reliability , a quality web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Security is a prime concern for any site , but especially for those dealing with user data or sensitive information , such as e-commerce sites . The average website is exposed daily to dozens of threats , from spamming and phishing attacks to viruses and trojans . Make sure that your web host is prepared to handle attacks and offers adequate protection for your data . <p> If something does go wrong , your site can easily be corrupted and you may be forced to make a full or partial restore of your data . Even if its for a minute , the possibility of a disaster should always be on your mind . Does your web host provide a comprehensive backup service ? How often is your live data backed up ? The best web hosting providers offer continuous or near-continuous data backup . With continuous backup hosting , each modification made to the site or to the database powering the site is saved on a backup server , which means that if you need it , you can restore any previous version . Near-continuous backup works the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes instead of each time its modified . With many hosting plans , the data is only backed up daily if you have to restore your site , the changes made since the last backup are lost . <p> A good web hosting service is flexible and adaptable to your needs regardless if you run a personal blog or a powerful web application . Control panels , file managers , email and FTP accounts , and installation scripts are just a few of the features that help you make the most of your website . Before settling for a web hosting provider , analyze what services are included in the web hosting package . If you want to run a blog for example , your web host should ideally support one-click WordPress installations . Do you have a PHP site ? Make sure that the web hosting service comes with the latest version of PHP .

IMHO , ICQ is still the way to go ... <p> I 've been tempted many times to install Trillian on my PC 's , but since I only care to use ICQ , what 's the point ? You loose most of the features built into ICQ . Trillian is a ' chat ' proggie , pure and simple , and I do n't like to chat . Chat irritates me . Why would I want more ' chat ' ?

I could even chat with 8 million trillion users ( that 's a pun , son ) ... <p> The only thing that ever bugged me about ICQ ( except the ads , which are easy to remove with a simple hack ) is the fact that you could only open one instance at a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I have 15 accounts with me at the moment but this will increase greatly towards the end of the year . I 'm hoping moving to VPS will stop some of the problems I 've been suffering i.e. email problems slow running sites due to another user on the server hogging resources . What I 'd like somebody to explain to me is this : How much ram would I need to make my VPS run without problems 128mb , 256mb ? I vet and manage most of my clients accounts so they do n't have anything other than a web site running . Also jag seem to have a lot of coupons running with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for clients or do they stick to the plans they have set out ? <p> Sorry if this is posted in the wrong place or if I 've asked something I should n't , I know it happens on other forums ! <p> If you want to run WHM/cPanel on the VPS then you 'll need a minimum of 256Mb of RAM . The other big factor that will determine how much RAM you need is what you are doing with the VPS . If you have mostly just static HTML sites that get a moderate flow of traffic then you probably wo n't need more then the 256Mb , if any of your sites are highly active or they run any resource-heavy software then you might need some extra RAM . <p> Coupon offers only apply to the type of plan for which they are advertised , but talk to sales before you order if you have a special feature now that you 'd loose if you switched to VPS--they might work with you .

When it comes to web hosting , most people are faced with two main options Windows hosting services and Linux hosting services . <p> The differences between Linux and Windows hosting are substantial , and choosing the right hosting solution is made more difficult by the fact that both operating systems have specific software ecosystems , comprised of applications , database servers , and web services that are designed to work optimally on either Windows Server or Linux . <p> Every Windows hosting plan is powered by a version of the powerful Windows Server operating system .

What started as a platform for bloggers it still is , of course quickly became one of the most popular interfaces for managing a website , to the point where it is estimated 10-12% of all websites are powered by WordPress today . One characteristic that has driven the popularity of WordPress has been the ease of use and installation that it shares with cPanel . Webmasters and site owners are increasingly using both in conjunction with each other . The great thing for these groups is that they lose nothing in the way of ease of use or convenience when doing so ; installing WordPress into a cPanel is easy . While cPanel is able to take care of the installation for you , you can always do it yourself in a very short space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you need to do to ensure that your cPanel is ready to install your WordPress application ? The first step is to ensure that your hosting company and your server plan actually supports WordPress . If you knew that you were going to use WordPress , then chances are you would have made sure of this before signing a hosting deal . Most hosting companies do support WordPress in the modern day , but it is always worth checking whether there are any parameters that you need to consider . Prepare everything you need ahead of time . Download the WordPress package , unzip the folder and save it to your computer . You may be able to download WordPress directly to your web server using wgnt , although if you are a inexperienced at carrying out such operations then you might be better going the hard drive route . Should you download WordPress to your computer , it will extract to another file titled wordpress , from which you will find everything you need to move forward.Database Creation The next step is to create your database and user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MySQL Database Wizard through cPanel , and name your database . Next , you need to set up your username and password . A useful meter at the bottom tells you how strong your password is . If you use the same password for all of your accounts , or can not come up with something that passes the test , allow the in-built password generator to do it for you . Now you will add the user ( you ) to the database . As you are the site owner , simply give yourself all privileges , although it might be worth making a note of the others should you plan to allow others access to your site in future . You will be notified that you have successfully added the database , and have an option available to complete task.Editing the Config File Using your text editor , open the wp-config-sample.php file . You will need to enter four pieces of information.DBNAME Enter the database name you created earlier.DBUSER Enter the username you assigned yourself.DBPASSWORD Enter your password.DBHOST You would have seen a hostname when you were setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are also lines for DBCHARSET and DBCOLLATE . However , you can leave the first as it is , and the second blank . Go into the section titled Authentication Unique Keys , and set your secret key data . At this stage , do not worry about remembering what you enter , it just needs to be a long , complicated password that would take a long time for anyone wanting to hack into your site to discover . Something such as this , for example , would be ideal : **35;256;TOOLONG Save the config file and you are ready to move on.Uploading Your Files How you do this will depend on where your WordPress site is going to feature within your overall website . For example , your whole site may be WordPress powered , or you might just be using it for your business blog . You will upload WordPress to the root directory of your site , or to a subdirectory , which you can name blog or whatever your WordPress content is going to represent.Uploading to the Root Directory This process will differ slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both for the root directory and a subdirectory . In this case : Files downloaded to your computer should be uploaded via an FTP client ; upload the contents of the wordpress directory , not the whole file . If your files were downloaded to your webserver , you can simple move them from wordpress to your root directory . Again , move the contents only , not the whole file or directory itself.Uploading to a Sub-Directory If your files are on your computer , change the name of the wordpress directory to blog or whatever your chosen name is , and upload the whole directory , not just the files , to the relevant subdirectory , which you can find within the root directory . For files already on your server , move the directory first , and rename it when you are done . Completing the Installation Completing the installation is easy . Point your browser to one of the following : If you placed WordPress in the root directory , go to http : **35;293;TOOLONG For a sub-directory , in our example called blog , go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install and take you through the process . If there any problems with configuration , you will be asked to amend the config file that we walked through earlier . There may be an option through cPanel , depending on your service and applications that allows 1-click installation . However , if you are looking to increase your knowledge of script and the more technical side of things , it is often a good idea to follow this process instead .

Instead , you can configure your server to function exactly as your business requires . <p> However , most of this configuration and control will take place remotely , using a hosting control panel that you access through your browser . There are a number of options available , but the industrys leading control panel solution is cPanel. cPanel and WHM is a system that makes it possible to configure sub-accounts on a reseller hosting plan , or work with the settings on your overall server . <p> Let 's look at just three of the reasons cPanel continues to be the leading choice of dedicated server control panel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ databases easy <p> To engage with your potential and existing customers on a long-term basis , offering rich and exciting content is essential .

Sun built a huge corporation selling machines that would n't run windows , and IE only runs on windows . Are you one of those that thinks the OS is part of the machine ? I have 5 machines running here right now and only one has windows . The only drawback I find to Linux is that it 's TOO configurable for the novice . You seem to be very knowledgable and could greatly benefit from trying out a more stable and configurable system . You really owe it to yourself to download a copy of mandrake and toss it on an old machine and play with it . In fact , there are some distrubutions that you can burn to a bottable CD and try out , fully functional , without even installing . Obviously , you lose your configuration once you reboot , but most have a feature that will allow you to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I burned to a business card CD . When I find a windows machine I need access to and someone put a password on it , I just boot from the CD , mount the hard drive , then do what I need to in the machine . Really f**ks with peoples heads . <p> Originally posted by Vin DSL Shelling into my account with SCP and Blowfish is the name of the game these days , not FTP . <p> Man , Vin - this is about the only accurate statement in your whole post ... <p> Good you mentioned this - anyone using FTP for site maintenance is playing with fire - regardless of the FTP tool . It 's trivial to sniff your FTP login anywhere along the path between your PC and Jag . And since site maintenance requires a privileged user I 'd , most folks using FTP for this task use their main account I 'd and PW , which when sniffed , gives up their entire site . <p> Just do n't do it - there 's never a need . <p> In under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a secure Windows GUI app installed for file transfer to your site . <p> - Go to Google <p> - Enter " WinSCP " <p> - Click " I 'm feeling lucky " <p> Download and install . Note - you must have shell access for this to work . If you do n't currently have it , this is reason enough to request it , even if you never open up shell prompt . <p> RE POSIX . Get with the times , man . The tools running your own web site use it heavily . <p> RE CPanel security - it 's completely secure , if you use it correctly . I 'll grant you that most folks probably do n't use it in a secure manner , but that does n't mean it ca n't easily be done . <p> Do n't do it - same problem as with FTP . You are using an unencrypted http session and your ID/Password can easily be sniffed when you log in . Fortunately , there is a very easy and secure alternative - use the SSL certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SFTP ? Most decent FTP apps support it and it 's just as secure as SCP , but you get the full power of your FTP app . <p> I was referring strictly to FTP , as this is what Vin 's IE tutorial was using - not SFTP . <p> If you want to give a tutorial on SFTP , great - and I agree , it 's secure , even if it 's not as widely available as SCP . However , when folks set up a site in WSFTP Pro ( or other FTP packages ) , they must configure the site to use SFTP - by default , most packages use FTP . <p> Add to that , I 've had problems with SFTP against Jag 's servers - it could very well be user error , I do n't profess to be an SFTP expert . I just tried it again ( using WSFTP Pro ) , and the following is displayed in the message pane when the connect fails : <p> Perhaps an SSHv1/SSHv2 incompatibiity ? I tried several different WSFTP Pro SFTP configurations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of why the above is happening , my point is WinSCP is easier to set up ( especially for novices ) , works in more places ( I 've never had a problem with it anywhere I 've had an SSH login ) , has no possibility of being configured insecurely , and is sufficient for most folks ' file transfer needs . <p> Originally posted by wgiese Do n't do it - same problem as with FTP .

@@99682530 @3882530/ <h> When Do You Need a Dedicated Server ? <p> Getting a business of the ground can often feel like a balancing act . You do n't  want to handicap yourself by not investing enough into the business to ensure it runs successfully . Conversely , you can easily find yourself in a situation where you have too much overhead in relation to the value you 're actually getting from sinking so much money into your venture . This can happen at every level of your operation . Whether its having too many employees vs. too little or renting out huge office space , its important to be critical of what you 're paying for . This extends to your website , as well . <p> There are many options when it comes to hosting solutions and they 're all priced differently . They range all the way from a couple of dollars a month for shared hosting all the way up to having dedicated servers for maximum performance . Everyone wants the latest , greatest , best , and fastest . Its why people upgrade their smartphones every year . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest performance speeds come at a cost . If you 're running a static , informational site , a dedicated server is probably overkill when it comes to your needs . Do you have a big e-commerce store , though ? Then going dedicated might make more sense for you . <p> Let 's explore who would benefit the most from opting for a dedicated server . <h> What is a Dedicated Server ? <p> First things first , a quick explanation of what a dedicated server actually is . When you sign up for shared hosting , you 're on a physical server with many other different websites and you 're using the same resource pool . One machine , many sites . A VPS is the web hosting solution that most developers and business owners will probably want to opt for because it is a safe middle option . You are still on one physical machine with many sites , but each site gets its own resources so there is absolute minimal impact on your performance due to your neighbors . <p> Then there is a dedicated server which is an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imagine , the performance is unrivaled because the entirety of the servers resources are going towards powering only your site . Sounds great , right ? But who needs all that ? <h> Its All About Traffic <p> The shorthand answer is : anyone expecting high volumes of traffic consistently ( six figures to millions of visitors ) should opt for a dedicated server . High volumes of traffic on a site without the proper infrastructure to handle it can definitely cause slow downs . This can be very damaging to your business . Its been shown time and again that there is a direct correlation between page speed and conversions . Consider that even a company as big as Walmart has learned this . They found that when load times jumped from 1 second to 4 seconds , conversions dropped sharply . And when load times went up ? Each second increased the conversion rate . If you 're running an e-commerce site with a large customer base , you cant afford to have that traffic bottleneck . A dedicated server would probably benefit you here . <p> E-commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business owners curious about going dedicated . Some more specialized types of sites that would benefit from a dedicated server include social networks and high trafficked content delivery sites ( think Buzzfeed and the like ) . So , if you 're looking to create a social empire , you may want your own server . <h> Security <p> Let 's start with the caveat that security should n't be the only reason you opt for a dedicated server . That would be an expensive investment . But , as a bonus , having your own server does lend itself to being a bit more secure . This security comes from the relative isolation . On a shared hosting plan , yes , it is possible for a vulnerability in one site to allow malicious actions to occur in other sites sharing the server space . <h> You Have an Exceptionally " Heavy " Site <p> If you have a feature rich site that has specialized functionality ( you are constantly pulling in raw financial data and presenting it live , for example ) or if your site has some serious server-side programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated server to ensure visitors have a smooth experience on your site and do n't  see stuttering when trying to load pages . <h> Conclusion <p> Make no mistake ; dedicated servers put a lot of power into your hands . Your site will experience industry leading performance and you can be rest assured that visitors wont suffer from slow loading times or , worse , downtime . However , depending on the kind of site you have , you may see the same kind of performance with a VPS .

Whether users wish to revamp their websites layouts , or update their blogs , Drupal provides a number of helpful services . If you 're searching for web hosting to accommodate Drupal , as well as other features , there are a few aspects to consider before making a selection . Determining server compatibility , the features included in your service package , and the technical support available to you , are all essential steps to be taken . <p> Choosing a Platform When choosing a Drupal hosting service , compatibly is the first and foremost point to take into account . Its important to ensure that your provider supports PHP and MySQL , as both are needed to run Drupal without complications . When faced with the choice between Windows or Linux hosting , Linux is typically recommended for Drupal because it runs PHP applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or problematic , depending on your expertise with control panels , FTP , and MySQL . If you 're not comfortable installing Drupal yourself , some providers offer 1-click installations . <p> Selecting the Best Features Features are a crucial part of choosing the right service provider , especially when you 're planning on running Drupal . Hosting packages that include database features are necessary , because Drupal is heavily supported by databases . Additionally , its important to make sure your hosting package includes adequate disk space and bandwidth to accommodate Drupal as well as other applications and add-ons . The inclusion of a control panel , such as cPanel , is also necessary to manage your account , domains , websites , and other important hosting features . <p> Aim for Excellent IT Support Its always a good idea to choose a company that offers good customer service and IT support for any issues you may encounter with Drupal . If you 're not experienced with Drupal , or other aspects of web hosting , finding a helpful , knowledgeable company is all the more important . While you can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it helps to have another line of defense if those methods do n't  solve your problem . Any company that offers IT support all day , every day is recommended , especially if their team works through various methods , such as email , phone , live chat , or ticket system .

By drawing large volumes of traffic to your website and converting this traffic effectively , your work will pay off in the form of new customers . <p> In this article from professional shared web hosting provider JaguarPC , you will learn the first steps of creating an attractive shared hosting-powered website .

Read on to start building your shared hosting site traffic today . <p> A note about using search engine optimization to grow your shared hosting site <p> Online , there is a tendency to lean on search engine optimization , or SEO , as the single most important tool for bringing visitors to your website . <p> In essence , SEO involves tailoring your website to fit the search queries people enter into Google , Yahoo , Bing , and other search engines . In turn , this means making sure the search engine crawlers that analyze web pages can understand your site . If a crawler thinks you offer an excellent resource for a certain subject or keyword , you will rank highly for that phrase and attract more search engine traffic . <p> But whatever you do , numerous competing companies are all trying to grab the same few spots on Google as well . SEO is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search engine optimization ? The answer is that there is no trick you simply need to be the best resource available for your potential customers . By concentrating on the areas below , you will create a website people will want to visit . Quite simply , this means that search engines will take notice . <p> Fill your shared web hosting site with the best possible content <p> Content is the single most important element of any website . A great design is good , but only if it facilitates access to quality information . The best thing about good content is that it creates a win-win situation for your website people love it , and as a result , search engines love it too . <p> Before you begin building out your website , think about the content you will offer customers . This is your main online stock , and with a good strategy , you can continually offer new and fresh content that attracts visitors to your shared hosting site . <p> Most successful websites will launch and regularly update content across the following areas : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and what you offer . This is your chance to tell visitors who you are . <p> Blog Posts and Articles A great opportunity to update your site regularly with opinions , thoughts , or news about promotions . <p> Product Pages Whether drawn from an ecommerce platform or created as a list of services , this is where visitors learn your product specifications and prices . <p> To bring new visitors to your shared hosting website , having regularly updated content , like a blog , is vital . Great blog posts are routinely tweeted , liked on Facebook , and linked to from other websites . The more links to your content , the more visitors will follow them . <p> To start building your content , use a content management system ( CMS ) such as WordPress , Joomla or Drupal . Most shared hosting plans offer PHP and MySQL , two essential components of running these CMS products . You can even use automated script installers such as Softaculous to deploy the CMS installation in just a few clicks , allowing you to devote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right content , attracting visitors to your website is achievable . When these visitors arrive , though , you need to convert them into paying customers or leads that actively engage with your business and make contact either via email , telephone , web form , or chat . <p> Converting visitors into customers is not always easy . In fact , research shows that the average conversion rate for a website is around 2% . For example , if you were to attract 10,000 visitors with your content , only 200 of those visitors would convert . <p> There are many things you can do to improve conversion rates , but one proven technique is to increase the amount of time visitors spend on your website . This means both attracting them , and enticing them to come back regularly . <p> A shared web hosting plan that supports dynamic applications and has an automated script installer offers a wealth of ways to do this . From message boards and forums to complete social network functionality , shared hosting can support highly interactive and social platforms that give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means you will have many additional opportunities to convert visitors if your first attempt fails , ultimately ensuring that you do not just win visitors you win business . <p> Shared web hosting to support your growth from JaguarPC <p> Before you haphazardly put together a website on your shared hosting plan , consider what you will be doing to attract visitors with great content and convert them effectively into sources of revenue . With this plan in mind , make sure your shared hosting provider can support your strategy . <p> JaguarPC is an experienced shared web hosting company offering reliable hosting services optimized for dynamic applications .

So I have been all over WebhostingTalk.com and I think JaguarPC is where I should host my sites . <p> I have been trying to figure out what to do . 1 ) Get a reseller account somewhere else or 3 ) Get a VPS and have a bit more control . <p> I like the VPS option , but I am no Linux admin , and I would be afraid I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plus I am used of working in a Windows environment . My only stipulations are custom nameservers , phpadmin , and AWStats . Obviously I need excellent uptime and I want excellent speed loading the pages . <p> Would VPS be overkill for me right now ? Would a reseller plan be better for me . I just read on the forums that the PHP is running out of CGI now instead of Apache , will that affect the loadtime of my blogs ? <p> I am just trying to get a feel for what option I should go for . I just want reliable hosting where my blogs load fast . I am real interested in learning about running servers and maybe VPS is a good place to start with that . 31684 @qwx891684 <p> I just read on the forums that the PHP is running out of CGI now instead of Apache , will that affect the loadtime ... <p> Um ... <p> I hate the idea of running PHP as a CGI , but I guess I 'm between the hammer and the anvil . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> Some of the ppl here say PHP running as a CGI runs better than phpmod , but I find that hard to believe . How could it ? Then , again , maybe they have n't got much of a web site to start out with , and it 's wishful thinking ... you know ? 31684 @qwx891684 <p> Vin always complains about the PHP running as CGI , and maybe he got his reasons for that ( check the board for his fears of PHP as CGI ) , i do have my ( customer ) websites all running this way on multiple servers and never found this an issue at all . <p> You get phpMyAdmin and AW-Stats pre-installed on shared / reseller accounts as well . <p> I would n't worry about the speed of PHP-CGI . Most of the arguments in that debate are quite outdated . Sure there is some difference , but I would be surprised if it was more than 10% nowadays . <p> Also , I consider that entirely JagPC 's problem : we pay them for a certain level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a module needs more support hours to worry about and fix safety stuff and PHP as CGI needs more hardware . Now , what do you think is the most cost effective of the two , eh ? <p> As for VPS : it 's offered fully managed , which means that they can do a ' standard install ' for you and keep that up to date . You may have to request those updates though ; I 'm not sure they keep track of who appreciates them . <p> Perhaps someone from support popping in could enlighten us there ? This seems to be a recurring question : can a VPS client running a pretty standard setup sign up for updates of certain / all applications , or does he have to put in seperate request tickets each time ? <p> Speed and reliability are essential for me . My most trafficed blog - thetvremote.com - it seems to be running ok now . It could be a little more responsive . Lately its been pretty sluggish . And I think its been either really sluggish or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in Feedburner . So speed and reliability are my number one concern . <p> So far i do not have any problems with speed or reliability , if you really want to be sure about enough resources on the server , but are not quite ready for VPS ( no matter what everybody says , but some understanding of a OS is essential ) . you might want to consider the semi-dedicated service JPC does offer . But for these standard wordpress blogs you might want to just take a shared-server account . <p> What is the reason you dislike cpanel ? my customers never complain they even love the fantastico installer to put their blogs online with a single click . <p> Cpanel is just . . . difficult . Now I do n't  mean hard to use , I just mean the user experience is not as smooth as say HELM . But if I end up with cpanel , I end up with Cpanel , that 's life . <p> With the shared would i have to use add-on domains ? I like having my own account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . <p> I want to put my blogs in a place where they can grow without having to move to a different provider each step of the way . They may be small now , with The TV Remote getting most of the traffic - averaging just over 100 uniques a day . But I will be adding more blogs and hopefully growing my current ones in to high traffic blogs . My little network is n't Weblogs Inc or B5 Media , but I hope one day they could come close to being that successful . <p> With multi hosted domains you can have separate e-mail accounts for each domain . You wo n't have a catchall for each domain , but I do n't use a cachall all anyway . You also have awstats and I think raw log files for each domain . <p> I think 5 multihosted domains can be added for free and then there is a small onetime fee for each additional domain . <p> You can always upgrade to a different plan without changing host , if sites need to be moved because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ( do n't quote me on this ) . <p> Helm is a Windows only CP , AFAICT . If you wanted a Helm-based site you 'd need to set up a dedicated server running Windows . <p> If you go with a bulk reseller account , I believe that JPC will let you build your own CP theme to use on the accounts you create , so you could set it up however you want . If you are just hosting your own sites , though , it probably is n't worth the trouble . <p> Since you already mention that you do n't know much about admining Linux , and since you do n't really have a site that warrants the need , I would n't recommend a VPS just for the ability to pick your CP . <p> As Connie said , you can multi-host several domains on one shared ( or semi-dedicated ) account , which is very cost effective for smaller sites . It would n't be difficult to move WordPress sites into new accounts if they outgrew the confines of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , is that any site could outgrow its resources at any time . Even with a bulk reseller account--where you have several individual accounts that share a set of resources--you still have finite limits and you may eventually have to upgrade . <p> Yes I am very aware HELM is a Windows CP , I have a few HELM reseller plans setup for other hosting needs . Linux CPs - and webmail for that matter - are totally inferior to the Windows ones . That was my point . Cpanel is so clunky and not user friendly . <p> I would probably go for a reseller plan of some sort . Keeping all my domains/blogs under one cpanel account was inefficient and a big headache when i tried doing it under my current cpanel hosting . <p> As far as the VPS , it would be worth it for the control . Plus I would rather get the hang of it now rather than when my blogs are pulling in huge numbers of visitors a month .

I created a subdomain ... 31684 @qwx891684 <p> Replace index.html with your desired page . Note that this may work only for emptry requests ... and that I have n't tested this , but I hope it points you in the right direction . <p> As . htaccess directives can be inherited by subdirectories , please note that it is likely you will have to add an . htaccess file in each subdirectory with the " RewriteEngine On " directive ( followed by nothing ) , ESPECIALLY the /home subdirectory . <p> I do n't think a 301 redirect is what your looking for because the user would see the redirected name in the address bar . If I understand you correctly you want the address in the address bar to stay the same as what was typed in so the user never knows that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for would be more along the lines of domain masking or domain forwarding . I do n't think either will return a 301 header response , and that can cause you problems with the SEs . Here 's a Google Search that you might find helpful . <p> First I wonder why you want to do something like that ? Especially since you do not want the user to know they have been redirected . <p> Some extra flexibility ? I know it 's sometimes done to swap around between site versions . You could for example have a folder /newcode and switch over to it very fast and seemlessly ( and back if you 've missed a glitch or two ) without having to move files around . <p> that can cause you problems with the SEs . <p> No , it need n't . If you do an internal redirect your pages will still be available at the exact same URLs and also still only at those URLs ( if you do it right ) . The search engine can not tell and does n't care . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long run i have i used redirects in the past for different version of a website but the user has always know they have been redirected. eg www.domain.com/v1 <p> If you have more than one damain you can mess around with addon domains and redirect in cpanel . <p> As a last resort you could always try framed forwarding personal favourite of 123-reg . <p> One of my sites internally redirects nearly every single visitor ; their request is for a URL which only exists as a result of a script generating it , and the page they get is a result of dynamic generation as well , so I do n't see the problem in internally redirecting folks in a well thought out scheme . <p> Before Connie jumps all over me , it has nothing to do with cloaking or providing different content to different visitors ; it 's all about being a dynamic site , just like this forum . The page URL and info is static to the extent it is not added to . In fact I 've created a backup system that generates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPU usage and provide availability if/when MySQL is down . <p> Well I could think of some other reasons for doing this , organization for one . You could organize folders for what they are instead of having to give the relevant names . <p> You do n't have to be messing around with robots.txt for lot of uneeeded files and folders . For example the " stock " way of rewriting URL 's for wikipedia is doing exactly as described above . You 're only rewriting articles and some other pages with content . You only need to deny the real folder with robots.txt for the others like the edit pages you do n't want a bot to get into . On line in robots.txt kills them all . <p> I could think of one other reason too , you could use it as a minor security measure . If for example you have something like phpbb and install it in folder **33;965;TOOLONG ... then only rewrite the URL 's for public pages the true location of the admin folder any other files that might have security issues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one security hole I know of from a mod I installed . <p> Before Connie jumps all over me , it has nothing to do with cloaking or providing different content to different visitors ; it 's all about being a dynamic site , just like this forum .

Much better to be a touch late to the party and start with all cylinders firing than have people form an opinion of a half-baked page , meaning they wont return later even though you 've sorted it out . <p> Ensure that business logos , colors , and anything else are all the same as you have on your regular business website . <p> Finding an Audience Facebook themselves tell you that step one is to invite all of your friends to your page . Good advice , but not ideal if none of your Facebook connections have any interest in what it is you do , or if you 've just joined Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some alternative options that will bring better results : Ensure a link to your Facebook page , and/or a like box , is added to your website homepage ; make this a feature on every page if possible , particularly for liking content . Use a social plugin from Facebook that will help you reach out to people with interests in what you do without you needing to be friends with them ; this is a great alternative to paid advertising . If you already have a healthy blog following , or an email-marketing list , for example , dedicate a full post/message to your new Facebook page , talk about your excitement around it , and encourage everyone to join . <p> Audience Engagement Do n't  connect your business Facebook page with other social networks and allow posts from these to appear in your Facebook feed . Doing this with Twitter , for example , will leave your Facebook page filled with short bites of information that might not be relevant to your audience on that site . <p> Luckily , the trick to getting Facebook right is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a regular basis so those who visit your page know when therell be updates and something to read , and always respond to queries and feedback , negative or positive . <p> Never Rely Only on Facebook All of the guidance here will help you to make a success of your Facebook page . However , do n't  rely only on Facebook , both from a website and a social media standpoint . Many businesses actually use social media without having a website , which is never a good idea . As well as Facebook , take the time to identify the other social platforms , including niche sites , where you might be able to build a following .

The term " Malware " includes many different types of malicious software such as computer viruses , ransomware , worms , trojan horses , rootkits , keyloggers , dialers , spyware and adware .

@@99682551 @3882551/ <h> How Reselling Hosting Can Help Your Web Design Business <p> Often the first roadblock an independent contractor or new business owner will hit is the inevitable limitation of there being only so much time in the day . After all , its pretty necessary to actually relax and sleep once in awhile . But , other than increasing your rates or hiring outside help ( which can cut into your bottom line if you 're not that truly busy yet ) , you can easily reach a plateau . How does a freelance web designer get over this hump of purely trading time spent doing creative work for money ? The answer is the mostly passive income generated through cPanel reseller hosting . <p> Passive income is always the goal . Its a recurring source of income that does n't  require you to put in physical work ( for the most part ) and it helps keep the lights on while you 're spending time doing your actual web design and development work . If up until now you 've made a living doing one off projects and then having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services to your offerings . They are a great way to keep income consistently coming in . With cPanel , fixes can be easily made by either you or the client ( depending on comfort level ) . This minimizes headaches and keeps your hosting service as a relatively hassle free source of monthly income . here 's how investing in some VPS space can positively impact the growth of your business . <h> Recurring , Reliable Source of Income <p> There are other ways to generate passive income as a web designer , but they often require at least some investment of time and energy . Maintaining a WordPress theme , for example , can open you up to having to do regular bug fixes and other customer service activities . When you resell hosting services , you 're adding a billable item that requires little to no work on your part . You may have to occasionally act as a middle man between your customer and your hosting companys support team , but otherwise its money you 're receiving every month just to have your clients site remain online . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service disruptions will trigger an email being sent to you , not the hosting company . But that 's fine because you 'll either have the know how to fix whatever issues come up , or you can just as simply contact customer support on behalf of the customer . Other than the unavoidable wait time when there is a " middle man , " this troubleshooting process should go smoothly . <h> Makes Your Business More Attractive <p> With so many web designers out there , there is a lot of learning to do in order to be competitive . Clients are always looking for the total package . Each additional vendor they need to keep track of only adds uncertainty . Its like another moving piece that could break and put the entire operation in flux . If you create websites for people , it only makes sense to try and position yourself as " the web person . " That includes getting the hosting set up and maintaining it . Creating a site , handing the assets over to the client , and saying " Okay , good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only a bad experience , itll cost you easily obtainable income . See the project through from beginning to end and see if your referrals increase . <h> A Wise Investment <p> You know the old adage " It takes money to make money . " Its true . You do need to be willing to take on some overhead costs in order to be successful . Luckily , there are plenty of financial incentives in place for cPanel reseller hosting . Depending on the needs of your clients , you could get a machine for under twenty dollars a month that 's suitable for up to twnety-five clients . Assuming you charge each client let 's say fifteen dollars a month for hosting , two clients have already more than covered the cost of the server . If you use all twenty-five free client spots on that twenty dollar a month investment , you start to see how much real income potential there is in reselling hosting services . <h> Good Practice <p> A good businessperson is always learning . Even if you 're the best coder in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you stronger and more effective . Managing hosting will add yet another skill under your belt . Sometimes even something as simple as being forced to set up a recurring monthly invoice is a great lesson in getting your operation to the next level . <h> Conclusion <p> What are you waiting for ?

In this type of hosting arrangement , a server is owned by the dedicated hosting provider , leased for the use of a single customer , and is managed and administered by the hosting providers technical staff . Managed dedicated servers are housed in a secure data center on the managed dedicated hosts premises and customers usually do not have physical access to them . The lack of control over your managed dedicated server is compensated by 24/7 technical support that includes proactive monitoring and maintenance . <p> With managed dedicated hosting solutions , the responsibility for system administration and application support is placed entirely on the managed hosting provider .

Instead , customers can take advantage of dedicated managed server hosting solutions and save drastically on monthly expenses . Outsourcing server administration to a professional managed host is actually very cost-effective as there is a fixed monthly rate you pay that usually does not add up to the monthly salary of the IT staff you would otherwise need to hire . <p> Most web hosting providers offer a wide range of managed dedicated hosting solutions to suit many budgets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the framework in place to deal with seasonal fluctuations , major spikes in web traffic , and situations when an additional server is instantly needed to handle an unanticipated load spike .

Outsourcing server management to a professional managed host will take care of all server-related issues since they are well versed with server management and can quickly attend to any problems . <p> Managed dedicated hosting is one of the most powerful hosting solutions available .

@@99682557 @3882557/ <p> Dedicated hosting is the ultimate hosting solution , deployed by thousands of organizations and companies that require stability , non-stop availability , and the best performances . One aspect that greatly influences the performance delivered by a dedicated server is the operating system installed on the machine . There are several operating systems to consider , but the Linux family of operating systems is widely recognized as an excellent option . Linux is installed on the majority of web servers , including most of the worlds busiest Internet servers . <p> Once you have decided on a Linux dedicated web server , the next decision you need to make is the selection of the Linux distribution . You can choose from dozens of flavors of Linux , from commercially backed distributions such as Fedora or CentOS , to popular community oriented ones such as Debian . <p> To help readers make the right choice , JaguarPC recently published an article called Which Linux Distribution Should You Install on your Linux Dedicated Server .

Most of the time , a human user logging onto your website would n't see a HTTP status code so long as everything is okay , although there are some common codes that many internet users will likely be familiar with . Well mention these as we go through this post , but for a good understanding it is better to go through what each type of status code is , and when it will typically be utilized . <p> Provisional Responses : 100s There are only two provisional responses , both of which require the user or the search spider to take action to continue . The two responses are 100 , which is continue , and 101 , which informs the user of a switch in protocols . <p> Successful : 200s When a server sends this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful . The most common success status code is 200 , which means you 've got the page and information you requested 100% successfully , although there are other status codes that mean a request has been successful but not fully met . For example , a request might be successful but not return any content , or the request might be successful after information has been sourced from another location . <p> Redirected : 300s A 3xx code means that the server needs to take further action to fulfill the request . Most 3xx codes involving redirection to another page or website . Using redirects and 3xx requests correctly is important if you are redesigning your website and have new URL structures and sections . If you do n't  use them , users would find blank pages and receive the types of error were going to look at next . <p> Request Error : 400s This is the type of error that a human internet user will most commonly see . The two errors likely to be encountered are the 403 error , which means you are not authorized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the server couldnt find the page . 404 errors can occur for a number of reasons , typically because a 301 redirect request has n't  been used or because of a typography error in the request . Some websites will identify their most commonly landed on 404 pages and set up 301 redirects as a result . <p> Server Errors : 500s Server errors are exactly what they say they are , meaning there was no problem with the request itself . Server errors can happen for a number of reasons , and from a hosting providers perspective they are something you should be looking to eradicate as much as possible , or else you could quickly find yourself losing traffic and customers .

I 'm not having any luck trying anything . <p> If account is hosted with some other hosting provider and you want to handle emails on your server then yes it is possible . First of all create an account in your server using same domain name . Then you need to setup MX record pointing to your server 's IP address so that emails can be handled by your server . If you need more details and assistance please open a ticket with technical support department and Techs will assist you . Thank you . <p> Actually what happened was he decided to get another account after having an account setup on my VPS . In order for the domain name to work with " weebly " I needed to go into WHM and change his A records to point to " xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx " . As for the domain name , it 's through godaddy and the nameservers are set to my VPS . So basically his domain name on godaddy points to my nameservers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IP . So this is still possible ? Just making sure before I open ticket . <p> Ok , I 'll open a ticket . I would really like to know if this is something that could be done through WHM by myself or is there something special you guys have to do on my server . Just in case this ever happened again I 'd like to know if it 's an easy thing I can do or something more complicated I can do through WHM or command line . I 'm very familiar with linux but just do n't know alot about DNS stuff . I will open ticket but would also like to know how it 's done incase I run into this situation again . <p> I think you 'd be looking for the " Edit DNS Zone " screen . Lookit how " normal " accounts are set up and make note of how his account is setup , then note the differences after support has completed your ticket ! <p> If you had the account set up on your server first and then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point at a different IP for the website , I would think there is nothing to do to have mail go to your server . If an MX record is present on the domain , that 's what gets used to route mail , so if you did n't change it mail should still go to your server . <p> What you may want to do is set up a DNS record for something like mail.domain.com to that your fiend has an easy to remember address for checking his mail .

I ca n't remember having ever received such a notice before and I do run Wordpress sites , so I thought I 'd better have a look at them / read up right away . One site had already auto-upgraded . <p> My other WordPress site could n't upgrade ! It was dificult to even find out the version number and that version number was the vulnerable one . After a bit of panick ( was I already hacked ? ) I found the culprit : I installed it this summer using cPanel -&gt; Software / Services -&gt; Site Software , which turns out to be a program called cPAddons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that cPAddons takes it upon it to manage the software update process , badly ! In order to do that , it uses specially modified versions of the software it installs and disables the built in update mechanism - which for WordPress is very good . In other words : while the vulnerability was actively exploited , at JagPC servers , I was supposed to wait for cPanel folks to repack the fix and roll it out .. auch ! ( And additionally I was to manage that one WordPress install in two ways , one for the core , taken hostage by cPanel , and the normal way for WordPress templates and addons . ) <p> I did n't want to wait , nor keep that delay in place . Here 's how I succeeded in decoupling WordPress from cPAddons . <p> 1 . Undo the changes made by cPAddons to WordPress This shows the version number again and re-renables the updates . Search your Wordpress installation files for " cPanel " and for " cPAddons " . You 'll find the WordPress code short-cut in three places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Remove those short-cuts and you 've got a fully functioning WordPress again . <p> 2 . Decouple from cPAddons Doing just step one leaves you with a problem : cPAddons might overwrite your install at any time , probably because it thinks you need an upgrade ( which in reality might even be a downgrade at that point ) . This is not something you can remember not to do and then simply avoid ; JagPC might also trigger it server wide , in an attempt to get rid of outdated vulnerable software . Fortunately it is not hard to decouple : go to your **32;1062;TOOLONG folder and delete the . yaml file for your WordPress install . <p> Done . You now have a normal ( auto- ) updating WordPress unlinked from cPanel . <p> Hope this info is of use to someone wrestling with the same problem and a bit of a warning to folks thinking that one click installer under " Site Software " is bliss only .

Across sales , support , and communication , the Internet has changed the way the world does business . Unfortunately , the Internet is also a place full of empty promises and seemingly great opportunities that rarely deliver on their guarantees . <p> Web hosting affiliate plans are one of these areas , as not every web host gives you the deal that you expect . Affiliate hosting services are routinely marketed as get-rich-quick schemes where just a few weeks of easy online promotion will produce a dramatic impact on your bank balance . But the reality is that becoming a successful web hosting affiliate takes a little more work . <p> In this article , you will learn more about what makes a good web hosting affiliate plan . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset , you can give yourself the best opportunity for success and see for yourself that with a little work it is quite possible to make money as a web hosting affiliate . <p> Web hosting affiliate plans are easier to sell with great web hosting services <p> Ask any webmaster or business owner who has scoured the web for a reliable web hosting service and you will find that not every web hosting plan is the same . If you plan to refer your website visitors to a web hosting provider to convert them into paying customers , you must be sure you are sending them to a host that offers quality services . <p> A number of different factors signify the overall quality of a web hosting provider . First , consider the variety of services available . Most web hosts with a web hosting affiliate service provide shared web hosting , virtual private server ( VPS ) hosting , and dedicated server hosting as standard , with tailored web hosting services for more specific needs . Choose a web hosting affiliate scheme where the host in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on professional server hardware , in a dependable and reliable data center environment . <p> In addition , it is important to look at the features of each web hosting plan and the general customer service features provided by the web hosting company . It may seem obvious , but an unlimited web hosting service with unlimited resources is far easier to sell than an overpriced and/or limited offering . What 's more , the customers that you refer from your web hosting affiliate website will feel more confident and more willing to convert if they have the assurance of a strong network uptime service level agreement ( SLA ) and extensive customer support , available 24/7/365 . <p> They say that good marketing can sell just about anything to anyone . But why make your life more difficult ? Once you have found a genuinely attractive web hosting provider , even the most basic affiliate marketing practices can start to generate revenue . <p> Making money as a web hosting affiliate is not an overnight process <p> With the majority of web hosting affiliate services , making a small amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans offer a tiered payout system , rewarding your first few converting referrals with a modest commission . However , the best results come over time , with most web hosting affiliates being more handsomely rewarded as they climb the referral ladder . In some cases , every referral after your tenth could earn you over $100 ! <p> But there is another way that time factors into your ability to earn money as a web hosting affiliate . Looking at the buying habits of the average web hosting user , committing to a recurring , month-to-month investment in professional web hosting services is not a quick decision . Sometimes , a potential customer may visit the homepage of your web hosting provider dozens of times over a few weeks , sizing up the various features of the service and comparing these features against those of competing services . <p> Some web hosting affiliate plans are provided by companies that are aware of how difficult it is to land a sale , but do not account for it in the way they pay affiliates . If you are to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uses cookies to track referrals , long-term . The best affiliate web hosting solutions place a cookie on a potential customers computer the moment that you refer them and leave this cookie in place for up to 90 days . This means that if the user orders a service at any point during this period , you will still be rewarded with the relevant payout . <p> Can you really earn money as a web hosting affiliate ? Of course ! But doing so depends on finding an affiliate hosting provider that offers attractive , easytosell services , and is fair and honest when it comes to paying you the money that you are owed . <p> Become a JaguarPC web hosting affiliate today <p> As the leading web hosting provider , JaguarPC understands the important role that web hosting affiliates play in drawing new customers to the companys range of web hosting services .

Use the database and file backup feature in cPanel and you wont have to worry about a fiasco . Hosting accounts that are under 500 MB can take a full backup . Click download or a full website backup and your site is safe . If your site is over 500MB , you will have to perform two backups , one for your database and one for your files , but it is still the same simple process . <p> Some sites offer backup plugins , but be weary . While these plugins make it easy for frequent backups , its best to do this trhough cPanel . <h> Image Management <p> You can find a HTML Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get it properly tagged and displaying on your website . If you need to edit images , then go to the advanced area and look for image tools . Once here you can change the image size , the file type and even create thumbnails in the directory . <h> Disallow IP Addresses <p> If you notice a number of pesky visitors IP addresses , then cPanel makes it easy to change your setting and deny access . Follow these steps to block an IP on cPanel : <p> 1 . Choose " security " <p> 2 . Click the IP deny manager <p> 3 . Enter the offending IP addresses . <p> 4 . Presto , no more nuisance visits from that IP <h> cPanel is Mobile <p> You can download an app which puts many of the control panel functions you need to use in hand no matter where you are . You will have access to basic FTP , Email administration , server status and a few other everyday tasks you demand from cPanel . Check the cPanel site to see where you get the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E-mail <p> It is handy to set up notification from cPanel , but you do need to add an additional email address . Since cPanel uses your registered email as the primary , you will need to navigate to preferences where you can update your secondary email . In case the primary email is unreachable you will still be able to receive notifications and updates . This is very handy in the case of support issues and lost passwords . <p> Since all the buttons and Icons in your cPanel can be overwhelming , it is good to know what to look for and be aware of a few bonus features you will want to activate . <p> cPanel bundles the most compatible and effective tools into your control panel which takes the guess work off your hands . Hopefully one of these cPanel secrets help you take better advantage of all the great tools it offers . <p> JaguarPC can help you get started with cPanel web hosting plans .

It is because , i kind of lost/dont really get to understand this error ? Is it true Cpanel really stop us from to add the domain as an addon domain ? ? <p> Error from park wrapper : Using nameservers with the following IPs : 69.7 ? . XXX.YYY , 69.7 ? . XXX.YYY Sorry , the domain is already pointed to an IP address that does not appear to use DNS servers **33;1096;TOOLONG ........ <p> When a user adds a domain to their account , an authoritative entry for that domain is created on the shared hosts DNS server . This usually includes an MX record for the domain which directs mail traffic to the shared hosts mail server . <p> Theoretically the primary nameservers for the domain should be set to the shared hosts DNS server , and the shared hosts DNS should only be consulted regarding the domain if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosts internal systems utilize the shared hosts DNS server for name lookups , the server will respond as if it was authoritative for the domain regardless of whether it is actually configured as the primary NS . This may lead to the internal systems receiving results that are inconsistent with the global DNS state . <p> One approach to avoiding this is to ensure a user can not add a domain that is not already configured with the correct primary NS . In cPanel this is done by ensuring the following configurable parameters are disabled : <p> Allow Creation of Parked/Addon Domains that resolve to other servers . <p> Allow Creation of Parked/Addon Domains that are not registered <p> Allow users to Park/Addon Domains on top of domains owned by other users .

@@99682589 @3882589/ <h> IMAP setup - from POP : newb <p> so , I am new to IMAP . But I know I need it since I check email from my work , phone , &amp; home . I check my email account as POP now . What do I do now ? Do I need to convert it in some way in cpanel ? Or do I just use a different incoming / outgoing server ? <p> For reference I use : Outlook 2007 at work Outlook 2003 ( or 7 I forget ) at home iPhone mail <p> If you 've never used IMAP before , you may sometimes find it a little slow or unresponsive ( especially with a mailbox that contains LOTS of emails ) . I once was in a situation like yours . I decided to stay with POP3 instead . Instead of using IMAP ( which keeps the emails stored on the server ) you could configure each of your clients , either your iPhone , your work or home PC ( except one of them ) , to leave the mail on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iPhone , to download emails and leave a copy of the mail on the server , but have your home PC set to download and delete them from the server ( as normal ) . This way you have a copy of your emails in all places , and the server does n't get over loaded with hundreds of emails . <p> The only disadvantage , is that you must check with your Work and/or iPhone before checking with your Home PC . <p> Alternatively , you could set all three to leave a copy on the server , but also that the copies should be automatically deleted or expired , within X amount of days . <p> These are all settings you configure in your mail client , no changes need to be made on the server . <p> Thanks . What you describe in the 2nd post is exactly what I do . It 's just a bear to manage . <p> Qs w / IMAP. 1 ) email I delete shows up in Outlook with a line through it , how do I make it actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can read them if the connection drops ? 3 ) if I drag an email out of the inbox into a personal folder , will it now be local and not on the server . 4 ) if I drag email from other folders into my IMAP inbox , will it sync onto the server ? 5 ) can i still use 1 inbox for multiple accounts ? <p> 1 . In Outlook 2007 go to " Edit &gt; Purge &gt; Purge marked items in &lt;current folder&gt; " to delete the messages . In older versions of Outlook I belive it was just " Edit &gt; Purge Messages " or something like that . I usually add a button to my toolbar to make it easier to access this functionality . To do that go to " View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Customize " then choose " Edit " from the categories list and then find the " Purge marked items in Inbox " item from the commands list and drag it to anywhere in your toolbar . You can then ( with the Customize dialog still open ) right click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something a bit shorter and , if you wish , add an icon . <p> 2 . I believe that Outlook automatically caches the messages when you first open them . It also caches the headers ( sender , subject , date , etc. ) of all messages every time it checks for new messages . I do n't believe there is a way to automatically cache unread messages . <p> 3 . The message will be moved off the server and into your local personal folder . I believe it will show as deleted in the IMAP folder ( with the line through it ) until you purge the folder . <p> 4 . Yes . You can think of the IMAP view in Outlook as a " live " view of the server . Anything you change in Outlook will be automatically updated on the server . <p> 5 . Yes , IMAP is just a method of accessing your mail . Noting changes with regard to how it is received . 31684 @qwx891684 <p> 1 ) the purging is not great . Any idea if it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a pretty junky inbox until you take the steps to purge . 5 ) It made me create a special inbox in outlook for this email account ( previously all 4 of my pop email accounts dumped mail into one folder , my personal/inbox . <p> 1 . No , I do n't believe that you can . The deleted state is the equivalent to moving mail to a deleted folder so that you can get it back if you accidently delete it . The IMAP protocol just specifies that messages stay in the current folder . Some clients will move mail to a different folder when you " delete " it , but Outlook does n't . <p> 2 . No ... since with IMAP you are maintaining looking at a " picture " of the mail on the server it ca n't easily be aggregated into one folder on the client . The easiest way around this is to use one email account with forwarders to it for your additional addresses . If you need to be able to send mail with the " from " address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a way to add a from field to the message form . I do n't recall how to do that , but if I figure it out , I 'll let you know . <p> When I first switched to IMAP , and later to Outlook , these were my two biggest frustrations as well . I was used to collecting all of my mail in one place when I used POP , so the IMAP switch , and having to watch multiple folders , was difficult to get used to but the convenience of being able to check mail on multiple computers made up for it . You get used to it pretty quickly , though , and the need to purge the mailbox is n't too diffucult to adjust to especially if you add the button to the toolbar as I suggested . 31684 @qwx891684 <p> Jason - thanks for all the help . I do have 3 email accounts which I need to send from seperately . You 're right , I just have get used to it . It would n't be as bad if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save &amp; organize old email - just a lot of visual noise . <p> Having to always purge is just silly . Sounds like a microsoft design flaw . My iPhone puts deleted IMAP email in a trash folder , seems simple . U sure I ca n't set a trash folder ? I ca n't find that setting if there is one . <p> VinDSL - I 'll look into live mail . Thanks . If it count have calendar , tasks , and notes forget about it .

From other documentation I get that it will simply use the mailboxes on the server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Also , how to set this is up is also a bit confusing . I am aware that my primary server should have a priority of 0 and the back up of something like 10 . However , I have 4 different setting types for the email server where MX records are set . These are automatic , remote , local , and backup . <p> So if I want to use the backup I assume I set the setting to backup then I set my exchange server to have a priority of 0 while the cpanel server has a priority of 10 ? <p> Having not tried this before and not wanting to risk having my clients not get email I would appreciate some feedback from people that have tried this before . <p> having said that , the dropdown your seeing should be telling Cpanel how you want to it to handle any mail that makes its way to the cpanel server <p> " Automatic " = Cpanel will attempt to automically figure out what to do , normally delver locally <p> " backup " = cPanel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if that mail server is responding , if it is it will send the mails to the primary ( to the primary it will think these are just new incoming mails and process them normally ) <p> " remote " = Email is not hosted on the cpanel server ( i.e using google apps for domains or an exhange sever externally ) If using mail() or other server side mailing , with out setting this to remote will cause cpanel to deliver the mail locally instead of to the proper remote mail server ( do n't  know if this conflict with backup , but I doubt it would ) <p> " local " = delivers all mail locally . <p> Thus in your case you would set your Exchange to a MX record 0 , and Cpanel to MX Record 10. and set the email handling to backup <p> Thanks . I asked around and others tell me it works like that as well . The main concern seems to be with spammers targetting the backup MX server . I will be setting this up tomorrow night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend .

Every day , people use cPanel hosting to control their shared hosting accounts , virtual private servers ( VPS hosting services ) , and dedicated servers remotely . cPanel makes it easy to create mailboxes , upload files , and work with domains from a user-interface that is elegant , understandable , and effortless . <p> But although these flagship features of cPanel are very popular , they are only the beginning of what cPanel hosting services can really do . Because cPanel has so many features , some very useful tools are often overlooked . Webmasters who take the time to investigate these ignored features of cPanel often find that they have excellent functionality waiting to be used . <p> In this article , written by leading cPanel hosting provider JaguarPC , we offer an overview of three commonly ignored features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Error Log . Read on to learn what each of these features can do and most importantly why you should be using them . By taking advantage of these features , available with every cPanel hosting plan , you can unlock the full potential of your hosting plan and your website . <p> Use Image Manager to work with images from your website <p> Possibly the most useful and underused feature of cPanel is Image Manager . With no training or additional skills required , Image Manager allows you to work with pictures in a wide array of formats , streamlining the repetitive tasks that are involved in image manipulation . <p> Image Manager includes three main functions : <p> Thumbnailer Whether you are creating a gallery of images visitors can click on or adding small thumbnails to your blog posts , Thumbnailer can take an entire batch of images and resize them to your preferred size . <p> Image Scaler For more exact resizing , Image Scaler accepts a percentage or pixel input to make your current image bigger or smaller . You can even retain a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Image Format For use with specific applications or to improve performance , Image Format can convert entire directories of images into a given file type , such as . png , . jpg , or . gif . <p> Most cPanel hosting customers work with complex desktop software to manipulate images and prepare them for online publication . By using Image Manager , you can save time and let cPanel process your graphics server-side . <p> Automate your website administration with Cron Jobs <p> Some customers use cPanel hosting without noticing the Cron Jobs tool , while those who do successfully discover Cron Jobs are often intimidated by its complexity . However , Cron Jobs is an easy-to-use tool that can automate some important , time-consuming tasks . <p> Essentially , Cron is a task scheduler that can be configured to run specific processes at specific times . Using the Cron Jobs menu in cPanel , you can create annual , monthly , weekly , daily , or hourly tasks . Alternatively , you can schedule one-off processes for a given date and time . <p> When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write the section of code that will be executed . This code can be a command-line instruction , or , for less-experienced webmasters , a script . <p> One particularly useful application of Cron Jobs is backing up your data . There are many Perl and PHP scripts available online that will automatically copy data from your server , or send specific data to you via email . Using Cron Jobs , you can schedule this type of script to activate on a regular basis . <p> From backing up data , to deleting temporary files , to renaming directories , Cron Jobs is a useful way to automate repetitive tasks and a feature every cPanel user should explore . <p> Monitor your website with the Error Log <p> There are few things more frustrating than finding errors in your website that have been there for a long period of time . A missing page that leads to a 404 error can significantly damage your professionalism and prevent customers from getting the information they need . In addition , an error in a script can stop customers from requesting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom error pages and hope their customers will inform them of broken links and errors . Of course , most webmasters try to find the errors themselves by checking their website manually . Unfortunately , these methods rarely yield satisfactory results . <p> To effectively root out any errors on your website , cPanel comes with an Error Log that sits under the Logs menu , along with information on the Latest Visitors and Resource Usage . The Error Log shows the last 300 errors that were encountered on your website in plain-text format . <p> Each Error Log line includes major error types , including 404 Page Not Found errors and 500 Internal Server Errors that are usually the result of misconfigured scripts . <p> By checking your error log on a regular basis , you will quickly identify patterns that indicate a significant problem with your website . Armed with this information , you can quickly fix the problem and restore quality service to your customers . <p> Professional cPanel hosting services and customer support from JaguarPC <p> In the future , we will offer even more details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to learn more about using each feature to make full use of your cPanel hosting plan . <p> JaguarPC is a web hosting provider with a commitment to great hosting and exceptional customer support .

@@99682608 @3882608/ <h> What 's The Best Hosting Solution for Ecommerce ? <p> There are a lot of variables that go into the success of an ecommerce business . Marketing professionals certainly know how true this is . The constant need for A/B testing and the refining of both the user experience and content all play a big part in how well products or services can sell . To go a bit deeper into the factors that can have a big effect on how well your ecommerce site does , let 's take a look at servers . <p> Its true that hosting can make or break a business because of the many performance related factors that can influence customer behavior . These factors can be traced right back to the server that your site calls home . Make no mistake , though , your content management system will play a big role in your sites performance as well . That 's why you want the best combination for your particular business . A big Magento build and a mid-sized WordPress backed site will probably require two different kinds of hosting solutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , VPS hosting is the way to go . There are always exceptions , however . Let 's explore why owners of ecommerce businesses should take an extra close look at their hosting . <h> Skip Past Shared Hosting <p> If you were looking to put up a blog or portfolio site that remains relatively static , shared hosting might be just fine . But , there are too many negatives when it comes to running an ecommerce site . While the cheapest option , you 're also dealing with the slowest option . Its important to stress just how critical site speed is to your success . Not only are you losing out on sales if your site is slow , but you 're also putting yourself at risk of compounding that poor experience and losing visitors who wont even go to your site due to poor reviews . Consider that 79% of users who have an issue when making a purchase wont return to the site and 44% of those who had a poor experience will tell their friends or family about it . <p> There is also the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but shared hosting brings its own challenges . In the event of a security breach , there is higher risk of " infection " or a malicious agent getting access to your site due to the fact you 're sharing the same hardware and resources as many other sites . If the breach occurs in one site , there may be a method of accessing yours due to the proximity . If you 're handling things like customer credit card information , this can quickly spell disaster for the longevity of your business . Consumer confidence is a difficult thing to get back . <p> If not shared hosting , will a VPS work ? <h> Why VPS ? <p> For most ecommerce businesses just getting off the ground and up to mid-sized ones ( visitors in the thousands ) a virtual private server is the go-to solution . If shared hosting is having a bunch of roommates who are always eating the food in the fridge , a VPS is an apartment of your own . Sure , there 's still a landlord ( you are still sharing hardware with neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VPS is n't as susceptible to performance issues due to the activity of other accounts on the server . The resources alloted to you are yours only . Those resources are also considerably higher than the ones you would get on a shared plan . <p> VPSes come with higher clocked CPUs , more RAM , and larger disk space that will go far in helping you establish a robust ecommerce site . Throw in the optional managed services , and you 'll really see the difference . With a managed VPS , the backend management of the site is largely left to your hosting company . Troubleshooting , backups , and other technical issues that would otherwise take up time from you actually selling wont have to be of concern . <h> What About Dedicated ? <p> In short , yes , some ecommerce sites would benefit from using a dedicated server . Dedicated servers are generally the highest performing hosting options you can choose . The reason why one might be hesitant to go that route is because of the cost involved . You pay for that performance . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until you 're hitting tens of thousands of sales with high six figure visitor counts , you may not need it . But , you 'll see for yourself if the VPS performance is n't enough over time . You can always migrate . <h> Conclusion <p> Its clear that a lot goes into your sites success . The hosting company you work with can influence that success greatly . That 's why you want to partner with a hosting company that has the experience , longevity , and resources to ensure that your site is always performing at a high level . The team at JaguarPC can help you choose the monthly plan that makes the most sense for your business .

There are still a high number of businesses that want to remain on or move to dedicated servers because their business has inflexible operations , they are inexperienced with cloud hosting or they have basic business needs that perform better with a dedicated server business solution . <p> Dedicated servers are an excellent choice for expanding small and mid sized business operations . Dedicated server web hosting is particularly well suited for SMBs because of its ability to be customized to suit particular performance and security needs that higher level businesses demand . So why should you consider dedicated web hosting ? <h> Exclusive Server <p> Cloud is to an extent a shared service and heavy volume can slow it .

The absence of any shared factors make dedicated servers one of the most secure and reliable types of hosting service . <h> Values of Dedicated Servers <h> Managed Dedicated <p> Business that have grown large enough to need the level of resources , security and performance that dedicated servers offer are generally very busy . Eventually , as your business grows you will have to admit that you just cant do it all . Managed dedicated plans allow for your software and security settings to be upgraded , installed and receive professional administration services . <p> You ca n't be an expert in every aspect of your business .

@@99682615 @3882615/ <h> Blog <h> Will Hungry Hackers Find Your Website Security Holes ? <p> Website owners generally are n't  security experts . Most of us just do n't  have the time to become experts , however , it is important to be aware that hundreds of thousands of websites become the victims of hacks every year . <p> Despite your efforts to keep up with the right security practices for your website , it can still be a daunting task . If your users have their sensitive information breached , then your website and business could be in trouble . While certain patterns of attacks and the required defense practices , many website owners still overlook some basic security practices that can create a more secure environment . Use these website security tips from the JaguarPC team to ensure a safer environment for your visitors and your website . <h> Enable a SSL <p> Secure Socket Layer certificates are more important than ever . <p> If your website is passing credit card numbers , emails , passwords and other sensitive information then your site should be running a SSL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your web address once the security certificate is enabled . SSL certificates will encrypt the data that is passed between the web browser and the server . Adding an SSL to your server will add an additional layer of security to your site that will not only protect your data but the users who rely on you to protect their own data . <h> Strong Passwords <p> Passwords may seem a nuisance but they can provide a simple and easy to enable level of protection . One of the failures of passwords is that often they are simple and are n't  changed with regularity . Passwords need to be strong and have at least 12 characters which include symbols , upper and lower case letters and numbers . <p> A brute force attack can easily guess simple passwords like pet names and some variation of your own name . Every year a list of most commonly hacked and used passwords is published , but site owners still fail to heed the warnings . Regularly changing your passwords is also a sound practice . And , always change the default password @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and updated is overwhelming then consider a password vault where all your passwords are not only stored but also encrypted . <h> Updated Software and Scripts <p> Scripts and software need to be updated . Updates for software more often then not are released for security updates over feature additions . The world of hackers is strong and hackers are constantly looking for new ways to infiltrate . If you have unused scripts in your website , then dump them . If you have n't updated to the latest software version of your programs , then you could be leaving the back door wide open for intruders . While maintenance is rarely a welcomed task it should be on every site owners task list . A little house cleaning and tidying on your website could prevent a hack . <h> Malware is Vicious <p> Malware is so stealthy and malicious that a spy bot could come into your systems almost with an invitation and manipulate or even steal your important data and leave without a trace which is why not running some type of security suite on your website is maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to morph each and every day and most high level security suites are constantly updating to provide the most up to date protection levels . Malware has stealth powers . Websites , downloads and even images that look harmless can take you down in a matter of moments if you are n't  running some type of security protection . If your security service does n't  catch it , then a bonnet can intrude into your database . Attacks are continuing to increase in frequency despite the efforts of security experts to slow the malware industry . <p> It is critical to be aware of what you are downloading and using and to make sure it is a trusted source . Copy cat sites , an alluring e-mail and even a seemingly innocent invitation to a new product can all be inroads for malware . <h> CMS : Joomla , WordPress &amp; Drupal <p> Content management systems like WordPress , Joomla and Drupal can be a field day for attacks . These platforms are used by web designers on a global scale ad attackers know where to look in these systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designers to overlook new CMS versions and fail to update third party plugins . The failure to keep track of and actually update can wreck havoc on your website or even worse your e-commerce store . Watch for version changes and update alerts to ensure that these are updated as soon as possible . If you do n't  update , you could be a sitting duck for hackers . <p> JaguarPC takes security issues seriously . We want our customers to know that hackers are always on the move . More than ever they are using the dark web , tor communications and p2p . As a website owner you must be proactive with your security practices . While you may be more inclined to update your content and add new products to your shopping cart the best way to start off each new month is to take a hard look at your security practices and shore up any holes that intruders can use .

Although browser-based control panels are able to automate and streamline the essential tasks involved in getting your web hosting up and running , the more complex tasks associated with a virtual private server ( VPS ) hosting or dedicated server hosting plan often require a great deal of specialized expertise . Between time and expertise , managing your own VPS hosting plan can also be expensive . Alternatively , managed VPS hosting is a way to save your time , reduce your expenditures , and ensure the well-being of your virtual private server . <p> In this article , specialty web hosting provider JaguarPC explains what managed VPS hosting is and how the managed features of VPS hosting make configuring and working with your server easier . You will also learn more about the most common features of managed VPS hosting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct impact of managed VPS hosting on your profit margins . <p> Managed VPS hosting plans share overall server responsibility <p> By design , a VPS hosting service is designed to closely mimic the features and functionality of a dedicated server solution . Although your server is a virtual machine , or VM , it should behave exactly in the same way as a dedicated server , with allocated system resources , dependable performance , and full system access , allowing you to work with your VPS hosting exactly as you choose . Many businesses and individuals choose VPS hosting for this reason they desire full control of their hosting . <p> However , control means responsibility . Much like in a dedicated server hosting plan , VPS hosting users are usually left in charge of their own server . Although a reputable VPS host might offer a guarantee with regard to the network that the server is hosted on , you will be expected to install any software that you may require , upgrade your operating system with the latest security patches , and monitor your server for potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full responsibility and no responsibility . Although it allows you take full control of your VPS hosting with full root access , for example , managed VPS hosting also provides you with the support of experienced IT professionals who can help keep your virtual server running correctly . Rather than leaving your host completely responsible for running your hosting service ( as with shared web hosting ) or taking complete control yourself ( as with a dedicated server ) , managed VPS hosting takes away a portion of your responsibility , leaving time-consuming and complex server management to your VPS hosting provider . <p> Five common managed VPS hosting features <p> In a managed VPS hosting plan , your web hosting provider will automatically be on-hand to help with specific tasks that you may need assistance with .

VPS hosting software updates for improved features and performanceJust like operating systems , all of the software you regularly use on your VPS hosting plan will be routinely improved and upgraded . When the latest incarnation of the core software you require for your VPS hosting to work correctly is released , it is only natural that you would want to start using this new version as soon as possible . With managed VPS hosting , your host can install new server software , or upgrade software on request . <p> 3 . VPS hosting with regularly upgraded securityWith so many different threats facing your web presence , security is a vital element of your online success . However , to keep on top of the latest threats including malware and viruses , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest security patches and updates for your chosen operating system as well as for all of your core server software . As standard , managed VPS hosting plans include vital security upgrades , implemented automatically by your host . <p> 4 . Managed VPS hosting includes proactive server monitoringEven armed with the very latest updates and security patches for your server , there remains a number of security threats that could put your web presence at risk . Disruptive and destructive methods such as a distributed denial of server ( DDoS ) attack rarely prey on a specific failing in your security software instead , DDoS attacks overwhelm your entire server until it can no longer cope , and fails . Many managed VPS hosting solutions include proactive server monitoring , designed to identify the earliest warning signs of malicious attack , software misconfiguration , or hardware failure . <p> 5 .

But what are the implications of managed VPS hosting on your success and your ability to do business online ? <p> The benefits of a managed VPS hosting service <p> Managed VPS hosting lightens your workload by removing your responsibilities across three key areas upgrades and installation , security , and monitoring . Imagine the number of hours you could spend in an average week checking for the latest Internet security news , finding appropriate software patches and upgrades to combat new threats , and installing these upgrades on your VPS hosting plan .

Many users do n't  realize that Microsoft actually quit producing any new versions and packaging FrontPage in its office versions in 2003 and it discontinued support for the product in 2006 .

The template files are not actually ever served out to the user 's computer like ordinary HTML . Instead they are parsed by PHP , variable values are substituted for the placeholders , and the result is served up as the output of a PHP script . <p> There are several different ways this is handled , but the technique is the basis of nearly every templating system out there ( and there are probably over 100 such systems for PHP alone as well as others for nearly every programming language used on the web . Some software uses one of the common template systems , others do their own thing . <p> Here 's the basics of how it works in psudocode : <p> Code : <p> get contents of template file as string get next variable delimeter , while delimiter found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browser <p> Most scripts do this by using a regular expression search such that each time through the loop a new delimiter is matched and the name inside the delimiter is examined and matched to a variable value , and then the entire sequence is replaced with the value . This makes it easy to work with an arbitrary number of variables . I 've also seen some smaller systems , in the interest of speed , do strreplace() matches on a fixed list of variables . Some major template systems , like Smarty , actually interpret the compile the template into actual PHP code before parsing it . <p> Using template is , in some ways , like using multiple include files . Include files essentialy replace a placeholder in your code with the contents of a file ; template systems replace a placeholder in your output with a value . That value could be anything . Often it is a simple variable ( a name , a price , etc. ) , but it could also be a section of the page . The aforementioned Smarty system even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be parsed , just like its parent , and then inserted into the parent . <p> If you want more info about template systems , go right to the source and look at the docs for some of the tools out there . Two that I have used are patTemplate , a fairly decent , easy to use tool , and Smarty , the Swiss Army Knife of template tools--it will do everything you can imagine , but it has a very steep learning curve . You can also take a look here for an idea of just how many different systems are out there . <p> Thanks to techlighthouse for posting a question which has also been bugging me for some time . I think what always puzzled me was that HTML does n't support the content tags , yet there they were , in an HTML file . <p> So , just to finally get this straight , am I right in thinking that for example in the case of OR template files , is it irrelevant that the files have the . html suffix , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which parse the html template page , replace where necessary the content tags and then output the resulting code as a true html page to be sent to the browser ? <p> So , just to finally get this straight , am I right in thinking that for example in the case of OR template files , is it irrelevant that the files have the . html suffix ... <p> You are correct . What happens under the hood is that the application ( PHP script or whatever it may be ) reads in the file , parses through it in whatever manner it was designed , and it then returns the output to the browser . From a technical standpoint the file extension is irrelevant--the only reason for using specific extensions on the web is as a convenient way to tell the web server how to handle a requested file--and template files are never handled by the web server directly ( they are handled by the application , the web server stops once it starts the app ) . Some template systems may be hard-coded to only allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tend to use an extension that matches the type of content in the template ( generally that 's HTML , so I use . html , but I 've also used things like . rss for RSS feed templates and a handful of others ) . In the case of . html , this gives me the advantage of being able to open the template file in an editor like Dreamweaver without a lot of effort . I use Eclipse with PDT for most of my development these days and , by using . html for template files , Eclipse knows they contain HTML and does code completion , colorization , and error checking for me . If I use something non-standard , like . tpl , it treats the file as plain text and does n't do any of that . I 'm sure I could go change settings somewhere , but why bother ?

Is it in that account and if so , how do I access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as the site admin , how do I delete it from cpanel ? <p> So my question is , as the administrator of the site , can I see that FTP account and folder from the cpanel . Also , are those files safe on the web . I did require a password . I would hate to have someone be able to get to the file . When I went through all of the folders you mentioned , I ca n't find " work " , " user files " , or " price list " mentioned anywhere in the file manager . <p> When you create an FTP account , it adds a folder in the publichtml folder ( which is the same as the www folder ) with the same name as your ftp account username. ( ie FTP account username= " pricelist " then then there should be a folder under publichtml called " pricelist " ) whatever is in there is available to everyone on the net if they can guess the address correctly . For information on how to password protect the folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't think work@domain.com is a valid FTP account . you need somehting like " work " <p> I do n't really have a firm grasp of what your talking ' bout so I 'm just taking a stab in the dark

Perl scripts are executed directly by the OS--that is Apache tries to execute the script directly , the OS sees the file is executable , it looks at the first line to find out how to execute it , and then it executes it . With PHP all valid extensions for PHP scripts ( ie . php , . php4 , . php5 , etc. ) are mapped to an appropriate processor ( the PHP interpreter ) . When a request is received , Apache runs that processor passing it the path to the requested script , the processor then opens the file and runs it ( similar to runing a script from the command line using " perl myscript.pl " or " sh myscript.sh " ) .

The OS would then be able to run the script directly . <p> I have n't tried it , but I bet you could set up suPHP to run perl scripts the same way as it handles PHP . It is n't necessary though because suExec is already available to give the same benefits .

I have also tried adding removing and readding myself via both their control panel as well as by editing the majordomo list file as well ( I 'm one of the admins on this site ) . Neither one has worked for me . <p> I do n't know which end it 's on . I 'm also trying to find out what server software has changed on the other end recently as well . I know none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem odd that the mailer is trying to do an authenticated sendmail ( not sure why it 's trying that ) - if the TLS in question is part of SSL/TLS ( I think it is ) . <p> &gt; As for the client area and ticket system , &gt; try login in with your full domain name &gt; and the password that your account &gt; was originally set up with , You may &gt; have to capitalize the first letter of your &gt; domain name as well . <p> So the username should be ' domain.com ' ( possibly capitalized ) and the password should be the original one ?

If you are using a filter , try switching to an forwarder . Set it up the same way , with the forwarding address set to : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have you catch-all set to collect unroutable mail , you will get the same effect without doing anything . <p> Filters do n't seem to work with " $to " " equals " ; unless you put brackets " &lt; " and " &gt; " around the address you 're trying to filter . Then " equals " works , but the condition does n't display in CPanel , you have to look at the page source to see your conditions . So if it 's unique , I use " $to " " contains " . <p> Because you 'll start sending bounces to an unknown number of random people who 's email addresses are contained in spam that reach your bounce address . <p> Not to mention that if spamcop finds out you are bouncing , your IP address will be blacklisted faster than you could ever imagine . If you are on a shared host then you 'll also blacklist **** loads of other domains along with yours . <p> Bouncing is legitimate if there is no such user . What SPAMCOP does n't want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters . " Configure your software to either reject messages during delivery or accept them permanently . " I do n't know when email filters are executed , if they occur during delivery or afterwards . <p> Either way , I do n't bounce them based on my filtering , I ship them to " discard " . <p> If you use the : fail : method ( either as your default mail action instead of a catch all or if you set up a forwarder and forward to : fail then the messages will simply be refused at the gateway . This is probably the same for filters , but I do n't know for sure . In this case the " bounce " message will be generated by the sending server , not yours ( so SpamCop wo n't care ) . <p> Incidentally , you do not actually need to set up specific handler for " no-reply , " if you are n't collecting messages in a catch-all box then all mail to no-reply will fail and will be handled however your default is set up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it works fine . <p> OOOOOOOooooooooooooook , I hope I 'm not wrong , cause we 're now saying the same thing . The first time , you said : DO NOT BOUNCE EMAILS with no exceptions . Now you 're saying they should be rejected during delivery , which is what I said in response to your first outcry .

This morning , it 's pulling up from my old web host again . Is this normal ? <p> Try going to http : //www.dnsstuff.com/ and doing a DNS lookup for your domain name . You will find that in the upper right corner of the test page , enter your domain name , and use the drop down box to select " All " records . This will show the nameservers currently listed for your domain . Once that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the 13 TLD servers all contain the same information . <p> Also , are all of these checks being made from the same place . The whole reason why propagation takes as long as it does is that local DNS servers cache data so that they do n't have to keep asking for the same thing over and over . So it is possible that the servers you 're using at one location have a different cache than at others . <p> For example , say you are at home . You go to your registrar 's site and change your DNS servers . You then try to go to your site . Updates usually take up to 24 hours to be effective in the central registry , so when your ISP 's DNS server asks where it can find your site it is directed to your old host . It downloads the info about your site and caches it for 48 hours . <p> The next morning you go to work . By this time the change has been made in the central registry and your employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It too downloads and stores this info for two days and directs you to the new site . <p> You get home for the night and bring up your site again . Since your ISP still has the cache from yesterday it does n't bother trying to find your site again and just sends you to what it knows from " memory , " which happens to be your old site , even though you know that the new site is working already . <p> If you see this happening and it is always from the same location it is probably due to multiple DNS servers at y your ISP that are n't talking to each other properly . <p> # 38.25.63.10 x.acme.com # x client host 127.0.0.1 localhost <p> Located here : <p> Code : <p> C : **28;1346;TOOLONG <p> If there 's an entry for your website in there , you will need to either delete the entry or update it to reflect the new IP address .

Then I finally realized that my email address was being spoofed by the sender of the spam . Of course , I 've got my email address whitelisted which makes it tuff to keep out spammers who our spoofing that address . <p> I 've been messing around with the SA parameter whitelistfromrcvd , to try and check against the email received headers , but so far my attempts have been fruitless .

If you want to whitelist your own domain , be aware that spammers will often impersonate the domain of the recipient . The recommended solution is to instead use whitelistfromrcvd <p> This is exactly what happen to me . Spammers are impersonating my domain , and I 'm trying to figure out how to use whitelistfromrcvd instead . 31684 @qwx891684 <p> Sorry if I 'm talking to myself , but can you explain this situation a little more ? <p> Are they spoofing like : <p> ' arealuser@example.com ' or ... <p> ' somephuckingbullsh ! tname@example.com ' ? <p> Sorry for the confusion . The " From " line in the header is actually *MY* email address ( arealuser@example.com ) . Since I have my personal email address whitelisted , any spam that gets sent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fake addresses with the correct domain ( somephuckingbullsh ! tname@example.com ) are not a problem . I do n't have the full domain whitelisted , just valid email addresses , not to mention , those would go the catchall anyway which is already set to : fail : . <p> This why I wanted to try and switch from using whitelistfrom to using whitelistfromrcvd . That way I 'd be checking the Received headers for the proper domain instead , which supposedly is much more reliable . But so far I 've had no luck . In searching the web for help , I 've seen lots of questions , but no real answers . <p> For what it 's worth , here 's the full description of whitelistfromrcvd from the link I included above : <p> whitelistfromrcvd **26;1376;TOOLONG sourceforge.net Use this to supplement the whitelistfrom addresses with a check against the Received headers . The first parameter is the address to whitelist , and the second is a string to match the relay 's rDNS . <p> This string is matched against the reverse DNS lookup used during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchangers . It can either be the full hostname , or the domain component of that hostname . In other words , if the host that connected to your MX had an IP address that mapped to ' **28;1404;TOOLONG ' , you should specify **28;1434;TOOLONG or just spamassassin.org here . <p> Note that this requires that internalnetworks be correct . For simple cases , it will be , but for a complex network , or running with DNS checks off or with -L , you may get better results by setting that parameter . <p> Assuming you are on a JPC-owned server , I think your servers rdns would be servername.nocdirect.com ( check your cpanel for the proper servername to use ) . All mail is sent through the shared IP of your server , so an reverse lookup should result in the nocdirect name . <p> Assuming you are on a JPC-owned server , I think your servers rdns would be servername.nocdirect.com ( check your cpanel for the proper servername to use ) . All mail is sent through the shared IP of your server , so an reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck . <p> --Jason <p> That 's a good point . My JPC server is Hero , but I 've been using my personal domain name for the whitelistfromrcvd parameter . I 'll switch the parameter over to hero.nocdirect.com and see what happens . <p> One thing I 've noticed , however , is that most of my emails have 2 to 3 and sometimes 4 Received headers . I assume this a product of the email transitioning from server to server on it 's way to the destination ( please forgive my lack of proper terminology here ) . Every email has servername.nocdirect.com in at lease one of the Received headers . I 'm hoping that whitelistfromrcvd looks at the originating Received header and not all of them . This would seem to make more sense . <p> Assuming you are on a JPC-owned server , I think your servers rdns would be servername.nocdirect.com ( check your cpanel for the proper servername to use ) . All mail is sent through the shared IP of your server , so an reverse lookup should result in the nocdirect name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have done the trick ! Use the MAIL EXCHANGE SERVER NAME .... NOT the email address domain name . <p> I 'm currently at work where we have a different web/email hosting service , so this became a good test . Sending emails using my JPC account via my office email hosting service becomes a good test to mimic the spam problem I 've been having . Here 's what I tested in the userprefs file : <p> If I send emails to myself using the first method , the X-Spam-Status header in my emails showed NO whitelist flag . However , when I changed to the mail exchange sever name , the X-Spam-Status now showed USERINWHITELIST . Excellent ! <p> Once that was all settled , I placed in a second line : whitelistfromrcvd myemail@myJPCdomain.com hero.nocdirect.com <p> An additional problem that was getting me wrapped around the axle was the fact that I had the Auto White List set to ON while I was doing the testing . With all the test emails I was sending myself , after a couple emails the address would get placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I did in the userprefs file ( correct or incorrect ) . So , I turned off the AWL function and my test results made much more sense . <p> I 'm not sure if I 'll turn the AWL back on or not . I think I 'm going to snoop around the forums a bit to see what it 's benefits are . Maybe I just need to set the whitelistfromrcvd settings that I want then clear my AWL.

Despite its popularity , users have an excellent opportunity to enhance their cPanel experience by using either a paid or a free cPanel theme to brighten up their control panel . One popular step to take is to pay a developer to create a branded cPanel theme based on our business so that it clearly associates with what you do . Naturally , branded cPanel themes are all going to be different and specific to the specifications of each business , and may contain images , logos , marketing slogans , or something else relevant to the company . However , several generic themes are available to give your cPanel account a fresh look and make your site in general easier and more fun to manage . What are the top 5 cPanel themes for your hosting panel ? Clean Panel This cPanel theme is one that definitely lives up to its name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the point , making it easy for cPanel users to find their way around their control panel and make updates as and when they need to do so . Clean Panel makes use of the space available on the control panel page to make everything stand out , and it is compatible with all third party cPanel add-ons . At the same time , users can continue to customize their Clean Panel interface however they want to do so , while anyone who also uses cPanelsWeb Host Manager ( WHM ) receives the theme for that platform , too.RVSkin RVSkin is one of the more advanced examples of cPanel themes , allowing you to fully customize all aspects of your interface . RVSkins own control panel does offer a number of pre-installed themes , however , so you can take advantage of these and upload your logo , a photograph , and other branded assets to feature on your cPanel should you wish to do so . Although it can give a distinct appearance specific for your brand , it is probably not as good as Clean Panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving the user-friendly aspect of the control panel . This is definitely better for aesthetics rather than making cPanel easier to use.Element This cPanel theme is available from cpskins.com , and is the best of the 13 that they have on offer . Element will give your cPanel interface a complete makeover and give it an intuitive , easy to understand and navigate appearance so that you and other users can find exactly what they need with the minimum of fuss . For a modern , stylish looking cPanel , this theme is a great choice.X4 X4 comes from cPanel itself , and is definitely a theme worth considering . While it will eventually become the front-end cPanel theme , those who already use cPanel will be able to download it and add it into their account . For those who struggle to find what they are looking for , the built in search function will prove to be a great help , while the way X4 is laid out into three columns with data , icons , and finally news is sensible and ensures that users never miss anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one is better for advanced users who do not need to have icons in front of them at all times in order to find what they are looking for . It does allow users to specify their own quick links , however , so any features that are regularly used can be collated in one place on the main screen.Your cPanel Theme cPanel is an excellent control panel solution . Using a theme , either an updated one from cPanel themselves or a third party one , will help to smarten up your cPanel interface and make the whole service a lot sharper and easier for you and anyone else to use .

Joomla , Drupal and WordPress are now considered the best platforms for creating blogs and websites . But , not many understand the real differences or benefits between the three systems and why one is better for some projects and a different platform better for others . Explore the reasons why . <p> Joomla Offers Advanced Design Features Joomla makes content editing easy . Many report it has the feel of Microsoft word and Joomla locks content editing so simultaneous editing wont cost you time and errors.Menu creation is also a snap . You can create hierarchical menus that consist of various menu items pointing to different locations internally and externally . Joomla creates websites and blogs using PHP and most uses MySQL for data storage . PHP is the most important open source web scripting language at the time . When you choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest versions of PHP and MySQL which makes it a powerful choice for it editing features as well its seamless performance because of its PHP use and MySQL data storage benefits . Joomla can also boast about its vibrant community . If you think it can fit your needs you can explore the bigger benefits on the Joomla website , newsletter or at its community forum . <p> Drupal for PHP , MySQL and CSS Users Drupal is another CMS which shines . Drupal is known for being highly functional when you need advanced menu features , you are handling a variety of content types and you need good graphics management . You can plan to easily build advanced websites , blogs , discussion boards or social networking pages when you use these advanced Drupal elements . One feature that most CMS platforms do n't  offer is the ability to categorize your content as you see fit . Drupal allows you to create categories for URL addresses , paths and to make your own lists . The structure allows you to create a system of organization . You can decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods to search and reuse any of your content . A good variety of plugins and a solid support community make Drupal an excellent CMS choice when it comes to larger projects and more advanced web design and blogging needs . If you have advanced knowledge of PHP and HTML languages as well as CSS then this is the system for you . <p> Use WordPress to Publish a Site Fast WordPress is likely at this time the most well recognized CMS platform and it even has some of the advanced development features you crave . The real beauty of WordPress is that a novice can watch a few tutorials and get WordPress web hosting running to have a website published quickly . Many themes are available and this also makes WordPress a good choice for intermediate and beginning users . A few fresh photos and a bit of original content along with some choice plugins can produce a good looking site in a relatively short period of time . The other advantage is the multitude of plugins that you can use to add features . While Drupal and Joomla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally relies more on plugins for advanced features which means you do n't  have to know code to produce an attractive , high performing and popular website or blog . <p> While WordPress is the most popular blogging and website creation platform available today it might not entirely suite your needs . Take a look at Drupal and Joomla as well before you begin your project to see which features and elements will best benefit the overall needs of your particular design . WordPress may be a common choice but it could have limitations that you can find work arounds to get the job done far easier and faster in Drupal or Joomla.

No , it is n't a war zone , but data centers are very secure structures because they are where servers reside . <p> If you are using web hosting , then you are part of a data center .

This would all occur AFTER mail has been processed by spamassassin . The point of this excercise is that only more important email will go into my inbox whereas everything else will go into something like inbox2 . ( Additional motive is that I 'll be starting to check/respond to emails using imap on my phone . ) . I am planning to use a separate whitelist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't need to edit the script every time I add someone . Any examples or hints people might have would be appreciated . If no one here has done something similar , then I 'll research the exim filters in more detail . Thanks . <p> Mail in -&gt; spamassassin -&gt; exim filter ( what I want it to do - looking for recommendations on how to do ) : <p> if &lt;from&gt; is in &lt;whiltelistfile&gt; then deliver ( to mailbox ) else deliver to account/inbox2 <h> How to filter whitelisted and other email <p> I have detailed my solution to send whitelisted email to a mail account 's primary inbox and all other mail for the account to a secondary mail folder . This required Jag to reconfigure the system Exim configuration file ( directorytransport in USERFORWARD section ) since Exim was n't delivering using the Maildir format . Thanks to Smith and support team ! This was done on server manticore . It may not work on other servers until said Exim changes are made . <p> I am using this solution to : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from known people go into my primary inbox. 2 . I want my primary inbox to be super clean since I am also receiving/sending from it using my phone ( via imap ) . 3 . All mail from elists and other stuff that just comes in ( but not potential spam , that goes elsewhere ) goes to my secondary mailbox folder that I check during the day too - just not as often as the primary inbox ( and not via phone ) . I know the whitelist rule uses reverse logic , but there was a reason for doing it for me . You could straighten the logic and explicitely deliver whitelisted mail to your primary mailbox instead . <p> The filter file : ( please note : I had to add a spambox rule in since the filter file must take precedence over the spambox filter . This only applies to you if you a spambox . I was using the spambox configured via cPanel . ) <p> Replace " myemail@mydomain.com " ( the email account to filter ) ( You could leave the email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your domain ) ( Yes , this matching is quite loose - matches it anywhere in header . Needed to do since some key inbound mail is n't providing exact headerto matching . There are several other techniques possible . ) Replace ACCOUNT ( your Jag account on the box ) Replace 2ndINBOX ( whatever separate mail folder you want other email to go to note courier imap folder naming conventions ) <p> 1 . IMPORTANT : YOU COULD LOSE MAIL : If the userforward section of exim on your server is n't configured for Maildir , all mail filtered will disappear since exim does n't know how to save it using a PATH as the save location . If it 's not working and you 're not sure , you can test this by adding a save line that ends in a file name instead of a directory . This line will save as mbox format if that 's how your server 's exim is still configured . <p> 2 . Another reason for the reverse logic on the whitelist filter is that if Jag upgrades the server/software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes , only mail that is NOT in your whitelist will be lost until you figure out the server config is hosed and you ask them to fix it . Keep that in mind as you create your filters . <p> allobrogica : This is exactly what I 've been trying to do since the move to maildir format ( I have - had - a pretty decent collection of filters I use to sort my email server-side ) . <p> What server are you on ? I 'm on Titanium , and I have n't had any luck . Perhaps there 's a config difference , in which case I could ask a support person to look at your server 's config to get Titanium to jibe with it ...

VPS Hosting <p> Both shared hosting and VPS hosting have their advantages and disadvantages , depending on the requirements for any particular website . Many webmasters are choosing VPS hosting these days because of its greater capabilities and generally moderate cost . However , shared hosting does offers convenience and a lower cost platform that attracts a large number of clients . Below are some comparisons between the two platforms . <p> Utilization of Resources Shared and VPS hosting differ regarding the way they allocate resources . With shared hosting , multiple users are sharing the same space , thus limiting your control to use the space as you desire . Since the memory resources are shared , there are limits imposed upon each user of the hardware . However , with VPS hosting these restriction do not exist . With a VPS , the hardware space can be customized to meet you websites particular needs . As well , each server provides virtual independent storage spaces contained within the server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This translates into faster speeds and no interference from other users using the same server . <p> Security VPS hosting offers a security advantage over shared hosting in that it only allows users to access their own files . The configuration is kept secure to prevent the risk of others gaining access to your content . With shared hosting there is always a certain level of risk for compromised data , since a single server is being utilized by many users with no independent partitioning . <p> Reliability Most webmasters are highly concerned with the reliability of their websites . Uptime is important for virtually any kind of website , whether its low or high traffic in nature . Especially for businesses though in a competitive online arena , uptime can be crucial . Shared hosting offers less of a guarantee regarding uptime since any particular website is sharing resources , and just one other user can spoil accessibility if they overload the server . Since a virtual private server offers an independent , virtual hosting environment , there are no concerns over other accounts affecting the accessibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no constraints regarding the type of software you can install with a VPS host . You have the freedom to customize and install the applications you need . As a result , you can eliminate potential compatibility problems . However , with shared hosting you must basically accept what the web hosting company provides in order to ensure the proper functioning of your software . <p> In conclusion , shared hosting offers a genuine price advantage and is more than suitable for those requiring a less than demanding web presence . However , for more efficiency , flexibility and speed , VPS hosting definitely provides many advantages .

I was n't sure if it would work with CentOS , since it was ported from Windows . It worked fine , but only if you TAR'ed the files first , e.g. you got ta pipe 7z after TAR'ing everything . <p> Ultimately , this produced a slightly tighter file than BZ2 , but not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my local machine , et cetera 31684 @qwx891684 31684 @qwx891684 <p> bzip2 and gzip only compress things , they do n't put 30 files together into one . tar puts 30 files into one , but does n't compress . Linux 's philosophy of each tool doing one thing -- and doing that extremely well -- shines through here . In linux , you first create the archive , then you compress it . Some tools , such as tar , make it easier to use the other tools in conjunction with it . With tar , you can add options on the command line to run the file through a compressor ( gzip or bz2 ) after it creates the archive . This is very helpful <p> bzip2 is pretty much the best compression algorithm available , but it can get extremely slow . I only recommend it when you 've got a massive file that you need to transfer , and you 're on a server that is n't too busy . It will eat CPU faster than a cop eats donuts <p> gzip is decent compression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is fast .

Very annoying pages , at least you could replace the DEFAULT apache error 500 page with something like " server busy " and remove that annoying nswwwhost line , or something . <p> I get tons of error 500 pages , while browsing a phpbb forum , when accessing cpanel , etc. ( domain.com/cpanel ) <p> This is happenening because we implemented Resource Limits and tightened it per account on all our servers . Intermittent 500 errors mean that your scripts are using too much server resources and when it hits the limit , the processes are killed giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overloading our server and ultimately crashing . <p> You may want to look at any scripts or programs you are using to determine why its using so much resources , we have allocated more then enough resource usage per account , if this continues then optimizing your script/program code may be needed so it does not do this . <h> How cPanel handles FTP authentication <p> Ever wondered how cPanel deals with FTP authentication ? I did , and as cPanel themselves do n't seem to want to say much about it , here 's a bit of an explanation . <p> The system seems to have been designed primarily with ProFTPD in mind . When set to use ProFTPD , the daemon uses the shadow passwd file located at **26;1581;TOOLONG to decide upon user authentication . <p> More interesting is what it does when you set it to use the PureFTP daemon. cPanel continues to basically use the ProFTPD shadow passwd file model , to the extent that it still uses the files in /etc/proftpd/ for authentication . It uses a feature of PureFTPd that allows a custom authentication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ login to FTP . This script is located at /usr/sbin/pureauth and is a Perl script , presumably written by cPanel themselves . Unfortunately , this authentication method seems to be specified on the commandline by cPanel each time the FTP daemon is started , so it 's not possible to enable other auth methods ( like mySQL , traditional Unix passwd , etc ) on top of the cPanel authentication . <p> The script is basically a wrapper , allowing the shadow passwd files in /etc/proftpd/ to be used in the same way as ProFTPD for authentication , so cPanel can continue to update these files in the same way no matter which FTPD you 're using , and switch between the two easily . The script will check the IP the user connected to and try to match it up to a domain using the file /etc/domainips . It will then check whether the username is in the form user@domain , and if it is , uses the domain part as the assumed domain and ignores what it found in /etc/domainips . It then looks up the owner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cPanel , using the file /etc/userdomains . Assuming it has found a user , it then checks the supplied password against one of the shadow passwd files . If the username was not in the form user@domain AND the IP connected to was not the ' main ' server IP ( the first non-local IP in the list supplied by /sbin/ifconfig -a ) ( which implies that it is the ' main shared IP ' for use with name-based hosting ) , it will check the /etc/proftpd/username file , where username is the username supplied for FTP login . Otherwise it checks **26;1609;TOOLONG . It will try to check the supplied password against its crypt()ed version and its MD5 crypt()ed version . If this fails , it will always then check the password against the **26;1637;TOOLONG file . <p> The script then returns the authentication information ( success/fail , UID , GID , root dir ) to the PureFTP daemon . <p> Just thought I 'd share the result of this research with you . Unfortunately , it means I 'm not easily able to do what I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PureFTPD will not let a custom authentication script successfully authenticate the root user . No , I 'm not mad , I just find it easier to edit files by downloading , editing , then uploading then than messing around with Unix commandline editors . Seems the only way to do what I want is just to start another instance of the FTP daemon , listening on a seperate port and using traditional Unix ( /etc/passwd ) authentication . For some reason , it then does allow you to FTP as root ! <p> Update : I just found out that cPanel implements its SSH access via OpenSSH , which also coincidentally happens to implement the ' SFTP using SSH2 ' protocol which is a very nice , secure , FTP replacement . I 'm using FileZilla to login as root now via this protocol , and it 's working fine . Thanks for the advice , chirpy . I guess my advice is to use SFTP , especially when FTPing as root . <p> I would also definitely recommend to use SFTP instead of regular FTP , since regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the server without encryption , so if it gets intercepted by a package sniffer anyone can just grab your password . That 's the reason you should never FTP to your server as root . <p> If you want to do that , simply use SFTP . If you have SSH installed ( and every cPanel server does ) then you can also use SFTP , and you do n't have to install anything to login as root then .

Please make sure to ' cd ' to ' incoming ' folder and then upload the file . The file uploaded this way will not be available for download via anonymous ftp . This is to protect against warez and security issues . <p> Given these replies and the other posts out here , I suppose it is a server wide thing : i.e. once someone on your server has asked for it , it will be set up properly ( again ) so all can use it . <p> Do not forget though that you can enable and disable this for your own account in your cpanel . I.e. once your server is set up properly ( again ) you still need to enable it yourself in your cpanel before it works for your account . <p> So , if you ca n't get it to work using only your CPanel , best put in a ticket . <p> Yes , there seems to be a server-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tech : <p> There is one configuration file for pure-ftpd in /etc/sysconfig there I allowed the anonymous to upload . <p> Problem is that this left me in a very bad state . My incoming directory perms were 777 , so all files could be read and downloaded by anonymous . <p> So I changed the directory perms , and then newly uploaded files could n't be seen/listed , but if you know the exact filename , you can still download the file . <p> The Techs are still working on the ticket . <p> Wim , I tried your personal site , and I uploaded a small . jpg file and could neither see it nor download it . When you recieved it ( 23&lt;&gt;. jpg ) what were the permissions on it ? <p> ( I am guessing that a configuration to ftp must be made to change the umask for the files so that they ca n't be read .

To this relative newbie at *nix it seems that the file permissions by themselves would allow such a download . Therefore I suppose it is done through some special setting in the ftp-server configuration . <p> It is obviously essential that nothing can be downloaded from this folder , not even by those that know the file names , as it would open up your server for file sharing of god knows what by third parties . This is also why I choose not to mess with it myself when it stopped working due to the ftp software change , but wait around for folks to get to it . <p> Veena was able to find the correct option to get it working .
