" The culture , architecture and foods were big influences for my first collection in 1999 , and that 's where I got the inspiration for the split toe shoe , which is still incorporated into my designs today . " Dan Sullivan . <p> The opportunities that Dan discovered in China allowed for detailed &amp; creative manufacturing , at an affordable price &amp; small quantities . This gave Dan the chance to combine the resources of the far east with the experiences he had gathered spanning the most creative times , and countries , of his generation . And from this Irregular Choice was born . <p> Dan has stuck very determinedly to his philosophy throughout the past 16 years , which is to keep Irregular Choice as something that is not influenced by passing trends , but original and set apart from the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an Irregular Choice shoe is not like any other you 'll find . Dan does n't  listen to what 's happening in the fashion industry or what another brand may be doing . This is what makes Irregular Choice designs completely unique and truthful . <p> From embellished heels , ornate wood carvings , tiny intricate charms and lavish fabrics , to the memorable colour combinations , everybody has an Irregular Choice favourite shoe or story . Each year Dan creates over 600 different styles , and is constantly jotting down styles , photos and sketches , its an ever expanding creative process reaching to what is now over 10,000 different options . <p> Irregular Choice has evolved with great strides over the past decade . The brand is now sold through hundreds of stockists around the world , and has nine of its own stores across the globe , with more in the pipeline . <p> Every Irregular Choice customer has their own favourite designs , and with such a huge collection to choose from each season there is always something to tempt every shoe addict . <p> Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is brought to life within the Irregular Choice stores . The Irregular Choice fans responded so positively to the introduction of Irregular Choice stores that we believe this is where the future of the brand lies . When a Stacked wooden , hand carved heel with scalloped fabric upper is displayed in the window of an Irregular choice store , the fans gravitate towards it , not only as a piece of artwork , but they also feel they are capturing a piece of fashion history . Between the details of the 3D vinyl coated wall surrounding the Shenzhen Store , or the mirrored mannequins and flashing rainbow staircase of the London Carnaby Street store , the trips to Irregular Choice stores are always memorable . The shoes are presented on floating light up shelves and the accessories are neatly placed on multi-coloured tiles .

@@3521802 <p> I was afraid that the sole protectors would make my shoes more slippery but to my luck they did not . I had some struggles trying to cut them to fit the sole as I was n't sure about how far back they should go ( I used them on a pair of Lazy Rivers ) but I managed . On the more curvy parts of the sole the sole protector may not grip perfectly and some dirt may get inside . Other than that they stay really well . You ca n't see the sole pattern just as clearly as before but it 's a small price to pay for not completely ruining the pattern . After a lot of walking and dancing the pattern is still intact !

The heel tips used by our factories are made to the recommended hardness to ensure good wear quality and yet not be too hard to cause slip problems . Given the nature and size of the heel tips , they will wear down depending on use . Also it is not uncommon that they may come off during wear . If a heel tip is missing or loose/worn , replace these ASAP to prevent damage to the shoe . We recommend that heel tips are also replaced before they wear down completely to ensure that the heels are not damaged .

Whilst we have accurate information on the materials used , it 's not always possible to get exact information about any dyes , threads , glues , trims , glitter , sequins , paints , cements , resins or glues which may be used .

If a style contains leather in the upper , sock , lining , sole or trim , the blue product information box will state this on the product page , and the material info sticker on the style itself will also show this . It is company policy , and has been for many years , to use faux fur rather than real fur .

All styles that feature light-up LED components ( except the State of Flux style ) have concealed , single use , non-replaceable batteries , are designed to keep flashing for an approximate minimum of 20,000 steps , and can not be turned off .

We will always nicely re-pack these products for you wherever possible , however sometimes the packaging may appear slightly less than pristine .

This week we have an extra special entry from a member of Staff working at Irregular Choice ! <p> We would love to hear from all of you . To share your story please write on our Facebook wall to be in with a chance of seeing your story in a future post. - <p> Amy 's Story- <p> Hello ! I am Amy I work on all the online marketing for Irregular Choice . I have been working for the brand nearly 5 years now and initially started off as a Christmas Temp in the Irregular Choice Brighton Store ! <p> I first found Irregular Choice when I was about 12 years old . One day I was walking through the local shopping centre with my mum on my way to some boring clothes shop when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of wonderful rainbow magic hidden behind a vast expanse of black and brown leather . I was immediately hooked . Every time we went shopping I HAD to run in the store and look in awe at the latest pairs of Irregular Choice shoes . Each time I would plead my mum to buy me a pair . But there was no way my mum was spending money on a pair of heels for a 13 year old who 's feet were still growing . I had to wait and endure the world of bland trainers and school shoes until my time would come . <p> I started my first job around my 16th birthday , in a shoe shop who are known specifically for their wonderful range of black and brown leather conservative work shoes . Ironically I would spend every pay check on bright and colourful <p> Amy 's Meteoria boots <p> Irregular Choice shoes . My first pair were a pair of ICED Trainers called " Meteora " which had lightning bolts down the side . They made me feel like a bad ass space girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I refuse to throw them away ! <p> During one of my monthly visits to the Brighton Store to pick up another pair for my collection and drain all my weekend job money I noticed a sign in the window asking for a christmas temp to join the team for the seasonal period . I HAD to apply , I never thought I would get it but what did I have to loose ! <p> Since working for Irregular Choice my collection has BOOMED ! It 's just too tempting ! You are surrounded by shoes all the time ! I think I must have around 40 pairs now from all collections . I have flats , to trainers , to skyscraper heels ... not forgetting bags , clothes and accessories too . <p> Mirror Mirror and Flop Flip <p> I think my favourite pairs are my Big Momma boots which I wear pretty much every single day . ( I bought 2 pairs in black because I wanted to have them forever and not worry about wearing them out ) . Another of my favourite pairs are my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels because they are so cool with their little planets and clouds and paper aeroplanes on the side and they have a lower heel which makes them super comfortable . <p> One Lump Or Two and Oh Ello <p> When it comes to my heels and crazier styles it has to be my " Oh Ello " Wedges which were the first pair of shoes I bought when I started working at Irregular Choice and my " One Lump or Two " heels from the Alice in Wonderland Collection , - THEY HAVE A PLATFORM THAT LOOKS LIKE CAKE ! ! ! <p> I love Irregular Choice for so many reasons , I love the colours the fabrics , the designs , the affordability compared to other brands that try and do the same ... But its all about the revolutionary designs and ideas that come bursting out of Dan Sullivan 's head . Every season you are in for a surprise . There is alway something new , something fresh to wow you and inspire you . <p> Irregular Choice changed my life . Not only do I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also have a fabulous career . Not forgetting my wonderful Irregular Family I have gained too ! @qwx23036 @qwx23038 @qwx23042 @qwx23046

But do n't hold back , you can also pair your wedges with some jeans . Wedges and skinny jeans look super stylish or try a pair of flares to play with a 70 's hippie look . <p> Wedge heels are easier to walk in , comfortable to wear and a great alternative to a stiletto style heel .

Try an enclosed- shoe boot , t-bar or strap style which will keep your foot nice and secure . <h> Skyscraper heels and Stilletos- <p> We even have something for the fierce who dare to go higher . <p> WARNING These shoes are not for the feint hearted . But there are cheats to help you raise up without discomfort . Pad the balls of your feet with an IC Insole- this extra cushioning will keep your feet happier for longer . Choose a heel with a platform . Shoes with a platform have extra height but more of a gradual slope compared to their non-platform- counterparts . We recommend Flaming June . <p> No shoe collection would be complete without a set of signature stiletto heels . They may not be the most practical of styles but they sure are sexy and guaranteed to make you stand out from the crowd . It 's fun to be bold . We recommend Tease when you 're out there to WOW .

You could n't help but notice them as they were so unlike anything else at that time . They were elaborate and frilly when minimalist and boxy was " in " . I thought they were absolutely beautiful . There was so much to look at on them , with colourful insoles and painted soles , then I turned them around and noticed embroidered steaming poo on the back . I thought it was absolutely hilarious and was hooked after that ! Taking what looked like an overly pretty shoe and potentially ' ruining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage and that 's part of what 's kept me loyal . I 've always liked unconventional and IC excel at that . They are n't afraid to push the boundaries , have fun and take it a step further and there is that " more is more " approach where they clash another print or add in another trim , but somehow it still works . They manage to give you the unexpected and have a knack of making something which on paper seems totally unappealing , completely desirable ( I never expected to fall in love with gnome heels ) ! <p> The introduction of the character heels a few years ago , really blew me away . I could n't believe that such out of this world creations could be made at an affordable price and that they would be wearable , while looking like art . We 've since had music and sounds , flashing lights and twirling ballerinas-becoming more and more ambitious and making the seemingly impossible , possible .

I love the reaction they create too ( people ca n't help but comment when you 're wearing IC ) and if the general consensus is confusion or disapproval , then I figure I ( and IC ) are doing it right ! I 'm not looking for conventional , I want unforeseen and unique . The brand have never remained stagnant , there 's constantly fresh and innovative ideas , so I 'm always so excited to see what I 'll fall in love with next . @qwx23036 @qwx23038 @qwx23042 @qwx23046

I bought them before I bought my dress or any other wedding item . <p> My style is a bit more out there and my top three favourite pairs I own are my white true love they flash and everything I am such a big kid . My midas touch disco bunnies every time I put them on I think of chocolate bunnies . And my lazy rivers iridescent as it 's my all time favourite material .
