Tourism Research Australia forecasts that Chinese tourists will be spending $20.3 billion , or around 35% of total international tourism expenditure in Australia , by 2021-22 . As tourism-related revenue in Australia continues to grow over the next five years , both airport operators and international airlines stand to benefit from growth in inbound tourist numbers . However , the extent to which these industries will benefit relies on adequate capital investment in airport infrastructure . <p> As airport operators obtain revenue on a per-passenger basis , soaring tourist numbers bode well for airports located in major hubs or near popular tourist destinations .

Nationally , an estimated 34.8 million tonnes of sugar cane will be milled for the 2015-16 season . With the harvest well underway , farmers are starting to turn their attention to growing the cane for next season . However , the 2017 season is expected to be different to other seasons . Sugar manufacturers Wilmar Sugar , MP Australia ( MSF Sugar ) and Tully Sugar are set to break away from the industry 's long-standing single-export body Queensland Sugar Limited ( QSL ) . Sugar cane growers are nervous that the split will spark price competition that will reduce their profit margins . However , Australia 's position as a price-taker in the world sugar market means the effects are unlikely to be as detrimental as expected . <p> QSL was established in 2000 to replace the Queensland Sugar Corporation , which was responsible for marketing Australian sugar to export markets . As an industry-owned marketer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar manufacturers and sugar cane growers . Following the deregulation of the industry in 2006 , QSL has operated through voluntary contracts with sugar millers . Despite the voluntary nature of the contracts , most millers continued to operate through QSL . However , in 2014 , three of the five largest sugar manufacturers announced their plans to sever ties with QSL at the end of the 2016 season . The announcement sparked strong opposition from sugar cane growers that worried that the split would spark price competition , limiting their returns . <p> In some respects , the growers ' worries are not unwarranted . Sugar cane must be processed before it can be consumed . As a result , sugar cane growers , which mostly operate on small and mid-size farms , rely on sugar manufacturers . In addition , sugar cane must be processed within sixteen hours of harvest to prevent the sugar cane juice from evaporating , which means that sugar cane growers have little choice about which mill they supply , and often have to sell to the closest one . <p> Although approximately 80% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exported , Australia accounts for around 3% only of global sugar production . Because of this , local sugar cane growers have little control over the world sugar market .

This means that despite the imminent changes , farmers are likely to receive similar prices for their cane regardless of which sugar mill they sell to , even if they ca n't choose . <p> Despite the shake-up , the sugar cane growing industry and the sugar manufacturing industry are both projected to grow in the current year as low world sugar stocks cause world sugar prices to increase . As these effects flow through to the Australian market , the sugar cane growing industry is expected to grow by 12.9% , while the sugar manufacturing industry is anticipated to grow by 19.9%.

@@22430455 @2430455/ <p> 2016 looks likely to be a better year than the one just closed , partly due to the recent FTA with China and the coming Transpacific Partnership agreement . The low Australian dollar will help , as will continuing low interest rates , and hopefully continued rises in consumer and business confidence . <p> The nation needs a number of reforms to recreate the sort of growth we have become used to over the past century or so , at 3.5% per annum . One of these is industrial relations reform of the regressive Fair Work legislation , which is more suited to our long-gone Industrial Age of pre-1965 rather than our new Infotronics Age . Another is overdue taxation reform , which has been impeded by ignorance , vested interests , politics and a severe knowledge-deficiency in finance , taxation and economics in our unrepresentative Senate . Yet another is reigniting innovation , entrepreneurship and productivity growth , although the Turnbull Government made big strides in December on these matters via the $1.0 billion innovation initiative and proposed changes to the over-penalising bankruptcy laws . <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second half of the year " which brings the nation to a pregnant pause . <p> To forecast the economy 's performance in a new calendar year , we have to start with the marketplace .

Now in the Infotronics Age , we have a market-pull economy based on services , underpinned by the utility of information and communications technology , compared with the goods-based economy underpinned by electricity and telecommunications in the Industrial Age . This market and consumer power has been further strengthened by social media , fast broadband , big data and analytics , which emerged in the second stage of ICT in 2007 " the digital disruption era . <p> The main aggregates of the market at the most recent measure by the ABS are shown in the first chart . <p> Our gross national turnover " comprised of our own gross national expenditure ( GNE ) on goods and services , plus exports ( overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time by the end of 2016 . Our GDP should nudge $1.7 trillion with real growth over 2016 of some 2.5% , compared with an estimated 2.3% in 2015 . This growth is just over a third of the growth in our region of the Asia Pacific . But better than the OECD average , dragged down by the EU . <p> Inflation , measured by the GDP deflator , may be around 1.0% or a little higher in 2016 , having been negative in 2014-15 and probably close to zero in calendar year 2015 . <p> So what is happening to our market segments " which of them are growing , stumbling or declining ? <p> Consumption expenditure is expected to be some 62.0% of the total market , and growing at a hoped-for 3.5% . Household spending is rising faster than in 2015 due to rising consumer confidence , a very popular new PM , less appetite for investment housing ( a capital item ) , and governments at federal and state levels playing their part as well . <p> Consumption expenditure has never been negative over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recession over that period . <p> Exports , accounting for some 16.0% of the market , could grow as fast as 9.0% on the back of a low Australian dollar , fast-rising inbound tourism , further growth in mining export volumes " as separate from prices " and some manufactured foodstuffs . And of course this will be helped by the new China FTA and TPP . Agriculture , if El Nino is cranky , could cut into its exports , but since agricultural products are less than 10% of total exports these days , this would do less damage than in previous decades . <p> And , as the next chart shows , export growth rarely goes negative , and has therefore not been responsible for any recession over the past six or more decades . <p> The third market segment is capital expenditure , which accounts for almost 22.0% of the marketplace . <p> As the following chart demonstrates , capital expenditure is the sole cause of recessions when growth turns severely negative in any year ( more than -8% ) . <p> Whilst the crash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of all capital expenditure at its peak in 2014 " the negative growth in the year through September 2015 for total capital expenditure was limited to -4.0% .

Business capital expenditure makes up the bulk ( near 60.0% ) of all capital expenditure , and while it is still likely to be negative in 2016 , there are signs of confidence emerging in that sector , helped by the new PM 's cajoling . <p> Indeed , the current positive for the economy is the new PM , like NZ 's John Keys , who is commercially and politically bloodied and savvy , reformist , upbeat and " so far " popular and steadying . <p> So , continued growth is expected for consumption expenditure : it has not been negative since the end of WWII .

With significant demand for beef coming from export markets , Teys has capitalised on this by increasing prices for its exported products , which has benefited company profit margins . With weak production volumes in the United States due to high feed costs , high operating costs and a prolonged drought , Teys have benefited from reduced competition in export markets .

The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement came into effect in January 2015 , immediately eliminating many tariffs on products . Other tariffs , such as those for grapes , various citrus fruits and onions , will be incrementally reduced over the course of up to 16 years .

The AER implements regulations concerning the asset bases of participants in the electricity distribution industry . Operators asset bases are directly linked to their allowable revenue and the amount they can charge other market participants for access . Expansion in assets is therefore linked to greater revenue and absolute profit for suppliers . This has been demonstrated over the past five years " at the beginning of the five-year period , the AER set asset-base regulations with the assumption of continuing growth in electricity use per capita and rising peak demand .

Energy efficiency initiatives and structural change in energy-intensive industries ( such as aluminium smelting ) have also driven the change . The resulting mismatch in network investment and centrally generated electricity usage has made the industry 's asset base surplus to requirements . This mismatch , and the accompanying political pressure , has contributed to the AER 's decision to reduce allowable revenue for electricity distributors . <p> As a result of the new regulations , revenue for the electricity distribution industry is expected to be constrained , and will grow at a more subdued rate over the next five years .

As an estimated 4.9 million students returned to school and higher education , the funding flows into the education and training sector shifted . The Coalition and the Australian Labor Party have fiercely debated the Gonski model and education reform . While this debate continues , policies remain in place to increase federal school funding , partly through moving spending away from higher education . <p> Funding shifts are only beginning in 2014 . The Federal Government is increasing its role within the primary and secondary school education systems through the Gonski model . IBISWorld forecasts strong growth in the public and private schools industries over the next four years , with the potential for higher growth if the final two years of the Gonski model are implemented . In contrast , higher education is being pushed towards a user-pays system , as funding per student declines . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still place budgetary pressures on the Federal Government , and surging student enrolments will boost revenue for the university and other higher education industry over the next five years . Funding flows to schools <p> The Federal Government has adapted Labor 's Gonski model by shortening the funding timetable by two years to run from 2013-14 to 2016-17 and removing the state and territory governments ' co-contribution obligations . These changes will result in significantly less funding for schools in the five years through 2018-19 than under Labor 's package . By cutting two years from the timetable , the Federal Government is projected to save $7.0 billion . Within schooling , outcomes are likely to vary between the private and public systems because of the locked-in federal funding for the private system and uncertain state-dependent funding for the public system . Funding arrangements following the four-year period are yet to be announced . <p> Baseline funding for government schools is forecast to increase by an annualised 8.3% over the next five years , to total $6.2 billion in 2018-19 .

The Federal Government has removed requirements for the states and territories to provide their share of the proposed Gonski increases , but if they do not contribute the required funding , a significant proportion of schools will continue to operate below the SRS target . <p> The SRS is the central plank of the Gonski model . It is a funding metric designed to improve the outcomes of underperforming student groups , which is an attempt to improve Australia 's productivity by increasing the skills of the future workforce .

IBISWorld estimates that revenue generated by government schools will rise at a higher rate over the next five years than what was expected under previous funding arrangements . This is based on the assumption that the states and territories will continue to contribute their share in baseline funding as well as matching the 35.0% of Gonski increases .

This is expected to offset any negative price effects caused by the creation of a second export channel . Furthermore , global consumption of sugar is forecast to increase over the next five years . Rising populations and income growth in countries such as China and India , along with the increasing westernisation of diets in such countries , are anticipated to drive sugar consumption upwards . This will further stimulate demand for sugar cane , promoting revenue growth and higher profit margins for growers .

Major bookselling chains Borders and Angus &amp; Robertson closed their doors in 2011 , though web-retailing operations were maintained . Local retailers , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low prices and extensive range of foreign web giants like Amazon and the Book Depository . The advent of e-books , particularly with the take-up of e-readers and tablets , has encouraged online purchases , which are inexpensive and immediate . <p> However , as the Australian dollar declines in value , more consumers are making their book purchases from local online retailers . Australian companies like Booktopia and Bookworld have expanded , and their economies of scale and declining per-unit costs have allowed them to pass savings on to customers . This , combined with the falling Australian dollar , has made local online retailers increasingly popular . The online book retailing industry is expected to benefit strongly from the depreciating dollar , the continued popularity of e-books and the growing scale of participants . The industry is forecast to record strong growth of an annualised 14.5% in the five years through 2018-19 . <p> Online apparel retailing is entering a similar phase . Clothing retailing in Australia declined by an estimated 0.9% annualised in the five years through 2013-14- ( the online operations of bricks-and-mortar stores are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to offset the decline ) . Many consumers have turned away from physical stores , preferring to compare prices across a broader range of apparel online . Overseas retailers , with established brands and websites and lower prices , were the main beneficiaries of the move to online clothing shopping . The UK-based ASOS , for example , has dominated online clothing sales from overseas in the past five years . In 2013 , the company was sending four jumbo jets of stock to Australia per week . However , local online retailers like The Iconic have been building strong brands and loyal customer bases . Assisted by the lower Australian dollar , companies like The Iconic and Surfstitch have started to thrive , while ASOS has recently reported falling Australian sales . Australian online men 's clothing sales are expected to grow by an annualised 9.7% over the five years though 2018-19 . The online women 's clothing sales industry is forecast to record similar growth , though off a considerably higher base . <p> Bookselling and clothing retailing are just two industries where local online retailers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A vast number of retailers , both pure-play and traditional bricks-and-mortar , have entered the online space in the past five years .

Conditions are ideal for local online retailers , and all signs indicate that strong growth will continue .

@@22430543 @2430543/ <p> As election day approaches , IBISWorld weighs in on key Labor and Coalition policies " and the industries they will affect . <p> The economyThe 2013 Federal Government election will be dominated by concerns about the economy . The end of the mining investment boom and the continued decline of the manufacturing sector have set a pessimistic tone among Australian businesses . The Labor Government has taken a glass half full ' approach , pointing out Australia 's strong economic position relative to other advanced economies and successful economic guidance during the global financial crisis . In contrast , the Coalition points out a widening Federal Budget deficit , a declining economic growth rate , low business confidence and a weak economic performance relative to neighbouring countries . The winner of the election will have to balance the government 's role to provide fiscal stimulus and counter-cyclical spending with budget responsibility and a plan to reduce government debt . The Coalition intends to reform government regulations to reduce red-tape costs to businesses while repealing the carbon and mining taxes . The biggest expenditure pledged by the Coalition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2015 , which will cost $5 billion over the next four years . Pledges are to be paid for by reducing unnecessary government spending , increasing efficiency in the public sector and making changes to the National Broadband Network ( NBN ) . The Productivity Commission has estimated that there are $12 billion worth of cost-cutting and efficiency savings available to the Federal Government . The- Coalition has backed away from providing a date for a return to surplus , but asserts it will be sooner than a Labor- surplus . Labor has announced a fast-tracked plan to convert the carbon tax into an emissions trading scheme , which is expected to result in a large fall in the carbon price , reducing the cost to businesses and households . This will not stimulate the economy by as much as the Coalition 's full repeal of the carbon tax , but will have a smaller impact on government revenue . The reduction in government revenue will be paid for by making changes to the Fringe Benefits Tax ( FBT ) for company-provided cars . The FBT change will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automotive industry to protect car makers from the expected reduction in demand for new cars . Labor will pay for downward revisions to government revenue forecasts by increasing the excise tax on tobacco . Labor forecasts a return to budget surplus in 2016-17 , driven by savings made during 2015-16 and 2016-17 when the economy is expected to be in a healthier state than it is presently . <p> Workplace reform Labor plans to have a hands on ' approach in the labour market , actively helping to create jobs , with an emphasis on the manufacturing sector . Subsidies to the automotive industry and regulating work for Australian businesses in large projects form the core of Labor 's policy . Labor 's Australian Industry Participation Plan will regulate an emphasis on Australian companies being involved in large-scale projects . The Coalition will do the opposite , reducing subsidies for uncompetitive industries such as the automotive industry , and reforming workplace regulations to encourage hiring . The Coalition 's repeal of the carbon tax will directly and indirectly reduce a wide range of costs for Australian firms , allowing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to have a more immediate effect on employment . While removing regulatory restrictions on job growth and business development will be cheaper and more sustainable in the long run than subsidies and regulation , it will take time . In the long run Labor 's policies might create inefficiencies in the Australian economy and discourage foreign investment . <p> Energy The two major policies that will affect the performance of the electricity supply sector are changes to the Clean Energy Future Plan and the treatment of the Renewable Energy Target ( RET ) . Australia has had renewable energy targets since 2001 . The current RET compels large energy users to invest in renewable energy , to the benefit of industries such as wind and , to an extent , hydro-electricity generation . The RET introduces more capacity into electricity markets and pushes down wholesale electricity prices , which challenges fossil fuel electricity generators . Changes to the RET will affect these industries directly and their upstream industries , such as oil and gas extraction , brown coal mining and black coal mining , indirectly . Labor is committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with 2000 levels , and an 80% reduction on 2000 levels by 2050 . Labor has announced an early transition from the carbon tax to an emissions trading scheme in July 2014 , rather than 2015 . This means that carbon dioxide equivalent would have a floating price that is linked to the prices of the European Union 's emissions trading scheme . Under such a policy , the per tonne price for carbon dioxide equivalent emissions is likely to be much lower than would otherwise be the case . The impact of an earlier move to a trading scheme on the industry assistance packages included within the Clean Energy Future Plan is uncertain . The tax cuts given to consumers will remain in place . Labor supports the current 20% RET and has made a commitment to not review the target until 2016 . The Coalition is committed to a 5% to- 25% reduction of emissions by 2020 compared with 2000 levels , and will review this commitment in 2015 . The Coalition intends to wind back many of the provisions of the Clean Energy Future Plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy Finance Corporation , the Climate Change Authority , the Climate Commission and the Energy Security Fund . The consequences for assistance package commitments made to industries are uncertain . The Coalition supports a 20% RET , which it will review in 2014 . The earlier review may increase the perceived uncertainty around investment in the electricity supply sector . The Coalition intends to expand the existing Emissions Reduction Fund to introduce a buyback . There are also plans to expand the Carbon Farming Initiative to achieve emissions reductions in the absence of an explicit carbon price . Changes to the Clean Energy Future Plan will create new winners and losers across energy-intensive industries . Labor 's changes maintain a pricing mechanism as a strategy to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions . This policy direction has been in place since the Howard Government and so is understood by industry . The Coalition 's plans to meet emissions commitments will be more disruptive to electricity supply industries and their downstream industries . <p> Resources The future of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax ( MRRT ) and gas policy are the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oil and gas extraction industry is forecast to grow strongly in the next five years , in part by using controversial new technologies such as fracking to access existing resources . Growing investment is expected to directly benefit the petroleum exploration industry , oil and gas extraction industry , and a number of- construction and mining support service industries . The issue of gas reservation " that is , reserving a portion of gas output for domestic consumption " has been raised by large gas users on the eastern seaboard . Currently gas reservation polices are only in place in Western Australia , where they were one of the conditions of approval for the North West Shelf Project . As domestic gas prices are lower than world gas prices , expansion of gas reservation policies could deter future investment in the industry . Conversely , sudden increases in energy costs could affect a range of energy-intensive manufacturing industries . Labor supports the MRRT and the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax ( PRRT ) . The MRRT is a 22.5% tax on profit that applies to iron ore and coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached . The MRRT includes a 40% PRRT , which applies to all onshore and offshore oil and gas projects . The PRRT came into effect in 1988 and was extended in 2010 to cover all onshore projects , including the North West Shelf , oil shale and coal seam gas projects. - Coal seam gas developments are supported by the party , subject to approvals , as are oil shale developments . Labor does not support gas reservation polices . The Coalition intends to get rid of the MRRT but keep the expanded PRRT in place . Reflecting the position of the National Party , the Coalition supports coal seam gas developments , subject to approvals . It has an additional caveat : that landholders agree to developments when they are on prime agricultural land . The Coalition supports oil shale developments .

Both parties support the development of gas reserves in the Bowen Basin in the Kimberley , subject to approvals .

While download speeds , costs , technology and design are key differences between the Labor and Coalition plans , the parties agree that broadband speed and availability can be greatly improved across Australia . The Labor Government has already begun to build the NBN , with rollouts commencing in key metropolitan and rural areas . Full completion is expected in 2021 . Labor prices building the NBN , which will involve overhauling the existing copper network system through a series of fibre-to-the-premises upgrades , at $44.1 billion . The scheme is anticipated to allow potential download speeds of up to one gigabit per second , with full utilisation of fibre to connect homes , businesses and rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is planned to be distributed through universal pricing under a government-owned monopoly wholesale network . Conversely , the Coalition has vehemently promoted its own version of the NBN following a spate of rollout difficulties and connection issues suffered under Labor . Under the Coalition 's proposal , the NBN is expected to be priced at just $29.5 billion and take two years less to build . Maximum speeds of 100 megabits per second are anticipated through utilising a fibre-to-the-node approach , connecting fibre to neighbourhood cabinets and using copper to connect homes and businesses . Under the Coalition 's plan , competition will be encouraged , with wholesale prices determined by the ACCC . A number of unknown factors remain , including the commercial feasibility and potential usefulness of achieving such high download speeds under Labor 's NBN , the ageing of the copper network system and how to continue on from current operations if the Coalition comes into power . <p> Transport infrastructure Both Labor and the Coalition have pledged support for many substantial infrastructure projects across Australia , which is highly dependent on road and rail transport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident-prone Bruce Highway in north Queensland , with the Coalition pledging $6.7 billion over 10 years , which is $2.6 billion more than Labor . However , Labor is expected to commit an extra $300 million to Sydney 's WestConnex project to link the M4 and M5 motorways on the condition that an extra link to the CBD is created . Other projects include the Gateway Motorway in Queensland , F3/M2 link in New South Wales , South Road in South Australia and Midland Highway in Tasmania , all of which are expected to receive similar funding pledges from both parties . In terms of rail , Labor has argued the Federal Government should contribute to urban rail systems while the Coalition maintains that state and region-based urban rail systems are not the responsibility of the Federal Government . Also on the agenda for both parties is the proposal of a high-speed rail network across Australia . Despite mutual agreement on the economic benefits of high-speed rail , public funding would be difficult to attract and construction would likely take several decades . <p> Manufacturing Australia 's manufacturing sector is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties are concerned about the diminishing health of manufacturing in Australia , but their policies on how to revive the sector differ . Debates tend to be approached from four vantage points : anti-dumping , industrial relations , regulation and access to energy and resources . Dumping occurs when an exporter sells goods in a foreign country below the cost of manufacturing them in a domestic country . Labor has established the Anti-Dumping Commission , while the Coalition aims to make changes to the Customs Amendment Bill 2013 and impose Australian standards on imported goods . This is designed to further protect the local manufacturing industries . Regulation of the sector is also under the spotlight . Both parties agree on cutting down the red tape associated with manufacturing . However , how each will achieve this is not specified. - The Labor Government attempted a cut in corporate taxes , which was to be funded by the mining tax . Since the returns from the mining tax were lower than expected , the cut was scrapped . The Coalition has promised to cut the corporate tax by 1.5% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse the cuts made to R&amp;D tax concessions for businesses with revenue of over $20 billion . Both parties aim to increase the participation level of domestic manufacturers in local projects . Labor plans to introduce a policy whereby government projects in excess of $500 million will have to demonstrate that they gave local companies a chance to bid for tenders . Additionally , international companies with projects over $2 billion will have to include domestic suppliers in their operations . The Coalition aims to introduce an approach that is based more on tender , hoping to encourage small business participation . Australia 's automotive industry will be the focal point of policy debate concerning the manufacturing sector during the lead-up to the election . Both major parties support at least some level of subsidies for automotive manufacturers . Labor has pledged to increase the level of subsidies but to make changes to Fringe Benefits Tax advantages for company cars . These changes will have an adverse effect on the domestic automotive industry , but Labor plans to compensate the industry with a further $200 million worth of subsidies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalition plans to cut subsidies to the automotive industry by $500 million , reducing the total subsidies to $2 billion between 2011 and 2020 . However , the Coalition will not change the Fringe Benefits Tax for company cars . <p> Education The key education policy of the election is the Better Schools Plan . Otherwise known as the Gonski reforms , the plan will affect private and government schools . The Gonski review , commissioned in 2010 , found that under existing funding arrangements , some schools and students were missing out on necessary resources . While Australia 's schools rank highly compared with other developed countries , overall standards have been gradually declining over the past decade , with the gap between the highest and lowest performing students widening . In response to the recommendations outlined in the Gonski review , the Labor Government developed the Better Schools Plan , which will be implemented in 2014 . Funding will be based on a benchmark amount per student with a base amount of $9,271 per primary school student and $12,193 per high school student . In an attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students from low socioeconomic backgrounds , indigenous students , students with limited English skills and students with a disability . The plan aims to improve the results of all Australian schools and students , particularly in reading , maths and science . So far , New South Wales , the Australian Capital Territory , South Australia , Tasmania and Victoria have signed up to the education reforms . The government was unable to reach an agreement with Western Australia , Queensland and the Northern Territory before calling the election . Regardless of which political party is voted into power , the jurisdictions that have agreed to the Better Schools Plan will receive 65% of funding from the Federal Government , with the remaining 35% to be provided by the participating states and territories . There is a key point of difference between Labor and Coalition policies on education reform . If Labor is re-elected , the states and territory that have refused to sign up to the reforms will not receive the extra funding allocated to the Better Schools Plan , and will instead be funded under the old system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jurisdictions regardless of whether they have agreed to the plan , and these states will not be required to contribute funds of their own . Labor has committed $9.8 billion in Federal Government funding towards the Better Schools Plan over six years , with an additional $5.1 billion to be provided by the states and territories . The majority of funds will be invested in- the final two years of the period . The Labor Government has stated that its goal is to have Australian schools ranked in- the top five countries internationally by 2025 . Despite initially opposing changes to the Australian school funding system , the Coalition has largely agreed to support the plan . However , it has proposed to honour the Gonski agreements for only four years , instead of six , and has committed to investing just $2.8 billion to the reforms . At this stage , there has been no announcement regarding investment in education following the four-year period . If Labor wins the election , private and government schools combined will stand to benefit from nearly $10 billion in additional funding from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in the Better Schools Plan . However , it is unclear whether the Coalition will provide funding to schools in other ways .

This desire to increase airport capacity has been welcomed by airlines and local communities . Combined with the expected relaxing of airport taxes in the long term , a new Sydney airport would boost local industries and bring new opportunities to airlines . The domestic airline industry currently faces intense competition and capacity constraints . Continual competitive pressures to reduce prices and higher airport taxes due to capacity constraints are expected to be the main limitations to industry growth . <p> In 2012-13 , Virgin Australia acquired Skywest Airlines and a 60% stake in Tiger Airways .

Statutory profit after tax for the Qantas Group totalled $6.0 million in 2012-13 . This poor profit figure is expected to be largely due to heavy operational costs because of overcapacity at key national airports like Kingsford Smith in Sydney . Nevertheless , the domestic airlines industry is projected to grow at an annualised 3.7% to $16.1 billion due to resurgence in inbound tourists and a recent fall in the Australian dollar . <p> In light of the change in government , IBISWorld anticipates that a second Sydney airport would provide ample room for growth in the capacity-constrained domestic airlines industry .

These include global companies like Airbnb and Uber , in addition to local players like Airtasker , Open Shed and websites like Gumtree . The sharing economy involves consumers using their private property and time to make extra money , or gain value from possessions , by leasing them to others . Through these platforms , consumers can be paid for providing services to other consumers , such as offering a spare room for a night , giving someone a lift , or lending a lawnmower . This new way of extracting value out of consumers ' private property has presented new competition for some industries , particularly transport and accommodation industries . <p> Uber , a car-sharing platform , has been the most controversial sharing economy app to date , as its services compete with established taxi service providers .

@@22430572 @2430572/ <p> The purpose of an economy is to provide needed or wanted goods and services to a nation 's population . In Australia in 2014 , this means 24 million people in 9.3 million households . <p> Only a few centuries ago , most goods and services were produced on a do-it-yourself ( DIY ) basis within households . But with outsourcing , we have created over 500 classes of industry to do it for us , and work in one of them to earn the money to buy these goods and services . Nowadays , of all the goods and services produced ( our GDP ) and imported " totalling $1.9 trillion " some 59% goes to households . A further 22% goes into capital expenditure for the future and 19% goes to other countries as our exports . So households are the biggest market by far : no surprise there . <p> But the statistics on household finances do provide some surprises , whether expressed as averages or ranges . Averages are always just that , and they can disguise the often polarised distribution of all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , both the averages and the distributions tell us a lot when it comes to household incomes and how we spend them , our wealth and our taxes . <p> Starting with average household income and spending , the first chart shows the picture in 2014 . The first surprise is the average income , a staggering $145,400 across the nation 's 9.3 million households . <p> The total income across all households is around $1.4 trillion , which is made up of wages , mixed incomes ( of unincorporated businesses ) , investment incomes , welfare payments , transfer payments , other incomes and the imputed rent value of home ownership . We will return later to look at the polarised distribution of these incomes between the rich and poor . <p> Savings , including superannuation , are currently around 7% of income . Savings were negative through the middle of the last decade , well before the impact of the global financial crisis at the tail end of the decade , which was a wake-up call to recalcitrant and spendthrift households .

In the case of imputed rent , the Australian Bureau of Statistics treats home owners as investors that earn ' and pay ' a rent to themselves . <p> Non-durables , being retail spending on goods consumed within the year , are the single biggest outlay at about 17% of total income . <p> But in 2014 , we are spending more on outsourced household services and functions ( $34,600 per household ) than on non-durables . Such outsourced services include meals , holidays , cleaning , child minding , entertainment , financial advice , health services ( once done at home , usually by mum ) , gardening , car maintenance and a myriad of other chores and functions . <p> The Industrial Age of DIY household functions and chores is now a distant memory for many households in the new age of service providers .

Of course , the four-fifths of income spent on services includes taxes ( returned to us as health , education and other services ) , capital related products ( interest on housing and other loans ) and financial services . <p> The second chart reveals the extraordinary change in the way we spend our incomes compared with the past . <p> There have been many changes over the past 12 decades . They begin with the dramatic reduction in the proportion of spending on goods , from 62% of total incomes down to almost one-third of that at 21% . This fall has been due to lower real prices through manufacturing productivity , cheaper imports and approaching consumer saturation . <p> A second stand-out change has been the increase in direct taxes , from a modest 2% of incomes in 1900 to 14% today , not including indirect taxes ( e.g. GST ) embedded in other items . As mentioned earlier , these taxes are returned in the form of services such as health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welfare and more . And in large measure they benefit the lower income households . <p> Savings have been lumpy " sometimes negative - " and rarely at the desirable level of 10% to 12% of gross incomes that can ensure a dignified and comfortable retirement of around one-third of average household incomes . <p> Nevertheless , the wealth , or net worth , of households has continued to climb . In the middle of 2013 , total household wealth was $7.4 trillion or around $750,000 per household on average across the young and old , rich and poor cohorts . <p> For the first time in living memory , property " in the form of homes , investment housing and other property " dropped below half this average net worth in favour of superannuation and other financial products ( e.g. shares and deposits ) . This is a positive in terms of income generation . <p> All this begs the question : what is the distribution of incomes , wealth and taxes across the nation 's households ? <p> The final chart adds to the reality check of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this polarisation is not quite as extreme as it might appear when incomes are equivalised by adding government benefits to the lower income households . Of course , it is always important to remember that a lot of the poor ' households are inhabited by students , inbound visa holders and religious workers , and not just the unemployed or pensioners . <p> Interestingly , the polarisation has increased only marginally over more than a decade , unlike other developed nations such as the United States . Further , the polarisation is far less than most in the OECD , and other developing economies for that matter . <p> And while the richest and well-off quintiles are dominant in incomes and wealth , they are taxed much more heavily , as the chart highlights .

@@22430579 @2430579/ <p> Unemployment can be soul destroying , especially for those responsible for a complete household 's welfare . In the 20th century , governments finally took responsibility for those without a job . The dole was a term used to cover the work provided by state governments in the 1930s in the form of public works , and it provided some sustenance and dignity to the needy . <p> Over a decade later in 1945 , the chiefly Labor Government formalised unemployment relief at the federal level . At around a fifth of the average wage or less , it was arguably all our taxes could afford in the 1940s and 1950s . It is higher today , but still just under a quarter . <p> Unemployment in Australia is cyclical but these cycles are not necessarily of equal length . The worst peaks have coincided with depressions in the 1840s , 1890s , 1930s and during the Federal Labor Government in the 1990s . The peaks averaged 50 years apart but actually ranged from 38 years to 61 years apart . <p> The last three peaks are shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , 1932 ( 17.6% ) and 1992 ( almost 11% ) . The 1930s figure is often disputed , largely due to unemployment among union members , which was much higher than the overall labour force average . The worst depression and unemployment in the nation 's history was not , as many claim , in the Great Depression of the 1930s . It was in the 15 year period from 1892 to 1906 . <p> However , the longest and most disgraceful period of unemployment in our history was more recent , from 1977 to 2005 : an almost three-decade long elongated depression . <p> Unlike previous depressions , the cause of the more recent unemployment cycle was due to bloody-mindedness by unions ( opposing work sharing ) , businesses ( working hours and other rigidities ) and governments ( binding IR regulations ) . So all three share the blame . <p> The current upsurge since 2009 has corresponded with the GFC but not with a recession in Australia ; we have n't had one since 1992 , nearly a quarter of a century ago . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Clearly , the Work Choices legislation under the Howard Coalition Government worked , restoring full employment to the nation . But politics and scare-mongering saw that legislation replaced with Fair Work Australia , which has re-rigidified the IR arena , as in the three decades up to 2005 . And that legislation is treated as a hot potato by the current Coalition government , which refuses to re-visit and reform the legislation . <p> The US has restored full employment , arguably with overly-free labour force regulations . If so , where is the middle ground ? <p> The good news is that we currently employ 49.0% of the nation 's 24 million population . That remains close to our record-high level of several years ago , and way higher than the 40.0% of the 1960s when we had virtually no unemployment as the above exhibit shows . <p> However , the jobs are in vastly different places than 50 years ago . The exhibit below reminds us that service industries now dominate , as they do throughout the developed world . <p> In 1960 , manufacturing alone accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 7.1% !

This will make it one of the largest privatisations of the past five years . A large portion of these funds is expected to go towards new infrastructure projects . The efficient allocation of funds is crucial , since Medibank also generates substantial profits ( NPBT of $315.0 million in 2012-13 ) , an income stream that the Federal Government will lose once the insurer is privatised . <p> The privatisation of Medibank has prompted discussion regarding its implications for the Australian health system .

It is further argued that premium prices could be controlled via competitive pressures .

Opponents of privatisation argue that due to the misalignment of incentives of the public and the private sector , private companies will prioritise profitability over the quality of community service provision . <p> This means that essential , but loss-making services may disappear once the government privatises its assets . An example of this trade-off was evident during the privatisation of Qantas . As a state-owned airline , it serviced many routes to regional communities . Generally , these routes are economically unviable due to low demand . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be shut down when the company was privatised , which would have been detrimental to regional communities . The situation was resolved through an agreement by the government to subsidise the newly privatised Qantas on these vital routes . Privatisation of assets may also carry some economic pitfalls . All is well if the proceeds from the sale flow into new investment projects . However , if they are instead used to pay out benefits and fund temporary social programs , there is effectively no recycling of capital . <p> Recent developments <p> The National Commission of Audit proposed that the Federal Government privatise a number of large companies that provide important services . A sample of the enterprises , and the IBISWorld industry reports that contextualise their performance , is in the following table . <p> Where would- the money go ? <p> Where the money goes is important . The proceeds from the sale of Medibank Private have been earmarked for the Federal Government 's Asset Recycling Initiative . Under the initiative , the Federal Government will provide a bonus of 15.0% of the selling price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the proceeds are used to fund further infrastructure projects . To be eligible for funding , state and territory governments must invest the funds in projects that demonstrate a clear cost benefit , that enhance productivity in the long run and that enhance the involvement of the private sector in infrastructure funding . <p> This initiative is designed to spark a wave of investment in new projects across Australia , and increase the role of the private sector in operating existing assets . If state and territory governments can qualify for all of the $5.0 billion allocated to the Asset Recycling Initiative , close to $40 billion will be spent on infrastructure in the coming years , to the benefit of businesses in advisory and construction industries . <p> State and territory governments with a mandate to privatise assets are likely to be the first to access these funds . The system that the Federal Government has put in place appears to apply on a first-come , first-served basis . States and territories could miss the benefits of the initiative if they do not have suitable assets to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will benefit ? <p> The immediate beneficiaries from the use of the sale proceeds are expected to be professional service firms . Both the private and public sector are expected to turn to expertise in the following industries to pave the way for asset sales and identify the business cases for new projects : <p> As funds from federal ( and subsequently state ) privatisations start to flow into new projects , the Construction division is expected to be the primary beneficiary . The bulk of this work is expected to fall outside of the next five years , due to the long lead-time required for major projects . <p> In the medium term , Australia Post is another privatisation target . The organisation is Australia 's largest logistics company , employing just under 37,000 people including sub-contractors and turning over $6.4 billion in 2013-14 . The company was formed at a time when letters were the dominant form of communication in the economy , and Australia Post 's services were considered essential . After decades of stable growth as a regulated natural monopoly , Australia Post 's business model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years . Business and social communication have migrated online , and demand for the company 's core service , letter delivery , has declined . Letter delivery has changed from a profit centre to a loss maker , as the company is mandated to provide frequent delivery services to a wide network even as volumes decline. - <p> Australia Post has adjusted its strategy to move with the times , investing heavily into parcel delivery services , which are outside of its community service mandate . Australia Post , in competition with the private sector , has managed to generate profit from these activities . Nevertheless , letter delivery activities are forecast to contribute an increasingly smaller share of revenue and larger share of loss . As Australia Post increasingly focuses on providing parcel services , the need for government ownership will weaken . In 2014 , calls for privatisation of postal services are growing . <p> Privatisation <p> In 2014-15 , the combined market for postal and courier services is expected to be worth $11.6 billion . It is expected to expand to be worth $12.7 billion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on the structure of the sale . The business operates under community service obligations that dictate the size of the delivery network and the frequency of delivery . These features of Australia Post are likely to be unattractive to the private sector , as they are unprofitable . <p> To maximise the value of the entity in a future sale , the frequency of delivery or the size of the distribution network could be altered . The viability of reducing the number of delivery points has increased in recent years , as internet coverage in regional areas has improved . Additionally , the company could be permitted to offer tiered delivery services , similar to the current express/normal services , where users could be charged a premium for more frequent services . <p> Another option is partial privatisation . Australia Post currently aggregates postal items from collection points into distribution centres , before sending them through the delivery network . Other countries , such as the United Kingdom , have attempted to introduce competition in delivery networks that were run as regulated monopolies . This opened Royal Mail up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precursor to privatising the delivery part of the business . <p> A final option is the sale of Australia Post 's profitable activities that are outside of the company 's regulated monopoly services . The challenge with such a sale would be in managing the relationship of the existing network of retail post offices " which operate in a way similar to franchises " with the new entity . <p> Australia Post currently has a major advantage in the size of its network , which generally makes it the most convenient option for consumers . The structure of this network may present challenges during privatisation . The company 's retail network is dominated by licensed post offices ( LPO ) , which account for over 65% of establishments . LPOs have a franchise-like relationship with Australia Post , which introduces a degree of uncertainty as to the value of the network . Any potential buyer that valued the size of the current network would need to find a way to work with current LPO owners , many of whom provide postal services alongside other activities such newsagency operation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more transparent competition in parcel delivery . A private operator could have more flexibility to trial new products or adopt practices from overseas . Cheaper or more efficient parcel services would lower transaction costs for growing areas of the digital economy , such as online retailers . <p> Telecommunications companies could be big winners , as a reduction in the service quality of mail is likely to accelerate the adoption of internet-based services and use of their products . <p> Some households and businesses still rely on hard-copy delivery of information like bills and invoices . These users could be adversely affected by a reduction in services . Those in areas of low population density " generally rural or regional users " would be most exposed , as their services are the least profitable to provide. - <p> Existing employees could struggle , as new operators are likely to try to improve labour efficiency . The sub-contractors who currently work for Australia Post in areas like delivery have highly transferable skills , and so are likely to be absorbed by the larger Integrated Logistics sector. -

As the supermarket price war rages on with no clear winner emerging , liquor retailing may yet play a key role for the two giants in their battle for market-share supremacy . Woolworths currently holds the advantage over Wesfarmers in a segment with opportunities for growth . IBISWorld expects revenue from the liquor retailing industry to increase by an annualised 3.3% over the five years through 2013-14 , to total $17.7 billion . <p> So far , Woolworths has clearly had the advantage in liquor retailing . Woolworths warehouse brand Dan Murphys and bottle shop brand BWS have both outperformed their Wesfarmers counterparts ( 1st- Choice Liquor- and Vintage Cellars/Liquorland respectively ) . This is evident in the companies financial results : Woolworths enjoys a significant lead in liquor retailing , with revenue totaling $6.8 billion versus Wesfarmers $3.2 billion for 2012-13 .

During 2012-13 , Woolworths opened 54 liquor outlets to Wesfarmers 45 . Woolworths has effectively used its established brands and economies of scale to bring in greater income from liquor sales . An advantage in this sector is significant , with liquor sales making up over 17% of Woolworths $40.2 billion food and liquor segment revenue in 2012-13 . Of Wesfarmers food and liquor segment revenue of $35.8 billion , only 9% is attributable to liquor sales . <p> Over the past five years , alcohol consumption per capita has declined by 5.6% . In spite of this trend , the alcohol retailing industry has enjoyed a steady increase in size .

Independents , including IGA Liquor outlets , are staying viable through membership with Independent Brands Australia , a coalition body that uses bulk purchases to keep costs down for members . Competition will also come from international , low-price alternatives such as Aldi and Costco , as they further penetrate the liquor retailing market .

@@22430658 @2430658/ <p> Manufacturing has faced a series of debilitating shocks over the past few decades . Protectionism has been diluted , subsidies have become scarce or begrudgingly extended , economies of scale in North Asia 's emerging economies have been added to the already-existing competition from Japan and Korea , and the global financial crisis-induced overvalued Australian dollar has been the last straw for many sectors . <p> The first chart highlights the enormous power of the Chinese economy , adding to the industrial power of Japan and Korea . <p> China now accounts for half the world 's manufacturing and has a standard of living around one-eighth of Australia 's , which means we are uncompetitive with our cost structure and our small volumes ( lack of economies of scale ) .

And yet , the car parts manufacturing and car assembly industries have been shedding over 2,600 jobs per annum , on average , for the past decade . In that time , Mitsubishi has ceased manufacturing , and now Ford is following . Perhaps there will be no car manufacturing by the end of the first quarter of this century , or even this decade . If so , most of the remaining 30,000 jobs in parts and assembly ( after Ford 's manufacturing closure ) would be lost . <p> Our manufacturing industry at large has been losing , on average , 8,800 workers per year since its peak of 1.2 million employees in December 1989 . All told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the same time " almost a quarter of a century " the nation has created 3.9 million new jobs ( almost 19 times more jobs than those lost from manufacturing ) , at a rate of 13,640 per month .

It is n't in wealth creation , standard of living or defence terms . <p> Manufacturing has stirred passion ever since the early 1900s , when two fledgling parties in the national parliament " the Free Traders and the Protectionists " fought bitterly on the issue of protecting manufacturing to obviate imports from Mother England and create new jobs in the new federation of states , although mostly in Victoria and New South Wales as it turned out . The Free Traders lost and merged with their opposition to create the Fusion Party . <p> So protectionism won , as it had done in many other countries around the world , until the 1970s in Australia when the Whitlam ALP Government began the painful dismantling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now begun to threaten economic growth and productivity , and inhibit the emergence of new growth industries and new jobs in the new age that was on its way to supplanting the industrial age . <p> Subsidies ( fiscal morphine ) have nevertheless continued to the present day , dispensed by both sides of politics . Ironically , the recipients in the case of the car industry have still run losses for years , and the workers still lose their jobs in the long run . So are there any winners , other than politicians ? The subsidies did n't revive the patient , just dulled the pain . <p> Passion , jingoism and lobbying are part and parcel of a modern democracy . If nothing else , this tests politicians ' ability to deal rationally with an issue and determine whether votes or statesmanship are the order of the day .

And in 2013 , the nation has the highest labour force participation rate since the end of the Convict Era over 150 years ago , with over 50% of the entire population ( men , women and minors ) currently employed ! So much for the scare tactics . <p> The immoral part of subsidies and protectionism is two-fold : they rob the nation of using scarce capital to grow new industries faster ( and create jobs faster ) , and they rob ageing workers of time to reskill themselves .

Do we have to be so slow to understand the simple issues involved , or exercise political capitulation so often ? <p> The fourth chart reminds us that there are always new industries to take the place of the old , including the iconic old ones . <p> The quaternary services sector now accounts for 47% of our GDP and most of our jobs . It pays higher wages " on average " than the old secondary or tertiary sectors , and would normally beat the primary sector except during price and wage booms like the recent one . And the quinary services sector is on its way to adding to this new age of growth by the middle of the century . <p> The hoary old chestnut that Australia must preserve and develop skills in some manufacturing via preserving inefficient , expensive and often incompetent production of motor vehicles , naval vessels and heavy equipment to aid defence is simply to fail to understand how a nation best defends itself in the 21st century , especially in our fast-growing Asia-Pacific region . And defence equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is just plain silly . <p> No , manufacturing is n't dying : it is just being rationalised , at long last .

We are humans , not robots . <p> But to try and preserve the status quo is to damn ourselves and our children to a static or falling standard of living as we force down wages to compete with poorer countries and join them ! <p> That is a daft idea : the future is too prospective to settle for regression .

Dairy manufacturers are forecast to generate revenue of $11.5 billion in 2013-14 . With domestic demand growing mainly in line with population growth , manufacturers have struggled to increase revenue through product innovation in the past five years . The poor weather conditions of the past decade have also affected the industry , with reduced returns limiting investment incentives . While dairy manufacturers have long structured their operations to supply a mature domestic market , the industry is entering a period of transition as export markets grow . Over the past 12 months alone , declines in global production compared with consumption have resulted in appreciation in the world price of dairy . IBISWorld forecasts Australian dairy product export revenue will grow at an annualised 5.2% over the five years through 2018-19 , driven largely by growth in Asia-Pacific markets . Domestic and international players are fighting to position themselves to supply these export markets with Australian dairy products , and this trend has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Butter ( WCB ) . In WCB , bidders see the potential to increase industry revenue through research and development , capital investment in domestic production and improved export strategies .

However , new export markets are expected to change the face of the domestic industry . <p> Export opportunities Over the next five years , China is expected to firmly establish itself as one of the largest export markets for the Australian dairy industry . The wave of modernisation in China means millions of Chinese are becoming middle class and are moving towards Western dietary patterns . The surge in dairy demand is largely due to higher levels of income and the growing acceptance of dairy as a staple in the Chinese diet . The burgeoning growth of China 's middle class poses the opportunity to tap into a- demographic that is estimated at 500 million people . At the moment , China represents the largest opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whole milk powders globally . Continuing growth in demand for dairy products in countries such as Japan and Singapore will remain crucial for the industry . This is particularly relevant for cheese manufacturers : close to one-quarter of cheese manufactured in Australia is destined for Japan . Key export markets are expected to remain stable over the next two to three years . Japan and China represent the two largest markets for Australian dairy exports , followed by Singapore , Indonesia , Malaysia and Thailand . <p> The Australian industry has a strong chance of meeting this growth . Australia 's strong reputation for high-end primary produce is expected to help the industry develop markets in the Asia-Pacific region . Australia 's milk is internationally perceived as high quality . Further , the high food safety standards enforced in domestic manufacturing help Australia 's export competitiveness . Scandals surrounding Chinese milk powder manufacturers , which began in 2008 , accelerated Chinese demand for Australian milk powders . Australia 's position was further enhanced when Chinese food regulators identified disease-causing bacteria in milk powder exported by competing New Zealand company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Agreement with China , which commenced in 2008 .

Potential export growth signals the productivity gains that could be made through further capital investment in dairy and production infrastructure . Additional capital investment will also be required to develop transport networks that support the export of these often temperature-sensitive products .

WCB has led the way for product innovation and export growth within the industry over the past decade .

The potential rewards for industry participants and prospective entrants to the industry are increasing , and domestic and international players will continue to fight to supply export markets with Australian dairy products . WCB 's strategic planning , strong capacity and proximity to Asian export markets , combined with an increase in demand for dairy products from a growing Asian middle class , make it an attractive acquisition .

Fast fashion retailers take trends straight from the latest runway shows and make them available for mass consumption at affordable prices . These operators typically have short production and distribution lead times , which enables them to respond to shifts in the market within just a few weeks . Clothing purchased from fast fashion chains typically has a short wardrobe life , as it has been designed to reflect the fashion of the moment .

The clothing retailing industry in Australia has suffered from these growing competitive pressures over the past five years , with revenue falling by an annualised 0.9% to $12.8 billion in 2013-14 . Despite this , some local retailers have managed to defy tough trading conditions and successfully fend off the invasion of global fashion chains . For example , Australian fashion label Sass &amp; Bide has grown from strength to strength , benefiting from store network expansion , fashion-forward product ranges and unique designs .
