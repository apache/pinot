They were struck by the allure of the New Years Eve Sao Paolo run at midnightand thought , why not do the same in Seattle ? Thus , the Firecracker 5K was born , where devoted fans of the race showed up year after year at Memorial Stadium to run the streets of Seattle on the eve of July 4 . <p> The event continued for 32 years , but when the City of Seattle revised its fee structure in 2016 , costs to put on the race in the heart of downtown Seattle tripled and the event had to be cancelled . <p> Now , CNW has reinvented Firecracker 5k with some exciting changes and additions ! <p> New Location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorial Stadium in downtown Seattle , the race will now start from Magnuson Park . Besides the breathtaking scenery of the course , which stretches along the beautiful shores of Lake Washington , parking is plentiful and free . <p> Additionally , this flat course offers a great opportunity for runners seeking a PR . <p> New start time and kids race ! <p> In past years , the race began at midnight on July 3 . However , now the race will start just before dusk at 8:45 on July 4 , which allows for a more family-focused event , with a kids race prior to the 5k . Additionally , those who stay after the race will get to watch the City of Kirklands fireworks display from Kite Hill , just a short walk from the races start/finish line area . <p> Beer garden and music <p> To keep runners entertained and hydrated after the race and before the fireworks start , there will be music for all and a beer garden for the adults . <p> Keep those patriotic costumes coming ! <p> As in years past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotic gear with a contest to determine the best costume . So come in your best red , white and blue ! <p> We at CNW are extremely excited about the new location for the race and hope families will make this event an ongoing part of their July 4tradition . <h> Video 25465 @qwx435465 25459 @qwx435459 25470 @qwx435470

Wanting to rectify this situation , they took their idea to the head of the police fitness unit , and together the group organized the first race , held on Sunday , April 27 , 1980 .

Runners with good form expend less energy over their runs , and are less likely to end up with injuries . <p> We can begin to look at efficient running technique by focusing in on initial contact , when the foot first makes contact with the ground . Use these three exercises to work on your foot strike . <h> Exercises To Improve Your Stride <p> Step ups , Slow Motion Marching <p> Forward Lean Run Drill <p> Single Leg Balance Exercises <h> Finding The Strike That Works Best For You <p> Which part of the foot you land on depends on which kind of foot striker you are : heel , midfoot or forefoot . <p> The way you strike the ground depends on many factors within each individual body . To ensure safe and efficient running form , the way your foot strikes the ground should produce the least amount of ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or resistance , will result in lower amount of energy required to move the legs . Therefore , you will have a smoother , more efficient stride . <p> You may have heard that its better to be a forefoot striker vs. a heel striker , but it really depends on your biomechanics . For example , you should only be a forefoot striker if you have adequate calf strength to control the lowering of your heel to the ground after contact . If you do not have proper calf strength , then a midfoot or even heel strike pattern might be more efficient . <p> In addition to looking at what part of your foot you are landing on , a frame-by-frame run analysis can help you understand where the foot lands on the ground in relation to the midline , or center of gravity . The closer the foot lands under the trunk , the shorter amount of time the foot will be on the ground . How much noise the runner makes when landing is also important . For example , landing with a loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quiet , soft landing would show better shock absorption at the foot , knee , and hip . <p> We also look at hip and knee flexion , and a forward trunk position . Forward trunk position helps your momentum stay forward . Hip and knee flexion helps to absorb shock .

You 'll most often find the Winnipeg Frontrunners gathering at The Forks and hitting trails that take them through the Exchange District , French quarter St. Boniface , organic loving Wolseley , historic North End , and cozy South Osborne . 25475 @qwx435475 <p> Hi Wally ! Tell us a bit about your club history , how long has the club been around ? <p> We started from humble beginnings in the summer of July 2011 with two to three members . I started the group , which was originally named " Out There Run " , to provide a healthy and social environment for LGBTTQ* people to meet . We met in different parts of the city every week to explore the many picturesque trails . Several years later , we joined International Frontrunners and rebranded ourselves as " Winnipeg Frontrunners " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What level of runners do you cater to ? <p> I love our members !

I cross over to the west side of Main Street and admire the old neighbourhood meat , bakery , and corner stores , and churches . It takes you back to what life was like in the early 1900 's . <p> My most favourite route , which became the Pride Run route , is running across the stunning Provencher Bridge into Whittier Park in St. Boniface . There is a canopy of trees that is so scenic that always brings a smile to my face . The return route comes back onto Provencher Bridge with a breathtaking view of the Museum of Human Rights and tall skyscrapers of Downtown Winnipeg .

Who are you ? Give us your best one line bio <p> I 'm an Olympian , husband , father and coach . I am also the co-founder of Mile2Marathon . <p> Tell us a bit about Mile2Marathon 's history <p> I 've learned a lot over the years about how to train properly . Through the many appearances I 've done at events , local running stores , and just talking to other runners I 've fielded a ton of questions about the sport . <p> One of the things that always surprised me was how many questions related specifically to training and how much the running community lacked individuals with the level of experience and knowledge that someone who has trained at my level has . This experience made me realize how much knowledge I had in the area and that coaching would be a great way to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The group in Vancouver was an avenue to share my knowledge and be a part of the Vancouver running community ! <p> We started group runs in earnest in the spring of 2016 . Smaller more informal groups have existed in the past , but nothing as formal as what we have going now . <p> Nice ! what sort of runners typically run with the group ? <p> Runners of all abilities come out for our runs . We have people running anywhere from 5hrs to under 3hrs for the marathon on any given day . People are anywhere from early 20 's to 50 's , but we 've had people as young as 13 come out to the group on a regular basis . <p> I feel like the common thread between our members is that they are individuals who have some real concrete goals with their running . The social aspect of the sport is great , but at the end of the day these people want to improve too . We recognize this and try to make the group a fun environment to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have to work hard to achieve your goals . Running is not an easy sport , but it can be very rewarding when you hit it right . <p> Where/when do you usually meet and run ? <p> We mix things up depending on the cycle of training we are in . But we try to frequent Stanley Park as much as possible . The options for running there are plentiful . You can run road or trail ( technical or not ) , flat or hilly . Most people associate running in Stanley Park with the Seawall . But we try to make a point of exploring other parts of the Park with our groups . <p> Currently we meet Tuesday night 's at the Vancouver Aquatic Centre and Saturday at either Stanley Park or Point Grey Track . As of the new year ( 2017 ) we will be lucky to call Musette Caffe ( at the corner of Burrard St an Harwood St ) our home base .

This winter ( winter 2016 ) we will be focused on training for the half-marathon and marathon distance . So people can expect to get a variety of workouts when the show up , but with a focus on endurance . Tuesday nights are either tempo runs or longer intervals and Saturday 's are usually more speed oriented . <p> We do n't  host any events , there are already so many great running events in the city ! <p> Where are your favourite spots to run in/around Vancouver ? <p> Stanley Park is an absolute gem in Vancouver . It has so many different types of running within one small space . <p> Pacific Spirit Park is also amazing . I do most of my training there . The trails are really well maintained and runners of all abilities should feel comfortable with the terrain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past 5 year I am still making up new loops and discovering how different trails connect .

It 's not on the seawall , which almost every other race in the city is . So that is refreshing . Running through gastown on the cobblestones , is a pretty unique experience . It sort of reminds me of road races in Europe that run through old town centres . The crew challenge that is connected to the Eastside 10k is also great fun .

Despite its low intensity , its one of the toughest and most basic training components in the program of an endurance runner . Long runs help the body use energy more efficiently enabling muscles to burn fat and produce energy . This is very useful in endurance runners since this reduces the consumption of glycogen from the muscles enabling them to use it later when energy levels are low . <p> The long run which is performed at a lower pace simultaneously helps to transfer energy and oxygen to the working muscles while removing the substances such lactic acid . It also increases the number and size of mitochondria ( micro organisms responsible for aerobic energy production cells ) . <p> Here are a few simple tips on how to integrate long runs into your training schedule without jeopardizing injuries while providing proper recovery <h> Be Patient <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gradually increase the duration by up to 10 minutes every time . This will help your body to become accustomed to the changes . For non marathon runners we suggest that the duration should not exceed 90 minutes . <h> Select your Running Buddies <p> Choose running partners that run at your pace . Listen to your body , the goal here is not to increase your speed , rather its to build endurance . Running with partners who are much faster than you can lead to injuries in some cases even fatigue syndrome . <h> Plan your Long Run <p> More experienced runners can do the long run every 7 to 10 days , less experienced every 2 weeks . Its important not to do a long run too close to an event . We suggest an interval of at least two weeks before and 5 days after the race , even if you 're a regular runner . <h> Heart Rate while Running <p> The proper intensity for a long run should be the one in which your body works with purely aerobic adjustments .

Dedicate 10 to 15 minutes after your long run to do some strides ( medium intensity ) for example 6 x 60 metres &amp; and of course stretching . Insufficient recovery can lead to injuries , stress , even fatigue . This can make all the difference . <h> Nutrition <p> Be sure to eat a meal consisting of proteins &amp; carbohydrates the night before a morning or on the day of the run if you 're running later in the day .

@@43046452 @3046452/ <h> Ten Tips For Better Running 25462 @qwx435462 <h> Ten Tips For Better Running <p> We become adults and life seems to get pretty complicated . Running , which was such a simple pursuit when we were kids , is suddenly seen as rocket science . The following list is the culmination of 25 years of running , coaching and study . Practice these tips and you 'll be back running with the joy of a kid ! <h> 1 - Find Joy <p> There is so much to love about running . Create the conditions that result in running bringing more happiness to your life . Run with friends , run alone , run with music , run in silence . Make it personal . <h> 2 - Start Smart <p> Be they a new runner or one starting a new season , so often the major mistake is made with the very first steps : doing too much too soon . There 's no joy in running if you ca n't run so , do n't get injured . Your primary goal should be FIFE : finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance you think you can do without being sore , then only do half of it . Next , see how you 're feeling the next day . If you 're fine , then build from there , adding no more than 10% distance to any run or to your overall weekly mileage . <h> 3 - Follow the Path of the JETI <p> Technology has conditioned us to expect results now . Your body does n't work that way . You need to send a message through training that it needs to grow a little stronger . Then , through rest and proper nutrition , your body rebuilds , allowing you to run a little further or a little faster . If you increase the workload ( distance , speed ) too much , your body will be overwhelmed which often results in injury or excess fatigue . When choosing how much to increase from run to run , remember to do Just Enough To Improve . This will help you to achieve the key to success : consistency . <h> 4 - Stretch <p> Many runners keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually avoidable . Excess tightness in certain running muscles , the gluts especially , leads to the body to move in inefficient patterns , and injuries can often happen as a result of this compensation . Remember , a 5k run will see you hitting the ground close to 5000 times ! 5000 repeats of a motion the body is n't built for is a good way to get injured . Make sure your muscles are loose and your body is able to function the way it was meant to by properly stretching after your run . <h> 5 - Maintain Cadence <p> Cadence refers to the rate at which your feet hit the ground . When you learn to run with shorter , quicker strides , your body will spend less time in the air meaning there is less impact each time you land . By bringing the foot down more quickly you will also avoid over-striding , which results in a small but measurable braking effect each time you land . A great cadence target for the recreational runner is 90 strikes per minute per foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can run at any speed ; the difference then lay in your stride length . <h> 6 - Present Perfect Posture <p> You do n't just run with your legs . In order for your body to run efficiently , it must be well-aligned from top to bottom ( actually , right past the bottom , all the way to the feet : ) With your head up , shoulders relaxed , and leading with a proud chest , you will leave your upper body working as one with the legs and not working against them . Add to that arms that are bent to approximately 90 degrees , and avoiding swinging across the body , and you will be on your way . <h> 7 - Change Your Pace <p> Recreational runners often train at the same pace every time they go out the door then wonder why they have plateaued . Slow down on your long run ; you do n't have to go fast to get all of the benefits of this workout . Stay at a conversational pace . With the extra energy you saved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your other weekly runs and slowly build a section of it in which the intensity is hard but sustainable . This will give you huge fitness gains , teach your body to run fast , and you will find that , when you slow down to your goal race pace , it will feel easier . Goodbye plateau , hello personal best . <h> 8 - Rest Before You Race <p> So simply , yet so hard . The big race is a few days out and you 're nervous so you go out and do a long run just to reassure yourself that you can do it . Then , on race day : disappointment . Remember , your body needs to recover in order to get fitter . It can take over 7 days for a body to fully rebuild after a workout . This means that any hard run within 7 days ( longer for longer races ) of a race will only hurt you . Leading up to the race , maintain the frequency of your runs but keep the workload easy . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the legs tuned up , but otherwise enjoy the nervous anxiety I call taper madness . <h> 9 - Refrain , Sustain , Freight Train <p> The gun goes off and like the empty smoke exploding from it 's barrel , you take off like a sprinter . Do n't get sucked in by the adrenaline ; pace yourself . For the first third of the race , when you are fresh and excited , the challenge is to hold back or REFRAIN and stick with you goal race pace . This is not easy . The second third is all about being steady and able to MAINTAIN goal pace . The final third is where the race really begins . Here is where you see what is inside you and I 'm not talking physically . The final third , it 's time to dig deep and run like a FREIGHT TRAIN ( your body follows your brain so I like the imagery ) , and push to the finish . <h> 10 - Give Thanks <p> As you cross your finish line , take a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow you to do so . We are so lucky to be able to celebrate the joy of running . <p> These tips have been provided by Geordie McConnell , head coach of the Ottawa Running Club .

You 'll often find them out on the numerous trails of San Diego from South Bay to North County , and from the beach trails to the Pacific Crest Trail 25475 @qwx435475 <p> Tell us a bit about the club history , how did the Dirt Devils get started ? <p> The group started in 2007 , after I ran my first 50 mile trail race . I realized many other runners would enjoy the trails of San Diego but not necessarily running 50 miles so I began to map all the lakes , canyons , rivers and mountain trails in San Diego . <p> At this time Dirt Devil Racing was formed and offered trail races from 5K to Half Marathon . The club became a natural extension of Dirtdevilracing.com as we could train runners for our events as well as open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra running ! <p> Nice ! Tell us a bit about your members <p> We have all levels of runners that join us but somehow we seem to convert many of them into crazy ultra runners . I think it is because we have a core group of runners who have transformed into adventure seeking distance runners and formed tight bonds with each other . As runners enter our group and are exposed to these relationships it is natural that they too want to be part of it . For example , this February we have 19 people going to Antelope Canyon 50 in Arizona and for many this will be their first 50 mile experience . <p> That being said we definitely do not discourage but rather encourage those that run shorter distances to train with us . Our long runs are designed to facilitate this . For example we might do two 8 mile loops using our cars as an aid station this way those that want to only run 8 mile can bail out when they are finished . <p> Where/when do you usually meet and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week , full moon runs at night once a month and Saturday or Sunday runs starting around 7am . These runs can be anywhere but often we go to the Laguna Mountains at 6000 feet ( yes we have 6000 foot mountains 1 hour east of downtown San Diego ! ) , Lake Cuyamaca at 4200 feet or Anza Borrego Desert which has amazing and unique desert trails with geographical features such as slot canyons , wind caves , abandoned railway lines and tunnels and ghost towns . <p> We give a two week trial membership for free then we ask for $20/year to help support the website and other club logistics , like the beer and wings at our post Turkathon run , or club shirts and hats and such . <p> We are also closely connected with the Oriflamme Canyon 50k and Pacific Crest Trail 50 Miler . <p> Plus we like to host our own fun club events . We recently hosted the " Turkathon " which consisted of 4.5 mile loops through a local canyon . There were prizes for fastest loop and most loops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 miles ...... we all drank beer after though : ) <p> Where are your favourite spots to run in/around the city ? <p> There are so many but two local favorites that are very unique are the Cliffs ( Beach Trail ) at Torrey Pines and the San Elijo Lagoon . <p> The beach trail is a 6 mile loop that takes you from the famous Torrey Pines Golf Course down sandy trails with breathtaking views of the Pacific all the way to your own private beach and then back to the top . <p> The San Elijo Lagoon takes you from Cardiff State Beach through an amazing lagoon full of wildlife into scenic Rancho Santa Fe ( one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the USA ) . This trail has a little know ( until recently ) slot canyon that has been recently opened up to the general public . <p> Do you have any favourite races ?
