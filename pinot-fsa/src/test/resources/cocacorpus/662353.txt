I cant wait to see my puppies but had such a great time here in paradise . Traveling is even more fulfilling when the place you 're traveling to is more magical than you originally expected . This was a realization that I came to last year after being blown away by how adorably charming Amsterdam is . I had no idea and I definitely was n't expecting it . It made the trip even more special . And , that 's how Bermuda has been for me , as well ! To be honest , Ive seen my share of beaches but there is something different about the ones here in Bermuda . Kaylee and I had a blast capturing it all !

I brought these by Michael Kors and they were perfect ! <p> If you go in March , like I did , definitely bring a sweater and cardigan ! It was pretty windy and not SUPER warm when the sun is n't out . <p> If you go during prime-time , April through June , be sure to bring this humidity shield spray to protect your curls from falling immediately . It works so well ! <p> I wore multiple flowy , boho-ish dresses during my time in Bermuda . This one was my favorite !

This was one of those places so many of who have been to Santorini told me Victoria and I HAD to go . Santo Winery in Pyrgos . And , with this one , you were right on ! We really enjoyed it . Many of you said its an amazing spot for sunset and , while I 'm sure it is , we really enjoyed the tranquility of going in the early to mid-afternoon . There werent many people around and it just started buzzing right as we were leaving . The receptionist and manager at our hotel , SunRocks Santorini , that it is a great winery but is a little more commercialized . There were quite a few tour buses that were the cause of the influx of people we saw come in as we left , so I 'm assuming that 's what they were hinting at .

Its- easy to share between two people making it a really good deal ! <p> HEADS UP : Right now , 36 Euro equals just under $40 . <p> We knew it was going to be a little toasty on this particular afternoon so I opted for this white and blue striped jumpsuit ! - I do apologize that it is now sold out but will keep an eye out to see if it does come back in stock . This is the struggle with travel content .

Its like the WHOLE city is on the same page and on board with decorating everything that you can possibly decorate for the holiday . Its amazing . The last few weeks I was in London , I made it a point to walk around as much . I was adamant about soaking it all in because , well , Christmas in Florida just is n't like . this . <p> Today , I thought itd be fun to share some of my favorite things to do in London during the Christmas season ! There are pictures of some of the activities and places mentioned but , not all . You really have to go and experience it for yourself ! <p> Spend a fun evening out at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park ! Its an a massive carnival that has a traditional European market with food and product vendors , fun rides , a carousel with a bar in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went twice and had a blast meandering through , sipping on mulled wine ! Highly recommend just be sure to bundle up ! Entry is free ! <p> Go shopping in Covent Garden in the morning and sip your morning coffee from their wooden benches , adorned with garland and red bows , then grab lunch at The Ivy , a London staple . They have delicious food and bright and fun holiday decor ! I love how they use ornaments and flowers in their Christmas trees and wreaths . In terms of food , I always get the Shepherds Pie . <p> Meander through one of the Christmas markets ! There are quite a few throughout London . I really liked the one right next to the London Eye at the bottom of the Golden Jubilee Bridge . There 's also a great one further down along the Southbank near the Tower Bridge . The food and product vendors are all mostly impressive . Whitney loved finding a good place that had mulled wine and I loved Waffle On they had the best waffles ! <p> Embrace the British culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Minced pies , honestly , taste a lot like Poptarts , except the filling is rich in fruit and spices instead of fruit and sugar . Not bad ! I brought some back for my family to try , as well as mulled wine spices . You can find them at any pastry shop or grocer , and you can find mulled wine at any of the Christmas markets mentioned above or Hyde Parks Winter Wonderland ! <p> Go ice skating at Somerset House , Natural History Museum or Tower of London . Make sure you book your tickets ahead of time . Its usually between -12-17 $15-21 and you get to skate for an hour . Also , make sure you set aside some time to take advantage of the cafes that are usually within the rink area . They have some really impressive holiday drinks . The ice rink at Somerset House is sponsored by Fortnum &amp; Mason , the Queens grocer , and they have an amazing little shop full of holiday trinkets , as well , so be sure to check that out if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the new year , except Natural History Museum . It opens mid-to-late October . <p> Pop over to the beautiful area of Belgravia for an afternoon treat at Peggy Porschen Cakes . Its always decorated beautifully throughout the year . They make really yummy lattes and cappuccinos and their cake is TO DIE FOR . Remember this post ? <p> Get out there and walk around ! here 's one route I took one day that 's great to do during the holidays : Get off at Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly Line , walk up toward The Dorchester Hotel , then turn right into the Mayfair area on South Street . Make your way toward Maison Goyard and through Berkeley Gardens . From there , find your way over to New Bond Street and . JACKPOT ! You 'll find Cartier , CHANEL , and Tiffanys with beautiful store front decor and The Royal Arcade is right there , too . From there , Regent Street is a mere 5 minute walk so head there next for more lights and splendor ! After that , if you 're wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Churchill Bar &amp; Terrace to warm up ! Its located just on the outskirts of that major shopping area , more near Marble Arch , though , so you may need to take the tube from Bond Street up to Marble Arch on the Central Line if you 're tired . But , its a great place to unwind after pushing your way through those crowds all day . Their outside seating area is beautiful and kind of reminds me of Narnia ! Its enclosed during the Winter so you 're not really outside , and there is a faux fur liner and blanket on every chair with lights in all the windows . <p> Treat yourself to afternoon tea at The Ritz ! This is something I did n't  get to do but my friend , Victoria , did last week and said it was absolutely divine ! It books up months in advance so make sure to book this when you book your plane tickets . <p> Check out the holiday window displays at Selfridges , John Lewis , Harrods , Harvey Nichols and Fortnum &amp; Mason ! My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the photo I included of the one of the penguin and the polar bear but the bottom of it says " Although they were poles apart , theyd never forget a friend overseas . A simple gesture that brings us together , during times such as these . " Usually window displays are all about the THINGS within the store , but I like how F&amp;Ms focused more on the season itself . That one in particular was my favorite window . <p> Find a Christmas carol service or concert to attend ! THIS site usually has a great list of the major ones , including dates and times ! I caught some great carolers in Trafalgar Square when I came out of the National Gallery . It was dreamy to say the least ! <p> Dine in an igloo overlooking Tower Bridge ! I 'm not sure if you 've seen this place on social media but its called Coppa Club and its located right next to Tower of London . Get off on the Tower Hill stop and its a short 7-10 minute walk , depending on crowds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at sunset and , thankfully , did n't  have a long wait to sit in one of these heated igloos . I think it was because we went during the week and we went kind of early , before the afterwork crowd came through . What I liked about this place was that the food was equally as good as the view ! <p> I am quite confident there are so many other amazing things to do during the holiday season in London . These are just the ones I was able to experience . We really wanted to see the Nutcracker at the Royal Opera House . We heard its great but , unfortunately , we did n't  plan that well enough in advance . My favorite thing to do , personally , was just walking and discovering decorated doors and buildings , etc . I miss London so very much already and sincerely hope this post inspires you to go and see this amazing city during this fun time of year !

@@29465607 @3165607/ <h> FAQs <p> I 'd love to start a blog . Do you have any advice ? I get asked this a lot and my brain immediately goes to my favorite quote : " Do n't  talk about it , be about it . " The best way to start a blog is .. to start a blog . I literally had no idea what I was doing when I started Sequins &amp; Things because , well I was a nurse , ha . And , to be honest , I did n't  follow any blogs . There was a huge learning curve but I was determined , motivated and worked hard to figure out whatever I needed to know . Google helped me with almost every single question I had back then and is still my go to . Its what eventually led me to sites like Shop the BBar , The Fox &amp; She , and A Beautiful Mess . The amazing women behind each of these sites are great at what they do and make it super easy for you to learn from their experience . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are starting out , too , and build friendships . Its helpful to have other gals in your corner going through the same thing . <p> But , remember never underestimate all that you can learn from just going for it ! Personal experience is the best teacher ! <p> I 'd also encourage you to make sure to start for the right reasons . My blog came about as an extension of what I was already sharing with my audience on Instagram . It was more work , but I was motivated by my passion for creating , sharing and connecting with my audience even if it was super small . I did n't  find out blogs could generate an income until almost a year after starting mine , so when I hear girls say they want to start a blog because of the income you can make its hard to wrap my mind around . Sure , it was a really nice realization and incentive I mean , is n't it everyones dream for a career to come out of the things you 're the most passionate about doing ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're passionate about blogging for what it is , even the not so glamorous things i.e. accounting and taxes ew ! because money will never make you happy in the long run . <p> My last piece of advice is to HAVE FUN , BE YOURSELF and BE PATIENT . Do n't  focus on the numbers or being the biggest or the best . Just do you . No one else can be the creative that you are , so share original content and have fun creating it . If you 're being genuine and authentic , in time , people will gravitate towards you and want to follow along as you go . <p> What do you love most about blogging ? Dressing up and getting to do the creative side to blogging is definitely up there but I must say connecting with yall is absolutely , with-a-doubt , my favorite part . When you send me emails telling me what you have going on in your lives I can promise you I cry , because I am so touched you would take the time to reach out and share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed me in to your life in some way . Its a special thing and I appreciate it so much . <p> What 's your least favorite thing about blogging ? I am definitely not a numbers person so , although a necessary evil , the accounting / tax side of owning your own business is the furthest thing from fun in my opinion . I also do n't  enjoy anonymous haters comments . I mean , who would enjoy that , really ? I realize I put myself out there and there will be judgement but , if you do n't  like what you 're seeing be a decent human being . Unfollow and leave quietly . The misconception that blogging is easy or that blogging is just some fake profession are also up there on the least favorite things about blogging list . <p> How do you make money from your blog ? I 've found that people are not so shy about asking this question , so I 've become not so shy about sharing the answer . Its simple , actually . I make money through affiliate links provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you make a purchase after clicking a link on my blog and across my social media platforms , I could possibly make a small commission percentage on the sale that is paid out by the retailer . I just shop online , like everyone else does , from retailers that I personally love and , as a thank you for sharing and bringing you to their site , they pay me a small cut of the sale . Its comparable to when a sales associate helps you in a store . When you check out to pay , they ask who helped you and , after mentioning their name , they enter a code so that they make the commission on the sale . The same thing is true for me , as a style blogger . You using my links is you telling that retailer that I 'm the one that helped you . Its important to mention that not every link is linked to an affiliate site and the network does not influence what I choose to feature on the blog . <p> Sponsored posts come about when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post on the blog . I am very selective about the sponsorships I enter into , as I want to ensure that they are companies that fall in line with my personal style . Even though I am paid for the guaranteed promotion , sponsored posts should always be genuine , in my opinion . I will never promote anything that I do n't  personally love . <p> What kind of camera do you use for your blog photos ? What lenses ? Miguel , my photographer , has used many different camera bodies since we started working together on Sequins &amp; Things , but currently shoots my outfit photos with a Nikon D750 and , typically , a 85mm lens . <p> What program(s) do you use to edit your blog photos ? Miguel and Lyndsey both do their own editing when it comes to my photos . They both use Lightroom . <p> What program(s) do you use to make your collages / style boards ? I use a program called SnagIt . I probably should learn how to use Photoshop but my photographers , Miguel and Lyndsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I 've never had a desperate need for making the investment when this program is such a dream ! Its easy to use , allows me to make quality style boards and is such a great deal . Plus you get to try it for a month for free ! <p> What is LIKETOKNOW.it ? Why do you choose to use it ? Please see THIS page for the answer to these questions . <p> How do you take your downward facing selfies on Instagram ? I use my iPhone . Open camera , make sure its in Square view , flip the camera to where its facing you , hold it up in front of you at an angle . Your shoes should be in one corner and either your lips or your neck in the other depends on what you prefer . Then SNAP ! Super easy ! <p> BUT I ve been doing these for almost 4 years now more consistently over the last 3- - so do n't  be discouraged if you are n't  a pro at it right off the bat . They take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? At the moment , I do not hire interns . If you 're looking to gain experience in the blogging world , the best thing to do , in my opinion , is to start your own blog and learn from personal experience . It sounds pretty cliche but , I promise , its what I did and it makes me appreciate where I am today that much more because it was all trial and error .

We want it to fit right , feel good on , accentuate our features , as well as- like the shape and style. - Its no easy task for us , ladies , and can physically pain us to think about but now is the best time to do your swimsuit shopping and I 've found a great spot to find some for under $100 ! <p> Back in December , I partnered with Modcloth to share my holiday style with you and today I 'm partnering with them again to share my swimwear style . I typically steer clear of one-piece swimsuits . Do n't  get me wrong . I see so many I love but- Ive always had this idea that one-piece swimsuits look so good on women with curves , and I 'm naturally very thin and petite so I 've never felt super confident in them . However , every swimsuit I found on Modcloths- website that I liked were all one-pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to give them another try . So , I ended up getting this bathing suit in the mail on Thursday of last week of course after I said I typically steer clear of one-pieces in this post from the day before and fell in love with it . I thought , for the first time , that a one-piece actually flattered my features , and I cant get enough of the pretty pink and blue hues throughout it . <p> I threw it on with this super cute coverup that 's only $38 ! the other day down in Miami to explore the hotel rooftop and grab a cocktail with my girlfriends before going doing to get ready for dinner . The view was amazing and thankful to have been in such great company for my birthday weekend .

@@29465613 @3165613/ <h> BLUE MAXI DRESS UNDER $100 IN SANTORINI <p> Hey there , loves ! Happy Monday ! I 'm so excited to finally start sharing my trip with you all ! I am sharing all of the outfits I wore from each city as well as packing guides and travel diaries ! I always feel a little hesitant to call my posts travel guides or city guides because I cant pretend like I 'm an expert that knows ALL the different places to recommend for different things . So , I like the travel diary term better because I am , more or less , just sharing where we went , what we liked , what we did , what we took away , etc . As I shared on Snapchat , I pretty much wrote- all of my travel diaries as we traveled , which is definitely the way to go . Otherwise , I knew I 'd forget little tidbits that would be helpful so I really , really hope you like them ! Please be sure to let me know if you end up booking at any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or found my heads up ! tips helpful ! Itll help me know how useful I was to you and to the partners that help make these trips a reality . <p> Okay so here we go ! Based on your feedback , you wanted all the outfits and info on Santorini first so I am starting with this easy , breezy summer look that I wore on our second afternoon / night in Santorini . We stayed in a little town called Thira , which is centrally located along the steep cliffed Western coast of the island , and decided to walk around a little bit before we headed to Oia pronounced E-ah , the big must see city on the island . We asked a local if there were any blue dome churches in the area or if they were mostly in Oia . He laughed and said they 're everywhere ! but honestly , they are a little elusive ! Then , when you finally spot them you have to find out what road leads to it . Its pretty tricky , ha ! So , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out is- called the Agios Theodori Church- which means Saint Theodore . <p> We had both seen this spot on Pinterest and on postcards hanging outside of memorabilia shops . Since we had a little bit of time and because Victoria said Oia at sunset will be chaos , we decided to do outfit photos here . I literally just wanted to sit on the perch for hours and eat our dinner there . It was so beautiful and peaceful . There were a few groups that would come up and take photos near us but- it was nothing compared to Oia ! You cant even really take anything in in Oia when the cruise ships are docked ! I was kind of glad we stayed a short 15-minute drive from Oia . You know me and crowds <p> This flowy maxi dress is one of my summer " go-tos " because of the fit , price and number of color options . I bought it last year in the Vine color for my birthday trip down to Miami and then decided to get it in Cobalt Blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long for my 53 frame and they often fall too far down on my chest . This one is amazing because it just lightly touches the ground and also has adjustable straps so actually fits appropriately ! Its seriously a diamond in the rough for us short gals ! <p> Everything in Santorini is white , more or less , and the sun is really strong so make sure you bring a hat , good sunglasses and a good moisturizer with SPF . I use Alastins Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 36 then- apply this powder SPF by colorscience throughout the day over my makeup . I wore this hat pretty much every day I was there ! Its a steal and often sold out so snag it if its still in stock ! Its available in a Medium HERE- but otherwise , I 'd order it from HERE- and just wait for the backordered delivery to get the size you need ! Its just a good hat ! <p> One last thing then I 'll let yall go I bought this Louis Vuitton crossbody when I got to London because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought it was SO cute and such a perfect size , especially for travel . I have told yall before to leave designer items at home when traveling remember- THIS- post ? check it out if you 're traveling abroad soon ! but I broke my rule with this cutie- because I was able to keep it in front of me and its not a bag that can be easily accessed by a pick-pocketer . It also went with SO many of my outfits . Sometimes I get tired of carrying around a tote so this was the perfect alternative . I could fit my little camera , phone , card case , lip gloss and hotel key with no problem ! <p> If you have been wanting a designer item for awhile and you 're traveling abroad soon , I 'd advise you to buy it abroad ! Its so much cheaper ! That 's why I waited to buy my LV crossbody there. - On Louis Vuittons website , the price is set at- $1560 and I paid $1345 . The salesperson will know you 're American and will likely make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theyll ask you for your passport information if you do n't  have it , its okay then , before you leave the country to go home , you go to the Tax Free office at the airport before you check in for your flight , and theyll work out how much money- you get- back ! You have to claim it at customs as a imported good and pay duty on it but , you get an $800 tax exemption on purchases abroad , so then you 're only paying 3% on whatever is left over ! Not bad ! <p> Alright , yall ! I 'm done chattin your ear off ! Come back tomorrow for some more summer vacation outfit inspiration and more about Santorini ! = <p> Haha , yes ! I definitely did ! I wanted to match the surroundings so everything I brought for Santorini was blue , white or a combo of the two = Well except for what I wore to the black sand beach . Stay tuned for that ! 
@@29465614 @3165614/ <h> BERMUDA TRAVEL DIARY <p> Yall may have noticed that , since returning from London in December , that I have stayed put in Jacksonville to catch up and get reorganized at home after my roommate of two years moved out of our apartment . Its been nice to be home for awhile but I started getting the- itch to travel again around the time the opportunity to venture over to Bermuda came up ! I knew Bermuda was an island with beautiful beaches but I did n't  really know how charming this little island is . In my experience , when you- go on a tropical getaway , it is likely that the only thing that is beautiful , by our standards , is the beach and the resort you 're staying at. - That is NOT the case when it comes to Bermuda and I cant recommend you consider a getaway there more ! <p> I decided to invite my photographer friend , Kaylee , to go on this trip with me . Her and I went to high school together and , as evidence by this post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely talented . We flew up to Atlanta from Jacksonville , which is the shortest flight ever , and then took an almost three hour flight over to Bermuda , which went by super fast ! <p> We knew we were going to love this little island when we saw that the airport was pink and blue , the water was neon turquoise , our hotel was nicknamed " The Pink Palace " and everyone we met was friendly and happy . <p> Today , I 'm going to share more about where we stayed , where we ate and where we played during our three day stay in Bermuda ! <p> Kaylee and I stayed at the beautiful- Hamilton Princess Hotel , - also known as the Pink Palace . It is literally every girly girls dream hotel in terms of exteriors . It is centrally located on the island , in Bermudas capitol city of Hamilton , making it equidistant to any other part of the island you 're wanting to explore . It is a short 20-minute drive almost anywhere ! <p> Upon our arrival , we were greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms . Both- rooms were large with two full-size beds , a beautiful bathroom , spacious closet area and a balcony with a view of the courtyard and water . They also came with access to the Gold Lounge , which is- a quiet little haven where club level guests can enjoy a full breakfast , cocktails anytime throughout the day , small snacks and afternoon tea . <p> FUN FACT : Bermuda is a British colony so their afternoon tea was super legit AND you can find Union Jacks and red phone booths sporadically placed throughout the island ! <p> One morning , we went over to grab breakfast and decided to- fill up- multiple plates to the brim and head- back to our rooms to enjoy breakfast from one of our balconies . I do n't  know about you but I love slow , relaxing weekend mornings ! They 're the best way to start the day ! <p> FUN FACT : Bermuda is the birthplace of Bermuda shorts and you 'll certainly see men wear them around the island . Its amazing ! Hah ! <p> I also really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces adorning the walls ! When I first walked in and saw multiple Queen Elizabeth IIs- by Andy Warhol on the wall behind the front desk counter I was like Okay , I love this place ! <p> These were my absolute favorite , though : <p> The- Hamilton Princess- also has the most beautiful infinity pool with palm trees on each side . How amazing is this ? - Being that we went to Bermuda in March , we did experience some **28;0;TOOLONG temperatures so we enjoyed the hot tub they have next to the pool , as well ! <p> Overall , we found that the- Hamilton Princess- has so much to offer its guests and we are confident you 'll have an amazing stay , just as we did ! <p> FRONT STREET : - Front Street is a short walk from the- Hamilton Princess filled with shops and restaurants ! We really enjoyed walking around the area . Every store is a different color and they even have the original Bermuda shorts store ! Hah ! = <p> ST . GEORGE : St. George is a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first settlement on the island of Bermuda and the original capitol , as well . It was a 25-minute taxi ride from our hotel and was certainly worth the trip ! It was an extremely quiet little town on the day we went . I could n't tell if it was always like that or not . Surely not during high season ! It did n't  keep us from enjoying ourselves though . Every building is- a different bright color and is a gold mine for color-loving Instagrammers ! Do n't  miss grabbing a cafe latte at CV Cafe ! It was SO SO good ! <p> TOBACCO BAY : This little spot was said to be a cant miss from a local that- Kaylee and I chatted with so we made sure to scoot over there after we were done exploring St. George , since it was n't far . Our taxi driver was kind enough to drive us there , let us check it out and snap a few photos , then drove us back to the hotel . A lot of taxi drivers are happy to oblige to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right ! This spot is SO AMAZING ! If I lived in Bermuda , I 'd be there as often as I could in the summer ! It has a little beach around one side of it so there 's plenty of room to set up for the day . There 's a restaurant and bar right there , as well ! <p> BEACH CLUB : - As I mentioned , the- Hamilton Princess has a beautiful infinity pool and hot tub on location for its guests to enjoy . However , they do n't  have a beach front at the hotel itself so , instead , they have a cove with a private beach , restaurant , bar and paddleboard rentals for Hamilton Princess guests only. - They have plenty of beach chairs and a few hammocks in the water for your most ideal cool down sesh ! = <p> HOTEL SPA : - Kaylee and I had the opportunity to enjoy massages one of our last mornings and it was such a nice end to our trip because we had been hustling around the island trying to explore and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we loved our stay , we had a lot to squeeze in to three days , hah ! Highly , HIGHLY recommend some time at the spa ! It was LOVELY ! <p> HORSESHOE BAY : Bermuda is known for beautiful beaches , especially one in particular ! Horseshoe Bay , on Bermudas South Shore , is always ranked in the most- beautiful beaches category by Conde Nast Traveler with its pink sand and expansive horseshoe shape ! It was quite the trek to get down to it . Our taxi driver said that the typical entrance was under construction so he dropped us off at a trail that would take us down . It did definitely get us there but there were multiple trails connected to it with no signs so we had moments of hesitation and confusion but . WE MADE IT and it certainly lived up to the hype and reputation ! <p> You can take a taxi , like we did , or you can take bus #7 from the Hamilton Bus Station . <p> WARWICK LONG BEACH : - Immediately after we- dropping off our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the sunset because it was the only night that had a 0% chance of rain . We did n't  know exactly what beach to go to so we asked one of the friendly doorman at the hotel . He said his favorite beach to enjoy the sunset is Warwick Long Beach . It was about a 20-minute ride and absolutely stunning ! It was probably my second favorite after Tobacco Bay ! <p> ELBOW BEACH : - This beach will make you feel like you are walking into a Pinterest photo . Its palm trees made me feel really short , as well ! Ha ! There are quite a few restaurants surrounding Elbow Beach if you 're looking for a beach to lounge at for a good part of the day but not have to venture far to fulfill your lunch time cravings ! <p> CRYSTAL CAVES : This spot was on our list because it looked really cool based on photos but we said that we would try and see all the beaches we want to see and then , if it rains one day or if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its a short 10-minute drive from the hotel and supposedly has an AMAZING ice cream shop right next to it called Baileys Ice Cream . <p> WATER ACTIVITIES : Since Kaylee and I went in March , the water was extremely chilly ! I would have loved to have paddle boarded , snorkeled or rented jet-skis but I 'll definitely be sure to do that during a future trip ! All of those activities are available for guests through different vendors throughout the island . Be sure to talk to the friendly staff members at the- Hamilton Princess- to help you find the best vendor for what you 're looking to do ! <p> Unfortunately , my recommendations are a little limited in this area as Kaylee and I often opted for room service at the end of our long days of shooting and exploring . However , we did n't  come up completely empty for you guys ! <p> DEVILS ISLE : - Kaylee and Is trip crossed paths with my friends Marissa and Kendall , who were also staying at the Hamilton Princess . We all decided to check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short walk from the hotel . This place had an adorable aesthetic . I honestly do n't  remember what we got but I do remember that we were all so full and happy when we left ! I highly recommend you check it out one night ! <p> VILLAGE PANTRY : Marissa &amp; Kendall both RAVED about this place . They had tried it out earlier in the day and found out about Devils Isle , where we were eating for dinner , from the people that work there ! They 're sister restaurants , I believe . <p> MARCUS : This restaurant is located on the hotel property- and open for most of the year but always during high season April October . We made sure to make a reservation the first afternoon we arrived as we were told it is always busy ! Thankfully , we were able to secure a spot the second night we were in town ! - Try the Shrimp &amp; Grits ! They were delicious ! <p> HAMILTON PRINCESS ROOM SERVICE : I 'm not going to lie . I am a lover of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm traveling , especially if I 've already ventured in to town for a few nights . So , our last two nights Kaylee and I opted for room service and have no regrets ! It was a little pricey , as it normally is . <p> BAILEYS ICE CREAM : This place is supposedly AMAZING . We did n't  make it there but could n't let yall miss out just because we did ! Check it out ! <p> You cant rent a car in Bermuda . There is n't enough space on the island . The residents are allowed one car per household . <p> Uber does n't  exist in Bermuda . Download HITCH which is a reliable taxi app that is reliable and used frequently on the island ! <p> - If your trip somewhere is short , taxi drivers do n't  mind waiting for you to spend some time in the area you want to be dropped off at and then take you to the next spot . You have to pay them , obviously , but its pretty reasonable . <p> Exchange Rate : 1 Bermudan Dollar = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language on the island is English and citizens of the US , UK and Canada do not need a VISA to visit the island .

@@29465615 @3165615/ <h> SUMMER PACKING TIPS FOR ROME <p> Hi there ! Last month , Ben and I ventured over to Rome and , honestly , I had no idea what to pack ! Aside from the sweltering temperatures , there were quite a few rules that were relayed to me and it made my packing dilemma even more challenging . <p> Today , I 'm sharing one of the outfits I wore in Rome and a few tips on packing for Rome , and Europe in general , during the summer months ! I know were entering the Fall season but , do n't  worry you can just bookmark this post to refer to later ! <p> I cant stress how HOT it is in Rome ! The sun is so strong and the heat gets trapped in the alleyways in between buildings . Wearing loose , lightweight garments is just one way to stay cool . <p> Honestly , when I packed , I did n't  have a lot of really good summer weather clothes to choose from because , I brought good layering options that could be worn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans the first day and night I was in Rome , and I was sweating through them ! Definitely opt for dresses , loose tops and shorts or flowy midi skirts ! Here are some options : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> What I like to do is pick my garments based on whether the shoes that I have opted to bring will match them , that way you 're not bringing multiple pairs of shoes to match everything . The more basic , the better ! <p> There are multiple items you 'll need to pack to do this well , like sun block with a high SPF , a hat , and a good pair of sunglasses ! I 'd also encourage you to bring a small travel umbrella for the areas , like the Roman Forum &amp; Colosseum , where there is n't a lot of shadow cover . 129525 @qwx329525 <p> Another tip on staying cool is to make sure you 're drinking lots of water to stay hydrated ! Youll be walking a lot in this heat and you 'll be making your way through crowds , which makes it a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , then fill it up at the public water fountains throughout the city . They supply fresh drinking water from ancient aqueducts ! <p> The challenge of dressing for Rome , especially as a tourist , has to do with the fact that it is so hot and many of the destinations you will want to venture to require modest dress . Churches , such as St. Peters Basilica and the Sistine Chapel , require shoulders and knees to be covered before entering , so you 'll need to take this into consideration when you 're planning your outfits . Some smaller churches may not make you or turn you away but , out of respect for where you are and the culture there , you should do everything you can to follow this request / rule , especially within the Vatican City . There were people wearing paper sheets over their shoulders and wrapped around their waist when we were in the Sistine Chapel because their attire was considered inappropriate , so just know that it is enforced in certain places . 129525 @qwx329525 <p> The day I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short sleeve shirt and Nikes . While my attire was considered appropriate , I was extremely hot . So , I 'd probably opt for a loose , sleeveless midi dress that covers my knees and then bring a lightweight scarf in my bag to wrap around my shoulders while you 're in the church . That 's my suggestion ! <p> Rome is no place for heels of any kind or even sandals if you plan on doing a lot of walking ! There are cobblestones and uneven walkways everywhere . You 're constantly going up and down stairs with and without your luggage and heavy bags . Its dirty , as well . Stick to running shoes or comfortable flats . I promise you will thank me later ! I wore booties for three hours when I went to Bologna , Italy this past April and my feet hated me for DAYS after that . I might be a style blogger who wants to inspire you and your wardrobe , but I am also a girl who loves to see new places and cities so todays outfit might not be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here are some great options : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> NOTE : Sandals ARE okay for nighttime . I just think they wont be good for your feet during the day ! <p> As with any other large European city , it is extremely important to be very aware of your surroundings while venturing through Rome . You should be taking the proper precautions in securing your personal belongings by opting for handbags with zippers as opposed to bags that can be easily accessed with a quick grab , like open totes and front flap backpacks . Pick pocketers are scattered throughout the city , as are people who will try and get you to give them money i.e. do n't  let anyone put a flower in your hand , help you with your luggage or get a taxi for you that does n't  work for a hotel , so make sure you are keeping your handbag close to you and its ALWAYS closed .

I love a great designer item as much as the next girl but I would say you better off leaving the Loubs and super big designer names at home ! There 's no real need for them while you 're exploring a new city ! <p> One last thing this is actually something I have learned recently . When you 're traveling , its important to secure your passport in your hotel room safe and keep a copy of it on you . If you keep your actual passport in your bag , and it DOES get stolen , that can cause a plethora of issues you just DO NT want to deal with on your vacation .

Go Ben ! Also , I agree with you when it comes to leaving the " flashy " stuff at home .

I would only add that it is n't sweltering year round , just June/July August , so the " off " seasons tourist wise can be really pleasant ! I would suggest a visit to Rome around Christmas !

A couple of weeks ago , I attended my friends Nathalie and Johns wedding - in St. Augustine , Florida . It got me thinking that it might- be fun to share some of my dos and donts when it comes to wedding guest attire . I know Ive definitely been stumped before ! Its tough , so read on to find out what Ive learned over the last few years of- attending countless friends weddings to hopefully make it a little easier on you : <p> When I 'm shopping for what- to wear to a friends or family members wedding , I look at the date of the wedding first and the attire indicated on the invitation second see first- DO NT below for more on that ! . <p> The date of the wedding helps to- determine what colors- to filter out of my search options when looking at online retailers. - If the wedding is on July 7th , I would filter out the black , dark red and plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - I 'd steer clear of light pink , yellow and other pastel colors . <p> FYI : - Embellished dresses are okay to wear to a wedding , but its definitely more appropriate for formal evening weddings during the Winter months . For Nathalie and Johns wedding , I- opted for a light pink fit &amp; flare dress because its been a rather warm winter here in Florida . Honestly , it- feels a lot like Spring . I did choose to bring a subtly- bright , olive green coat to pay homage to the Winter season . It was also a great way to be- prepared for the cooler temperatures at the end of the evening . So , its okay to use your own judgement , too ! <p> Choose a pair of comfortable heels- to wear to the wedding ceremony , but do n't  forget to bring a pair of nice sandals to slip on- at the reception . If its a more casual wedding , a newer pair of flip flop sandals would be okay . However , if its a more formal wedding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or neutral flats . 129525 @qwx329525 <p> One of my biggest fears is showing up to a wedding looking like I belong in the bridal party . This , actually , almost happened in September when I was invited to my friend , and fellow blogger , Katey of Chronicles of Frivolitys wedding . I sent her a link to the dress I was considering wearing . It was a pretty champagne color , and thought itd be a great dress to have for multiple occasions . Turns out , Katey laughed and said that the dress I was considering was- THE.SAME. dress as her bridesmaids , except her bridesmaids were wearing black . I can not even explain how mortified I would have been if I had n't  asked her . What if I liked it in black ? What if I was n't close enough to her ? - <p> If you 're not super close to the bride , you can always ask someone who is what the colors of the wedding are , specifically the bridesmaids dresses . Do your best to steer clear of those colors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Try and find out as much as you can , and do n't  be shy if you feel like you do n't  have a way of finding it out ! The girls in the wedding party would surely not mind a harmless Facebook message about what to wear to their dear friends wedding . I know I would n't ! They want it to be the best day ever so go ahead and send along a quick inquiry ! - Their names are typically shared on the couples wedding website , so reference that if you 're not sure who they are . <p> During the work week , its a shame that- your statement jewelry is at home collecting dust. - A weekend wedding- celebration is a great- opportunity- for you to pull out your favorites and show off a little bit ! - We all know there are some cringe-worthy ways to stand out at a wedding i.e. showing too much skin , wearing a dress that 's too short or too tight , but- statement jewelry- is the most appropriate way without taking eyes off the bride ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding.Sadly , I 've made this mistake before . <p> As you can see in the photos above , I wore these fun statement earrings which perfectly pulled together my dress and coat . I wore this bracelet to the wedding , which is n't pictured in todays post , but I highly recommend you consider buying for occasions such as this . 129525 @qwx329525 <p> If you 're really not sure what to wear , even after investigating the type of wedding and considering the season , just remember that its better to be overdressed than under dressed ! - Being overdressed is more appropriate AND , to be honest , it will draw people to you making it easy to make new friends , allowing you to feel a little more comfortable whereas being underdressed would do the opposite . So , in general , its a good rule of thumb ! <p> <p> The invitation typically indicates what attire is appropriate for the type of wedding the bride , groom and families are planning , so be sure to read it carefully . This article is great and details- what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show your respect for the occasion by following the guidelines of that dress code . <p> For anyone who has been attending weddings in their recent past , this should be a given , but this is important to know for anyone who may- just now getting to the age where you 're friends are getting married . White is reserved for the BRIDE only . This goes for wedding showers and rehearsal dinners , as well . <p> Here are some great dress options for a wedding guest to opt to wear in the upcoming Spring season , all of which are NOT white : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> Staying on the conservative side when attending a wedding is smart . If you 're wearing a short dress , be sure that its no shorter than an inch above your knee . Its okay for your dress to be tailored to fit you , but be sure you 're dress is not too tight . Make sure that your cleavage is tasteful , if any . If you 're wanting to show off a particular area , such as your back with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thin cutout , its okay but keep it to one area . For example , - if you have a low back dress , be sure that the neckline is high and there is n't a dramatic slit in the front . Remember , this day is not about you so do n't  dress like its YOUR night . <p> As Ive- already mentioned , there are a few ways you- can steal the show from the bride . Be sure to steer clear of white , showing too much skin , wearing a tight or short dress- but another tip would be to maintain appropriate behavior . Be sure to enjoy yourself , socialize and have a great time but put a limit on the number of alcoholic beverages you have . <p> As a wedding guest , you do n't  want to steal the show but you do want to put your best foot forward by looking nice and being prepared for anything . I would suggest styling your hair , especially if you do n't  normally do too much to it . Also , wear lipstick or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Also , be sure to carry a medium-sized- clutch or bag that is not only structured , - but- appropriate for a wedding- to carry- all the little extras you may need throughout the evening . Some little extras include bandaids , breath mints , cash and a pair of sandals see the second DO for some options ! . And , finally , before you head home , be sure to give the bride and groom a hug and express your sincere gratitude for being invited to share their special evening with them ! <p> Hope this post was helpful ! Let me know if you have any questions and I can incorporate those answers into the post ! xo . <p> Oh ! Also exciting news ! - Better Homes &amp; Gardens- has nominated Sequins &amp; Things as one of their favorite life &amp; style blogs and are leaving it up to YOU to determine who is the best in their 2016 Blogger Awards .

I thought I 'd add a few little life updates throughout so read carefully . Hopefully there are n't  too many typos hah ! At the end , I 'm highlighting some of the things I 'm looking forward to next month ! = Enjoy ! <p> FAVORITE UNDER $50 PURCHASE : This is kind of a random favorite but I have literally worn these blue and white striped pajama shorts so many times since I bought them earlier this month . They 're so comfortable and cute . Perfect to wear to bed for your night time beauty rest or just around the house for a day of lounging , recoup and catching up on your shows ! <p> FAVORITE SPLURGE : I have been wearing this YSL straw handbag that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many outfits this time of year and I love to pair it with less expensive shoes like these Steve Madden sandals that I 'm wearing in todays OTHER post ! Yes , today you 're getting a double feature in honor of 4th of July ! = <p> FAVORITE NEW SHOW DISCOVERY / OBSESSION : I shared earlier this month how excited I was that Botched is back with a new season on Bravo . I also am a huge fan of Southern Charm but that 's nothing new . Does anyone else LOVE Cameran as much as I do ? I want to be real life besties with her ! My newest favorite show is Million Dollar Listing . I have watched a little bit of each season , I feel like , but I really got hooked on it a couple weeks ago when they were doing a marathon . I forgot how funny Fredrick and Ryan are and , the new guy , Ryan , is really good looking ! I 've heard Bloodline is so good . I think that 's what I 'm going to start next because Kyle Chandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone have any good show recommendations ? <p> FAVORITE INSTAGRAM POST : - I love the movement of the tunic and all of the colors together ! Taking good Instagram photos can be really difficult because you have to find places that are in good light at the time you 're shooting . One of my favorite spots to get a good shot , this pink wall , happened to be perfectly shaded when my friend and I were out and about . I love when it just naturally works out ! <p> And , I also always love the posts that take me a good bit of time to put together for you guys its a labor of love kind of thing , you know ? so I 'd also say that my 5 Summer Hair Products That You Need In Your Life . The photos turned out beautiful . I wish we had gotten a little more diversity in the product photos but , regardless , I loved it because I truly love every single product I reviewed and have been using them for awhile . Its always nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yall have asked ! <p> FAVORITE ACCESSORY BUY : These cat-eye mirrored sunnies are so sassy and fun ! I cant get enough of them and wear them as often as I can ! You can buy the sunnies HERE and you can check out more photos of me from the shoot below HERE . <p> FAVORITE BLOG SHOOT : Due to my deep love for the Trevi Fountain , my absolute favorite post of the month is THIS post showcasing an easy summer look with the most beautiful backdrop in all of Rome . <p> Although , shooting in front of the Duomo was a very close second : <p> Being able blend what Sequins &amp; Things has always been about style with my current hunger to see the world has been so fun and extremely rewarding . I understand its a little different than what Ive created and shared in the past , and not everyone is going to like that , but I do n't  want to stay the same forever . I 'm thankful for where S&amp;T originated but I want this space to be a genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of the sides to be reflected home decor , beauty , pet care , travel , style , etc but I wanted to focus on sharing more of myself with yall this year aside from JUST style. - S&amp;T will always be predominately about Sequins but it has to include the other things that I love and am passionate about , as well . Travel is just at the forefront of that effort right now . I hope that , over time , you 'll see and appreciate the fact that there 's multiple types of content to explore and engage in around here . = <p> FAVORITE LESSON / REALIZATION : I 've been thinking a lot about where I 'd like to see the blog go and what I 'd like to see happen in my personal life and what I 'd like for my focus to turn to more often . Ive been thinking about the feelings I 've had toward certain aspects of my life and why I feel that way and how I can find some kind of refreshment in that area . Ive been thinking a lot about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what the best approach would be to achieve them . The word that keeps coming to mind is boundaries and I 'm realizing that I need to set more of those . Some of these boundaries I do n't  really , at the heart level , want to set but I know its what needs to be done in order to get where I want to be and my hope is that I 'll have the understanding of the people that matter the most . A few quotes on Pinterest about boundaries have caught my attention and I thought I 'd share in case you may be struggling with something similar : <p> FAVORITE DEVELOPMENT BEHIND-THE-SCENES : This month was the first month that my assistant , Justine , has worked with me as the one and only client she manages . She usually likes to have her hand in a lot of different things but found the most enjoyment working with me and wanted to dedicate more uninterrupted time to our partnership . She is giving me all of her allotted work time to helping me behind-the-scenes on S&amp;T and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could possibly put into words and her being more present around my apartment and in the office , the more I 'll be able to streamline our roles . I 'm totally the kind of employer who is often has the thought oh , I need to tell Justine to take care of this .. actually , I 'll just do it real quick and then the more pertinent things that I really need to be focusing on and getting done gets pushed down the list . I 'm more distracted than ever these days and I have more content than ever to focus on putting out there to you guys so I literally feel so behind for that reason . <p> So , Justine has helped me brainstorm processes to put in place to help me focus better . *Goodbye push notifications for most apps ! *Weve come up with a weekly schedule that I 'll stick to to prevent me from misusing my time . Ill only go out and run errands on Wednesdays .

Were also coming up with new ways of getting back to your questions .

So , I 'll keep yall posted on any new system we put into place on to how to reach me and get answers to your questions . = <p> Another big development behind the scenes is the new website re-design . I chose what the homepage will look like from a few options that my designer came back with and I could NOT be more excited . There are so many fun features that were adding to make your experience here a little more unique and interesting , as well as making it much easier to find the content of mine that you 're looking for .

Heres what the actual ones look like : <p> And , here is what the dupes look like on : <p> The best part about the dupes is the fact that they 're only $50 ! <p> FAVORITE SONG : My favorite song is STILL No Promises by Cheat Codes and Demi Lovato . I literally never get sick of it ! I also love Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee with Justin Bieber . Its so catchy ! I wish I could speak Spanish , hah ! I had to look up what Despacito means and also had to Google the spelling of Despacito . But I 've honestly gotten back into listening to the Hamilton Soundtrack , which I loooove and have listened to to death since last year but still find it to be so fun ! <p> FAVORITE BEAUTY BUY : I do n't  know that I can pick a favorite !

In a little over a week , we will be celebrating our country 's independence and , as much as it 's one of my favorite holiday 's , I always stress a little bit about what to wear a little more on this holiday than most . I always feel like what I have as options are n't quite what I was wanting to wear or is n't quite appropriate for what my plans are .

Sure it has its perks but , at the end of the day , there is a job to get done and we have to make sure it does without walking past our room and being tempted by our comfortable bed ! <p> Since I 've been working on S&amp;T full-time for two years , Ive gotten caught up in the downsides to working from home and have come up with a few rules or tips on how to be the most productive when working from home ! <p> Get dressed every day . <p> Even though you are you 're own boss , there is something motivating about getting yourself ready for the day . Since S&amp;T has been up and running , there have been plenty of days where I am tempted to stay in my comfortable pajamas and opt for the whole I 'm just going to write this blog post from bed mentality . Historically , I am able to get the post done but its how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a more relaxed mentality as opposed to the let 's get stuff done mentality that I prefer to be in for work . I am much more productive and less stressed at the end of the days where I get myself ready for work , go in to my office and do those posts , get back to emails , file away important documents , go through mail and recent shipments , etc. at my desk . <p> Set your working hours . <p> This tip is for my fellow entrepreneurs . We have to set our own working hours for our own sanity . Our culture glamorizes the girl boss epidemic were seeing rise up and , while I 'm all for women being badasses , I 'm also worried about what this whole good things come to those who hustle- will do to our mental state , families and relationships in the next few years . I think we should keep focusing on setting goals and going after them but I also think we need to be a little better to ourselves and the people around us in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , set working hours . Those working hours may be more than most people who work for the man , and that 's fine , but allow yourself the time to rest and allow yourself the time to wake up in the morning without reaching for your phone to check your email or how your latest Instagram performed . Take your dogs for a walk . Make breakfast . Grab lunch with a friend . And , at a certain time in the late afternoon , stop working . Allow yourself to do OTHER THINGS . *gasp* Heaven forbid ! <p> Know how you 're wired . <p> Everyone 's clock is wound just a little bit differently in terms of productivity . My productivity hours are 7:00AM-1:00PM and then again from 6:00PM-12:00AM . Unless I have a shoot planned to take Instagram photos or an appointment , I opt for a short nap in the afternoon to recharge or enjoy some downtime on the couch to read . After focusing all morning , I need that little break for my brain to get back in to work mode . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . I know that 's not an option for everyone but the takeaway I want yall to have is to always do the highest priority items on my to-do list when I 'm typically MOST productive . <p> Prioritize your to do list . <p> To piggyback off of the last tip , I have found that its important to keep a running to do list . I keep- mine updated in my Notes on my computer . I italicize completed tasks and move it to the top of the list of items that still need to get done . When I start my day , I look at the items that I have left to do and I bold the- five things that I- need to get done during that- day then order them from highest priority to lowest priority with asterisks . <p> Okay , so I pulled this old to do list as an example . As mentioned , the italicized tasks are completed tasks and I continue the to do list by writing in regular font below the completed tasks . <p> In the morning , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as needed based on what really needs to get done during the day .

Clearly , my to do list is a mix of professional and personal items that need / I want to get done but , I typically prioritize work first and put personal items in- that lower priority spot because . typically , those are items I can do while accomplishing another task . For example , scheduling Fish &amp; Chips for their boarding appointment is lowest priority and can be done while I am driving to the Town Center to go to Lululemon . Does that make sense ? I also try and put the highest priority on- the tasks that I need the most mental energy to do i.e. writing blog posts and save the easier mental tasks for a lower priority . I hope that helps ! <p> Time block to assist in getting the most done in the least amount of time . <p> When you 're looking at the tasks you have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit that you want to get that task done . Then , when you are beginning that task , put away anything that distracts you from getting tasks done i.e.your phone , set your timer for that realistic time limit , and get to working ! If you do this , you will be amazed at how many things you will be able to get checked off of your to-do list ! <p> Get yourself organized ! <p> If I did n't  have file folders in my filing cabinet for certain documents or drawers &amp; baskets in my office closet designated for certain items &amp; products , I would be a very scatterbrained individual who barely gets anything done . If you 're constantly digging through a mess of papers or trying to find something to get a task done , your productivity level is going to drop and your stress level is going to skyrocket . Set aside time on a weekend to sort through the mess and get yourself organized . It definitely takes time and does n't  happen overnight . Its actually taken a trip to IKEA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend hours to get my office the way I want it but its getting there and I finally feel like its a place where I know I can efficiently get stuff done ! <p> Do your best to minimize distraction . <p> Our phones are our biggest distraction . Am I right ? Or am I right ? <p> If I do n't  have to make a phone call or post anything to social media , I put my phone in my room and set a reminder on my calendar to help me with my time blocking . However , if I have a conference call set , I keep my phone at my desk but do my best to not respond to anything that pops up while completing tasks . Its really difficult but the timer that is set keeps me focused . <p> Set a structure to your calendar . <p> My weekly calendar used to be a recipe for disaster and disappointment . I would schedule three appointments on complete opposite ends of town , tell myself I 'm going to shoot with Miguel , and also write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to plan things out a little more so that there is more of a structure . Mondays and Tuesdays are my work from home days , Wednesdays are my appointment days , Thursdays and Fridays are shooting days . I make up anything else that needs to get done on Saturday and Sunday but this structure has helped me my sanity immensely . <p> Hire people to help . <p> This tip is , again , for my fellow entrepreneurs . In hindsight , I should have done this much earlier than I did . Ever since I opted to go full-time as a blogger , my to do list was longer than what I could realistically get done in a day and , if that 's the case , you need to hire help . If you are working 90-hours a week and you are still overwhelmed by your to-do list , you need to hire help . Its okay if you cant get it all done . I do n't  think were wired to be able to run a business single-handedly . I think were wired for community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can come up with . I think two is always better than one . So , hire someone to help you but this could really be another post in and of itself make sure you 're hiring the right person for the task at hand or you 're just going to end up being even more overwhelmed with what is n't getting done ! <p> Get out ! <p> Working from home definitely has its perks but , eventually , you start to get cabin fever and feel a bit isolated without the typical accompaniment of co-workers . I do have an assistant but she can and is able to do a lot of her job for me from her own home office . She stops by throughout the week and we have our weekly meetings but I do n't  have someone working alongside me everyday ! So , to prevent me from feeling like a hermit , I make it a point to plan a lunch date with a friend once or twice a week as well as opt to go work at- a coffee shop on one or two mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay ahead of it , especially us introverts ! It 's so hard for us to WANT to go out and do stuff , but it 'll make you feel better ! <p> I hope this post has been helpful . Do you work from home and think I 've missed a key tip ? I 'm all ears ! We all know some days are harder than others and I 'm all about new ways to be better ! = xo. 129523 @qwx329523 <h> 28 thoughts on " 10 TIPS ON WORKING FROM HOME " <p> This is a great post Alyson .

I 've followed your IG and blog for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep doing what you do = ) <p> I love these tips too , especially about setting your work hours . I feel like people think owning your own business means always being on the clock , but this should n't be the case ! I went to a ted x talk recently and they said that people who actually used their vacation days were 14% more productive . I think our brain just needs a second to unplug . Also loved your trip about getting dressed . It always helps me get moving ! <p> That leanna girl is clearly uneducated and jealous of your successful blog . As if she knows how many hours and work are put into blog , I 've been running mine for about a year now and I love every single second of it ! These tips are a HUGE help for me for when I can blog full time in the future one day ! Do n't  stop being fabolous ! <p> I think these are great tips . I work from home often and these are great suggestions to follow . I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work done ! <p> P.S. Do n't  worry about the people who are mean to you . That girl , ( clearly not a woman who could ever have class ) funny enough , took the time to read your whole post and then gave criticism that was not helpful to anyone . Bad Karma ! <p> Btw I love your snapchat videos of your dogs and travel . Feels like we are on those trips with you , its great ! <p> Love these tips ! I 've found that I 'm less productive working from home ( my desk is in my room ) and half the time I end up lounging in bed all day . SO , when I do work from home , I prefer heading to a local cafe or Starbucks to work ! <p> Your office is amazing ! ! It would be a nice place to spend the day . Since I love your taste , I was wondering what kind of business card holder you use to keep in your purse or office tote ? I 'm looking but not finding anything that says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. Thanks ! ! <p> Haley , this is such an awesome post ! I do not get to work from home ( boo ) and I spend my days at an office in an 8-5 job but I found so many things in this post that are applicable to my day-to-day ! I really appreciate you putting this together . One questionI checked the sources and did n't  see it , is that a phone charger that you have yours docked in ? Or is it just a stand ? I would love to get something similar . <p> Haley your office is just gorgeous ! ! ! I just started my first full time job , but with my hours I have a lot more time to work on my blog now than I used to when I was in school , so I am still working on figuring out my " blogging " hours as well . This post was so , so helpful ! I love the idea of putting asterisks by to-do list items . <p> Love this post ! I do n't  work from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month in my previous job . Even just twice a month was tough I felt like my productivity really dropped and it made me doubt that I would ever be happy working from home full time . This post made me not only rethink that opinion but also get excited about it ! Maybe I am cut out for it , with the right tools and tricks = Thanks ! <p> I absolutely LOVE your office set up ! I work 40 hours a week at a day job and I 'm getting ready to go back to school for nursing . I am a major extrovert so having a place to focus and setting a structure to my days will definitely help me stay on track . <p> Love this post ! I am going into nursing so I 'm sure you know that means lots of homework time ! I am taking 2 out of 3 classes online right now , so this has given me great ideas on how to get things done more efficiently when at home . Thanks so much , have a great week ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing school ! Sometimes I had to make myself go to the library if I was getting too distracted at home . I still do that , except instead of the library its a coffee shop ! Hah ! Good luck ! xo . <p> What a post ! I 'm a teacher and have just started a masters degree and I have a lot of work to do at home . Ive been really struggling to motivate myself recently and so this week have begun to organise an office and just ordered the furniture ! Ca n't wait for it to be set up to use . Taking lots of style notes <p> Love this post ! ! My job allows me to work from home one day a week which can even be a struggle sometimes to stay focused . The single most important thing for me was to get dressed as if its any day going into the office . I fell into a rhythm of staying in my PJs the full day that I was working from home and I noticed I totally was not as productive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a storm on ideas for furniture and decorations for an office I absolutely love seeing other peoples office spaces too ! Your office is beautiful . <p> Great post ! I actually used to be a freelancer and i worked from home . It was a HUGE adjustment . People expect that working from home is super glam and laid back but its totally not . I rarely worked in my pjs otherwise I 'd feel like i was being lazy and unproductive . I associated home with work so I needed to get out often otherwise I 'd find myself just checking emails for a quick second and that quick second would turn into a few hours . Its tough ! I 'm really happy you shed some light on this . 
@@29465632 @3165632/ <h> TRAVEL DIARY SANTORINI , GREECE <p> Hey there ! I 'm so excited to finally share my Santorini travel diary with you ! We tried to squeeze as much as we could into our five days in Santorini as we could muster while also allowing ourselves to just enjoy it and relax a little bit , being that we were coming off of a week and a half of constant and fast travel . My initial thoughts on Santorini , upon arriving to our hotel , was that its like walking around in a dream fully awake . Its too beautiful to be real but it is . Let me tell you more about this place , our experience and what you need to know if you 're planning on going ! <p> The official name of the island of Santorini is actually- Thira , but everyone calls it Santorini . Before it was called Santorini , it was called- Kall+st- " , meaning the most beautiful one . The name Santorini originated in 1153 by the Venetians and was the culmination of two words : Santa and Irenene ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round island . Now , Santorini is a crescent-shaped island that sits along the water-filled caldera of a massive volcano . There are four other islands that line the flooded caldera , as well . A caldera is a volcanic feature that occurs when a volcano collapses into itself , essentially forming a large crater that usually happens after- the emptying of the magma chamber within the volcano following a large eruption . The eruption that caused the formation of the current caldera occurred in the 15th century BC and was likely one of the largest that has ever occurred ! The last eruption was in 1950 and the volcano is currently sleeping . <p> Due to the volcanic history , Santorini has white , black and red beaches . Its one of the only places in the world where you can experience all three in one place ! <p> The most popular cities on Santorini are Oia pronounced ee-uh and Fira pronounced fee-ruh . <p> Only 15,000 people actually live on the island of Santorini yet 1.5-2 million people visit every year ! <p> There are more churchs than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine in Santorini than water because of how little rain they get . <p> There is so much white and blue on the island of Santorini because they are the colors of the Greek flag . Blue represents the sky and the sea and the white represents purity . <p> Until 1960 , there was no electricity . There were only donkeys and fisherman . <p> - The edges of each stair on staircases and walkways are traditionally painted white because the walkways and staircases used to be poorly lit . The white helped people determine where the edges were so they would n't fall over a cliff . <p> Santorinis economy relies heavily on tourism . Greeces economy took a huge hit in 2008 and a lot of people are really struggling to come out on the other side since then . <p> We stayed at SUNROCKS BOUTIQUE HOTEL in Firostefani and had an amazing experience overall ! I seriously could not recommend it enough ! I 'd love to go back for my honeymoon one day ! <p> Here are some photos then I 'll list some Pros &amp;- Cons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absolutely stunning . It is kept pristinely clean , is covered in white paint and has beautiful views of the Aegean Sea . You will often see private boats / yachts and cruise ships sailing by . It 's hard to comprehend just how high up you are until you see the boats , then you 're like I know those boats are massive but they look so small from up here ! <p> Staff was extremely friendly and helpful . We had the same gentlemen serving us breakfast every morning . They were always so sweet and attentive . Definitely get the eggs with feta with toast ! It was my favorite ! <p> Margarita , the property manager , and Costas , the gentleman who graces the front desk , always greeted us with a smile , asked us how everything was going and what they could do to help make our day run a little smoother . <p> Victoria and I slept SO well here . The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable . <p> It was a very quiet place to stay . Guests keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In Europe , you never know how the shower situation is going to go . But , here , you will surely have a hot shower . I burned my hands a few times when I went to wash them because I forgot to also turn on the cold water on , as well . Also , showers in Europe rarely consist of a shower head that is in front of you at angle . It 's usually an above shower head and then a removable one that you has a hook at waist level . It 's a little frustrating , being that this is one thing that I think Americans do better , but you learn to deal . <p> You are given a small phone making it really easy to call the front office or office manager without having to worry about international charges . They encourage you to take it with you in case you need to call to arrange for a taxi to pick you up anywhere on the island . <p> They have lounge music playing frequently throughout the property . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a preset playlist that , I think , really adds to the experience . It helps you relax . <p> Their staff took care of our luggage for us . The stairs are really intimidating and they never want anyone to worry about carrying anything down the stairs but themselves . <p> Your room is cleaned twice a day ! I mean . who does n't  love walking into a clean room no matter WHAT time you walk into it ? It was amazing . <p> CON 'S <p> The restaurant at the hotel was a bit pricey . Thankfully , breakfast was included in the price of the room , otherwise , we probably would have opted to get breakfast in other local cafe 's . <p> If you have joint issues , beware ! There are A LOT of stairs , but that 's true of anywhere in Santorini ! <p> OTHER NOTES <p> PARKING : Parking is available and free for guests of SunRocks Santorini . <p> COST : Depending on the time of year , the rooms range from 200 to 800 Euro. - Book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WIFI : Available for guests in their rooms and in the pool area . <p> LOCATION : SunRocks Santorini is located in Firostefani . It is a 20-minute cab ride from the airport , which costs approximately 25 Euro ! Make sure you have cash available . <p> For the most part , the Greeks that we came across were very sweet and fluent in English so you wo n't get lost in translation too much , - but just in case , its common travel courtesy to try and know a few phrases in the primary language of the country you 're visiting ! Here are the ones that would be good for you to know when venturing to Santorini ! <p> Yaourti me meli Yogurt with honey ( always make sure you tell them if you have a nut allergy because sometimes they put walnuts on the top ) <p> HOTEL RESTAURANT- Firostefani We got a lot of traditional Greek dishes like calamari , greek salad and octopus . I also got the sea bass , I believe , and it was all delicious but much pricier than other meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This place is absolutely adorable in terms of aesthetic , and it has an amazing view of the sunset , however , I was n't too keen on the food . I got the Spicy Prawn Linguine and it just lacked a little something . I love shrimp pasta dishes when I 'm in America but , I 'm learning from experience that they 're just not as good abroad for some reason . <p> WHY NOT ! SOUVLAKI Firostefani- On our last night , we really just wanted to relax and chill out in our suite so we put some warm sweaters and joggers on and walked over to this little place to get some good Greek takeaway . There was a line out the door , which we took as a clear sign it was authentic and delicious . And , it was . We got a Greek Salad , Fried Feta , Fresh Pita Bread , Pork Slovaki and Lukaniko which is sausage on a stick . It was DE-LICIOUS . <p> CAFE GALINI- Firostefani- We popped into this little cafe down the street from Why Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was absolutely adorable inside and we agreed we wanted to pop in again on our last morning to enjoy one last frappe with a beautiful view but we ended up getting done with packing and eating breakfast right as we needed to be checking out . But , the baklava was really , really good a little too rich and sweet for me , personally , but still . Highly recommend ! <p> TAVERNA LIMANAKI VLYCHADA Vlychada Beach We got a few appetizers here before heading back to Thira on our last day after exploring Vlychada Beach . The food was okay . I personally thought the Greek Salad was amazing but the calamari was not . Also , based on some reviews Ive read on Trip Advisor , I 'd recommend NOT going for the catch of the day if they offer that to you . Our server was nice but he also tried to get Victoria and Is number when we never gave the impression we wanted to get together with him . We felt like that was a little inappropriate . <p> RED BICYCLE Oia- This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers but , we called and they actually were n't going to be opening for the season until our last day in town . We said we would just play it by ear and see how we felt about heading back to Oia to check it out but , opted to do something different . But , since so many people recommended it I 'm letting you know you should check it out if you have the chance ! <p> SUNSET TAVERNA Amoudi- Bay- Amoudi Bay is the port just underneath the white-wash buildings and red cliffs of Oia , and Sunset Taverna is one of a few restaurants that sit right on the water where guests can enjoy delicious food with a stellar view of the sunset and boats bobbing in the water or passing through the port . If you 're not entering the bay by boat , you 'll have to walk down from the top of Oia , which takes about 20 minutes . Beware of donkey poo ! <p> Also , be sure to make a reservation for this restaurant ahead of time if you are visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks ahead of time ! - We also got there a bit late because we did n't realize how far it is from the top of Oia and he said said they would n't have been able to keep our table for us if we were visiting during that time , as well , so be sure to give yourself enough time to get there before your reservation ! - Overall , we had a really good experience . When you reach the bay , you can see just how clear the water is . We could see LOADS of sea urchins clinging to the bottom and to cement blocks . <p> It was so interesting . Once you 're seated , your waiter will have you come to the fish counter to pick out the fish they will make for you . He suggested four small red snapper for us and it was delicious . We also enjoyed Greek salad , octopus , and tzatziki among some other small plates . I really cant recommend this place enough ! We really enjoyed it ! <p> Check out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Santorini and we werent there long enough to do it all but I thought it might be helpful to lay out our itinerary over our five- days and four nights in Santorini . <p> DAY 1 // We arrived in Santorini around 3:30/4:00pm and hailed a taxi to- SunRocks Boutique Hotel in Firostefani from the airport , which was very easy to navigate- It was about a 15-minute drive from the airport and cost 25 Euro ! We were greeted by Margarita , the hotels manager , who was so friendly and informative . She brought us down to our room and by the time we said goodbye to her and did a little bit of unpacking , we got changed to go enjoy the sunset and some dinner up by the pool , which is where the hotel restaurant is . We could NOT stop snapping pictures ! It was SO pretty ! here 's one I grabbed from my camera roll : <p> After we were done with dinner , we essentially ran downstairs to get into bed . We were SO tired we could n't wait to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but made it up to eat breakfast before they stopped serving it at 11:00- then R E L A X E D on our terrace and sunbathed for awhile . It was SO needed . Honestly , after you travel for so many days in a row through cities like Venice , Florence and Rome , you 're completely exhausted . We were really happy to end our trip in Santorini because it really allowed us to unwind and just enjoy being away from the hustle and bustle of being home . <p> We ordered frappes and I literally just sat on our ledge and took the view in for a solid 5-minutes , uninterrupted . It felt good just letting myself be still , and should probably happen more often . I did n't  know Victoria took this until she sent me all the photos from our trip hah , but this was essentially me just taking it all in from our terrace : <p> Eventually , I started venturing around to see if I could find an even better view and ended up finding this spot where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ! <p> After we spent the afternoon in the sun , we got cleaned up and decided to walk around Firostefani , the little city we were staying in just outside of Fira , and found this iconic location . <p> Then , we took a taxi down to- Oia to walk around then eat dinner around sunset , which was about a 10-minute ride and was 15 Euro . We walked around a little bit but it was MUCH more crowded than we realized it would be . When cruise ships are docked , everyone gets out and flood the super narrow streets . <p> Here are some snaps Victoria snapped during our walk-through , despite the crowds : <p> We ventured down a long pathway to the bottom and enjoyed a sunset dinner at Sunset Taverna , a fish tavern at the bottom , right on the water . If you tell your waiter that you need a taxi before you leave , they will call one for you , like they did for us ! <p> DAY 3- // We slept in a bit again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sleep had really caught up to us ! We decided to enjoy breakfast from our little front porch / terrace instead of going up to the pool . <p> Then , we got ready and got- a taxi to Santo Winery for a wine tasting after receiving so many recommendations . It is supposedly an amazing place to catch the sunset but we went just after midday and loved that it was n't packed ! Again , keep in mind , we went in late April before the really busy season starts . However , just as we were leaving , a big tour bus full of people came so we really lucked out ! <p> We finished up around 3:30-4:00pm and got a taxi back to Firostefani and decided to walk over to Fira , the capital of Santorini , to check it out ! There 's a lot of hustle and bustle in this area and its- known for its nightlife . - We honestly did n't find it that appealing during the day . We thought the walk from Firostefani , where our hotel was , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the cruise ships port at the bottom and people taking donkeys up to the top , which was kind of cool . They do n't allow donkeys to work for more than a couple of hours so they do n't get overworked , which I really liked to hear . What 's with the donkeys ? The Greeks would use donkeys to carry their fish and vegetables and imports up to the top , where everyone lived because it was so steep , in years past . <p> Once we entered Fira , though , we realized that it was pretty crowded and unappealing so we- decided to head back toward our hotel when we- spotted the adorable Remvi Restaurant and decided to eat there for dinner . It was probably the cutest restaurant we ate at but , sadly , I was n't super impressed by the food ! <p> DAY 4 // Victoria and I ate breakfast at the hotel again hi , its free ! then asked Costas , at the front desk , where we should go . We decided to take his suggestion and head over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then , we ventured over to Vlychada Beach , a black sand beach with cliffs behind it that look like the moon . It was beautiful but we- did n't realize that some of the locals see it as a nudist beach ! Then , we ate at another fish taverna by the water . <p> When we got back to the hotel , - we were given the key to the suite that we wanted to stay in the whole time their SunRocks Suite with Private Pool ! It was INSANE . If anyone wants somewhere romantic and beautiful to stay , I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this suite . Its such a romantic spot and , I mean , I got to enjoy it with one of my great friends but , if me getting to experience it with her leads any of you to getting to experience it with your man than that will make me really happy = <p> Like , yall check out this pool ! ! <p> I could have sat out there all day ! We popped open a bottle of wine which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your room and sat out there for awhile and chatted about our favorite parts of the trip and where we would potentially want to go next together ! We are thinking somewhere tropical next time ! Any guesses ? = <p> After we got all settled in and chatted for a bit , we both just kind of took some time to unwind and recharge . Then , for dinner , we - walked down the street from the hotel to a souvlaki take-out place- and took it back to our hotel . We needed to pack after that and we also had a lot of work to make sure we did while we were together being that this was our last night together . <p> DAY 5 // Victoria and I let ourselves wake up whenever as it was the day we were checking out and heading back to London , but our flight was n't until later in the - day and it was direct . We went up and ate our last breakfast at the hotel restaurant and said goodbye to all the guys who had served us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel staff brought up our luggage and we sad our goodbyes to Margarita and Costas . I promise , if you stay at SunRocks you will be so sad to leave not just Santorini , but the people who work there ! They were all SO nice ! <p> We left a couple of hours before our flight , which was plenty of time ! Santorinis airport is very small and their processes are a little unorganized . The airport was only boarding two flights at the time . Each flight was in a separate LONG line on either side of the entrances of the airport . They were regulating entry but the airport staff kept- ensuring us that everyone would be let in with enough time to make their way through by the time we- needed to board our flight , but it was seriously moving so slow AND we kept getting confused because every few minutes there was an overhead announcement saying that if you 're flying to London , proceed to Gate 2 to get ready to board . So , we were so confused by the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making that announcement . Eventually , one of us walked up there and happened to mention that we had EasyJets Speedy Boarding so they let us through to the front . It was really weird how they do the check-in process so just a heads up ! <p> EXPLORE AKROTIRI- This is the archeological site of the ancient settlement that existed in the Minoan Bronze Age that was obliterated by an enormous eruption of the volcano around 1627 BC . Somehow all of the people that lived in the settlement at the time were able to evacuate so- there were no people preserved in the ruins . But , you can see fine frescos , small objects and pieces of artwork . <p> BOAT TOUR This was- something A LOT of people suggested and we just did n't  end up pulling the trigger on it ! HOWEVER , there are tons of companies in the area that put them on and we heard rave reviews about other guests who have opted to do them and LOVED it ! We were told that a lot of times there is a morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening tour at Oia during sunset . I think seeing Santorini from the sea would be really cool and special ! Look into it ! <p> HIKE FROM OIA TO FIRA OR VICE VERSA I honestly wish that Victoria and I had had time to do this ! The hike takes about 2 to 4 hours , depending on your pace , and I bet its incredible if you love being outdoors and doing active things ! I 've heard there is n't much shade so be sure to wear a hat , bring water with you and wear sunscreen ! This path is called the Calderimi , the path along the caldera of the volcano . <p> GO TO RED BEACH Victoria and I kept going back and forth over whether to go to Red Beach or Vlychada and , ultimately , Vlychada won but Red Beach looks just as cool and stunning ! You can definitely do both in a day so , do n't  think you cant just because we did n't  ! = There are some other beaches that were recommended to us , like Perissa Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs and- Kamari Beach pebbles . <p> DONKEY RIDE UP OR DOWN IN FIRA OR OIA Okay , this might not be for everyone and that totally makes sense . I did n't  really want to seek out the opportunity to have one of those cuties take me up or down a long , steep , narrow walkway BUT , it is something you can do in Fira and in Oia . We were told that the donkeys only work a couple of days a week for a couple of hours so they do n't  get overworked . They said the donkeys are VERY well taken care of , as well . I do n't  know how valid that is , to be honest , and I did n't  see any donkeys close up but , from the photos Ive seen , they look very healthy and also pretty bored . I 'm not sure how busy they get ! <p> VENTURE TO OTHER WINERIES : We enjoyed Santo Winery but were also told that were Arygros , Sigalas , Venetsanos , and Gaia Wines- were worth checking out , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best wine , just from personal experience , but who does n't  love trying out new wine ? <p> - RENT A CAR OR FOUR-WHEELER TO MAKE TRANSPORT EASIER We kept debating about whether or not we should rent a car and I think it probably would have been more cost effective for us , to be honest . They drive on the same side of the road as they do in the States so I 'm sure it would have been easy but , it was one more thing for Victoria and I to juggle when we were working as we were traveling through and exploring . I also will say to be careful if you do opt to drive ! The roads are narrow and windy ! <p> GO CLIFF JUMPING AT AMOUDI BAY This one is for the risk-takers ! I really wish I had known about this before our trip . It looks SO FUN ! This IS a dangerous thing to do and I encourage anyone who is interested in doing this to be VERY careful . HERE is an article I found that tells you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its right next to the little fish tavernVictoria- and I ate at in Amoudi Bay below Oia . <p> SANTORINI HIGH SEASON : March through May is when Santorini- starts to see visitors , right around the Easter holiday . June through August is the peak season where you 'll experience heavy crowds . September and October are great months to visit because there are n't  as many visitors but the weather is still really pleasant ! Be sure to book your hotel 2-months in advance to ensure availability ! <p> TAXI PAYMENT : Be sure to carry cash with you because taxis are NOT equipped with card machines . Do your best to always have cash on hand , although we had two sweet taxi drivers who were willing to stop and let us get money out at an ATM . The rate to our hotel which was in Firostefani from the airport- was 25 Euro . The rate from- Firostefani to Oia was about 15 Euro . <p> TIPPING : Add 7-10% tip- to your overall bill ! <p> LANGUAGE : Most Greek 's know a good bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave them by offering a hello , thank you and goodbye in their native tongue . <p> THE GREEK PEOPLE + CULTURE : Here are a few takeaways that I gathered through my time and experience in Greece , as well as through Victoria , whose Dad is Greek ! <p> In my experience , most Greeks are fun-loving , charming and easy-going , although definitely a bit blunt . <p> Do n't expect a lot of organization when you come to Greece , though ! It 's madness everywhere you go but that 's just the way it is so do your best to know it ahead of time and not let it get to you ! They say that 's all just part of the experience and you just have to roll with it ! <p> It 's also a big part of their culture to share multiple dishes amongst everyone at the table and then share a dessert . I never had a bad meal and the one that I did n't fancy as much was the one I did n't share with anyone ! Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck with the way the Greeks do it ! <p> Most of the time they will bring you a sweet dessert as a courtesy or a liquor at the end of your meal to help with digestion . Your experience in some of the bigger cities is definitely dependent on cruise ships . From the Firostefani area , we could see the cruise ships passing through to get to Oia , however , we did n't put two and two together until after we went to Oia and realized that it 's a madhouse when the cruise ships are in port . <p> - People usually eat really late in Greece so , if you are looking to go out you should n't go out until around 1:00AM . <p> GOOD TO KNOW : - Everything is EXTREMELY expensive due to high import costs and because , well , they know people will pay the price because everyone charges around the same ridiculous price . I was an idiot and purchased sunscreen and after-sun cream when I was in Oia and it was almost 40 Euro . STUPID HALEY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> WHO SHOULD VISIT SANTORINI : Santorini is a destination for anyone wanting a relaxing getaway , like couples , small families with children above the age of 12 or small groups of girlfriends . It 's not really a place for anyone looking to have a bunch of crazy nights out . If that 's what you 're looking for , head to Mykonos . However , if you do want a bit of a night out , there are more places to go in Fira . There is only one bar in Oia . <p> We had an AMAZING time in Santorini and wish we could have stayed longer ! However , I do hope this little diary about our time in Santorini and the takeaways were helpful if you are planning a future trip there ! No matter what you do you will leave with a new favorite place you 'll be yearning to come back to as soon as possible !

THANK YOU for such a thorough review and helpful tips . We are looking for a balance of relaxation and activity , and I appreciate all of the photos and information = <p> I love how detailed and thorough your travel posts are ! They 're immensely helpful , and I love that you also shared your itinerary . You always hit on all the most important points in your travel guides . I 've always known I 've wanted to go to Santorini ( and Mykonos ) for my honeymoon , and this absolutely confirmed that ! ! <p> This is such a great breakdown of what to do . This wasnt on my radar , even though I 've heard incredible things about it , but I believe its just inched its way onto my bucket list ! ! Thanks especially for the detailed breakdown , cost estimates and restaurant suggestions ! <p> Does anyone rent apartments via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , are there any small grocers or farmers markets you could visit if you decided to rent an apartment ? <p> Hey Kate ! Thanks ! I 'm glad I could spark a little wanderlust for this place in ya ! Its amazing ! <p> And , yes ! there are AirBNBs that might be more cost effective but might not have that Santorini ocean view that a lot of the resorts have ! Most of the resorts are set within the cliffs of the inside crest of the island so they have those stunning ocean , often infinity type , views that you see in so many photos . So , it just depends on what your needs , cares and wants are in terms of accommodations = <p> What gorgeous photos ! I love how you broke down what you did day by day to give a sense of how many days to plan to spend in Santorini and hope you do this with your other travel diaries . I also appreciate your transparency on costs since it is ( unfortunately ) a factor when planning travel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nice ! !

@@29465635 @3165635/ <h> BLUE DRESS UNDER $100 IN BOBOLI GARDENS <p> Hi friends ! This outfit is the first of three I 'll be sharing from my recent visit to Florence ! I 'm going to preface this post by saying two of the three I 'm sharing from Florence are very unrealistic if you 're a traveller and looking to explore this beautiful city . I would not recommend wearing heels around the city , hah ! But there were a couple of backdrops that I felt were perfect for these outfits in Florence so just take them as outfit inspiration rather than travel outfit inspiration . = <p> These photos were taken in Boboli Gardens in Florence . Its an amazing place to visit in the Spring because everything is in bloom and is absolutely beautiful . I also feel like the view of the Duomo is absolutely stunning and much less crowded than Piazzalle Michaelangelo . This was a place I did n't  make it to during my last trip to Florence and Ive seen photos of this beautiful wisteria tunnel in the gardens online before so I told Victoria that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said we missed full bloom by about a week so they said it was n't as magnificent as it was but I do n't  know about you but I do n't  get to experience wisteria where I 'm from so I thought it was stunning ! <p> This blue dress , once I had it altered , fit like a dream . I love the form fitting top half with the V-neck and the wing detailing in the back . I would suggest pinning the wings to help them stay back consistently with a really small safety pin on each side. - I feel like it is definitely a dress that needs a belt because there is n't a seam in the middle and , if you do n't  wear a belt , it looks a bit incomplete . This is an amazing under $100 option if you have a summer wedding , bridal shower , baby shower , or your next Sunday church service coming up ! <p> Thanks for stopping by today , yall !

Its been really fun perusing all the different home decor retailers trying to find the best pieces for my living room , office , and small spare room . Each one has SO many products , and it takes so long to dig through each ones inventory ! It almost feels like I 'm on a treasure hunt because when I find a piece that is exactly what I 'm looking for I feel like I struck gold or something ! Ha ! I am looking for large furniture pieces , like a couch , loveseat , chairs , TV stand , coffee table , desk , book shelf with drawers for files , and rugs so I incorporated small pieces of decor in the options above but mostly stuck to furniture pieces that are all styles that I personally love . Obviously , you have to choose an avenue when it comes to home decor , so I incorporated silver AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with glass , black with gold hardware , etc just to give yall some inspiration to run with . I want my apartment to maintain a consistent theme throughout , and I cant wait for it all to come together ! The hardest thing for me to choose has been the couch and coffee table . For whatever reason , I just am so scared to just decide and commit to one ! I know what chairs I want in my living room and I already got a TV stand you would think itd be easy to go from there . <p> I get my first piece of furniture tomorrow , which will allow me to start decluttering one area of my home . Itll where my bar car and small gallery wall used to be . Its going to be a busy couple of weeks . I need to get the carpets cleaned . I need to get the area that is my office now decluttered and cleaned out by next Friday . I need to get my room moved over to Kristans room by then , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room so my bedroom move ca n't happen until then . So many logistical things that you need to plan for , you know ? Ill be doing my best to have some blog posts up next week but probably not as many as I usually do . As I mentioned on Monday , I am focusing on taking care of myself this year in addition to getting organized so I am meeting with a trainer today . I have no idea where that will be placed in my schedule and how it will affect things but I am just going to get what I can done but not overdo it . If I try and overdo it then I 'll never get organized and I 'll never do what I need to do to better myself , you know ? Too many times in the past I have just hustled way too hard just to get content up everyday and its just not always realistic . <p> I have a lot of travel content I need to catch up on and share with yall , so I 'm hoping to share one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yall want Amsterdam or Tulum first ? Over the weekend , I 'm also going to get that survey put together for yall to fill out . I 'm really interested in hearing what you want to see more of and less of from me !

@@29465644 @3165644/ <h> TRAVEL STYLE WITH NORDSTROM <p> Hey there , lovelies ! Ive been a little MIA on the blog and on Instagram since I left for my trip to Italy and honestly its been kind of nice to just disconnect from the online world / life and just reconnect with people I have n't seen or caught up with in a really long time . If you missed it on Snapchat , I am staying just outside of Sorrento , Italy with my friend from college , Sarah Kate , and her family . She is getting married this weekend to her long-time beau , Domenico , who is from Naples . Sarah Kate was my nomad friend and the friend who always had ideas on how to solve a problem in a way no one else would . She is creative , funny and always seeking adventure so , after college , she moved to Italy to teach English and , sure enough , she met the love of her life . This was years ago and I 've been asking her for ages when they were going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 've always loved Sarah Kates family . Her mom and I are similarly tender-hearted so we have shared many laughs and stories and tears with each other over the years . I have n't seen her in a few years because you know that happens after college . You just do n't  see people and their families as often anymore as everyone goes their separate ways . Sarah Kate &amp; her hubby live in Chicago ; her parents have been living in the Bahamas I had never really gotten to know her Dad TOO well so , the other day , everyone was out running errands and it was just he &amp; I at the villa were staying at for the week and we literally talked for FIVE hours . Now I love her family even more ! I did n't  necessarily NEED to come this early but SK was like I want you here , come ! And , I was like you know what .. its not often I can see them and spend that much time with them . Theyre such good people so- I 'm really excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all week . <p> On Friday , when I flew out of Jacksonville , I wore this outfit for the first leg of my journey to JFK then ended up changing into leggings , a sports bra , tank and sweatshirt for the long flight . I absolutely love these pink bow slides . They 're so fun and I thought they had sold out for good about a month ago , then saw them restocked and got really excited for any of you who may not have snagged them yet ! I had purchased this top in lavender back in February and I 'm so excited its now available in additional colors ! I love this yellowy/chartreuse color a lot . It will go great with turquoise and I especially love it with pink ! I went one size up because , from experience , I know this top is a little short and I wanted it to be a little longer and oversized . I purchased this pink Gucci cross body bagfrom their new collection and I could n't be more obsessed with it . Nordstrom is carrying this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style of the bag . It seems like a great practical everyday bag if you 're looking for a good designer investment to make . It also comes in black , which will go with more than the pink I think , depending on your style . <p> I seriously cant believe this weekend is Memorial Day weekend . This year is flying by . Before we know it , well be buying Christmas presents . This- week , as I mentioned , I 'll be hangin with SK and her family . Were going out on a boat on Thursday and heading over to an island that is on my list of things to see while I 'm here , so I cant wait to do that ! Tomorrow , I 'm trying to solidify plans with a local photographer to shoot some outfits before the weekend festivities and before some people come and meet me out here to REALLY explore the area . Ive been working on our itinerary over the last couple of days and I just ca n't wait for them to get here ! - Ca n't wait to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear off enough ! Ill be sharing my French Riviera packing guide with yall tomorrow so be sure to check it out ! Thanks for stopping by today , yall ! xo . <p> I rarely comment but was SO happy to hear that you 're taking time for yourself . Good for you , lady ! ! You deserve the chance to unplug and enjoy time with loved ones without feeling guilty about it . Hope the rest of your trip is just as wonderful as the past few days have been ! <p> Aw , thanks Karla ! I think I still experience guilt when I unplug because social media never sleeps . I love creating content and see other people still posting just as they go through their day to day but , at the same time , I think when you work in social media you lose sight of what it is like to not be consumed with work 24/7 . Unplugging to some is just posting old content instead of new but REALLY allowing yourself to just ignore social media is something I think we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cherish those relationships and sit in that company and just laugh . Its not often you get to crate memories like those ! Everyone needs a break every now and then . Even bloggers ! And who knows , this little break might spur some awesome ideas for your blog ! ! = <p> Is it totally sad that I 've been checking back on your blog every day and I 'm like ugh , she has n't  posted I miss Haley ! ! Haha = I totally know what you mean though , it is so nice to disconnect from social platforms sometimes especially when traveling so you can really soak in what you 're exploring . Ca n't wait to see more on your trip !

I got them in the mail and I literally could wear them EVERY.DAY . They are so soft and flattering ! They 're super lose when you 're having one of those days where you just need your space , if you know I mean . They 're a little pricier than I think they 're really worth but , due to their insane comfort and flattering cut , I highly recommend them ! I went super plain jane with how I styled them here a basic white tee and some gray accessories , which have been my go to lately ! These sandals are so flattering and reasonably priced . They also seem to never sell out in sizes . <p> Alright , well I 'm off to grab some breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with- Kaylee ! Ca n't wait to share more of this beautiful place with yall !

You may think I do n't  because I work for myself but I assure you . I have had COUNTLESS other jobs before blogging full-time so I do get it. - During my trip to Europe last month , I got to check off one of the places I 've had on my travel lust list for quite some time Burano and it did NOT disappoint . <p> I will be sharing a travel diary from my day in Burano with you all later this week if this trip allows ! I still have to put it together but , if not this week , then definitely next week = <p> The outfit in this post is made up of basic wardrobe staples that are perfect for early Spring travel or just everyday errands .

They definitely need a little breaking in , with the warmth of a hair dryer . I still need to do that when I get back . But I do think they 're very comfortable and cant wait to stretch out the back when I have a little more time on my hands upon arriving back in the States . If you 're looking for something really similar that is a little bit more affordable THIS option is essentially the same and comes in multiple colors . I like the light blue ones although I feel like the pink goes with a little bit more of my wardrobe , personally . <p> - There is another place that were going to be visiting that is somewhat similar to Burano while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant wait to visit it , explore it and share it with you ! I 've heard its a cant miss because its beautiful but also because its not flooded with tourists .

Kristan , my stepmom and I ventured up to the local town of Massa Lubrense and enjoyed lunch with my friend Sarah Kate , who just got married to her long-time beau , Domenico , over the weekend ! Kristan had n't  seen her in years and they really wanted to cross paths during our time here . I was happy we were able to make that happen .

@@29465653 @3165653/ <h> SUNSET ON THE SPANISH STEPS + LABOR DAY SALES <p> Hi friends ! As many of you know , Ben and I ventured over to Rome for the weekend . He had a Bank Holiday on Monday , so we figured why not take advantage being that its the only one he has while I 'm here and go somewhere ? <p> For those of you wondering what the heck a bank holiday is . Do n't  worry , I was right there with you when I came to visit in December Bank holidays are , essentially , a day when banks are closed . They are viewed as a public holiday and thus , citizens in the UK get to enjoy a paid day off from work . They have about eight or so a year and are the best excuse to get out of town for the weekend . <p> We were so excited leading up to it . Ben had n't  been to Rome since he was 14 and I had never been . It has been number 1 on my travel lust list for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and see it all for myself ! The first day was jam-packed . We got up so early and did so much more on that in a later blog post and , after taking a small , much-needed nap , we decided to catch the sunset before heading to dinner . He really wanted to see it from Pincio lookout point but , for whatever reason , our taxi driver dropped us off a little early at the top of the Spanish Stepsinstead . There 's a church there called the Trinit+ dei Monti and , if you climb its stairs , the view is spectacular . I tried my best but I really do n't  think my photo does it justice ! <p> So many of you asked about this pleated rust-colored top after I featured it on Instagram . My sincerest apologies that the LTK emails never went out . There was a little glitch during the set up that caused it to link incorrectly . Thankfully that does n't  happen too often .. Anyway , I 'm wearing a UK 6 in the top , which is equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XS . I think its so adorable . I love the ladylike detail around the neckline and pleats throughout . For my ladies who work in a very professional dress setting , this top would be adorable tucked into a pencil skirt and paired with suede heels , in my opinion ! With a neat top knot and smart glasses ? Ugh . Yes ! 129525 @qwx329525 <p> After snapping these photos and enjoying the sunset , we headed over to the Trastevere area along the west side of the Tiber for dinner at Taverna Trilussa . I was a little scared after I read the menu because its not a traditional American Italian restaurant , but decided to stick it out . I 've heard that when that 's the case in Italy you are in for a treat . I blindly chose ravioli with a white sauce and seriously contemplated ordering another serving of it . It was SO GOOD . By the end , we were too full to order dessert but our server would n't let us leave without trying a little something . He sneakily placed a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he walked by the next time . After devouring the whole thing in less than two minutes , we really regretted the let 's skip dessert decision but were thankful we can now say we know where to get the best tiramisu in Rome . <p> Can we take a second and appreciate Bens great photography skills ? He took all of these outfit photos . To be honest , because I 've been single since I started my blog , having him take my photos was something I was really unsure about at first . It seemed a little unnatural , in my mind , because I 'm so used to setting aside time in my work schedule to shoot outfit photos . I 'm not used to incorporating it into my personal life schedule that I share with someone else . Its not wrong . Obviously , there are plenty of bloggers whose husbands have assumed the position of helping their blogger wife or girlfriend capture content for their blogs on the weekend or while traveling together . However , I did n't  want him to feel like he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked forward to being able to accurately capture my life , style and travels organically with the help of someone I do life with but , I do n't  want it to negatively affect our time together or be a thorn in the side of that person or our experience overall . So , with all that said , I wanted it to be a conversation with Ben rather than an expectation of him . <p> In every conversation we 've had about it , Ben has said that , when it comes to the blog , he wants to help and be apart of what I am creating . Within reason , of course . As with anything . There should , obviously , be more time spent on quality time together exploring and enjoying where we are than just using our time together &amp; travel location as merely a backdrop for a bunch of outfit posts . I could n't ever let that be reality , anyway . I love exploring cities too much . But , he sees the backend of what I do not only how much work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so , he s happy to help me tell these stories that would otherwise go untold , so to speak . Thankfully , even with the photography learning curve , we knocked these photos out in 15 minutes and got the enjoy the rest of the sunset . <p> I hope yall have had a great week ! I know it has been a little quiet around here lately but I 'm really trying to practice healthy living and choosing grace over perfection . I probably could have gotten more blog posts up last week but I decided to only do what I could . There 's a lot of backend stuff that 's been needing my attention so I decided to focus on getting all that done before I left for Italy on Thursday of last week . Instead of staying up late every night , I 've been opting to go to bed at a decent hour and choosing to remember that I 'm only one person and that , even though I want to get a post up every day , I do n't  HAVE to get a blog post up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . I think , in my head , I hate that it looks to you like I 'm not working when there is n't one up . I 'm realizing more and more that its okay . Some weeks I 'll have more than others , especially while I 'm here , and maybe its better that way . Anyone else have any work-life struggles you deal with ? Feel free to share ! Let 's be friends . <p> With all that said , I am so glad I was able to get this post up for you today and , Im excited that I have some fun posts in store for you next week ! Yall get to enjoy a long weekend and there are TONS of great sales to take advantage of . I 've rounded up a couple of my favorites here : <p> Thanks for the restaurant recommendation my son is studying in Rome this semester and is at John Cabot University in Trastevere ! Ill let him know how much you enjoyed it : ) Kudos to Ben on his photography skills the photos look great ! <p> I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weigh in on the time management part . At one point in my life last year , I tried to please too many people working two businesses and my full-time job so much so that I did n't  have time for anyone I love . I gave everything my all because I was worried people would think I was n't working or serious if I took some time off . Then I lost one of my dearest friends ( I kept telling him I did n't  have time to hang out ) , and it made me realize just how important it is to just make time for myself and for my loved ones . I think were often our own worst critics . We do n't  realize people are more understanding than we think , and we often do n't  realize the importance to " recharge " . Youve been a huge inspiration to me . You were the blogger that made me realize I could do my job at a hospital and blog ! ! So thank you SO much for that ! And also , my hubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got married , so I totally understand the importance of spending time with Ben while you can as well ! = <p> These pictures came out great , good job Ben ! My boyfriend has been my blog photographer since the beginning ( he s also the one who pushed me so hard to actually start one ) . This post is exactly what I 'm going through right now in terms of work- lift struggles . Work has been super stressful the last month and I almost feel guilty working on my blog so I have n't been posting as much , its killing me ! But I 'm with you that I 'd rather post a few quality posts rather than a bunch of little ones that were just thrown together . Have a great weekend &lt;3 xx Tess Sequins are the New Black <p> What a great post ! I would much rather you enjoy yourself ( and be able to recommend European spots ! ) and have a few quality and heartfelt posts than just some random things thrown together for the sake of having a post =

You do n't  have to stay there to go- up there , which is nice = <p> Dreamy , right ? <p> Sneak shot of Whit and I taking pics at sunset with Larry , one of the guys from Nashville , who is friends with all the gals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He owns a really cool business called Cause A Scene . Its pretty cool what they do bring quality music and the musicians behind it- to smaller venues to really connect with people . Check them out ! <p> When I 'm near the ocean , my mind quickly goes to the just how Great our God is . The ocean , even from this one spot , seems- so vast but , if you looked at a map , you can see that- its such a small piece of a much larger ocean . There 's so much more to it than I can see , - just- like our stories and- His love for us . Right now , He s working things out in our lives even though we cant see clearly what is on the horizon and its all because- His love for us is SO deep even deeper than we can even see from where we sit on the shoreline in our worldly flesh . What a beautiful thought it is that God is so much bigger and deeper than we can see , grasp and imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that His love for us , like the ocean , has no end . <p> " Whom have I in heaven but you ? And earth has nothing I desire besides You . My flesh and my heart may fail , - but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever . " Psalms 73:25-26 <p> I wore this on Sunday morning to take Whit to get some medicine at CVS . Her sinuses were bothering her so bad , so we went there and then headed over to Fonville Press for coffee talk , a little bit of work and quiet time before the beach ! <p> Shop the outfit here : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I think the purse is going to sell out- everywhere soon ! I had to search through quite a few retailers to find it available somewhere for yall , so- do n't  wait if you 're thinking about buying it ! My dress is only $34 . I 'm wearing an XS . It runs a little bit . If you click on the THIS link you can find the same dress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yummy Chicken &amp; Waffles breakfast from The Pearl ! #noregrets <p> Yesterday was beautiful ! After brunch , I took a little nap because I had a bit of a headache but , after that , I was good to go and headed down to the beach for a majority of the day : <p> We were a group of 10 gals total . You would think that there would be drama or that it would be hard to share a small space , but we all got along beautifully . We enjoyed time together but we would break off into smaller groups and there was never any talk of other gals . We all got along so well . It was awesome . Last night , we went to Georges in Alys Beach for dinner and enjoyed one last night together . We ended the night the way we did last year with a " Heres To , Cheers To " : <p> Its a little something I like to do at birthday dinners , bridal showers , or at the end of a fun trip to really connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been or the person is to the others in the group . One person will start by raising a glass and saying- " Heres To , Cheers To " and then- continues on to say something- they are thankful for about the weekend or the person being celebrated , and then another person goes , and so on and so on . If you 're celebrating a person , usually they will go last but you can do it however you want to ! - It really allows you to end things on a grateful note . <p> here 's a little something I shared on Instagram last night about the weekend overall , as well as my outfit details from what I wore to dinner : <p> " .. What I can do is offer myself , wholehearted and present , to walk with the people I love through the fear and the mess . That 's all any of us can do . That 's what were here for . " - @sniequist- = These last few days have been full of sunshine , laughter , tears , blow-up floats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm leaving thankful for vulnerable conversations , intentionality , authentic connection , and seeing hope being instilled in the stories were all living . When we , as women , have or experience this we feel less alone , more alive and like were all in this together . Let 's be sure to be that kind of woman to our people . Its what life is all about . <p> Hope you all had a great weekend , as well ! I am heading home now and I can not WAIT because I get to pick up FISH after 20 days away from that little baby ! ! WAYYYYY too long for this puppy momma ! Thanks for stopping by today , yall ! Let me know if you like these kinds of posts ! xo.

You can wear it off your shoulder or as a boat neck . Ive been drawn to this brand a lot lately . Here are a few of the products of theirs that have caught my eye : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I got this thermal top for less than $35 last week ! I threw it on and wore it to bed the other night it was SO COZY . Highly recommend . I think I got a Small because they were out of XS and I kind of like it oversized , especially if I just want to wear it around the house or to bed .. does n't  really matter , you know ? <p> Did yall have a good weekend ? <p> I went and saw Beauty &amp; The Beast on Friday after grabbing some tacos and my musical &amp; Disney loving self was SO very satisfied , hah ! Ive been listening to the soundtrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to ! The costumes and the cinematography are pretty incredible . Other than that , I spent quite a bit of time with the pups , getting my office organized still , yes .. , and sorting through packages that I have n't gotten to . I leave for a fun getaway on Wednesday so I have quite a bit of outfit planning to do today and tomorrow . This will be the first time that I leave Chips with a dog sitter .

I have a very unusual question or advice I 'm asking because I have searched online for info and come up with nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar experience , that I 'm so very sorry about . Today I lost a very special cousin of mine and she has two children ( my 2nd cousins ) her daughter is a junior in college , a very bright confidant young woman . I 'm looking for guidance and what would help her through such a difficult time , words to encourage or some type of momento that you know would be something special . I rather do something than say , " let me know if you need anything " because that person is never going to ask . Thank you and appreciate and words of advice . Love your style , keep up the great work ! 
@@29465663 @3165663/ <h> THE FRIDAY FIVE MARCH 2017 <p> Ive started doing monthly favorites post- but I felt a little under the weather towards the end of my Bermuda trip and have been trying to let myself rest a little bit since I 've been back . I decided to scrap the dedicated March favorites post and just incorporate it into the Friday Five ! My hope is that that post will be back next month ! = <p> 1 FAVORITE SONG : I have been listening to a remix of an old song called Return of the Mack . Its by Mark Morrison and the remix is the C&amp;J Street Mix . You can listen to it HERE . It kind of takes me back to middle school , which was n't a shining time in my life but , I think I like it so much because that realization is fleeting . Its almost like a new song to me . It is so fun to sing along to and motivates me to get stuff done ! <p> 2 FAVORITE BLOG POST ON S&amp;T : Honestly , this month came with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly scheduled programming here on S&amp;T . I did n't  get as many outfit posts on the blog but I feel really good about a lot of the other blog posts that made it to you , like the 5 Must-Haves in my Handbag and my favorite Spring Things Under $100 . I think my favorite was my Spring Beauty Buy Review ! I liked how the photos turned out and just really like sharing my thoughts on things other than clothes ! = <p> I will say because it was SUCH a labor of love and took quite some time the Blogging FAQ post was a VERY , VERY close second favorite ! <p> 3 FAVORITE INSTAGRAM POST : Take me back to Bermuda , on this beach , under the sun heading out to- lounge in- this hammock ! Ca n't wait to share the final images from the trip with you all next week ! <p> 4 FAVORITE EXPERIENCE : Without a doubt , my favorite experience of the month was traveling over to Bermuda for a few days with one of Sequins &amp; Things photographers and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos she took and edited to- me this morning and I can not , can not , CAN NOT wait to share them with you ! Here is a small sneak peek at just how beautiful Bermuda is : <p> Stay tuned ! <p> 5 FAVORITE MARCH PURCHASE : Before Kaylee and I set off for Bermuda , I decided that I wanted to try to put together a small video blog about our trip so I did some research on some cameras you guys suggested I try out on Snapchat ! I ended up purchasing the Sony a5100 16mm-50mm Mirrorless Digital Camera and yall I LOVED IT ! Its such a great little lightweight camera ! I highly recommend it for travel ! 129525 @qwx329525 <p> here 's a little peak at a few things you may be seeing pop up in posts or on social media ! This mirror is on sale and I have been eyeing it for awhile because it fits in the empty space between my bathroom and closet perfectly ! It will lean against the wall and reflect the light coming in from the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally got to snag it ! <p> When my mom was alive , she told me that Provence , France was one of her favorite travel destinations she had ever been to . She- said it was quaint and beautiful , - and you literally feel like you 're walking around in a storybook . I want to go during lavender season because they are known for all the lavender fields that are present just outside of the city . Victoria you up for it ! ? = <p> I had a couple of friends in college who studied abroad in Valencia and their pictures blew me away ! It looks absolutely gorgeous ! Its on the Western coast of Spain , not a far trek from Barcelona . I 've never been to either and I have a few cities in Portugal I want to explore so I think a big trip going all over Spain and Portugal would be an absolute dream ! Has anyone ever done that ? When is the best time of year to go ? <p> This water is just to-die-for , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moment . She lives in nearby Calgary and she went there with her husband on a small getaway . I want to go there so badly but just havent pulled the trigger just yet ! Maybe sometime this Fall ? I feel like that would be a perfect time to go ! <p> I feel like this is the kind of place that is just breathtaking and quiet and makes you just in awe of the wonder of God . I 'd love to go on a bike ride around the area and maybe even camp out there if that 's a thing in Moab . Maybe its dangerous to do that I 'm not sure but I 'd love to make it there one day ! I think I may save this trip for my future husband and I. I feel like its an outdoorsy place that whoever he is would like and enjoy , as well = <p> 1 TRAVEL AGENDA : - In a couple of weeks , I am jet-setting for 2 1/2 weeks and I can not wait ! After returning from London in December , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of time , allow myself to process the experience , get readjusted to life here in Jacksonville Beach , get myself organized , check a million things off the back-end-of-the-blog to-do list and just spend quality time with the Fish-man , and now Chips. - As much as I love to travel , I just needed that down time after being in a different country for that long . <p> However , one of the things I want to continue to do and incorporate into the blog is how amazing travel is and how it can enrich your life in ways you could never imagine until you make yourself get out there ! So , in January/February , I- got the ball rolling on a trip Victoria and I said we wanted to take together when I was living in London . Its taken a lot of work being that we are in completely different time zones but we are booked and ready for a 6-city trip . I 'm going to keep most of those cities a secret until we actually in them but , I will say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to last year , like Florence . I was only in Florence for a day , and- I felt like that was n't enough time for me to gain enough knowledge and recommendations to share with you guys in a travel guide . There were so many of you who asked me for one after my trip last year so , in order to finally put one together for you guys , we are stopping in Florence for a few days on this trip ! Okay that 's the only city I 'm sharing but I seriously ca n't wait to share the rest ! ! <p> 2- LONDON RETURN : So , the trip I was just talking about is starting in London . I arrive the morning of April 14th and am SO excited to be back . I could have just met- Victoria in the first city but the time change wont affect her as much as it will affect me and I do n't  handle jet lag well so I decided to just go to London first and get adjusted to the time and meander the city for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blooming , so I can not wait to walk around and go to some of my favorite places ! <p> 3 LULULEMON COLLABORATION : I 've been wanting to give yall an update on my fitness journey , but felt like doing it quarterly would probably make a little more sense than doing it monthly . I told myself that I probably needed to do that before this big trip I 'm going on and then I received an email about being a part of a campaign with lululemon , a company I 've loved and supported for YEARS now ! I really should n't share how many pairs of Run Times Shorts and Wunder Unders I have . So , I 'm really really excited when things come together like that ! Ill be working on that next week and will likely have it up the week - after ! <p> 4- COUCH DELIVERY : I would consider myself a pretty impulsive buyer of most things , except- furniture ! I mulled over what couch to buy after Kristan moved out for WEEKS and I finally decided on- one I kept going back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well , the price-tag and how long it was going to take to ship . I think I ordered it at the end of January and it said it would n't ship until April 17th . I received a phone call on Wednesday of this week from the delivery company saying they are likely going to deliver it before April 10th so I am really , really excited that the time is finally NEAR ! Now I need to make a decision on a rug <p> 5- NEW JOURNEY : On Snapchat on Wednesday night , I alluded to the fact that I 'm going to be doing something soon that I did n't  wasnt really expecting to do . Its not anything that 's weird for someone my age but I definitely had put it on my maybe this time next year list . However , some recent developments have made me move the timeline up to now ! Its going to be a process and there 's nothing to announce right now . Nothing has really happened yet . I just had an initial meeting with a professional and my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a lot of feelings about it and , when I 'm ready , I 'll share more about what this journey is all about ! Stay tuned ! = <p> 1 FRILLS : I 've always LOVED frills and they are EVERYWHERE right now . I am so happy ! Here are some of my favorites : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> 2 DISTRESSED BOYFRIEND DENIM : These are the best option when you 're looking to be cute but just not really wanting to put a TON of effort into your outfit . I recently fell in love with this pair that I totally shouldnt have splurged on because last week I found THIS pair that is SO similar for under $100 . These are more 90s inspired with the thicker denim with a higher waist . I was n't sure about them at first but now I 'm starting to love them ! Here are some others that - I 'm swooning over : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> 3 JOGGERS : Yall know I love to be comfortable and joggers are one of the most comfortable things to throw on to run a few errands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm abroad in a couple of weeks ! Here are a few I 've found that are super cute : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> 4 ROMANTIC DRESSES : I cant get enough of easy , flowy dresses and there are so many out there right now ! I am currently shopping for that two-week trip I mentioned and , let 's just say yall are going to see me wearing a lot of dresses with lightweight jackets ! 129525 @qwx329525 <p> 5 BOWS ON TOES : The other day I shared this photo of these adorable pink slides with a huge bow on each one . They 're definitely a statement shoe and so fun for Spring ! Bows on toes is a definite trend this season . Take a look at all of these I found on just ONE website : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> Alright ! That wraps up this months edition of The Friday Five ! Hope yall liked it ! - More from Bermuda coming up next week along with some more Spring content ! = xo . <p> Gosh Bermuda looks so dreamy right about now .

As you may know , Victoria and I stayed in lovely Nice , which is central to all the other small cities along the Mediterranean that you can explore . Another name for this area is the Cote dAzur , which literally means Coast of Blue . This beautiful part of the world is the playground for the worlds wealthiest , but I do n't  say that to make anyone feel like they should n't consider it a potential destination for a future getaway !

If you are a pop culture lover , you may have heard of the Cannes Film Festival , which is held here every year in May . This years festival actually began yesterday ! Its a star-studded event and really wakes up this otherwise sleepy beach town well , except in the summer then its a party town that is along the French Riviera. - Victoria and I were really torn as to whether we should go here or another neighboring city like Antibes , Monte Carlo which is in another country , a tiny one , called Monaco or even a small village called Eze , that many recommended . But , because I read People Magazine and Us Weekly on the reg and Ive seen pictures from the Cannes Film Festival every year I was like , I have to go and check it out ! <p> To be honest , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a smaller , less impressive Miami or hoity-toity coastal town with lots of yachts floating around . We walked around , along the water , and through the shops . We saw Gucci , Prada , Louis Vuitton , Salvatore Ferragamo , etc. etc. etc . After that , we were like okay its not really something you would n't see in any other large European city what else ? We ventured down to a restaurant on the beach that looked adorable and decided to have some lunch . It was called Annex Beach , which was delicious . I got the gnocchi and Victoria got the beef tartare. - We were told that this place and the next beach stop we made , Baoli , were both pretty crazy at night . They 're all restaurants and night clubs so when the summer hits , there 's loud music and dance parties all night . The server at Baoli who serves us our sun downer cocktails said he s served Brad Pitt , George Clooney , Wiz Khalifa , Ben Stiller , and many other celebrities since he s worked there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally be sitting where Brad Pitt has sat , or looked out at the same view , but I was surely not impressed by my glass of wine enough to be happy about my 25 Euro bill .

We did n't  even think about it until we were going to get our train tickets to head back ! Oh well next time ! I still have lots of the French Riviera I want to see so I hope to be back one day ! = <p> This outfit was perfect for this particular day . I know it might not be what yall are looking for at this moment because summer is on its way but its full of some good basics to stock up on now like this striped top and utility jacket .

I love love love the shoes but cant see myself spending that much on shoes for myself ( I 'm a teacher , have 3 kids and one on the way- I always feel guilty spending too much on myself ) . Do you know of any similar shoes for less ? <p> How do you like the Tory Burch Colorblock Espadrilles comfort wise ? They look so cute with those white jeans , I am thinking I may need to make the splurge . Would love to see how you dress them up with other outfits ! <p> It looks gorgeous there ! I can see though why you say you werent impressed . If I did n't  know where you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or LA . I still think its pretty though ! I love that outfit .

That outfit would be perfect for me with this crazy weather we are having . Have a wonderful weekend ! <p> Yeah , that 's exactly what I told Victoria ! It has a LA / Miami vibe but .. different . Its a little party , be-scene kind of place . Beautiful but yeah not unique , really . And , yeah ! I 've heard yalls weather has been crazy this year ! And then yesterday it was like 90 ! Insane ! haha <p> Looks gorgeous ! Love the outfit . Ive been considering the Tory Burch Espadrille Flatswould you say they are really comfortable when lots of walking is involved ?

Cannes looks beautiful , but it is good to know there is n't a whole lot going on there ! So Monte Carlo it is ! We cant wait for your packing guide ! ! ! ! <p> Yes , I mean it was fine but , if you do n't  have much time , I would say skip it and do one of the other local cities . I 've kind of heard the same thing about Monte Carlo , to be honest . The only people that make it look glamorous and worth going to is bloggers who work with major designer brands like Dior , Chopard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that kind of experience haha , myself included !

Sorry love ! xo . <p> We literally walked around for 10 minutes in Cannes , both looked at each other and were like . we made the wrong choice , hahaha !

I do , and I hope I 'm not alone ! My answer to that is to opt for an edgy outfit ! Who does n't  love putting on an outfit that makes them feel like a badass ? ? So , today I 'm going to share three ways to create a look that we could all deem as edgy ! Let 's edge it up , ladies ! <p> OPT FOR DISTRESSED DENIM : Now , there are so many distressed denim options out there right now so let me clarify how to wear the two most popular options . I personally think I feel the edgiest in distressed denim jeans , such as the ones I 'm wearing , that hug you tight and show off your curves . If you pair them with a cute , summery , loose-fitting top you 'll certainly be gold ! If you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like THESE , I think you can definitely edge those up but I would say wear more of a fitted , simple top not tight , like THIS . <p> Here are some distressed denim options I love : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> WEAR HEELS , NOT WEDGES : We LOVE to wear wedges as our heel of choice during the summer , do n't  we ? There 's absolutely nothing wrong with them . Girl , you sport those wedges ! I will , too , but if were going for an edgier look , I would opt for a high heel . Do n't  go so high that you feel uncomfortable or look like a walking baby T-Rex but , certainly go high enough to wear you feel confident ! I 've had these black sandals for the longest time because Im comfortable wearing them and I like how the height of the heel elongates my short legs . Theyre sold out now but THESE are the most similar that are currently available and have great reviews ! <p> Here are a few pairs of heels that I own or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I personally think there is just something sexy about wearing the color black . Paired with the other two tips Ive mentioned , its incorporation into your outfit really does add that extra edge . You do n't  necessarily have to be wearing distressed black denim like I did , either ! Get creative ! You can wear distressed white denim with a black top&amp; heels . You can wear distressed blue denim with a white top and black heels and sunnies ! I personally love to add THIS clutch to my outfits because it adds a fun print into the mix ! <p> Here are some black options for you to incorporate into your outfit : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I hope these tips were helpful for yall !

I opted for the Fast &amp; Free Crop because , well , Florida heats up quick this time of year . These crops are seriously made of the softest material , super breathable and moves with you instead of making you feel restricted . I love the Fast &amp; Free Bra because its made of the same lightweight material and comes up high on your chest , which I find to be really flattering . It also makes me feel more supported . <p> I wore this combo from- lululemon- last week and found what they said to be true . They keep you dry during those super tough workouts .

So , over the summer , after trying out multiple skin care lines , I was excited to share the products that had turned my skin completely around .

All of these can be found atNordstrom . I went in there a couple of weeks ago and ended up in the makeup chair . Has that ever happened to anyone else ? Just came in for a refill of something then got sucked in- by something colorful and shiny , ha ! - Nordstrom is my go to for so many things but especially beauty , and I think its because clothes-wise , I 'm good . I know how to style outfits .. - no problem ! But , I need a little more help and explanation when it comes to beauty products. - Nordstrom- carries so many brands and their employees are consistently helpful , knowledgable and fun to talk to about the- products I have questions about ! <p> 1- LIVING PROOF HUMIDITY SHIELD : Humidity is a biggest- curl- killer .

Not only does it smell divine- but it really does what the bottle says it will . I need to take it with me down to the Caribbean and see how it does but when I used it here in Florida on the days with a lot of moisture in the air , so far , its been a winner ! <p> 2- SMASHBOX PHOTO FINISH COLOR CORRECTING PRIMER- C/O : I 'll be honest , I use primers every so often but I typically forget to put them on .

Its green so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neutral palette for foundation application . Highly recommend for anyone who has natural redness to their face ! - Theyre also currently on sale for 15% off so scoop it up now ! = <p> 3- CHANEL JOUES CONTRASTE POWDER BLUSH IN 370 ELEGANCE : I 'm a sucker for a warm dusty rose colored blush as well as a bronzy-flesh colored blush , to be honest and this one goes on beautifully ! I also really want to try 340 Evening Beige and 99 Rose Petale . <p> 4- LANCOME WATERPROOF UNDEREYE CONCEALER- currently 15% off ! : Trying out new concealers is a weakness I have . I feel like it is really hard to find good ones that actually cover-up the darkness underneath our eyes. - My favorite of all time to correct dark circles is Urban Decays Naked Skin concealer- currently 15% off ! .

I also grabbed this face mask to see if it helps even out my complexion a little , like the product details says it will . Stay tuned .. <p> 5- NARS NARSISSIST UNFILTERED II- CHEEK PALETTE : NARS always knocks these cheek palettes out of the park ! They do such a great job at choosing the most flattering shades for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two that I wont use but FOUR in one that you will use is such a good deal !

I probably had a favorite one that I opted for more often than not so I forgot I had it . Anyway I recently rediscovered- and am now like how have I lived this long without this highlight ? ? !

If you ever make it a point to go to Bermuda , be sure to take the day to explore St. George , near the airport , because it was Bermudas first capital city and its absolutely stunning . Its so colorful and such a happy town . Kaylee and I walked through for a little while then sat down and had a latte at CV Cafe . The little British woman who served us was so sweet . We chatted with her for a little while and I would n't shut up about how the- latte was .

One of our taxi drivers had told us its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take us on a 4-minute ride over there . He also kindly waited for us to take it all in as well as snap some photos before taking us back to our hotel in Hamilton . I must say I am right there with that first cabbie that told us it was his favorite beach . It was breathtaking and I was so sad it was n't warmer because it took everything in me to keep from getting in the water ! <p> Okay , this white dress . is a little pricey but after I tried it on all my cares about it went away . It fit me like a glove which do n't  we all feel like nothing ever does ? The only thing that I had to get altered was the length because it is pretty long . But I think the top is so flattering and since its double lined I did n't  have to wear a bra ! Isnt that the best ? <p> I 'm wearing an XXS and actually loved it so much that I also have it in black . I wore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many compliments .

I was wide awake at 2:00AM , tossed and turned until 4:00 then I got up and poured myself a glass of wine and worked until 7:30 then passed out again until noon . Awesome hah ! So , hopefully after today I 'll be adjusted to the time ! Fingers crossed . I 'm off to get ready for a quick little shoot with Victoria in Notting Hill . I cant wait to see her !

Snatch em up while you can ! <p> Statement Jewelry / Accessories There are SO many great jewelry options and colorful accessories to add to your outfits . Use- this outfit as an example ! My floral tumbler is so bright and fun . I do n't  know about you , but I always have a tumbler of either water or Diet Coke with me when I have a long list of errands to get through .

It looks a little darker in these photos than yesterday because of the lighting outside it was really cloudy and about to rain and the editing of the photos . <p> Lightweight knit cardigan Cardigans are one of my favorite pieces of clothing . I love being cozy . I 'm usually cold , anyway , so that might have a little something to do with it . Spring mornings are typically colder here in Florida so these easy throw-ons are something I 'm always in the market for this time of year . I found this one last week and could not resist .

I get so comfortable with the products I know I love and do n't  want to venture out . However , whenever I do decide to go outside of my comfort zone and find a great product that I love I always think that there must be so many others that I do n't  know about , especially within brands that I 'm not as familiar with , because I 'm not willing to try them . <p> One of my favorite things about running Sequins &amp; Things is the ability to try and invest in new products that I might not have otherwise .

I 've always admired anyone who is shamelessly themselves and inspired others to do the same , so I have the utmost respect for the brands founder , Fran+ois Nars . <p> I recently splurged on some of NARS new Hot Sand Collection and have enjoyed incorporating the products into my makeup routine . Today , I 'm sharing the five products by NARS that I personally love and can not live without . <p> Lip Gloss : Their color rich lip gloss was the first product I ever used by NARS .

My newest addition is the Hot Sand shade . I 'm not sure that its the best shade for me but if you love peachy/gold lip colors , its definitely for you ! <p> Hanamachi Kabuki Brush : - My brush collection has been lacking a good quality blending brush for my face . I had one that I was using but just was n't loving it This was one of my purchases from the new- Hot Sand Collection , - exclusively sold- at- Nordstrom , and can not sing its praises louder . It is exactly what I had been needing and- looking for. - It blends your contour and highlight colors , along with your blush , perfectly . I only wish I had found it sooner . <p> Creamy Concealer : This product is amazing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge of my nose . The formula is smooth , buildable and blends well while providing medium-to-high coverage , which is what I prefer. - I typically choose between Vanilla and Chinchilly depending on how tan or pale I am . I do n't  like an overwhelmingly obvious highlight so , I tend to use Vanilla if I 'm tan or Chinchilly if I 'm pale . I encourage you to use- whichever one is best for your particular skin tone . <p> I highlighted some of the other items Ive purchased and have enjoyed using lately- in todays photos . I 'm wearing NARS Audacious Lipstick in Anna . Their lipstick formula is so smooth and color rich , just like their lip gloss , so be sure to give that a try , as well !

Whether you 're petite , tall or regular , you will surely be able to choose an option that suits you best .

Just being honest here = Topshop is great , do n't  get me wrong , but J.Crew does really go the extra mile in the quality department of their outerwear .

I promise I am no chef and the recipe is super easy and it turned out DELICIOUS . Ill leave the recipe at the end of the post for you ! <p> While I 'm not in the kitchen often , and certainly far from being consider a master chef , I do like to make sure I have everything necessary to host a few friends for wine , appetizers or dessert around my kitchen !

Three of those hours is just the fact that the cake has to sit in the refrigerator for that long before you can add the frosting to it because the Jell-O has to gel .

I wore them outside to take Fish out in the snow , to run quick errands , and on roadtrips up to the mountains .

@@29465738 @3165738/ <h> 10 MUST-HAVE PACKING ITEMS FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL <p> Hi , friends ! Today , I 'll be flying to London to start a two and a half week adventure . My friend , Victoria , who shot a lot of my blog post photos while I was living in London , and I are going to be hopping around together to a few spots in the- French Riviera , Italy and Greece . I am so excited to check a few places off of my Travel Lust List and also re-visit a couple of places I have already been to but wanted to see again or explore a little more . <p> Over the past couple of years , I 've been able to travel abroad quite a bit and , through those experiences , I 've found that there are ten things that I always make sure and pack . I also have a few tips to share about each of them . Some of these will make your trip a little easier . Others will be good to have just in case . And , the rest are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 129525 @qwx329525 <p> Your passport is essentially the number 1 thing you CAN NOT forget to pack or you wont be able to board your flight . <p> If you do n't  have one , be sure to apply for one HERE at least 8 weeks before your trip . It typically takes 4-6 weeks- to get but that extra two weeks will save you some stress waiting for it to come right before your trip ! If you have some extenuating circumstances , go HERE to see what your options are . <p> If you already have a passport , and its been awhile since you 've traveled abroad , do not wait until the last minute to locate it . Take some time to do so WHEN YOU BOOK- your trip. - The reason being , you 'll want to check the expiration date to ensure you do n't  need to apply for a new one . <p> The WEEKEND BEFORE travel . <p> Locate your passport again- and put it out on the counter to ensure you wo n't forget to pack it in your carry on bag . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your important identification documents . You can simply take a photo of it or scan it to your computer , save it and email it to yourself so you have it in case you need it . THEN , PERSONALLY , I WOULD- DELETE IT FROM YOUR- COMPUTER / PHONE . Here is what I have found to be the safest , most secure way to travel with your digital copies : <p> I have a folder in my Dropbox app called Travel Documents and have a photo of my passport , I 'd , TSA Pre-Check confirmation and numbers , etc. ( all of which I have deleted from my Camera Roll ) . What I love about- Dropbox is I can access it from my phone or laptop , and I will likely have at least one of the two with me anytime I need to reference any of those important documents . The other great thing about- Dropbox is you can turn on a pass lock- in your settings so that , if your phone ends up in the hands of someone other than yourself , they cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of your passport and leave it with someone you trust ! You never know what could happen during your travels and knowing that someone at home could help you is a comforting thing , in my opinion . My assistant , my best friend , and both of my parents have a key to my apartment and know what file they can find copies of all of my important documents if I were to ever need their help with anything . <p> Make sure you also have digital copies of all of your travel documents and itineraries , like flight , hotel and tour confirmations. - I upload these into my Travel Documents folder in Dropbox , as well , but I create a different folder within the Travel Documents folder for each trip I take . See below : <p> This will save you time and stress when you go through customs at your destination and the customs agents- are asking you questions about where you 're staying , how long you 'll be in the country , where are you going next , etc . Some countries customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more prepared you are the better . How inquisitive they are also depends on how long you 'll be in their country . In my experience , the UK borders are extremely secure . Ive been asked some pretty intense questions about why I 'm entering their country and they always want proof of your answers . For example , when I arrived to London in August , and they saw how long I was wanting to stay , they asked me whether I had enough money to support myself for 4 months and , in addition , wanted to see proof of that so I showed them the balance in my- bank account to prove I could live and support myself. - It was a little unnerving but its because I wanted to stay for so long . And , you have to understand that , with the state of the world being what it is right now , they 're doing what they SHOULD be doing and it actually made me feel MUCH safer knowing that that 's the kind of screening they put everyone entering the country through . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even looked at my passport before telling me to walk through because I was only going to be there for a few days , I guess . So , again , be prepared just in case . <p> Depending on the country you are traveling to and the length of stay , be sure to look into- whether or not you need to apply for a visa . You should be doing this WHEN YOU BOOK YOUR FLIGHT- to prevent stress before travel . Typically , you wo n't need one if you 're spending a few days in each country you 're going to but never hurts to know for sure that way you can get the process started early . <p> Enroll your trip with the US government by creating an account and submitting it through the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program STEP . The- program makes the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate aware of your trip . If there is- ever a- safety or security issue in the city you have traveled to , they will text you to make you aware of what areas to stay away from . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have access to my information and my presence in the area IF- heaven forbid ! there is an emergency and they need to try to- locate me or notify my family of anything . The state of the world is a little scary right now , however , you cant let fear cripple you from experiencing and seeing the world . There 's a risk with ANYTHING you do , whether its getting in your car or traveling to another country , so do n't  let this scare you just see it as a smart safety measure ! <p> If you are traveling with a pet , - be sure to have all of their documentation and travel gear ready on the day of travel , as well . This is really a whole topic in and of itself , one I know quite a bit about after traveling to the U.K. with Fish , and I 'm not going to go all into in this post but the thing you need to know more than anything is to- be sure to DO YOUR RESEARCH MANY MONTHS IN ADVANCE to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'll be stressed no matter what . It can be really confusing when you 're comparing notes between what the U.S. says you need to enter another country and what that countrys says you need for an animal to be brought into their country . My advice would be to tackle this endeavor with another person , whether its a family member , spouse or friend . Justine , my assistant , and I did research on how to travel with a dog to the U.K. separately and then came together to go through everything . We each had different takeaways and used the different online resources . She corrected me on some things and I corrected her on some , and it proved that two sets of eyes are better than one . Then , we took what we learned to my vet . My vet has a vet tech who- is really , really experienced with preparing pets for travel and was SO helpful in getting Fish ready and making sure all of his documents were filled out correctly . We all made a lot of phone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crazy but I 'm so thankful that we did it as a team so , use other people to help you ! It makes all the difference . <p> When Im- traveling , my phone dies within three hours of being out and about . Its insane . But , if you think about it , - you 're using your- phone much more than normal to take photos , access confirmation documents , share on Snapchat or Instagram , request an Uber or Lift and figure out the best way to get from where you are to the next place you want to check out . When you 're in a foreign country , especially one where- the primary language is not English , the absolute last thing you want is for your lifeline- to die . So , I always travel with a Mophie Charging Case on my phone . If you have an iPhone 7 , you can get charging cases HERE- just search by DEVICE. - - <p> I also bring a- portable charger in my bag . You 'll need to make sure you remember to charge it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to NOT use it until I get to my destination . The- Mophie Charging Case- will give you ONE full charge and- itll typically last me ALL day but I have had to use the charging block in the past . Its helpful to have , just in case , and it does n't  weigh a lot , which is nice . Here are some options to choose from : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> When you 're doing your research , you may come across some apps that will be helpful for you as a traveler in the city you 're venturing to . Helpful apps for travelers in ( enter your destination ) - could be a really helpful thing to look into before you go . I know I was so thankful when I found TransferWise and CityMapper when I was living in London . WhatsApp , Viber and Skype are all great apps that allow you to talk to people around the world for free . I use- personally use WhatsApp and love it ! <p> If I could recommend two very generic ones that could be helpful no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOOGLE MAPS : You can star destinations within the city you 're traveling to based on the tentative plans that you have made , or definite plans if you have booked tickets in advance , which will make it easy for you to find them on your map when you are there . You can also download routes from your hotel to a destination and it will be available when you are on your way and do n't  have WiFi , which I thought was pretty handy . It will typically pull up different transit options for you , as well , whether it be the underground , bus , or walking options . <p> GOOGLE TRANSLATE : This is a pretty obvious one but this can be helpful in those destinations where English is not the primary language . You should go prepared to speak the most basic phrases like " Hello , how are you ? " , " Thank you " , " Youre Welcome " , " I do n't  speak well , do you speak English ? " but if you 're unsure of how to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Translate is really helpful for that . TripLingo is another good app to consider for this , as well . <p> Have you found any others to be helpful during your international travels ? <p> A lot of unexpected and inconvenient things can happen when you 're traveling but , for me , if I could name one thing that- would quite seriously ruin a trip and make me freak out more than anything it would be if I lost or ripped a contact and I did n't  have a back-up pair in my toiletry case . Reason being ? I would legitimately not be able to function by myself . I am extremely nearsighted and my contact prescription is -10.0/-10.5 so , without my contacts , everything is extremely blurry . It would be like if you put Vaseline over your eyes and tried to see through it . SO I am very passionate about triple checking that I have at least two new pairs of contacts and two contact cases in my toiletry case before I leave home . If you wear contacts , I 'd encourage you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same issue in terms of terrible eyesight as I do but what is that ONE thing for you ? - Is it medication ? Is it an orthotic brace ? Is it a particular pair of shoes that is most comfortable with your feet my mom had bunyons , so I totally get that some peoples feet are more sensitive , especially when traveling ? Make sure you put them out a few days ahead of time and do your triple check before you leave ! <p> Speaking of eyewear , I would recommend- packing a pair of sunglasses to make sightseeing a little more enjoyable , especially in the summer . 129525 @qwx329525 <p> If you 're traveling to a big city that is a tourist draw , be sure to travel with a mid-size tote bag that has a top zipper , like the Longchamp Small- Le Pliage Tote . Its important to- keep your bag completely zipped up so as to avoid becoming victim to a pick-pocketer . They are super quick and swift . Most victims do n't  feel anything . <p> Then , to add an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouch to store- my smaller belongings like card case , lip gloss , phone , etc. along with- this travel wallet from Aspinal of London. - It helps to keep everything- really organized and concealed . These two items would be quite the feat for a pick-pocketer to grab if my bag was on my shoulder , which is why I carry them . <p> Here are some cute pouches I found available now : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> Make sure all items that have a zipper are zipped up at all times , especially around big monuments , like the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame in Paris , Westminster Bridge , Big Ben and the Eye in London , Trevi Fountain and the Vatican in Rome , etc . <p> I typically DO NT carry my passport on me when I 'm walking around just in case something were to ever happen to my bag . <p> Another big tip in regard to bags- is to leave your designer handbags at home. - Well , okay take at your own risk . How about that ? Because , I typically bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive but I pack smaller bags that zip-up in it ! Theyre beautiful , of course , but it makes you a target in the big and busy cities in Europe , especially around the hot spot tourist destinations . <p> Seeing the world is a beautiful thing but travel , in and of itself , can be challenging . Unexpected , inconvenient and uncomfortable things can and will likely happen along the way and its okay to feel a little frustrated or annoyed or confused at times . You 're in a foreign place and you 're surrounded by people who are from different backgrounds and cultures so , it is understandable HOWEVER , you are traveling as a U.S. citizen and you are a visitor in the country you are venturing to . So , how you choose to respond to that annoying occurrence reflects back on our country and , while that might not matter to you at the time , put yourself in their shoes . Would you want a visitor from another country to act the way you 're acting if they were standing in front of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations , - respectful to other people , and do everything you can to- maintain a positive attitude . Annoying things happen you can not let it consume you . You 're in a beautiful place . Do n't  let your circumstances make you forget that . <p> I 've totally been there , too many times when I lived in London AND back in December when I was at Disney World . I lost a very expensive card case which was dumb of me to bring with me but , alas .. that held- ALL but one of my credit cards business and personal within the first 20 minutes of being at the park and spent upwards of two hours- looking for it , reporting it to lost and found , and calling- all of my credit card companies to cancel them all and request new ones to be sent out . It was NOT FUN and not what I wanted to be doing during my first trip to Disney in five years but my friends can attest I did not let it steal my joy of- being at the happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is and there is n't anything you can do about it than what you need to do to take care of it , you know ? 129525 @qwx329525 <p> When you 're traveling , - there 's a good chance that you 're out there getting some serious steps in ! I mean , you better be ! That 's the only way you 're going to see the world ! GET OUT THERE ! Meandering is my favorite thing to do . I love to get lost and check as much out as I can . My feet definitely pay the heavy price and there are definitely certain types of shoes that I would recommend over others . However , its important to mention that there is not ONE shoe out there that will prevent your feet from feeling the slightest bit sore . You can be wearing the most comfortable pair of shoes and your feet will still be achy when you 've been on them for 9-14 hours so , just keep that in mind . <p> I would say , though , I prefer to wear lightweight Nike sneakers when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past and a few pairs I recently ordered to check out before I leave on Thursday : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I also typically pack a pair of neutral wedges or heeled sandals and a pair of flats that will go with many of my outfits. 129525 @qwx329525 <p> If you want to travel but you are n't  a planner , I would encourage you to opt to travel with someone who is . As previously mentioned , travel can be challenging and frustrating but nothing is more frustrating than when something happens that could have been prevented . When you decide where you want to go , talk it out with your travel companions , come up with a tentative plan in terms of where you 're going to stay first , second and third , etc. and , from there , keep asking questions and do research to find out the answers . Do n't  let the fact that you have n't traveled abroad stop you . There are tons of resources out there to help you with your questions . I always ask questions in Google and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts and articles ! <p> Here are some questions to ask before traveling : <p> Do I need a visa to visit this country ? <p> Do I need an international drivers license to rent a car in COUNTRY ? <p> What are the repercussions if I do n't  get an international drivers license and still rent a car to drive in COUNTRY ? <p> Should I travel from this country to this country via plane or train ? Heads up ! Sometimes trains are cheaper and they 're typically much more pleasant . <p> Do I need to obtain any vaccinations before entering this country ? <p> What is their currency ? <p> What is the tipping etiquette ? <p> What are the best ways to navigate this city ? Is it public transport ? Do they have Uber ? What apps will help me with navigating this city OR is Google Maps sufficient ? <p> What are the local laws and customs ? For example : In Italy , your shoulders and knees should be covered in churches and mosques . <p> What are the popular areas to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tourists in this city ? <p> I want to see ( insert touristy destination like , The London Eye or Notre Dame , here ) and ( insert another touristy destination ) within the city you are visiting. - Do I need to purchase tickets for this ahead of time ? How far away are they from each other ? What else is there that I could see in this area ? <p> HERE is an amazing resource to help you get started on getting these questions answered . <p> Finding out the answers to all of these questions will help you plan out- your days in a much more efficient way and will allow you see more things . If you do n't  do any research and if you do n't  look at any maps in the weeks and months before your trip , you 'll be wasting a lot of time . You 'll also be wasting the money you spent to get to this travel destination , as well , so its important that you arrive prepared with prior research and a tentative plan . <p> Personally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always made everything overheat BUT if you want to bring one anyway I 'd recommend you purchase one ahead of time . Here are a few world travel adaptors that have great reviews : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> This is what I do : <p> Since I always travel with my laptop , I purchased this World Adaptor Kit- when I was in Paris last year . It works great . I plug my laptop in with whatever adaptor is appropriate for the country I 'm in , then use the USB port on my laptop to charge my phone . The only other thing I need to plug in when I 'm traveling is my curling wand and , personally , I would advise you find a cheap one to purchase in the country you are traveling to . In the UK , Boots is the same as a CVS or Wal-Greens and they have good cheap ones available . I 'm not as helpful with other countries , unfortunately , but spending a little bit of time figuring that out makes more sense to me because I 've NEVER had a curling wand come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , I have two cheap curling wands for the UK and Europe , and I pack them based on my travel plans . The curling wand costs you just as much as the adaptor would , so I think it makes sense . <p> Most of us cant travel internationally SUPER often so its important- to capture these trips so you can look back on them whenever you need a little getaway ! Be sure you have extra batteries , fully charged and ready to go , and camera cards with you . 129525 @qwx329525 <p> A really great quality , lightweight camera that I 've started using for travel is the Sony a5100 <p> INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL- TIPS TO CONSIDER <p> - Before you leave , call your credit card company to let them know the dates of travel . Some do n't  require it but it will save you any annoyances that may occur while you 're abroad . Calling home is NOT cheap . <p> Speaking of credit cards , look to see which one of your cards charges the least or no foreign exchange fees so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you 're there . <p> Check with your cell phone company about what their international travel plans are . I 've found that its cheaper to buy a SIM card when you 're abroad rather than opting to purchase an international phone plan while you 're gone . Some popular cell phone carriers are O2 , Vodaphone and 3 . Here is a FULL LIST . You can use it to reference the countries you 're going to see- in order to see which carrier is best for you to venture to when you arrive . Vodaphone seems to be one- available in most high tourist countries . Its important to note that you 're phone must be unlocked in order to take your sim card out and put a new one in . The customer service person at your cell phone company can tell you more about what that means for you personally . Itll be different for everyone . <p> Write down the location of the nearest U.S. Embassy in the country / city you 're traveling to . Keep a copy in the small pouch in your handbag . Keep a copy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it could happen . Store a digital copy in your- Dropbox app . <p> Pack all of your medication in your carry on . <p> Pack an extra pair of underwear in your carry on . <p> Do n't  keep- ALL of your credit and debit cards in one place . Keep one or two on you , another in your suitcase , and another somewhere else . This- will prevent a huge headache if your wallet or handbag is stolen . <p> Bring a typed medication list with you along with enough of each medication . Each medication should be stored in its original packaging in case you 're questioned about the medication you are bringing into the country you 're traveling to . <p> Have your doctor write a letter stating you must travel with these medications for your health and well-being . Be sure to ask about generic equivalents of these medications in case you need to try and obtain some while you 're abroad . <p> Call your health insurance company to see what your international healthcare coverage looks like . If you are n't  covered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty cheap . I did this when I was abroad last year . I was shocked at how inexpensive it is compared to what I pay a month . <p> If you 're traveling to a country whose primary language is NOT English , I 'd encourage you to know a few basic phrases in home language . In my experience , they can tell you 're American and will respond to you in English and treat you kindly for at least trying . <p> Carry a card or matchbook from your hotel in case you get lost , - cant remember the address or your phone dies because you should have this information saved in Dropbox , remember ? <p> Always connect to WiFi when available . Turn off your data when you 're walking from Point A to Point B unless you have an international travel plan and want to use it . <p> Plan for jet lag . There are different techniques based on which direction you 're going and where you are located. - When I 'm traveling to London from Florida , they typically leave late in the afternoon and land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up SUPER early the day of my flight so that I am reallllly tired when I board my long flight . Once I board the flight , I make myself go to sleep . You essentially want to go ahead and act like you 're already IN the timezone you 're going to .

Despite that , I do own some open handbags that I love and carry around , including a neverfull . My favorite way to secure my belongings is using smaller pouches inside my handbag , so my staff is more secure . Besides that , makes it easier to switch between handbags ! <p> Do you have any suggestion when staying in an apartment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome in June for 5 days and I 'm not sure what is included . Hotels typically have plug adapters for you , blow dryers , etc . Thanks for the list . I will be using some of these suggestions when I travel to Italy and England soon . <p> I 'm glad you mentioned about taking zip up handbags . I am going to Greece in September and was debating whether or not to bring my neverfull . I 'm not sure how safe I would feel with it out and about seeing as it does n't  close . Great advice <p> This is a great post , but the government advises against taking photos of all your legal documents and storing them on your phone . Imagine if your phone was stolen/hacked , all that information is right there . <p> Hi Melissa . These are just my personal tips . You do n't  have to follow any of them that you 're uncomfortable with . I realize there is a risk with that one but there 's also a risk having it on you while traveling , even at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , or someone could grab your wallet out of it as easily as the streets of Rome or Paris . Traveling with any kind of financial payment card(s) and identification card(s) is a risk . But , if your personal preference is to not upload those documents to your phone because the government advises against it , that 's great . I do n't  think that 's a bad thing . To each their own , you know ? xo . <p> Two other tips for US citizens : sign up for GOES ( Global Online Enrollment System ) to speed your re-entry into the US : https : //goes-app.cbp.dhs.gov <p> And register with STEP ( Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ) so you can be reached in case of an emergency and notified of potentially dangerous events , etc .

I will be moving to London this summer for my husbands job and I 'm already so stressed about bringing my dog . Any tips or advice on this ? The information is so contradictory on every website ! A post about this would be amazing and I 'm sure it would be helpful to so many travelers . Thank you ! ! <p> Great suggestions for any traveldomestic as well as international . P. S. An Empty bottle/mug , hard candy , tim , small individually packed snacks , good book , paper and pen , and a game book are my personal musts . <p> This post was awesome ! Thank you ! I 'm traveling to France , Belgium , and England for 10 days at the end of this month . I did n't  even think to take copies of my IDs . Downloaded the Dropbox app right away !

Very helpful ! ! ! <p> This is SUCH an incredibly informative post ! ! So jealous of your organization ! Ive been traveling abroad all my life as most of my family lives in Europe and I 'm what I 'd like to think of an organized mess lol . This inspires me to get a little more organized with traveling getting little pouches and travel wallets would totally help with this . Also , sooo smart to have your travel documents in a drop box app ! Never would have thought of that but totally using that next time I travel !

Last week , I asked yall how you wanted me to incorporate my travels into the blog and one of the posts I suggested was what to pack on an international , overnight flight . Ive been on several of these and , although they 're never fun , there is a way to get through them a little easier if you prepare a little . <p> Everyone has different preferences in terms of what to pack for long flights , especially overnight ones , but I 've found that the items Ive included in this post is what I tend to like to pack . This last flight taught me to wear what you want to sleep in on the plane ! I usually do this but , because I had been out and about in Dallas all day on Sunday , I just ended up wearing my jeans and long sleeve top when I boarded my flight to London . I honestly did n't  think anything of it because I figured I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a middle seat sooo four hours after the flight took off , I felt horrible waking the person next to me up to let me get out , go to the bathroom and change into my in flight sleep clothes , per se , which was just leggings and an oversized , long sleeve top . SO definitely wear your comfy clothes when you board no matter what . I usually opt for leggings , comfortable sneakers , and a big oversized top that is appropriate to wear in public . Plus , its less to pack in your carry on ! <p> Speaking of your carry on I can talk through a couple things although everything I linked up there is pretty self explanatory . I use a passport cover to make it easy to identify and grab out of my tote , but always have it out of the case when you 're going through customs or airport security . When you 're traveling solo , you never know if you 're going to be sitting next to someone who HAS to have the air blasting so I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  try and look super pretty when I travel internationally because , let 's be real its a long flight , then you have to go through customs , grab your bags then figure out the public transit situation to get to wherever you 're staying . I usually walk really fast to customs after my flight , get through the line then , before picking up my suitcase , I find a bathroom and take the time to wash my face , brush my teeth , put deodorant on , as well as my favorite lip moisturizerand then I feel good to go ! You have your whole trip to look pretty . Use this day to let yourself be " no fuss " and your face breathe . <p> But if you insist on carrying some beauty products with you , here are some good travel size ones : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I would highly suggest bringing a small cosmetic case so you do n't  have your small travel-size products spilled out all over the bottom of your tote . Its important to stay as organized as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep you feeling less anxious about being in a place you 're unfamiliar with . I typically have all my small items in plastic bags for airport security purposes but still stow them in the small cosmetic cases and then , when I 'm at my destination , take them out of the baggies . <p> Aside from packing the right things in your bag , its important to keep in mind that , during your flight , you 're breathing in recycled air and there is less oxygen in an airplane cabin than your body is used to . I would encourage you to get up and walk around the cabin , when its safe , to keep your blood circulating . Also , be sure to opt for water over carbonated soda or alcohol . You tend to become more dehydrated when you travel . I would be buy a large water before boarding and try and drink the entire thing before you land at your destination then buy another one to drink during the day . Another important thing to do take note of what time it is at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination time . So , if you 're going to London and its currently 10:00pm there when you take off you should make yourself sleep right when you take off for as long as you can so that your jet lag wont be as bad when you get there ! I did not do this and regretted it BIG time ! If you did n't  get much sleep , I 'd suggest these amazing eye gels . They help you look a little more awake by supplying that area with some much-needed moisture . I typically put them on right after they distribute breakfast in the morning and take them off after about 20-30 minutes . <p> I 'm currently writing this all from my little flat in Verona , Italy .

I wore it- on a little mini excursion up to St. George Island in Bermuda with Kaylee a couple weeks ago . This little city is SO colorful and cute . It actually used to be the capital of Bermuda . From the city of Hamilton , where we were staying , it was about a 20 minute drive north and , once you get there , its super walkable . Kaylee and I enjoyed just meandering around , popped into some shops and grabbed a coffee before heading over to Tobacco Bay , which I cant WAIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! These pink chino pants are a DREAM and a steal for under $100 ! Chinos rarely fit me . I sent these back for that reason . I feel like they typically run big but these run true to size .

This little clutch is a little awkward to carry around as I clutch I realized as the day went on so I actually now keep it in my tote as a pouch . I adore the colors in the earrings and that they are super lightweight . They 're a really great price , as well ! I 've found so many statement earrings that I love lately . Ive been telling myself to pump the brakes , though , because I can only bring so much with me on my trip next week and tons of jewelry will certainly make 50 pounds come quick ! <p> Ill hopefully get the Bermuda Travel Guide up for you guys soon !

We picked up a rental car on Monday when we arrived , stayed the night in Cologne , then headed out bright and early to go on a little road trip . The road trip was probably my favorite part . The countryside , winding mountain roads and orange leaves everywhere were absolutely beautiful . It was more beautiful than I thought it would be . We stopped at some castles and wineries in a couple of small villages , which we swear are deserted . There were n't a lot of shops or cafes open , and no one walking around . It was a little strange but cute nonetheless . I 'm honestly just really happy I did okay driving , ha ! I was a little nervous ! But , it was actually pretty easy . The cars are exactly like American cars . We had a Volkswagen . They drive on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road signs look a little different I 'll admit there were a few that I was n't sure what they mean ! Should I be admitting that ? and the words are , obviously , in German but as long as you have a navigator using Google Maps to tell you where to go , you 're all good ! <p> On Monday , Whitney and I arrived at the Hyatt Regency in Cologne , which looks directly across the Rhine to the Cathedral , around 12:30 . We had a little bit of work to do , being that there was n't WiFi on our trains , then we decided to make the most of the rest of daylight , which was only a couple of hours . I changed into this outfit to do a little exploring . We walked across the bridge that the trains take in and out of their central train station . It was CHILLY that 's for sure but the bridge was so cute . It had locks all over it , like the Paris Love Lock Bridge , except WAY longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city center . It 's absolutely gorgeous . We were really hungry so we decided to opt out of going inside . <p> One thing that surprised me was just how much colder it was in Germany compared to London . I mean it 's cold in London but its nothing compared to Germany . If you have a trip planned for this winter in Germany , pack all things cashmere , wool and goose down . Ha ! I 'm freezing even thinking about it . I thought the amount of layers I brought would be enough , but on this day it was n't . I definitely needed my scarf but forgot it in our hotel room . <p> This loose , striped turtleneck is a great Fall &amp; Winter essential because you can pair it with other neutrals or a brighter color like a bright blue . J.Crew always does a great job of incorporating great winter accessories that can easily be paired together with their clothes . I picked up these gloves and this pom-pom beanie before I left just so I had something ! All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I mentioned yesterday , Justine my right hand girl &amp; assistant sent me a couple of my favorite coats from last year so I did n't  have to buy new ones . This gray wool parka with faux fur trim hood is my absolute favorite ! It 's so flattering and SUPER warm when you wear it with some good layers underneath . Plus , I think there are some coats that try and do a good hood with faux fur trim and it 's just a bit measly . I think they did THE.BEST. job with this one , personally . <p> Also , I know I always say this but , I seriously mean it if you need some good over the knee boots that wo n't break the bank , snag these that I 'm wearing ! They 're currently on sale and super comfortable . Spray them down with this suede protectant spray and you 'll be good to go , as long as it 's not mushy gross snow . You 'll need winter bootsfor that ! <p> I 'm a little sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend who booked a flight to come visit today through the weekend , so we made our trip really short . Unfortunately , some things came up and they had to cancel and , obviously , that 's no problem at all so my spontaneous side is screaming at me like , why did n't you just change your train ticket and go some other place ! But , it 's okay in the grand scheme of things = It just means we 'll have to come back ! There are so many places on my list to go in Germany ! I think next year will be a really busy year in terms of travel anyway , so Germany will likely be one of those trips = <p> Aw fun ! We wanted to go when the Christmas markets were up but we had some things on our calendar that prohibited us from going during this time . I wish I could see them .

@@29465777 @3165777/ <h> GOODBYE NURSING <p> I mentioned in this post , culminating some of my favorite looks from 2014 , that this year would be transitional one for me . I said that with hope , more than anything , but I had n't  exactly " made any moves " yet . A few days later , I was looking at my schedule for the month of January and just immediately said " no " to myself in my head . It looked too familiar , the same exhausting familiar calendar I had gotten so used to seeing . Almost every single month of 2014 was overwhelming and the thought of another month going by running myself ragged was just too much . I decided that something had to be done , that something had to change , and that I would finally have to take the advice I so freely give to everyone with a dream : " Do n't  talk about it , be about it . " At 6:45am this morning , I will clock in for my last shift as a Neurosurgical Progressive Care nurse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am excited to feel the weight of having " so much going on " to be lifted off my shoulders the minute I clock out . I am excited to be my own boss . I am excited to be able to spend more time with my friends and my family , and to enjoy their big moments like weddings , bridal showers , baby showers , and small moments like dinners , movies , wine nights , etc . Im excited to not be consumed with " busy-ness " . Im excited to have a little bit more down time . I am excited to see my Fish man more . However , I have to pay tribute to this wonderful profession of nursing . I have always always considered it a huge honor to walk in to a patients room and introduce myself as their nurse that I could take care of them for the day , helping to facilitate their plan of care , while also helping them understand what it is that is going on with them so that they feel less anxious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of themselves better when they leave , while also helping their loved ones understand what 's going on and what the plan is so that they feel less anxious and less scared . And , not only that , but to laugh with them and get to know them , learn about them , and learn from them its a beautiful and precious honor . The hospital is not a glamorous place its a very human place , a very vulnerable place but , to be honest , I like all things human . I like the vulnerable , the tough , the sensitive , the uncomfortable . If you cant show me your heart , I 'm going to have a hard time understanding you . Being in the hospital forces tough peoples brick walls to crumble , forcing them to really feel , and its a scary thing for most . I 'm going to sincerely miss experiencing these very human moments , these scary moments , with my patients and their families when I 'm sitting with them on their bed as they tell me how they lost their loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they met Jesus ; or how their children wont help them manage their medications and they know they do n't  remember things as well as they used to ; or how they think they 're going to navigate through the decision of whether to try chemotherapy again ; or how they 're going to decide whether or not to stay on a blood thinner and risk falling and bleeding to death or not take it and risk having a stroke ; or how they met the love of their life ( my personal favorite ! ) etc . Being a nurse has gifted me an enormous perspective on life , and love , and loss that I may not have been able to gain otherwise , and it is a perspective I am truly grateful for . It has helped me see Gods love when , on some days , it was really tough to see and it has taught me how to love people better how to open up your heart and your arms to people , in whatever condition they are presenting in , and to just love them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I leaving if I love this unglamorous , yet beautiful , place . for , what seems like , a super glamorous job like blogging ? Well , for one , I 'm " busy " for a reason . I am driven by passion . I know that everything in life is a choice . If I wanted to choose to spend more time with my friends and my family this past year , I could have made those choices , but I love what I do , and sometimes , when you have a dream , you have to make sacrifices to see them through . Yall , I have so much fun putting this little blog together , and I 'm so excited that those sacrifices were made because now I 'm on the other end of it . I 'm finally to the point where I can make this choice to do what I love , and have a passion for , and also spend time with the people I love more often ! I want to thank YOU so much for taking the time to visit the blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means a lot . The wonderful thing about blogging is that I can still love people , right where they 're at .

A denim jacket is perfect for a girls night out with friends , a utility jacket also here is great for walking around the farmers market , and a cognac leather jacket would be good for meeting your boyfriends parents for the first time !

@@29465800 @3165800/ <h> SPRING SHOE REVIEW <p> One of my favorite things about women is that we are all so different and unique in our own way . Some of us love makeup and getting that perfect winged eyeliner down pat , some of us are experts at finding the best flight deals and want to see the world more than anything , some of us know all things about stocks and Star Wars , and some of us love camping and drinking beer and , some of us , like all of the above ! I love that we 're all different . In Proverbs 27:17 , the Bible says As iron sharpens iron , so one person sharpens another ' and I believe that we can all learn a lot and become sharper in areas that someone else is already as sharp as they come . One of my personal goals as a human being , and I guess as a woman , as well , is to be a kind , open-minded and well-rounded individual . I do n't know it all and just because I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelled a little bit does NOT mean that I know it all about everything . I want to continue to learn and know more about a lot of things , not just what I 'm passionate about ! <p> I love that this blog allows me to help you and sharpen you in different ways throughout the year . Last year , many of you gravitated heavily to my- Neutral Shoe Review . My eyes popped out my head when I saw how much traffic the post got so it was clear to me that that 's one area that you look to me to help you with and I am so flattered by that because I think , more than handbags and beauty products , I am always drawn by a pair of shoes . They 're so hard for me to resist when my mind goes to what outfits I could see myself styling with them . So , after realizing this about yall , I- told myself that I needed to continue do these shoe round-ups for you each major season Fall/Winter &amp; Spring/Summer to sharpen your knowledge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I wanted to get this Spring / Summer Round-up of shoes to you a little earlier than now these photos have been in my Dropbox waiting to be put into a post for three weeks- but , you know , things have been busy with travel and all , hah ! Plus , I 've had a lot of other great content to share lately all of which I hope you 've enjoyed ! <p> Today , I 'm going to share my insight into the shoes Ive purchased this Spring and have been wearing or look forward to wearing more when I get home ! - It 's kind of like the Neutral Shoe Review from last year but a little different and A LOT MORE SHOES . It seems my sickness love , obsession , weakness , whatever you want to call it is getting worse ! <p> I 'll tell you some thoughts about each one and then I 'll give it a rating between 1-5 . <p> If I could choose a ride-or-die pair of shoes , these would with-a-doubt be in my top three . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of , but they are seriously the most comfortable pair of flats that are PERFECT for travel . I have them in Light Oak , French- Grey and just recently purchased the Retro Pink color . I can not sing their praises enough . You 'll definitely be seeing me wear the heck outta these while I 'm doing quite a bit of traveling this Spring and Summer . They do stretch out a bit after a lot of wear but I still get my normal shoe size . <p> These are another staple shoe in my collection that is a little expensive for what it is but worth it in the long run because of how much wear you will get out of them . I just tossed me Sand Patent ' pair after three years only because Chips got a hold of them . They have seen the world and could have surely gone another year or so but it was time for me to venture to a new pair . I decided on the Makeup- color and I was shocked at how much more pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Nordstrom'swebsite . These run true to size and do take a little breaking in just because the logo on the top of your foot needs to assimilate a little . Thankfully , it does n't take but a week or so . <p> These flats could , really , just not be more precious . I absolutely adore the detail . The only thing is I do n't wear them as much as I probably should . They can be worn with a lot but I think I always just opt for a quick slip-on sandal more often than not . They run true to size if you 're completely sold on them but , if you 're on the fence , and unsure if you 'll wear them a lot I 'd pass because they 're a little pricey . <p> I loooove these sandals . I have the Lagos gladiator style sandals but just wanted something similar that I could easily slide on and these are IT ! They do take a bit of breaking in . The leather strap that goes over the bridge of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're super comfortable ! Ill be wearing them around Greece a lot ! <p> Okay , these are just beyond . They 're SO fun , almost show-stopping ! I really , really like them but , I 've found that slides scare me , hah ! They can easily slip off if you are walking too quick and I seriously almost fell down my apartments ' concrete stairs running down them after Chips one day he is like Speedy Gonzalez when he knows he gets to go outside for a walk because they were loose on my feet . So , I 'd say buy them if you particularly love slides , consider yourself to be especially girly and do n't have any likelihood of being dragged around by a pup = They are super super cute ! <p> If I could choose a pair of heels wedges included that were the easiest to walk in with a major comfort factor , it would 100% without a doubt be these ! You 've likely seen them a million times over the last couple of years because they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe , and you saw them on almost every blogger . These are really not much different than those and , since I had the initial pair and they had been through the ringer , I decided to get her sister pair = These are such a gem of a shoe , truly ! Highly recommend ! They run true to size and they do take about a week or so to grow accustomed to . The leather will stretch . Promise ! <p> I purchased these a couple of months ago because they seemed like a great summer shoe for only $60 . I do n't know about you but sometimes I get tired of wearing the same shoes over and over again in the summer so , I felt like these would be a good options when I wanted to switch things up a bit . And , honestly , sometimes I like to channel my inner bohemian princess and thought these would be a great option to wear with those outfits . They 're comfortable and the ties stay tied , which is important to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear with a dress and who wants to continuously be bending over to tie a shoe every so often in a dress . These run true to size ! <p> I thought the colors in these sandals were so fun but it was the price that really sealed the deal ! They 're only $50 and add such a fun pop to any cute Spring or Summer outfit . Again , slides are tricky so just be careful when you choose to wear them . They run true to size . <p> Y'all have seen me style these quite a bit since I purchased the beige and gray pair last year . I love their classic silhouette . It allows them to go with more , in my opinion . They are comfortable for events where you have to be on your feet for 3-5 hours , but I would n't do a TON of walking in them . They 're not the worst in terms of comfort but your feet WILL hurt after awhile . They run true to size . <p> Stylistically , I 'm obsessed with these sandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this color . I knew I 'd wear them a lot in the Spring and Summer and , even though they were pretty pricey for a pair of sandals , I just felt right about getting them for that reason . I 've worn them on my trip here in Europe and they have n't given me a bit of trouble . They are well made and you will be able to wear them for years . They run true to size . <p> I realize the price is pretty steep so HERE is an identical pair that are under $35 ! <p> I am utterly obsessed with these beautiful wedges . They are so seriously my dream wedge ! I bought them in cognac back in February and , when I saw that they made them in blue , as well , I just had a weak moment and bought those , too ! I 've been wearing A LOT of blue lately before my trip so I knew I 'd wear them a ton and I have already ! I really do love them but , I am sad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. hah ! I think I just need to wear them more so I can get used to how I need to walk while wearing them and I 'm not completely sure that everyone would trip . - I will take off a little bit in the rating for it but , not much . They 're great quality , the cutest style and run true to size . <p> My friend , Kristin , from Suburban Faux Pas wore these in yellow with an adorable outfit in Palm Beach not too long ago and I just thought they were so cute ! I delighted to see that they also come in pink , which could add a fun pop of color to a future outfit . They run true to size and the taffeta material makes the ankle tie really comfortable but , I 've yet to wear them and I 've had them for almost a month . I think I 've often opted to wear my Chloe wedges or something else instead . So , these might not get as much wear as I anticipated . Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , although these have so many positive attributes I might say pass if you do n't think you 'll wear them a lot . <p> I absolutely love these sandals . They are so adorable and lightweight , a great pair to wear to a summer wedding or a night out with that special someone . They 're not to be worn for long periods of time what heels are ? but they are comfortable enough to wear for a few hours . These run true to size ! <p> I really like these sandals because they 're a little different than what you see everyone else wear . But , after wearing them in Bermuda , I was a little turned off about wearing them because they werent very comfortable . That top knot on the sandal dug into my foot too much and I realized after walking around in them that I probably should have gotten a half size up .

One thing I was really searching for was a great skin care regimen . Its something I had really been needing to nail down . I expected to not like what I bought and continue my search , but I 'm actually super satisfied with what I 've been using . I 'm always looking for new hair care products and lip colors , so I touched on all of those , as well . Please comment below with any questions ! I 'd be happy to answer them for you . Although , I must mention , I 'm no makeup or beauty expert ! <p> ClairsonicMia 2 ' Sonic Skin Cleansing System : Okay , I feel like I 'm the last girl on the planet to have gotten a Clairsonic but , better late than never , right ? Yall , this thing is a God send . I never felt like I got ALL of my makeup off , even after using my makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Clairsonic , its super clear how much of your daily makeup routine is still left on your face . It made me cringe , because seriously that 's all the stuff that builds up in your pours and causes uneven skin tone and breakouts . So , definitely invest in a Clairsonic if you have n't already . <p> LancomeCreme Radiance Clarifying Cleanser : I have oily skin so I needed a facial cleanser to use with my Clairsonic to give my skin what it needs to look healthy . I tried Purity for awhile , but took the Lancome sales associates advice and took a sample of the Creme Radiance home to try . I. LOVE . THIS STUFF . I 'm definitely not oil free , but it has improved so much since I started using it . I highly recommend it . Sidenote : This item is not pictured in these photos because I was sampling it at the time these were taken , but I actually picked it up yesterday when I was running errands , because I was so impressed with it . <p> LancomeEye Cream : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my index finger into the eye cream and lift it right back out . I do n't  scoop or anything . You just rub your two index fingers together and apply it to your eyelids and under eye . I wear makeup everyday so this eye cream rehydrates the area while I sleep . <p> LancomeBienfate Aqua Vital Lotion : Okay , I think out of all of these products , I love this one the most . There 's just something about putting lotion on that makes me feel so much better . My mom ALWAYS put lotion on , everywhere , and she definitely instilled that love in me , as well . This lotion smells so good and its light , not heavy . <p> AvedaBrilliant Damage Control : I needed a heat protector for my hair , and I love this one . I 've always been a huge Aveda fan because their products are environmentally friendly and great for your hair . I spray this on my hair right out of the shower after I brush out all the tangles . <p> AvedaVolumizing Tonicnot a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I have naturally very flat and fine hair , so after I spray in the Damage Control , I lift up pieces of my hair and spray this volumizing tonic to my roots before I blow-dry to help give it some lift and volume . <p> AvedaAir Control Hairspray : This is a product I will never give up . I have used it for years . It holds my curls without leaving them feeling sticky or crispy , and I love love LOVE the way it smells . <p> AvedaDry Remedy Daily Moisturizing Oil : I usually use KerastaseElixir Ultime Beautifying Oil , but let 's be real I live in Florida and a self-proclaiming heliophiliac , so I need to treat my hair a little bit better than I have in years past . This moisturizing oil helps to keep moisture locked in despite the beating it takes from the weather and heat styling . So , now I apply this moisturizing oil after I heat style my hair , and save the KerastaseBeautifying Oil for special occasions . <p> MAC Lipstick : Lady Dangerred : This color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint of orange . I tried it with my Redo lip liner and was n't a huge fan , so stay tuned on what lip liner to use with it . <p> YSL Rouge Volupte Lipstick : 01 Nude Beige : This lipstick formula is super creamy . I love it , but needs to be reapplied kind of frequently . <p> YSL Volupte Tint-in-Oil : Rose You : I was a little uncertain about this new lip gloss , which is supposedly moisturizing but I actually like it . Its not as trustworthy as my favorite , Jack Black Lip Balm , but it still does a pretty decent job , and it smells DIVINE . <p> MAC Brushno. 109 : I have a small face so I use this small contour brush as a blush brush . <p> NARSIta Brush : I JUST bought this brush a week ago , and it is perfect if you contour and highlight . <p> AnastasiaContour &amp; Highlight Palette : I did n't  feature this in the photos but I have been using this palette since Christmas and love it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , in my opinion . It also just came out in a medium / dark option , as well . <p> Lancome24H Foundation with SPF 15 : I swear I 've tested out every foundation out there . Having oily skin is so frustrating , especially when it comes to finding the perfect foundation . Most of them increase oil production , but I 've been really pleased with this one . It really does stay in place and my face does n't  look ruddy by days end . I highly , HIGHLY recommend it . <p> Viktor &amp; RolfFlowerbomb : I have been wanting this fragrance for YEARS , but they 're not cheap so I waited and waited , and was surprised to get it on Christmas from my sweet brother . My signature fragrance is Versace " Bright Crystal " and I 'll never not have it in my collection , but this one was a great addition because its not too strong .

@@29465836 @3165836/ <h> HOW TO MIX HIGH-END AND LOW-END ITEMS LIKE A PRO <p> I come from a hard-working middle-class family . When we were growing up , my mom stayed at home with my brothers and I and my dad worked hard at his job to provide for us . We were never without . Our needs were always met and , from time to time , we were spoiled with some nice things , as well . It was really important to them that we understood what a blessing everything we had was and how we should never take it for granted . My Dad was quick to remind us money does n't  grow on trees and that we have to steward what we earn well . He always encouraged us to work hard in school and , at the age of 15 or 16 , expected us to get jobs to learn time management , practice good customer service skills and exercise responsibility . I am really thankful for all the ways our parents taught us how to be good adults because , looking back , its pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , as well . <p> The lessons they taught us still resonate with me today and applies to any financial situation no matter what that looks like for you , which is why I always encourage yall to be realistic when it comes to making big purchases inspired by myself or any other blogger wearing designer items . Theyre nice to have , do n't  get me wrong , but they are- not worth going in debt over . Take your time and put money away steadily . It is so worth the wait and SUCH a cool feeling to finally purchase that handbag or that pair of shoes you have been dreaming of and clearing out a space in your closet for . I 've made a few designer purchases over the last couple of years and I 've learned that buying them at Nordstrom has A LOT of perks. - If you 're buying online , you receive free shipping and free returns . You always can return it if it eventually just does n't  suit you . Nordstrom is that reliable , gracious friend when it comes to retailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes using the item to realize it is n't for you ! No questions asked ! <p> I- also want to say that if you are able to purchase a designer item or two you 're still the same person you were before you owned it and that item does n't  make you any better than anyone else ! Hah ! I say that because how annoying is it when you see someone with an expensive item and then they act really pretentious or snobby ? Not cool . Let 's be humble , ladies . <p> Personally , I love designer items but I love to pair them with- more moderately priced , even lower priced , items . Multiple designer items in one outfit is just a little much for me , personally . I have been gravitating toward lighter , more neutral colors , like beige , - lately- so I keep- opting for these really cute Jeffrey Campbell wedges- and pairing them with my new Chloe Small Faye Cross Body Bag . The shoes are moderately priced , will last you a few years , are comfortable to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite designer right now , and has been for the last year or so .

Madewell , in my opinion , runs a little big so size down . <p> Mixing high and low items is the best way to be able to afford more higher priced designer items over time ! Here are some ways to do that : <p> Save on tops and set a personal budget for them based on your income .. <p> Only spurge on denim if you know you will wear them at least 3 or 4 times a week . <p> Only purchase accessories you know you will get a lot of use out of ! <p> Buy neutral shoes to maximize the amount of use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <p> Set a percentage that you want to put away in your savings that will go toward your designer purchase on each pay day . <p> Sell gently used items just taking up space in your closet then put that money directly into savings toward your- designer purchase . <p> I hope these tips help and , do n't  forget , to consider taking a look at what Nordstrom has in their designer department before making your purchase . If , for whatever reason , you have to return it , you wo n't ever get hassled ! 129523 @qwx329523 <h> 17 thoughts on " HOW TO MIX HIGH-END AND LOW-END ITEMS LIKE A PRO " <p> Hi dear .

I am obsessed with the look I 'm sharing with you today . You HAVE to snag THIS plaid cape to sport this winter ! Its SO cozy and only $60 ! I gravitate toward all black looks a lot during the frigid cold months and this cape is the perfect way to add some color in a beautifully chic way ! The black turtleneck dress I 'm wearing under the cape is an old favorite of mine and I found THIS amazing find that is really similar and UNDER $40 ! Score ! ! If you need / want something a little chunkier , HERE is an option that is a little more expensive that I found <p> Can you believe Christmas is right around the corner ? !

So , if you 're in the same boat as me during this time of year , or even more frequently let 's rest in that and be happy with what does get done- and stop putting so much pressure on ourselves ! - After all , it is the holidays ! LETS ENJOY IT for what it is , a celebration of the sweetest gift , the birth of Jesus , and the perfect time to be present and making memories with the sweetest of people in our lives . = <p> Whoa , I just typed all that in less than a minute and I 'm committing to sharing- it , so hopefully- I 'm not the only dreamer perfectionist out there !

I 'm really enjoying everything I 'm seeing and discovering . Italy is a beautiful place . There is no way you can see it in the amount of time we - allow ourselves to be here . I leave Sunday night and , seriously , wish I could stay for a whole month because there are so many cities I want to visit . But keeping your trips short and sweet give you all the more reason to come back , I guess , right ? = Enjoy todays post ! Thanks so much for stopping by ! - xo. 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I have been wearing this long sleeve , white shirt nonstop on my travels . Its so comfortable . I love the loose fit . I wore this turquoise- ring yesterday , as seen HERE .

They run true to size and are pretty comfy . The color is really pretty . They go with everything . THIS- sweatshirt is super cute . I love the light pink against the colors within the pineapple . Take note- that the bottom hem is cut at the bottom , instead of having a nice seam . I do n't  mind it but I remember being surprised when I took it out of the package . I did n't  notice it in the product photo . 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I 've basically worn this outfit almost everyday . I packed a few different white tops to wear underneath different layers while in Italy , as well as a couple pairs of jeans . I think I brought gray , black , dark denim and white . Keeping it simple and bringing things that can be worn in different combinations is key . I brought one jacket , my utility jacket that is similar to the one linked above , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is helpful to carry all the things you need , just try not to be a pack rat or else your shoulders will start aching from carrying it everywhere . A backpack may , actually , be the smartest but I know not everyone likes to carry a backpack . <p> Let 's be honest . We all want to look cute and wear nice shoes around when were traveling but when you 're on the go so much in cities that were built thousands of years ago , you need comfortable shoes . I have been living in THESE Nikes . Honestly , I think they 're so cute . You can see how I 've worn them HERE and HERE . IF YOU HAVE A TRIP COMING UP , ESPECIALLY TO ITALY Do NOT wear flats . Do NOT wear booties . I made the mistake of wearing booties yesterday . Not fun ! I would say sandals are also not a good idea , but I would understand if it was the summer because it does get hot here and sneaker might be too hot . 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first dress , they 're all pretty affordable .

I also want to try THIS new formula by them , as well . <p> UNDER $50 ALERT &gt;&gt; All the others THIS off-the-shoulder white top , THIS cute pair of shorts , and THIS loose , striped tank are all wardrobe essentials that are currently available and UNDER $50 ! Happy Shopping ! xo . <p> HEADS UP &gt;&gt; Also , wanted to let yall know that THIS bright pink dress is available again this year in the bright pink and four other fun summer colors ! I wore it last year down in West Palm Beach for my friends Bachelorette Weekend . I- think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had to get it sized down , but the material is a little thin . <p> I 've done all of Italy basically and in summer flip flops are pretty doable . If you 're in a boot/heel season , avoid them at all costs in cities with cobblestone . Rome is the worst when it comes to cobblestone . You 'll want sneakers of some sort . Flats are generally pretty horrible when it comes to uneven surface and you 'll end up with a broken foot- like I did . <p> I have really enjoyed seeing all your beautiful Instas and snaps of your Italian adventures !

It 's unfortunate that bloggers are wearing a $15.00 Forever 21 sweater and linking it to a $200 Vince sweater from Nordstrom for a bigger commission . You comparing yourself to a hairstylist or server at a restaurant is hilarious because those are both actual " real life " jobs .

I 'm currently on the hunt for a few blanket scarf , i 'll need them soon I know . <p> I know , that 's why I do n't post them too often because I know they 're not super realistic . Unfortunately , I have n't found a more affordable option yet . I always link more affordable options if I know of one . Sorry , girl ! I 'll make everyone aware when I do , though ! <p> Giirrll I know what it feels like to want to dress fall-like , but have to remember that you live in eternal heat ( at least most of the year ) . I used to live in Orlando , and going back for a visit in November . I might have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers that I will at least be able to wear a few scarves and layer like you have been . Great post ! 
@@29465864 @3165864/ <h> THE FRIDAY FIVE <p> Hi there ! Well , its been quite a while since the last Friday Five but I wanted to bring it back this week because I know how much yall love it ! I 'm going to start asking yall ahead of time what categories yall want because I always want them to be more geared toward what you 're looking for from me . But , I did my best and geared this one towards you the best I could based on questions received on Snapchat , email , etc . Enjoy ! xo . <p> This living room is such a dream ! I love the mix of metals , the pastels mixed with neutrals , the girly and cozy qualities of it all but , especially , the brick wall . I think its unexpectedly what pulls it all together . <p> I mean swoon ! This is actually a dress you CAN buy for your wedding . Find it here . <p> Thanksgiving is just a few short weeks away and , even though I am so sad I wont be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my favorite American holidays here in London . My friend , Sarah , is having a Thanksgiving feast . Her and I went to college together , although she was a few years older than me . Every year since her and her husband have lived here , they have had their closest English friends come over for Thanksgiving dinner to help them make London feel a little more like home . My sweet photographer , and friend , Victoria , is also having a Thanksgiving feast to celebrate , as well ! And , then Whitney and I are going to have people over on Thanksgiving , as well . Thankfully , all of these are on different days so well be eating really well ALL week hah ! <p> I 've started to get a few recipes together to whip up for all of these feasts and , if you 're like me , you like recipes that are delicious but pretty simple to make ! I am no Martha Stewart in the kitchen ! Plus , I am working with limited means being that I am renting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would at home . So , the simpler the better ! <p> With all that said , I thought it would be fun to share five fairly simple recipes I have found on Pinterest to help me either thank my host for having us or wow my guests and cause them to feel a food coma coming on ! Heres what I found : <p> CINNAMON HONEY BUTTER Ive never tried this recipe but it sounds SO delicious and would be great to drizzle over croissants or biscuits ! I 'm planning on making this for Sarah &amp; Victoria as a thank you for hosting such a fun and festive feast ! <p> SOUTHERN STYLE MACARONI &amp; CHEESE Aside from Ruffles Original Potato Chips , macaroni and cheese is my other guilty pleasure in terms of food ! The women on my moms side of the family have always made THE BEST macaroni and cheese . I do n't  have that recipe with me nor do I know it by heart , but this Southern Style Macaroni &amp; Cheese is essentially what it is . For me , its all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds , my absolute favorite to use is Sharp Cheddar cheese so , if you use that , you 'll do a great job with this recipe ! <p> SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE This recipe is a staple on most peoples tables for Thanksgiving and , while it is n't my personal favorite , it is super easy to whip up to help the host have one less dish to make ! <p> BACON WRAPPED GREEN BEAN BUNDLES When my mom was alive , she knew the way to our familys heart : BACON . She would make these bacon wrapped green bean bundles for every major holiday . However , she used a dijon mustard to garnish them instead of the brown sugar garlic wash . I 'm sure this recipe is just as tasty . I cant wait to try it ! <p> NO BAKE PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE Anyone else love pumpkin ? Anyone else love cheesecake ? This is literally the easiest cheesecake recipe and so delicious ! I 've used it before . TIP : Make sure you take the cream cheese out of the refrigerator a few hours before making this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to let me know if you make any of these for your feasts and how you like them ! xo. 129525 @qwx329525 <p> This is my favorite time of year to shop . I may be from Florida but I will take cold weather clothes over warm weather clothes ANY DAY . I love bundling up in sweaters and scarves and jackets and boots . Most of these items are affordable and you will likely be seeing me style them at some point soon ! = <p> Donald Trump is going to be our President . What ? ! I 'll say it . I was surprised . I could n't stay awake to watch it all unfold in real time . Senator Clinton called Trump around the time that my alarm went off at 7:30am , and Whitney had already been up and heard the news . This election was absolutely crazy and historic in so many ways , and it was so interesting watching it all unfold here in London . <p> Do n't  worry . I wont discuss the ins and outs of my personal beliefs on specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , honestly , it does n't  really matter to me who you voted for . We are all entitled to a choice and we all made our individual choices on Tuesday . <p> Now that I 'm 30 , I have been voting long enough to have experienced both excitement and disappointment by the outcomes of the past four elections but , at the end of the day , I think respect for that outcome and respect for each other and our future leaders is so important . Also , remember that the way we respond is seen by the world . Literally , everywhere I go , the minute that a London-er realizes I am an American , they either treat me differently or they ask me about the election . The behavior of Americans right now translates into how they view us as a country . Wouldnt it be amazing if they viewed us as loving , gracious and full of respect ? xo . <p> Brrr ! This week , it has been absolutely freezing ! I need to find some warm gloves . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these . <p> Things wont always go according to your plan , and you just need to get over it . While my London experience has been absolutely amazing and I really do NOT want it to end , there have been some hiccups along the way that have gone against the way I thought things would go . The latest was the fact that I was supposed to move in to this flat on Monday , but due to a super slow bank transfer , I had to wait until Tuesday which messed up a photoshoot on Wednesday and meant I had to move all by little self because Whitney already had plans to go to Cambridge that day . While that does n't  seem like a big deal and it , honestly , really is n't it frustrated me because if it had just gone my way , my week would have been more productive , or whatever . I also had some annoying SPAM / Hacker issues this week that pushed back blog post production and took up a lot of time . Again , not the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werent any worse than they were because I know they could have been . <p> But , this has always been something I 've struggled with , and after a long time , it seemed to resurface this week , which can be frustrating . I first realized this was an issue of mine when I was a nurse . Unexpected events come up ALL the time during your 12-hour shift and you 're still responsible for getting all your orders taken care , administering all of your patients medications , drawing all their labs , documenting all appropriate items that need to be , etc . Eventually , I got over it and knew that anything goes on your 12-hour shift and you have to just get over it and roll with it . I need to start applying that to daily life , especially living in London , where new and unexpected things are and will continue to happen all the time . Ultimately , I believe God is challenging me to remember He is in control , and not me . Jesus take the wheel You know better. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be good.I think a lot of us let fear prevent us from making changes in our lives that we either want to make or know we should make . Waiting for the bank transfer to clear was frustrating and moving in to it all by myself this week was stressful but , after I got all unpacked , it was so gratifying to be able to experience and enjoy what I sought out a more spacious flat for the last five weeks of my stay here in London . Change is n't going to be easy but , eventually , it will be worth it . <p> My two obsessions this week are The Queen on Netflix &amp; Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins . Ive been reading Girl On The Train for awhile but its just now getting really , really good . I am still not sure who I think did it and I cant wait to find out ! I want to see the movie . Has anyone seen it ? The Queen on Netflix makes me think of my mom . As some of yall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loved the British Monarchy and British &amp; European History . I know she would have been so excited about this series and there are so many facts that I remember her telling me about the royal family that are shared in it . I sure do miss that woman , and I am thankful her loves have rubbed off on me . <p> And that does it for the latest edition of The Friday Five ! Sorry it was a bit late doing the best I can over here = Love you guys ! ! Enjoy your weekend ! xo . <p> SALE ALERT : Gigi New York is offering 20% off site wide + $8.00 flat rate shipping on all orders ! 129523 @qwx329523 <h> 16 thoughts on " THE FRIDAY FIVE " <p> These are still my all time favorite blog posts ! I love , love , LOVE it ! Anything wrapped in bacon is a win in my book and you cant have Thanksgiving without mac and cheese ! I love that Friendsgiving is a thing ! Double the delicious food ? Sign me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflections about the election were so genuine and true . Things are n't  that easy here , and trying to look and act above the hate is hard . Especially being a Christian and trying to set a Christ-like example , we definitely should be showing the world how gracious and loving we can be . Also , knowing that God has a plan for everything , our lives and our country is like the story of my life right now too = Thanks for the positive reminder ! <p> I 'm originally from Iowa and just moved away from all my family to live in Jacksonville and so this year will be my first year celebrating thanksgiving without family so my boyfriend and I are going to attack our own feast for ourselves and I needed some inspo for meals and I think i 'm going to try out all 5 recipes ! Thanks for the post ! <p> I 'm definitely trying that mac n cheese ! Would you believe I live in the south yet no one in my family has ever brought mac n cheese to the table ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your recent purchases and all the links take me to Pinterest . Strange . <p> Oh really ? ? Omg , it was always such a staple at mine ! Maybe it was just me = <p> Hmm , that 's really weird . Within the widget ? Under Recent Purchases , I did n't  link any of the copy , and I doubled checked all the links within the copy under " Holiday Style Must-Haves " . Let me know and I can try and fix it . <p> Omg isnt it funny how God can speak to You through someone else ? That 's totally how I feel with this post , I recently made a decision to accept a job at another hospital . I work in the ER department and its amazing and scary how quick your routine can change there . I 'm very structured and I 've had to adapt to new things . You are so right , we have to let Jesus take the wheel because we honestly cant do it alone ! I 'm totally scared of change , but I love how you just put into perspective how change can be good ! 
@@29465865 @3165865/ <h> THE 5 MUST-HAVE HANDBAG REVIEW <p> Hi there , friends ! Today , I want you to give me the practical answer to the following question : <p> If you had to pick between jewelry , a handbag and a pair of shoes , which would you prefer to buy for yourself ? <p> When answering this question , especially if you 're on a budget , I think the best way to approach it is to think about what is the most practical . What will you get the most use out of ? Which of these will you NEED to use every single day ? Now , I know it 's not as fun to think of it that way . In a practical way . I mean , personally , I would pick a pair of shoes but , how often can you wear the same exact shoes every single day for every single type of occasion you get dressed for ? Not often . I 'll be the first to admit .. I 'm not a very practical person , so I tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these situations . Today , I want to be your backup <p> This post was created in response to the many requests you all have sent in to me asking about particular handbags that I own , particularly the designer handbags . These are handbags that cost more than my personal rent check and I 'm well aware that that is insane . I 'm also well aware that not everyone can make that kind of financial commitment to a handbag right now , and I know that because 1 you all share it in the comments on my Instagram and blog and 2 I have n't always been able to buy the handbags that are currently sitting in my closet . I 'll never sit here and think that it 's no big deal to buy one because it is . I do n't  think any of us should take the ability to buy one of these bags , no matter how long it took you to save for it , for granted . It is a big deal . <p> With that said , though , I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different for handbags and , no matter what that budget is , especially if its different than yours , we should be respectful of it . Its all objective and we should n't shame each other , or even ourselves , for what we can and cant afford . I see it often , when girls align their personal value on whether or not they can achieve the price listed on the latest it handbag . I can promise you a handbag will not change your life and fulfill the emptiness in your heart . So , just be honest with yourself and be smart about how you 're spending your money . <p> I feel like people are pretty quick to be like that 's easy for you to say , Alyson Haley but yall I 'm going to be super transparent here : I have made horrible financial decisions in the past . Ive spent money I did n't  have . I 've skipped multiple credit card payments . I 've consciously neglected putting a percentage of my income away in savings . The list goes on , and it was all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years ago , the shiny things of this world became an idol of mine and , as a result , I had to deal with really frustrating consequences of those decisions . I learned the hard way how detrimental these irresponsible financial decisions were on things that really matter , like your credit score , your ability to be eligible for loans for a future home , etc . It seriously kicked my butt in gear ! I realigned my values and I was real quick to put together a plan and , eventually , got myself out of it . The strategy behind it all was , basically , doing what I 'm telling you to do . Be honest about what you can afford and be smart about how you spend your money . If you cant afford it , do not buy it . It took a lot of time to get myself out of the place I put myself after making all those bad financial decisions , which is why I 'm being really honest and open about money in this post . I may be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am lucky its because I 've decided to be intentionally smart about how I handle the money I make every two weeks . <p> The decision I came to about how to structure this post was to select a couple designer handbags that you all have asked me to review the Chloe Marcie Leather Satchel &amp; the Louis Vuitton Damier Ebene Neverfull MM but then also include &amp; review three other bags , all of which I have recently purchased , that I feel would be great , affordable additions to your wardrobe , especially considering the season we 're in ! I 'll be reviewing the quality , wearability , functionality within the PROS &amp; CONS section for each bag , as well as my overall recommendation at the end . You 'll also find more options from each designer and brand as well as dupes of the designer bags for anyone who would like to sport the look for less at the end ! Please keep in mind that I can only do as good as what is available online in regard to similar bags . <p> The small depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tend to only carry it if I think a handbag is more appropriate than a clutch wherever Im going , and I do n't  need to carry a lot with me . Sometimes I wish it was bigger if I am needing to carry a few more things with me . Honestly , that is the only major con that I can think of that bothers me a bit at times . <p> I highly recommend this bag for anyone in the market for an every day bag that can be used to run errands , go out to dinner with friends , etc . You will certainly get a lot of use out of it , making it a very practical purchase . It will also last a very , very long time due to the quality of the products used to make it . 129525 @qwx329525 129525 @qwx329525 <p> The color of this signature Rebecca Minkoff handbag caught my attention right off the bat ! I usually gravitate towards turquoise this time of year but , I 've been seeing TEAL everywhere instead for some reason this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought itd be a fun pop of color to play with and add to summer outfits so , decided to give it a try ! The quality of the leather is pretty impressive for the price . I prefer soft leather over hard and this bag is like butter SO soft ! It has a large zip compartment , which I love , as well as two small pockets for other small items like your phone or lip glosses on the other side . The inside is just enough space for the things I like to carry with me . Overall , I 'm really impressed with this bag . I would assume it would last about two years of continued use . <p> I honestly do n't  have a lot of negative things to say about this bag . The thin tassel details may be a lot for some people . Sometimes I think maybe there are too many . Its also a little short . I think I 'd like another inch or two added to the height of it . <p> If you 're looking for a small summer satchel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple years , carry all of your necessities , while also adding a fun pop of color to your outfits on a daily basis , I think you will be really happy with this bag . I 've had fun wearing it with some of my bright dresses and will be bringing it on a weekend getaway this weekend ! = 129525 @qwx329525 <p> Quite a few of the bags in the above widget are currently 30% off ! Do n't  hesitate on grabbing your fave while its discounted ! = <p> Where do I begin ? Louis Vuittons Damier Ebene Neverfull Tote is my favorite bag right now . I had it on my lust list for years and years , but found the Longchamps Le Pliage Medium Tote to be an amazing alternative for a much more affordable price . Its been my go-to tote since college and , while I still believe it deserves high marks in functionality and comfort , I recently decided to finally pull the trigger on the LV Neverfull and am so happy I did . It has a gorgeous red striped fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of my work necessities , which helps me to not overpack and weigh myself down . It has a large zip pocket on the interior , and also comes with a small pouch to prevent your small items from spilling out all over the bottom of the tote . I also LOVE the little keychain detail on either side of the inside at the top . I hang my keys on them . All of these little details help keep me SUPER organized , which is typically hard to do ! <p> The leather on this tote is very stiff , especially the straps , when you buy it from your local Louis Vuitton store . Ive been using mine so much lately and its rare that my shoulders do n't  feel a little tender from the straps digging into them . Over time , they will loosen up a bit and it wont be so uncomfortable but wearing them in is a little painful . I think its important to not over stuff these bags in the beginning . It is a tote but I would recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were to recommend ONE designer handbag to you , it would be this bag . It is SO functional . You can take it to work . You can use it as your every day bag . You can use it for travel . The value of the bag will grow over time , being that this bag has been available at Louis Vuitton stores for years and years and , every year , the value of it increases . It is the most practical purchase you can make when it comes to designer handbags . I 'd like to encourage you to consider buying a gently used LV from the links above and below because I believe the more broken in these items are , the more comfortable and impressed you 'll be by them . My shoulders and I seriously wish mine were broken in , hah ! 129525 @qwx329525 <p> All of these items are all authentic , gently used Louis Vuitton pieces.LUXE DHis a very trustworthy site for designer resale items . They currently offer free shipping with code FREESHIP . Get $25 off your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx329525 <p> As much as I typically love all the colors Kate Spade handbags come in , I typically do n't  find myself wanting one of their bags as much as I did with this pink , pebbled leather cross body . In my opinion , these bags are the best no-fuss option to invest in during the Spring and Summer . When you 're off to a summer picnic in the park or concert , you do n't  want to carry a lot of stuff with you and you want your hands free and available , so these bags are just the best . This one , in particular , is a good size and fits all the necessities within the lined interior , as you can see in the photos . I was surprised it even fit my wallet ! I personally prefer pebbled leather to saffiano so I really like that detail , and its the perfect medium shade of pink . I know it will compliment so many of the outfits I 'll be putting together . The cross body strap is adjustable , which is certainly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body wherever is most comfortable for you ! My Kate Spade handbags in the past have lasted about three years so , overall , I think the price is certainly justifiable . <p> The tassels are an adorable detail to this bag but , they 're a little large and in charge when you 're wearing the bag , to be honest . I 'd also rather just use the tassels as a keychain holder . <p> If you 're looking for a fun pop of color and a good quality , highly functional cross body bag , this is the one for you ! It also comes in other colors ! I think you will be very happy with this one ! 129525 @qwx329525 <p> The blue and pink colors within this adorable straw tote were what originally drew me in to consider it as my 2016 summer beach bag . The overall aesthetic is a dream , even in person , but there were a few things that convinced me to keep it . One thing I love is its size . I hope you can tell from the photos that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being TOO large : two towels , my drink holder , flamingo towel clips , my phone and could certainly fit a couple books and a bag of my sun protectants . I love the fact that its double-lined , which makes getting the sand out of it super easy . I also love that it has a small zip compartment to safely stow my phone and keys without them getting grimy and sandy while at the beach . It seems to be very well-made and the straps have enough drop to carry on your arm as a tote comfortably . <p> Without your towels and other beach day necessities within the tote , it does not stand up by itself . This could be a little frustrating when packing everything back into it at the end of a long , hot day . If this is a deal-breaker for you , and would like a similar one that is sturdy and stands alone , you can find one HERE . <p> Buy this as your next beach tote only if you 're solely obsessed with it aesthetically . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listed above I have it in pink , it seems you get a little more with that one than the Tory Burch one . It is a little larger all over . It stands on its own . It has a small storage compartment AND it has three color options to choose from . Not to mention , its much cheaper . Hope this recommendation and review helped ! <p> And there you have it the first handbag review ! I hope you all liked it and found it helpful ! If you have any questions about any of the bags , please feel free to leave a comment ! If there 's anything you would like me to comment on in the future , please include that , as well . This is the first go at it so I 'm open to suggestions = I 'm off to get cleaned up and packed for a fun beach weekend away ! Be sure to follow along on Snapchat to find out where I 'm headed ! I 'm getting a MUCH later start than I originally anticipated but itll be worth the hustle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping by , yall ! xo. 129523 @qwx329523 <h> 31 thoughts on " THE 5 MUST-HAVE HANDBAG REVIEW " <p> I just got the Neverfull in the damier ebene about two weeks ago and so glad I came across your post to read your review .

I own several Louis Vuitton &amp; they are not leather is the reason they are stiffer ( which I love because I love more structure ) but are a sturdy canvas that is patented &amp; makes it weather resistant &amp; resilient to scratches .

I have the Classic Mono one and have been disappointed and I 've heard a lot of complaints about the Damier straps cracking ? ? Trying to decide if I want the Damier or not . <p> Very helpful post ! I do have a question about the Chloe bag . Did you ever compare to the medium Chloe Marcie bag ? I noticed Nordstrom does n't  carry it currently but Saks does . I was just wondering since you mentioned the interior is a bit small . Also have you ever seen Chloe Marcie bags on any type of sale ? <p> Hey Kelsey ! Actually , the Medium Chloe Satchel is only larger in the width , not in the depth . The depth is the interior of the bag and is what I would prefer to be larger . What I 'm not sure about is why they 're the same price , lol . <p> This was a fabulous post ! Well executed , thorough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price point issue as well .

I flew out to Dallas on Friday because my best friend , Ashley , is having pregnant with- a baby girl , so Katey , from Chronicles of Frivolity , and I threw her a baby shower on Saturday in Fort Worth ! It was really , really fun to see so many people come out and show her so much support and love ! She is n't due for a little bit so she still has quite a bit to put together in the nursery and , after the shower , she is pretty much set ! It is so crazy and , seriously , AMAZING- all the things that are available for moms and babys these days . I had a blast looking through her registry , deciding what to get her , and also putting together her stroller with her the other night .

There 's enough detail on the dress that all you need is a simple pair of heels , pearl earrings , a pretty pink lipstick . and you 're set ! <p> Aside from the shower on Friday , when I arrived , I shot quite a few looks with Angie Garcia , toured the new rewardStyle office and then went on a small shopping adventure .

@@29465874 @3165874/ <h> A WEEKEND GUIDE TO CHARLESTON <p> Hello , lovelies ! As many of yall know , I spent 4th of July weekend in Charleston , South Carolina with a couple of my girlfriends . While it was a extremely hot , to say the least , it was also very , very beautiful . This Southern city , almost completely surrounded by water , quickly became one of my favorite destinations to travel to . From the mansions lining the Battery to the colorful crepe myrtles lining every street , Charleston has a charm to it like no other and , while we kept ourselves really busy , there were still so many things we did n't  get to check off our list ! You can easily explore Charleston for at least a week or two and not get bored . There is so much to see and do ! Today , Im excited to share my weekend away in this beautiful city with you . Ive split everything up into the following categories : STAY , EAT , DRINK , PLAY , WEAR . <p> As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly realized that Charleston is really not short on adorable places to consider . However , when I realized that one of my options , The Mills House , was pink AND in a prime location ANDDD affordable , I was like SOLD ! I mean , please get a load of how gorgeous it is : <p> Its lobby and sitting area were gorgeous and their rooms were super comfortable . I slept so well and seriously considered packing a few of their pillows in my suitcase before we left , hah ! <p> FOR THE RECORDI would never do that , but the thought did cross my comfort-loving mind ! <p> Aside from all of the already mentioned positives , my girlfriends and I also enjoyed an afternoon by the pool ! Get there early ! Its on the smaller side so , although there are chairs all over the second floor outside deck area , there are a limited number of chairs RIGHT by the pool . We enjoyed drinks at the bar one night and had the sweetest waitress , who enjoyed watching us Snapchat about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant within The Mills House one morning . I got the shrimp &amp; grits and it was probably my favorite breakfast of the entire trip ! It was so good , and their biscuits are so soft and fluffy ! To die for ! Shout out to Robin who was so fun and took great care of us ! <p> Another restaurant that came highly suggested wasPoogans Porch , and it definitely impressed us . Its a couple doors down from Husk and we decided to go there on Sunday morning before setting out to do quite a bit of exploring . We all really enjoyed our meals and thought the story of little Poogan was a sweet one . Youll have to dine at the restaurant to hear it but , I 'll give you a hint as to why I like it so much Poogan is a dog . = <p> We also really enjoyed Fleet Landing , Charlestons only waterfront restaurant . We sat outside by the water and had a gorgeous view ! I got shrimp , red rice and green beans which , for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never get tired of ! It was so delicious ! I almost wanted to order another plate of it all but I refrained because I think our server would have thought there was something wrong with me . <p> One night , we wanted to go to Halls Chophouse but we did not plan accordingly . Its an amazing steakhouse in Charleston and , if you want to eat there , you need to make reservations a few weeks before ! We were going to wait for a table to open up in the bar area but , it was way too small and we were pretty hungry so we walked down the street and found The Rarebit . This place was no steakhouse but it was absolutely delicious ! Who does n't  love breakfast for dinner ? I got their chicken and waffles , but I think Ginas macaroni and cheese was the biggest hit ! <p> There were quite a few other restaurants that we did n't  make it to but heard so much about such as 82 Queen , Toast andS.N.O.B.We wish we could have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for next time , you know ? <p> Just like restaurants , there are no shortage of bars in Charleston ! I already shared my impression of The Husk Bar , but there were quite a few others I 'd recommend , as well . There are two rooftop bars that the girls and I checked out : Pavilion Bar and Vendue . We went to Pavilion Bar , at the top of the the Market Pavillion Hotel , one night after dinner at The Rarebitand just barely caught sunset , but caught enough of it to suggest you do the same during your visit ! The views are a good mix of city and water , and the bar staff are very attentive and swift . There are tons of seating options , between loungers and high top tables with adorable umbrellas with lig <p> hts on the underside lighting up the rooftop when its dark . The girls and I sat out on the loungers for awhile , watching the sky fade into black , until we finally saw a table free up ! We checked out Vendueon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Magnolia Plantation &amp; Gardens . I am usually very keen on sticking to wine when I drink but I was excited to see that they had a Pimms Cup on the menu . It was delicious and the view was gorgeous ! Its more of a water view if that 's what you would prefer ! Another bar we stopped in one night was Carmellas , a cafe and dessert bar ! We were looking for something a little more lively but it was adorable inside and the cheesecake looked DIVINE ! <p> In terms of where to go out , I am probably going to be laughed at by ANYONE who lives in Charleston , or has at one time , when I share where we went out on Friday night . Let me preface this by saying we love the show Southern Charm on Bravo and thought this place would be SO fun to go to being that we 've seen the cast frequent this bar on more than one episode . So , with that said we went to Republic , which is actually more like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , as much fun as a introverted homebody can have . We met some people , who were kind and funny . Afterwards , we ventured over to Trio , which was just a mess haha ! I felt like I was in college again . However , I never go out so I tried to just embrace it and have fun , and I did . If you 're super social and like to go out , I would say try those two ! <p> REQUESTIf you know of any better places , leave them in the comments section below so I can include them here for anyone wanting something fun but not like these two places Ive described ! <p> One of the other things I love about Charleston is there really is something for everyone ! If you 're a foodie , I 've already got your to-do list set with options you saw in the EAT &amp; DRINK above ! If you love a thrill , head over to the Old City Jail to catch a tour . It was Charlestons County Jail and housed thousands of prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deemed inhumane and unsafe to keep people there . Its supposedly haunted by many spirits who died over the years and has been featured on tons of ghost hunter type shows . We went on a rare 11:00pm one and enjoyed ourselves for the most part ! <p> DISCLAIMERI know everyone has their own opinions about ghosts , spirits and the afterlife . I am kindly asking you to please refrain from commenting about said opinions and harassing me about whether or not I should have partaken in such a tour . Going on a tour like this does n't  necessarily mean I believe one thing or another . My mom , a huge history buff , brought me up to embrace our past and this building was a huge part of it for many , many years . I thought itd be fun to venture through it for that reason and if a ghost tour is my in to do that , I 'm okay with it . <p> Another thing my fellow history buffs may enjoy is heading over to The Big Red Barn to go on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy tickets ahead of time , so head to your hotels reception to point you to the exact location you 'll need to go to purchase . We picked ours up at a store we popped into to grab a popsicle and cool off for a bit , so we just stumbled on it but I know there are other places to get them . Honestly , we had a great time on the tour . I love learning little fun facts about old cities . For example , there are these stones you 'll see on the side walks and they look a little odd because they 're standalone but seem to serve no point . Well , the city decided to keep these stones because , back in the day when carriages were the primary means of transportation around the city , the carriage would pull up to these stones to let ladies out . The stones served as a stepping stone so they did n't  have to jump down from the high carriage . Kinda cool . or am I a nerd ? = <p> HEADS UP ! Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the girls and I certainly kept looking at these carriage tours like are these animals okay in this heat carrying all these people around ? Before we set out on our tour , I obtained information about how the animals are treated and was happy to hear the staff atPalmetto Carriage Works talk so compassionately about their animals and animal care process . They even have a handout for people to take with them with all the information . I know there are a lot of animal lovers and activists that follow me , and I understand that there are a lot of people who do n't  like that these animals are used in this way . I totally get it but , again , do n't  need to be harassed for the choice I made to go on the tour . I truly believe that Palmetto Carriage Works do n't  just talk the talk . Its clear they walk the walk . They use mules instead of horses , which are stronger and do better in the heat . They assign TWO mules to each carriage tour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running the tour . Most carriage tours we saw had ONE horse being driven by the tour guide which , after learning about mules vs. horses , made me really sad for those horses ! I 'm sure every company is regulated and does a great job with their animals but I was highly impressed with how this company treated theirs . They even start the tour by driving you through where they keep their mules so you can see it all for yourself , and they mentioned that each mule gets a couple days out of the barn to run around and not work . <p> So , if you want to go on a carriage tour , I would recommend going on one through Palmetto Carriage Works . And , if you 're completely against this activity , no one is forcing you to go . Youre entitled to your opinion and stance on the matter , just as I am ! <p> Other great options for you history buffs would be to head down to East Bay Street to check out the infamous Rainbow Row . Its the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot in my heart . My moms favorite city in the South was Charleston and we had paintings of Rainbow Row around our house growing up because she loved it so much . Its typically pretty congested so , I would go early if you want a picture with not a lot of people or cars . You can also head out to Fort Sumter , where the first Battle of the Civil War took place . I went out there and took a tour the last time I was in Charleston , a few years ago . Its pretty interesting and another big part of American History to learn more about and see for yourself . <p> If you are keen on taking some pretty photos , well you 're in Charleston , so you 're pretty much set but I 'd definitely suggest just walking down along the Battery just before sunset , heading over to the Pineapple Fountain OR checking out an old plantation home just outside of the city . My girlfriends and I did both ! In terms of a plantation home tour , we chose the Magnolia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charleston on the Ashley River and our concierge at The Mills Housesaid its the most popular and a beautiful site to see . She was n't lying ! This place is absolutely gorgeous and , despite the heat , we loved exploring the property ! <p> FYII shared in an instagram photo that I went to Magnolia Plantation &amp; Gardens and got a comment from someone who could n't believe that we went to a plantation home because the families that used to live there owned slaves . So , I feel like I need to make it VERY clear that touring a plantation home , for me , does NOT mean I support the white civilians who lived in those homes in the South during the 1800s . In my opinion , I think touring places like this stirs up compassion in my heart for those who experienced such injustice , because it was n't okay ! To be honest , the tour had almost nothing to do with slavery . There was one small mention that , after the Civil War , that many of the owners slaves decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property and run the tours . He paid them , as well . Other than that , it was all a historical account of the home throughout the years . 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I wore this on our first night in Charleston when we went to dinner at Husk right across the street from our hotel , The Mills House ! It was a great little dress to wear that allowed me to stay pretty cool . I wore it in THIS post from Sunday ! <p> Also I got THIS neon pink clutch a few months ago and , honestly , totally forgot about it because I 've kept it in the dust bag . It would have been PERFECT to wear with this dress and its currently on sale ! 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I wore this outfit out to dinner one night ! Its definitely hot in Charleston so if you wanted to opt for shorts like THIS or THIS instead , I would n't blame you ! Both are on sale right now ! 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I wore this outfit on 4th of July , our last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then drove around the city , taking pictures of the beautiful sites and homes , then heading over to Magnolia Plantation &amp; Gardens ! 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I wore this outfit one morning to breakfast at Poogans Porch and then to shop around King Street with my girlfriends ! I ended up stepping outside to chat with Ben for awhile and quickly realized that I needed to wear something a little looser , like the romper I wore below ! 129525 @qwx329525 <p> I changed into this lightweight romper after we shopped around on Saturday and finally felt cool . I mean , I was still hot but it was MUCH more comfortable because it was n't clinging to my body . I 'd highly recommend it or something similar , like these below : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> Alright , that about does it ! I hope this helps give you a little bit of a guide to what you should do in Charleston when you go ! Obviously , there are probably TONS of other great suggestions but , I can only share what I know = Thanks so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much and be sure to stop by tomorrow for the beginning of the biggest sale of the year ! Ill also be sharing things on Snapchat and Facebook Live throughout the sale so get excittteddddd ! = xo . <p> What beautiful pictures ! I live about 45 minutes north of Charleston near Pawleys Island and consider myself blessed to live in such a gorgeous area of the country ! Quick question , how did you tie the bandanna scarf you wore on the 4th ? It looks adorable ! <p> I go to the College of Charleston and have eaten at so many of the places . I also know which ones are tourist traps and not very good . For a lunch place , Caviar and Bananas is amazing ! Its a little store and restaurant in one and the food is ranging from gormet sandwiches to make your own salads to sushi to hot foods like Mac and cheese , salmon , and fried chicken . It is seriously delicious , and you can ask any one who lives there and theyll say its super good ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got so sister restaurants as well that are equally as good . I am super picky and healthy and my mom has allergies and we 've never left hungry or dissatisfied . There egg roll appitizer is great and a must get ! These are places that show the Charleston charm , unlike some good , but normal restaurants you could find if you travel anywhere . <p> I live in Charleston and absolutely LOVE it ! ! I would definitely recommend Tavern &amp; Table In Mount Pleasant as a bar for you to go to next time you visit . Its a restaurant but I 've never been a big fan of their food , its right on the water on Shem Creek and the view is amazing ! Right across the street is the Shelter , they have pretty good bar food there and the actually bar there is fun too ! Lots of fun drinks as well ! <p> we visited charleston a few years ago in July for our anniversary so I feel you on the heat thing . It was HOT . But sooooo beautiful !

I bought this red Tory Burch mini tote which , yes , is a mini version of the cognac one I carry all the time . Okay , confession . I really just wanted it because it was just too cute to pass up . Before I saw the bag in person , though , I was a little nervous about the size . I 'm not usually a " mini " purse kind of gal . I think sometimes tiny bags look really silly . The bigger , the better in my book ! But , I 'm really happy I gave it a try because its actually the perfect size . It fits everything I really need with me when I 'm out : wallet , keys , sunglasses , phone , lipstick , and gum . Itll be festive for other holidays , as well , like Valentines Day and Fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other color options i.e. black , green , pink , navy blue , etc , too , if red is just not your color .

We all have those days where we just want to throw something easy on that 's still functional and cute . Chambray is that for me . I can throw on an oversized chambray top and leggings with black flats , and I 'm good to go on a Saturday morning brunch date . In the same regard , I can throw on a sleeveless chambray button up with a pencil skirt over it with heels and head to church on Sunday morning . I wore this outfit last week to some meetings and , personally , felt like it was a good mix of comfortable yet put together . I can see how the cardigan might seem a little sloppy looking , and I realize how my job is a little more relaxed in the dress code department than most .

On the other hand Boston has so much rich culture and history and its an absolute blast . <p> Hi Haley I love your blog ! Though I am not super into fashion , I follow you because of the great pieces you write ( like this one ) and the scope you give us into your life . I 'd love to see more of that in the new year ! Your resolutions sound awesome some of mine include being more intentional about how I spend my free time and keeping in better touch with my friends from college scattered all across the country . You 're so inspiring , and I think it is awesome how you have established such a wonderful , positive brand that young women like myself can look up to and be inspired by ! <p> Hi Alison ! Thank you for letting me know why you follow me and what youd like to see more of ! I can tell yall like when I do more heartfelt posts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point . I appreciate your kind words so much . You mean so much to me ! xo . <p> I love your goals/resolutions ! I also want to get more organized and make better use of my mornings/evenings . Its been hard getting up early since having a baby , but I know that if I got up before him , I 'd feel so much better the rest of the day and much more productive . The TODAY show has definitely been a love of mine , too . I love that you take Fish out and get Starbucks before it starts ! Im inspired to do the same ! ! Thanks for sharing ! xx <p> Hey Emily ! That 's always what I think about having my blog post for the day done before the morning . It is SO liberating and I feel so accomplished but it does n't  happen often so I hope to be better about that this year after I am done getting the home front organized ! Ha ! Good luck with your resolutions , as well , girl ! xo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to keep me accountable . I want to work on my communication , simplifying , being thankful , growth and focusing my energy on the positives . I want to add in adventure but I think it will depend a lot on how our sweet baby girl adjusts to life when she 's born in February . <p> Love this Haley ! Happy New Year ! ! I know , I am only one person of your thousand followers , but i love reading about your travel trips- where your are going , and then reviews once you do go ! As a travel bug myself , it really is helpful to look at for weekend trips or ideas , etc ! ! I 'd love a few casual business outfit looks ( similar to the Banana look you did ! ! ) for us worker bees that are office bound each day . I 'd also love your @shopalysonhaley insta to stay up and going , HA ! Excited to see what S&amp;T has in store this year , i truly love this little blog and pray you have abundant success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel is an area that I struggle to cover for yall on the blog . There are reasons for that but I wo n't go into those specifically . All I will say is that I have already put together a strategy for how to remedy that in the future . I am looking forward to sharing more of my travels with yall this year . Noted re : workwear and @shopalysonhaley is staying open . I just have Justine doing some other things to help me get organized after getting back from London but we will definitely continue to sell things here and there . Thank you for your continued support ! xo . <p> First off , I want to say I truly love reading your blog . Also , congratulations on your new office space in your own apartment . I think your 2017 resolutions are great and definitely realistic . If I were to comment on what you should add to your blog is how to use a piece of clothing more than once . I find myself shopping and picking up an item I really like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to analyze how I can use this piece more than once . <p> There are a lot of fashion bloggers out there , but your blog is definitely my favorite . I feel you are relatable and not snobbish . I like that you are open to share your faith in a proud conservative way . But I may be a little bias because I am a fellow Floridian. = Happy New Year ! <p> Hey Alexis ! That 's a great tip ! I think my hesitation to wearing things more than once in blog posts is that when I do , its less likely to be in stock and then whoever did n't  get the item the first time I wore it gets angry that I posted something that is n't readily available to purchase . Its a tough line to walk but I definitely wear things more than once so maybe I can incorporate this type of thing into Snapchat ? Do you follow me on there ? Let me know ! <p> Your compliment about why you enjoy following me made my day . Thank you for saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! xo . <p> Hey Haley ! I was just a casual reader of your blog until you moved abroad and I have been following you religiously since ! I lived in London several years ago and watching your life from afar as you explored put some serious ache into my heart . I want to go back so bad now ! <p> As for travel suggestions , I spent some time in Iceland this year and it was absolutely magical and I highly recommend it . They are going through a tourism boom right now , too , so there 's no shortage of things to do but the prices are a bit insane . Its super cheap to get to Iceland from America , though ( I live in Atlanta ! ) , and very easy to get from there to everywhere else in Europe . Its in the same timezone as London and many British people go there for a weekend jaunt . <p> Anyway , I cant wait to see what 2017 has in store for both of us ! Good luck , lady ! <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow all the people that I found in London on Instagram religiously and vicariously live through their Instastories . I miss London so much . Its such a magical city and totally changes a person if you ever have the chance to live there . = I 'm glad it brought you to follow me more closely . Happy to have you along for the ride ! <p> I definitely want to go to Iceland ! Looks like such a beautiful place ! Thanks for the suggestion ! ! Hope 2017 is full of fun travels for you , my dear ! Get back to London ! It misses you ! xo . <p> Happy New Year ! Two of my goals this year will be to : 1 . Save more , shop less ( this is always a tricky one , ha ha ) 2 . Become more active , I recently traveled to Vegas for the Christmas/New Year holidays and also walked for miles everyday , so I want to incorporate more activity into my daily routine now that I 'm back at home .

I always hate when that happens , but it is bound to happen from time to time . I do apologize for that but I found some other amazing summer tops with stripes that I think you would like , as well . <p> Here they are : 129525 @qwx329525 <p> As always , Nordstrom is my go-to for these types of items because they tend to have tons of inventory in stock and a wide variety of options . Ca n't beat free shipping &amp; free returns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July outfit options : 
@@29465941 @3165941/ <p> This plaid button-up is probably one of my favorites lately . I love the small additions of red &amp; a lighter blue against the large majority of deep hunter green and navy blue . Pair it with white or dark denim , and a red lip and you 're ready to conquer the day ! Remember : Madewell runs big , so size down if you 're looking for a more tailored fit . <p> Guys .. I 'm enjoying the Storyline conference so much . We got to hear from everyday people who are creating some amazing stories and walking them out in such life giving and inspiring ways . Excited to see what today , Day 2 , has in store ! <p> Hope yall have had a great week ! Thanks so much for stopping by ! xo. 129524 @qwx329524 <p> Yall I saw this morning that my Instagram has 300,000 followers . I am continually blown away by how many of you follow me . I can not believe it . At all . It never ceases to shock me . Please know that I appreciate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to thank you sufficiently but I do want to do a little something . Im excited to give away TWENTY $50 gift cards to Nordstrom to twenty lucky ladies . That 's not all , though . I love- Nordstrom , - do n't  get me wrong but , its important that you know that there 's nothing you can buy at Nordstrom that will make you feel whole or fully satisfied , so each winner will also receive two of my favorite books : <p> Scary Close by Donald Miller and Love Does by Bob Goff <p> They have both tugged at my heart and inspired me to live a better life , a better story . If you 're not a reader , I totally get you . I used to start books and never finish them . These two changed that in me . I promise . They 're worth the time .

I thought the colors were SO pretty . I do n't  wear red very often so buying it was a push out of my wardrobe comfort zone , as well ! I decided to keep it simple with a pair of white jeans , which can always be dressed up or down as long as they are crisp white . I also rediscovered an old lip gloss color that my girlfriends and I loved to wear in college . Its called Scandal ! Ooooo ! <p> HEADS UP : If you need a good pair of white jeans , this is my favorite pair ! I know sizes are limited in the ones I 'm wearing today . <p> Hah anyway , hope yall are having a great week so far ! Going to keep todays post short and sweet to give myself a little more time to get the Ulta video started &amp; completed for you guys ! The goal is to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what video I 'm talking about . I 'm partnering with Ulta on a video post . Brands give publishers full creative control , typically , when working together so I thought itd be fun to give the content topic over to you guys to decide ! So , I polled my Snapchat audience giving them 4 post suggestions to choose from and by a landslide they wanted a video on my Favorite Drug-Store Beauty Products , that you can obviously buy at Ulta = So , be sure to follow me on Snapchat because its my favorite platform to communicate and talk to you guys on ! I love hearing your feedback and suggestions . Your comments to me make my day seriously ! So , I 'll be filming that this afternoon , after I shoot a few looks with another London-based photographer , then will need a good bit of the rest day and all day Thursday to get it edited and ready for yall to view ! <p> If all goes to plan , I 'll have a post full of the Fall finds you need to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> I am also thinking about starting to do encouragement / inspirational posts starting next week . So many of you reach out and say such sweet things about how sweet and inspiring I am , how I 've encouraged you in some way , how down-to-earth I seem , etc . Its incredibly sweet to hear , especially because being a good human being is a daily goal of mine , but it made me think maybe I could just share my thoughts on tough topics on here so you can refer back to them from time to time , if needed . If you 've followed me from the beginning , you know I 'm a huge fan of quotes and words , and if so many of you like what I 've had to say in the past I 'd be happy to spend a little bit of time every month on those kinds of posts . Let me know your thoughts and if you have any suggestions ! <p> You are so down to earth and have such a sweet aura about you that 's for sure ! Love the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and low of the week with a little encouraging word factored in ?

I understand their love of those polka dots . So sweet
