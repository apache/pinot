@@2428258 <h> Post navigation <h> An Analytical Approach to Enhance Recruitment of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients <p> No single blood test or physical finding alone can confirm the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . However , two tests that detect markers of inflammation are often ordered when RA is suspected : erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . Other common tests include rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies . <p> RA patients in the United States <p> While the test results are clearly valuable to the requesting physician to inform diagnostic decisions , sponsors can also leverage this information to support patient recruitment in an increasingly competitive space . We recently evaluated how de-identified patient data from these common tests run by LabCorp can support sponsors ' clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis . <p> Tapping into a rich resource <p> When tests are ordered through LabCorp , the results are stored in a secure database along with supporting metadata . The additional data includes the ICD-10 codes for the patient , physical testing location , healthcare professional specialty , as well as general information such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the physician . With today 's analytical technologies and informatics capabilities , many new insights can be collected to improve forecasting and clinical development planning . <p> Adjusting inclusion/exclusion criteria in real-time <p> Protocol design is one area that benefits from access to this trove of relevant test results . Sponsors seeking to optimize their study design can evaluate the feasibility of their protocol 's inclusion/exclusion criteria , a practice that is valuable before protocol submission and even during a study to address in-flight issues . <p> Querying the LabCorp database by ICD-10 codes for these two common RA tests , ESR and CRP , the desired values can be set for each test result along with choices in patient demographics . A baseline result is returned with the number of eligible participants and summary statistics of the selected lab parameters . This information can then be compared to different scenarios , such as directly measuring the effect of - increasing the CRP levels on the number of eligible patients , or measuring the change in variability of ESR when the age range is increased . <p> Another crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most appropriate for their study . The LabCorp data can be transformed into a heat map of eligible patient populations ( clusters ) based on any combination of patient diagnosis codes , test results , test ordering patterns or patient-level progression of a disease state . Overlapping patient clusters and physicians can then be identified across the U.S. This information can be supplemented by leveraging the Covance Xcellerate- database , which tracks investigator performance , to pinpoint the best sites to support the study . <p> Geographic patient and physician information can also highlight gaps in coverage . For example , the heat map of RA patients from LabCorp may indicate that a large patient population is n't served by a known investigator . In that case , the sponsor may choose to engage a new investigator site or establish a referral relationship with the physicians who are frequently ordering RA-related tests or see RA patients that may screen into their study . <p> Opting-in to clinical trials <p> Beyond gathering and mining patient information , LabCorp 's online patient portal has added an option for people to opt-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very short time frame , we 've amassed over 120,000 people who have expressed interest in participating in applicable clinical studies .

@@2428312 <h> Post navigation <p> Clinical trials are becoming increasingly complex and competitive , so attracting the best investigator sites to participate in a trial is a crucial step in meeting patient enrollment targets . <p> Delaying approval by even one day can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more , depending on the drug . This means that timely trial implementation , including patient enrollment , may add significant value . <p> Meeting patient enrollment milestones in cooperation with investigators has traditionally been viewed as the responsibility of the contract research organization ( CRO ) . Now , important new data show that a sponsor 's choice of a central lab impacts the willingness of investigators to work with a sponsor on clinical trials . <p> Investigators have clear preferences when it comes to central labs , according to results from a September 2016 study conducted by the Life Science Strategy Group ( LSSG ) . * Fully 91 percent of investigators said they are more satisfied and willing to work with a sponsor on future trials when the sponsor has selected their preferred central laboratory from past clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences seem likely to influence overall satisfaction , ongoing relationships with the sponsor and even their ability to do their jobs effectively . This connection , first reported in 2011 , is often overlooked . <h> What Matters to Investigators <p> Investigators indicated that they participate in clinical trials to access new medicine and therapies for patients and because of intellectual curiosity . However , when weighing the decision to join a trial , they also consider aspects of trials that impact their satisfaction such as time commitment , budget and proper training . <p> So , how can sponsors increase investigator satisfaction ? <p> In the survey , 98 percent of investigators stated the central laboratory selected by the sponsor impacts their personal and staffs ' success , day-to-day activities and willingness to work with a particular sponsor on future studies . <p> If the investigator is working with a laboratory that he or she prefers " one that 's easy to do business with " satisfaction increases .

This becomes important when considering what motivates investigators to participate in trials . <h> Components of Satisfaction <p> Investigators tend to value a specific handful of services , which may tip the balance on how satisfied they are with their experience during a trial . In the survey , they shared that they generally prefer the lab that provides : <p> User-friendly kits and easy reorder instructions <p> Strong , reliable customer service for the investigator <p> Timely reporting ; quick turnaround <p> Covance Central Laboratory Services scored highest in the study as the most preferred central lab more than three times as often as the nearest competitor .

@@2428353 <h> Post navigation <h> A Holistic View of the Biosimilars Landscape : Key Factors for Clinical and Commercial Success <p> Biosimilars have dominated the headlines in the U.S. with several FDA approvals , legal battles and questions around reimbursement , placing an increased focus on how to successfully navigate this relatively new pathway from end to end . <p> Starting with the regulatory environment to CMC bioanalytics and pharmacodynamics , learn how drug developers can understand regulatory differences and identify a fit-for-purpose program . We will also cover how to proactively identify key issues for both PK equivalence and Phase III equivalence studies , and initiate market access and commercialization approaches . <h> Opening an early dialogue <p> Regulatory guidance from EMA and FDA has become more harmonized , but the requirements continue to evolve . Regulatory authorities have outlined a stepwise approach designed to demonstrate biosimilarity on various levels . To meet agency standards , sponsors must devise carefully designed strategies for chemical , manufacturing and controls ( CMC ) , non-clinical research and clinical development studies that are substantially different from the plan required for the originator drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes : 1 ) the establishment of structural and functional similarity based on a battery of CMC character-izations and nonclinical evaluations and 2 ) demonstration of clinical biosimilarity through human studies designed to demonstrate similarity to the originator product based on pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) and clinical immunogenicity assessments . <p> In determining what evidence is required , both agencies use a multistep , sequential process , involving analytical studies , as well as animal and human clinical data . A battery of analytical studies is followed by non-clinical in vitro and in vivo functional assessments that may also include toxicological comparisons . Finally , human clinical data are required from tests designed to show whether any of the differences detected in the prior testing result in clinically meaningful differences in either the pharma-cokinetics , immunogenicity or efficacy of the biosimilar product compared to the originator product . <p> As a CRO reviewing many proposals for studies , we 've noticed that sponsors often need guidance to understand the regulatory landscape and benefit from early engagement with regulatory bodies . <p> After proving biosimilarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in post-translation modification , such as glycosylation , a sponsor could approach the FDA and discuss the similarity of the compound to determine if any gaps exist . At this stage of development , the biosimilar should have the same effector functions regardless of potential contribution of mechanism of action . <h> Comparing the need for nonclinical testing <p> After demonstrating a highly characterized and similar CMC bioanalytic , the next hurdle is to design a fit-for-purpose and cost-effective nonclinical testing program , a process that is highly tailored based on the molecule of interest . However , a common question arises in this stage " is toxicology testing necessary ? In short , it depends on the regulatory body . <p> At one end of the spectrum , the EU indicates that toxicity testing is usually not recommended unless there is some particular signal in the comparative assessment of the CMC bioanalytical or if the PD data suggests potential issues . The FDA says testing can be discussed , and includes justifications for not doing some degree of toxicity studies . The WHO has some general regional guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but currently request testing for at least one repeat dose toxicity . <p> Regardless , if sponsors are aiming for a global or more broad market , they should consider toxicology studies . Conversely , if strong comparability data in the CMC support the biosimilarity , then a minimalistic approach can be considered in this stage . <h> Transitioning from Phase I to Phase III <p> The Phase III pivotal study demonstrates that a biosimilar is highly comparable to the reference product , by showing minimal differences in terms of efficacy and safety . Regulators generally look for trials to establish equivalence rather than non-inferiority , unless there is some scientific justification for the latter . However , in the U.S. at least , there does appear to be more flexibility in setting upper bounds of equivalence to allow for poten-tially improved performance compared to the originator product . When designing a study , sponsors need to consider which desired therapeutic indication to target and identify a sensitive measure to determine the differences between the biosimilar and the reference product . <p> Factors to consider in this stage include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding or stratification . Sponsors also need to determine if any switching from the originator to the biosimilar product should take place in the later stages of this study along with the primary endpoint variable to use . <p> Other design issues include the choice of an equivalence or a non-inferiority design and determining the equivalence margin , which needs to be justified to gain regulatory acceptance , and also drives sample size . And , while there have been some recent considerations of alternative statistical approaches that might be more efficient , at this time regulators are mostly interested in classical inferential type of designs . <h> Incorporating Crucial Market Access Considerations <p> In many ways , the commercial path for biosimilars is as challenging as that for a unique innovator biologic . Facilitating market access for biosimilar products involves engaging in the full spectrum of market access and health economic planning activities as early as clinical development . <p> For example , reimbursement under Medicare Part B will remain a hot topic for biosimilars approved under the new abbreviated biosimilar pathway along with coverage by commercial insurers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current policy and insurance environments . Other strategic approaches through reimbursement hotlines , patient assistance programs and provider-facing field teams can also help maximize the potential for commercial success in this rapidly growing market .

@@2428399 <h> Post navigation <h> How to Navigate Pre-Clinical Issues in NASH Development <p> The pre-clinical phase of development for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) drugs faces many challenges . Biopharmaceutical companies have several options for rodent models , but they must weigh factors such as customization versus speed before deciding on the best approach . <p> Some of the challenges include : <p> Diet : There is no prevailing wisdom in the field suggesting that one induction diet is superior to another . <p> Duration of disease induction : Depending on the type of diet , it will take 6 to 9 months for models to exhibit NASH-like features . <p> Despite these issues , companies can reduce their risk by using short-term models for early screening . As the models move through three stages of the disease , an array of biomarkers can be measured to assess factors such as fat accumulation and fibrosis . <h> Customized disease models <p> The induction diets used for pre-clinical NASH studies are supplemented with high fat . Diets rich in nutrients such as saturated fatty acids , trans fatty acids , fructose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as methionine and choline , may disrupt different pathways to yield NASH . At this point , different administration times and diets produce different results . <p> As companies begin pre-clinical trials , they may have to choose between customization and speed . Some contract research organizations ( CROs ) provide models that have already been induced , which reduces the waiting period . However , the client can not specify the exact induction diet . <p> Alternatively , companies can request that a CRO custom-make the models with a certain diet . This approach , while more predictable , requires more time . But early screening data can be obtained through short-term models in which agents such as carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) or dimethylnitrosamine ( DMN ) are used to induce liver fibrosis . These models can help companies evaluate whether their compound has anti-fibrotic features . <h> Three phases of disease <p> The disease created by diet induction progresses through three distinct phases : <p> ( 1 ) Accumulation of fat ( non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , NAFLD ) . Typically , a section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . Biochemical assays can indicate triglyceride levels . Lipid spectroscopy using MRI also can provide data on lipid accumulation , but this technique is specialized and can be cost prohibitive . <p> ( 2 ) NAFLD progresses to NASH . Typical biomarkers at this stage include elevated liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) . The marker cytokeratin-18 ( CK-18 ) , which is linked with necrosis and apoptosis in the liver , is sensitive and specific for increased inflammation in livers previously filled with fat . <p> ( 3 ) Fibrosis . When normal liver cells die , the organ responds by producing fibrotic tissue . A fibrosis index integrates levels of hyaluronic acid , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 ( TIMP-1 ) and amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen ( PIIINP ) . A pathologist may also examine a section of the liver under a microscope to assess the amount of fibrosis . <p> As the disease progresses , circulatory pressure increases in the liver due to inflammatory and fibrotic changes . Blood flow in small blood vessels is blocked and portal pressure rises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> NAFLD develops slowly in humans , usually taking decades to evolve and progress . However , rodents have a very short lifespan , and disease progression may take only several weeks or months in the experimental system . Although the rate of progression is faster in rodent models than in humans , many of the typical histological features in diet-induced rats with non-alcoholic liver disease closely resemble those seen in humans . <h> From pre-clinical to clinical <p> Many of these biomarkers , such as CK-18 and hyaluronic acid , can be aligned with endpoints in human clinical trials . For instance , patient blood samples can be tested for CK-18 and fibrosis markers .

@@2428501 <h> Patient-reported outcomes , compliance and retention are key components of success . <p> Recent research contends some underlying immune system response mechanisms are common to inflammation-related diseases , such as asthma , COPD , psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , lupus and inflammatory bowel disease . These diseases are referred to as Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Disorders ( IMIDs ) . There is a significant shift in the approach to managing traditional inflammatory diseases from organ-based symptom relief to tackling common underlying pathways of immune dysregulation which offers the hope of disease modification . <p> This shift translates into an opportunity for pharmaceutical companies to develop new treatments specifically geared toward modifying disease states , entering new markets and expanding market share . Although IMID trials are known to face a number of challenges that could easily derail efforts , there are ways to proactively address and reduce these challenges . A number of these ways are associated with the role of the patient " here we focus on patient-reported outcomes , patient compliance and retention . <h> Manage use and integration of patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) <p> PROs play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of symptomatic improvements in treatment outcomes , such as lessening of joint pain . Misapplication of poor or out-of-context PROs can lead to incomplete and/or spurious data . <p> To effectively prepare for this challenge , pharmaceutical companies can work with their CROs to carefully select and manage implementation of the appropriate and validated disease-specific PROs . Ideally , this entails integration between clinical development , health economics and outcome research teams , leveraging their collective expertise and experience . The approach provides the following benefits : <p> Clear instructions about expectations for questionnaire or other PRO instrument completion <p> Clear instructions for site personnel to review each instrument as soon as possible after administration so any missing data or clarification can be addressed swiftly <p> In addition , use of an electronic device for data capture can expedite real-time data capture and integration into the database and minimize errors . <h> Proactively address patient compliance <p> Many of the new therapies to address inflammatory diseases are biologics administered by injection . Self-administration of an injectable drug ; however , poses several issues , including patient apprehension and poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficacy . <p> Training and continual technique checks are critical to increase patient comfort and compliance with self-administration . During the screening period , placebo doses can be used and observed in the clinic or screening/randomization sites . <h> Optimize patient retention <p> Success does n't end with recruitment ; the patients need to be retained as well , especially when the study requires a long-term commitment , such as rheumatoid arthritis studies with endpoints focused on radiographic response and/or physical function that requires patient follow-up for up to two years . <p> The following are ways to increase continued patient participation : <p> Leverage pre-existing patient relationships " For indications that are chronic conditions , as such , the majority of patients entered into clinical studies will be already known to investigators . Investigators will have direct involvement with patients and family members during each visit . <p> Educate patients on an ongoing basis " Provide patients with general study updates and health-related information . <p> Send study reminders " Using postcards or text messages , communicating with patients prior to scheduled appointments can keep commitments top of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notepads can also be effective . <p> Telephone contact " Site staff can phone patients between scheduled appointments to check on well-being and protocol compliance and remind patients of their next scheduled visits . <p> By taking these steps with patients , you can effectively address the clinical trial challenges IMIDs face . <h> About Joan Meyer , Ph.D . <p> Joan Meyer , Ph.D. , is the Operational Strategy &amp; Planning Global Therapeutic Area Head for Inflammation , Infectious Diseases , and General Medicine at Covance .

@@2428523 <p> One of the confounding factors in clinical studies that can contribute to difficulty in discriminating an active treatment effect versus placebo is subject eligibility creep when subjects ( e.g. with milder forms of disease severity at baseline ) may get enrolled inappropriately by sites when struggling to meet recruitment targets and timelines . Baselines are skewed and misrepresented since subjects initially may be assessed as suffering from the more severe disease grades required to meet inclusion criteria . <p> The inclusion of de facto milder patients can make it more difficult to observe a treatment difference versus placebo and is , unfortunately , likely to place the trial at significant risk of failure . Multiple other factors also play a role in the so-called placebo response ; placebo response rates of 14 to 20% have been observed in trials such as psoriasis , and nearly 30% in placebo-controlled studies in rheumatoid arthritis . Even higher rates have been observed in ulcerative colitis studies . High placebo response can result in a failure to observe treatment effects and place otherwise effective drugs at risk of the study not meeting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IMIDs ) have a tendency to have unpredictable , chronic remitting and relapsing patterns . This makes it crucial to confirm severity and ensure stable disease at baseline on at least two separate assessments and with follow up treatment evaluations conducted by the same evaluator throughout the study to control standardization and mitigate assessment variability . Specific training of site staff who will be performing certain study assessments , such as ACR20 assessments in rheumatoid arthritis studies , is critical . The training is a way to reduce variability of patient assessments across sites and regions and ensure greater standardization across the study to provide more robust data . Blinded , standardized , centralized reading of some assessments , e.g. long-term radiographic evaluations , is likewise a valuable tool to help minimize bias and endpoint variability . <p> The key to combating eligibility creep is to bear these challenges and the natural history of the disease when recruiting subjects and proactively putting in place the measures aimed at improving the quality of enrollment and the rigorous standardization of baseline and endpoint assessments . <h> About Joan Meyer , Ph.D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strategy &amp; Planning Global Therapeutic Area Head for Inflammation , Infectious Diseases , and General Medicine at Covance .
