Period . <p> Its a no brainer that taking modafinil every day is going to reduce the efficiency of the drug , whilst potentially introducing unwanted side effects ( and worse : dependency ) . <p> I was mindful of only taking modafinil on days where it would be beneficial specifically , on tasks that required intense concentration rather than lucid creativity ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite this , after several weeks , I noticed that the performance high had tapered off . <p> I was still getting more work done on modafinil , but without the same intensity or total-mindedness that marked my early experiences . <p> This could be down to a tolerance of the drug , or an erosion of the placebo effect . <p> Whatever the case , I did not feel Limitless . <h> End of the Experiment : Panic Attack <p> My dabbling with modafinil came to an abrupt end in January this year when I suffered a panic attack . <p> This had never happened to me before . <p> It scared the shit out of me . <p> I was sat at lunch with my fiancee , in a food court , feeling overly buzzed . <p> I had taken modafinil that morning , along with a large highly caffeinated coffee which I suppose is the equivalent of raising two fingers to the Gods of ones nervous system . <p> Over the previous weeks I had occasionally felt a sense of unease . Heightened senses . Jittery restlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that pulling myself away from work , out of the tunnel , was causing an avalanche of thoughts , feelings and emotions to rapidly rush back in and fill the vacuum chamber I 'd created . <p> I had n't  yet put my finger on anxiety as a root cause . <p> But this day would mark the first time I 'd ever felt the need to read about it . To understand the signs . <p> All of those signs I was feeling over lunch : <p> Restlessness <p> Fidgeting <p> Sweaty palms <p> Racing thoughts <p> Sense of paranoia <p> Sense of foreboding <p> Racing heart rate <p> Dizziness and nausea <p> A complete disconnect from my surroundings <p> A need to GTFO <p> Over the years , I 've encountered all of these symptoms to some extent but never a situation where theyd all come rushing to the surface over a lunch of fucking fried rice . <p> It was inexplicable . <p> The colour had drained out of my face , my hands were shaking , and the murmur of foreign voices lunching was swirling around me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence of my fiancee eating her lunch with a concerned look . I do n't  remember talking , just muttering : " Need water , I need water , wheres the water " <p> Finally grasping that what I was experiencing was a panic attack , my next thought was : oh shit . <p> The modafinil . <p> Its not going to leave my system for hours yet . <p> I needed this to be over in seconds , not a whole afternoon . <p> I left the restaurant in a hurry and we sat outside . I felt like I 'd run in to a brick wall , mentally . <p> Seems crazy , but that 's when it dawned on me : it had taken me precisely 29 years to establish how anxiety feels when it manifests physically . <p> Even though the small signs had been there all along . <p> I did not like the feeling one bit . <p> After making it home through an extremely shaky taxi ride where I wanted to jump out of the vehicle and run at the sight of every red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The following weeks were tough . <p> I was shaken badly . <p> Riddled with this new catch-all feeling of anxiety , particularly around meal times . <p> I suffered a few recurring smaller attacks , despite ditching modafinil . <p> I remember fearing I had a heart condition , or diabetes . Blood sugar problems . Who knows ? You do n't  want to speculate online since you know all roads lead to Oh shit , It must be CANCER . <p> What I now assume I was experiencing the palpitations , the breathlessness , the foreboding deep-sat feeling that something is wrong was anxiety . <p> It just had n't  been triggered in the way that lead to a panic attack . <p> And for that , I blame over-stimulation of my nervous system . <p> Modafinil + coffee . <h> Maybe It Wasnt the Modafinil ? <p> I ca n't be sure the modafinil was to blame . <p> This period in January coincided with several changes : <p> 1 . I 'd just spent two exhausting weeks in the UK for Christmas . Constant booze + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week = Sheer exhaustion when I got back to Bangkok . <p> 2 . Sudden lack of mobility ( from the broken toes ) had severely restricted my ability to get around Bangkok . Which is pretty integral to my peace of mind . <p> 3 . I 'd recently gotten engaged which obviously , I was happy about but felt overwhelmed with the prospect of organising a wedding in a foreign country . Family and friends gathering 6000 miles away ? Organizing the proverbial piss up in a brewery is enough to stress me out , so this was no doubt playing on my mind . <p> 4 . I 'd recently started taking magnesium supplements , which have been ( anecdotally ) linked to anxiety attacks when used with modafinil . <p> 5 . I 'd recently dabbled in float tank and meditation sessions . <p> I know , meditation and floating sounds stupid as a theory for sudden onset anxiety , right ? <p> Float tanks are supposed to be a release from tension and stress , since the mind in zero-gravity has nothing to do but listen to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that might reduce stress . <p> I can see how it might unleash it , too . <p> I cant say for sure what caused such a monumental fuck-up of a start to 2017 . <p> As with most post-event reasoning , the answer is probably more of a clusterfuck than I am able to digest . <p> A combination of events , circumstances ; one bad afternoon ; and a lot of over-thinking . <p> But yes , I suspect that modafinil played a part . <p> The trigger , if you will . <h> Aftermath : Thoughts on the Experiment <p> Six months on , I 'm back to normal . <p> It took several weeks to shake off the heightened sense of anxiety that followed me around after the panic attack . <p> I think much of that was down to a self-reenforcing loop : <p> I started panicking about the panic attack . <p> What if I have another one ? What if this is my future ? What if I 'm slowly losing the plot ? <p> Taking any more modafinil was the last thing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off work to try and get my shit together . And to deal with the harsh mood swings of quitting caffeine . <p> You might be wondering <p> Were the modafinil productivity gains worth it ? <p> MO-DA-FIN-NILLLLL <p> Do I get less done these days without modafinil ? <p> Honestly yes . <p> But that is relative to an extremely high bar . <p> Im convinced that something close to maximum productivity is possible without modafinil " when I 'm in the zone . <p> Although I can spend less time there . <p> And it is harder to find . <p> There 's no doubt , I get less done on the days where I start badly , or cant focus , or just cant get started . <p> Net result , after quitting modafinil : <p> I 'm 10% less effective on my good days <p> I 'm 50% less effective on my bad days <p> I 'm less anxious in general <p> I 'm better at creative tasks <p> The typical affiliate might look at that and think : <p> " Jesus , what a bad decision to stop taking it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic attack , or sudden onset anxiety , you know that its simply not worth chasing that extra 10% " or trying to eradicate the bad days " at the expense of your mental health . <p> Not worth it at all . <p> Besides , I 've built up enough competence over the years to still get more done on my bad days than most people get done in their good weeks . <p> Having a good team certainly helps with that . <h> Thoughts on Anxiety in General <p> While a panic attack in public will have to go down as one of my shittier experiences of 2017 , I still see it as a positive thing . <p> The incident opened my eyes to symptoms of anxiety that I have ignored for my entire life . <p> I never grasped what they were . <p> Its also made me more empathetic towards others I know who suffer from anxiety . And others , I suspect , who do n't  know they suffer from it . <p> Previously , if somebody had told me they were feeling anxious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll be fine , there 's nothing to worry about " , and treat it as a lapse of mental strength . <p> One bad lunch showed me it could be far more insidious than that . <p> I 've also found a few things that helped : <p> 1 . Not spiking my adrenaline system with modafinil . <p> Hey , look , the reason for this post ! <p> I see a lot of affiliates experimenting with modafinil , and other smart drugs . <p> I do n't  blame them . <p> The pursuit of Total Cognitive Enhancement is catnip to me , too . <p> I 've got nothing against that experimentation ( clearly ) , but many of us digital types are built from the same stuff . <p> Introverts , socially awkward , tunnel vision tendencies , etc , etc . <p> If any of the above sounds familiar , I would exercise extreme caution in playing with a substance that acts as a central nervous system stimulant . <p> If you 're going to use it , get in sync with your mind and body . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I immediately gave up coffee . <p> My theory being you 're a jittering mess , any further stimulation is a bad idea . <p> Well , quitting coffee did n't  have much effect initially . <p> I suffered a month of smaller aftershocks and a greatly heightened state of anxiety and social unease . <p> Ironically , the symptoms started to subside at the same time as I reintroduced my daily coffee fix . <p> ( And I 'm pretty sure that first cup was what heaven tastes like . ) <p> These days , I max out at two cups of coffee per day . <p> Hell hath no fury like the thunderbolt coming a baristas way if she should fuck up one of them , or underfill my cup . <p> I legitimately walked out of Dean &amp; Deluca a few weeks ago after they Full-Fat-Milked me by mistake . <p> ( Theres a diva in us all . ) <p> Seriously though , the links between caffeine and anxiety are well documented . <p> I have noticed an uneasy floating / not-really-there sensation if I over-indulge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , I suspect , that can escalate to a panic attack given the correct trigger . <p> 3 . Acknowledging Anxiety As Is <p> The third and most important tip Ive taken onboard was simply the wake-up call from experiencing a panic attack . <p> Acknowledging anxiety . <p> I 'm learning to acknowledge when I 'm feeling anxious , without any attempt to alter the state . To accept the feeling at source . <p> Sounds like a tiny thing , but acknowledging the feeling is a fundamental step towards controlling it . <p> You know what they say , right ? <p> Self Help 101 : <p> Best way to reduce anger is to stop and acknowledge : " I can feel the sensation of anger " as opposed to continuing with " I AM an angry motherfucker " and launching the first plate . <p> I used to think that was a bonkers cop-out . <p> But it contains an element of truth . <p> Controlling that split second freeze-frame between " I am " and " I feel " can make all the difference between wrestling control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Your Thoughts ( And More of Mine ) <p> As always , I 'd be interested to hear your thoughts and experiences . On modafinil , panic attacks , anxiety and other epic smart drugs of choice <p> Want to hear more from me ? <p> Well , as you can tell , I do n't  blog much these days . <p> However I have recently started sending out a monthly newsletter discussing various topics and trends that are relevant to marketers , entrepreneurs ( and anybody else reading this shit ) . 114270 @qwx974270 <p> It was an easy decision , despite those campaigns being my primary source of income for the last decade . <p> As was the decision to quit this blog . <p> Well , as you can tell , I 'm writing this . <p> Shutting my cakehole was n't nearly as sustainable . <p> Nevertheless , I thought I 'd explain why I decided to get out of the CPA business . Maybe some of you can relate . <h> Why Give Up CPA ? <p> To be clear , when I say that I stopped launching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing altogether . <p> I still have several toes and half a bollock in the affiliate industry . <p> What I gave up was the conventional CPA model of affiliate arbitrage . <p> That is : <p> Running ads on Facebook , Exoclick , PopAds , etc Sending users to a landing page that forces an offer down their throats Hoping to get paid more in commission than I lose in ad spend . <p> This model has made me a lot of money over the years . <p> And do n't  get me wrong : its still a good model . <p> But I had several reasons for abandoning affiliate arbitrage : <p> Professional stagnation <p> Mental stagnation <p> Shifting barriers to entry <p> Desire to take more ownership of my assets <p> Increased unwillingness to burn my bridges ( and ad accounts ) <p> Ten fucking years doing affiliate arbitrage <p> There was another factor . <p> Can you smell the billowing winds of change ? <p> Or has my dog just farted <h> When Affiliates Stop Talking About Affiliate Marketing <p> I was listening to a keynote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched around how to build your own product , whilst outsourcing the day-to-day management , and living happily ever after . <p> ( Well , cheers mate . Ill take ten quids worth ) <p> You hear more and more of this , do n't  you ? <p> " Build your own product " " Be so legit they ca n't ban your Ads account " " Treat affiliate marketing like any other business " " Go work in an office " <p> Hmm . <p> This would have been the prelude to a savage bottling had the speech been given at , say , Affiliate Summit 2008 . <p> But times have changed . <p> " The difference between thousands of dollars and millions of dollars is building an asset , an actual business that can eventually be sold " and what better way to build that business than by leveraging the remarkable powers of affiliate marketers ? " <p> I 'm paraphrasing here , but this is the grand takeaway in 2017 : <p> Do n't  be an affiliate . Use affiliates . <p> Its funny because most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obvious idea . <p> And yet here we are <p> At an affiliate conference . <p> Like preaching to the pigs that theyd be wise to move in to selling pork . <p> Only for the pigs to sharpen their knives with approval . <p> The industry has changed , clearly , and many affiliates are finding their interests piqued by topics that are n't  so much affiliate marketing , but entire business models we used to proudly avoid . <p> Developing products ? <p> Dropshipping ? <p> Ecommerce ? <p> Building a large team ? <p> " The indignity ! " <p> These topics are front and center at affiliate events ; they are the talk of the conference ; but what 's so strange is how the traditional affiliate models we used to bumrush are falling out of fashion . <p> Affiliate marketing conferences are starting to look a bit like AA meetings . <p> Together we flock to celebrate tales of triumph , reform , and lucky escape , courtesy of successful ex-affiliates who still know how to slap together a completely irrelevant PowerPoint about PopCash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking talking case studies to convince us that , yes , we too , can soon work on something that does n't  involve that thing that brought us here . <p> Nervously farting at the prospect of new frontiers is the state of affiliate marketing today . <p> Or , at least it was for me twelve months ago . <p> One of those frontiers , a major rising trend in the affiliate space , is something we used to scowl at as the bloated ugly sister of get rich marketing rebills . <p> It goes to demonstrate the hilariously cyclical nature of our business , because that trend is called E-Commerce . <h> The Rise of E-Com <p> How about another flashlight , me old mucker ? <p> If you 've had your ears pinned to the ground or simply not up your arse you will have undoubtedly heard about the sophisticated funnel that has seen items like flashlights and survival kits blitzing every last corner of the social and native web . <p> While these offers have provided some excellent opportunities for affiliates using traditional arbitrage , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To understand why , you need only look at the single greatest barrier to entry facing affiliates today . <h> Barrier to Entry : The Cloaking Economy <p> Generally speaking , arbitrage affiliates need to be cloaking to be competing on the largest platforms . <p> ( The alternative is to be operating at a tremendous scale beyond the scope of most readers . ) <p> No surprises there . <p> Personally , I do n't  like cloaking campaigns . <p> Over the years , I chose to focus on niches and traffic sources where it was n't a prerequisite for profitability . <p> Its widely accepted that to run the more traditional types of affiliate campaigns successfully on Facebook or Google , you will need to cloak . <p> There was enough volume to get profitable through fresh new offers ( often unregulated ) , unsaturated markets , and novel creative angles . <p> My view is that , while this may still be possible today , the traditional lines of affiliate attack are increasingly leading to attritional bloodbaths rather than the rampant profiteering that made them desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to cloak , how do you compete with somebody who does ? <p> Bear in mind , many of the most popular offers are forwarded to affiliates precisely because the owners do n't  want to get their own hands dirty . <p> Some affiliates , undeterred , are convinced of a middleground . <p> A grey hat nirvana . <p> Theyll ask : <p> Isnt it possible to profit running White Hat campaigns but simply " pushing the envelope " to the edge of compliance ? <p> Surely there 's a way to run aggressive CPA campaigns on Facebook , profitably , without risking an account ban ? <p> Well , perhaps . <p> But what are you ? <p> A fucking masochist or something ? <p> This is the famed guideline straddling that allows a Facebook rep to speak with a straight face to a room full of CPA affiliates and insist that yes , it really is possible to co-exist on our platform with just the tip of our penis in your arsehole . Be our friends . Its worth it . <p> The truth is that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entry of large-scale affiliate marketing success . <p> And even if you do cloak you cant sleep any easier . Your ad accounts can , and probably will , hit the skids eventually . <p> So , how does this fit in with the rise of E-Com ? <p> Well , as one door closes <p> The barrier to entry for launching profitable affiliate campaigns has increased , but the barrier to entry for launching successful products via traditional E-Commerce has decreased . <p> Affiliates , over the last two years , have found themselves enviously glancing at other industries where the potential for rapid growth is just as big , and the payoff arguably even greater <p> Many trends have aligned : <p> Platforms like Shopify , Magento , WooCommerce , Teespring and others have brought total convenience to selling online . <p> Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter , GoFundMe and IndieGoGo have erased entire start-up costs ( and cannily allowed entrepreneurs to pass risk on to the consumer ) . <p> Marketplaces like Amazon FBA have opened up insane ready-to-tap economies of scale . <p> To top it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to source cheap products from China . <p> Whichever way you look , there are companies start-ups and giants making it easier than ever to bring tangible products to market on a scale that matches the potential of rapid wealth accumulation associated to affiliate marketing . <p> Consider some of our biggest pet peeves : <p> Caps <p> Lack of exclusivity <p> No control of the funnel <p> Requirement to cloak ads <p> No tangible business to sell <p> No ability to project long term growth <p> Who would n't want to sample post-affiliate life ? <p> There is a price , of course . <p> Many affiliates , including myself , have come to accept ( through gritted teeth ) that our best efforts can be multiplied exponentially only with the backing of a good product . <p> The likes of which are seldom found in the CPA space . <p> Good products . <p> I know , right ? <p> Affiliate Summit 2008 and theyd be sticking a fork in it . <p> Good products are the inevitable future of affiliate marketing for anybody who cares about advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the affiliate industry of today is becoming harder to penetrate without a competitive edge such as cloaking many affiliates are deciding that to commit to a competitive edge , they might as well take ownership of the product itself . <p> Its the carrot of more work for a considerably bigger reward . <p> Of course , an explosion in E-Commerce does n't  have to come at the expense of affiliate marketing . <p> As a few gajillion flashlight sales attest . <p> What 's changing is the incentives for the individual . <p> Turn back the clock ten years and one of the reasons why we LOVED this industry was because we could try X on Monday , Y on Tuesday and Z on Wednesday . Get rat arsed on Thursday . Sleep on Friday . <p> It was easy to sling shit at the wall and something would stick . <p> These days , the big opportunities in affiliate marketing punish such a lackadaisical mindset . <p> It does n't  take a genius to see how E-Com is turning so many affiliate heads . <p> It offers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought us to affiliate marketing in the first place . <p> With the added advantage that you can build your own asset . <p> And share a bed with Facebook Ads . <p> I expect a slow exodus of arbitrage affiliates as the platforms we love work harder to clamp down on products that customers do not . <p> Not because of failure on the affiliates part . <p> But rather a better payout elsewhere . <h> Seriously , though <p> My decision to step back from this blog , from writing about affiliate marketing , and from actively launching campaigns day-after-day was rather simple . <p> I got sick to fucking death of it . <p> Who wants to be doing CPA forever ? <p> One person , and I 'll tell you his name : <p> The Gingerbread Man . <p> He loves flirting with destruction , does the Ginge . <p> And in affiliate marketing , so do we all . <p> Which is why I asked myself : <p> If you do n't  want to be doing CPA forever and you 're successful enough to choose what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I did an excellent job of finding acceptable answers to that question over the last decade . <p> Answers that allowed me to continue focusing on A/B tests , without ever applying such a concept of open-mindedness to my own career . <p> My tendency to identify as somebody who focused only on CPA " rancid arbitrage and Voluum stats roulette " had become self-limiting . <p> And it was liberating to finally say : <p> " Fuck it . This is utter bollocks . What 's next ?

@@106277679 @1677679/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> " How much is it possible to earn from affiliate marketing ? " " If I quit my job , how long will it take me to earn X/day ? " <p> Both answers depend on your competence , but I realise there 's an insatiable hunger for concrete figures . So , here 's my take on the matter <p> There are five earning brackets in this industry . <p> Affiliate Apprentice Losing money . <p> Low Level Affiliate Anywhere from $0/day up to $300/day . <p> Intermediate Affiliate Anywhere from $300/day up to $3,000/day . <p> High Level Affiliate Anything above $3,000/day . <p> The Bag of Dicks Affiliate He who considers anything less than $10,000/day to be doing it wrong . <p> Bare in mind that were talking about profit here , not revenue . <p> Technically , a guy earning $300,000/month in revenue could be worse off than the guy making a steady $100/day with no outgoings . Admittedly he would have to be blind , dumb , deaf , drunk and stupid to continue swallowing such a skinny margin , but it highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revenue is vanity , profit is sanity . <p> A unique characteristic of our industry is how the mighty can fall overnight , often in spectacular fashion . <p> You can go from earning $3,000/day to sod all in the space of a lunch break . And vice versa . <p> An Intermediate affiliate may drop a level after losing his best campaign , while the Affiliate Apprentice can turn Top Doggy Baller overnight if he stumbles in to an unsaturated niche and makes it pay ( a daily occurrence in 2009 , rare in 2013 ) . <p> The Bag of Dicks Affiliate may continue to prosper , or complacency may bite him in the arse , but hell always be a bag of dicks as long as he judges others for how happy they should be with their income . <h> $300/Day vs. $300/Today <p> Many affiliates cant seem to tell their daily income from their todays income . <p> The volatile nature of the business makes it mindless fantasy to calculate your annual salary on the back of one days profits . <p> If this is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  assume that you 'll bank $365,000 in the next year . <p> Your current earnings , in relation to a salary , are $2.73/day . <p> Repeat your success tomorrow , then the day after , and so on in to the foreseeable future . Only then can you start throwing out whimsical multipliers on an income that is n't yet yours . <h> What Are Established Affiliates Earning ? <p> In the established affiliate community , I would say that most of us operate in the Intermediate earning category . <p> Note that by established , I 'm talking about affiliates working full-time in the CPA space . <p> Just recently a poll was held on the STM Forum ( I recommend you join ) asking , " How much do you earn in a year ? " <p> Here were the results : <p> Obviously , what an affiliate says he earns does not always correlate to what he actually earns , but it says a lot about the competence and/or the bluster of these affiliates in that almost 20% reported over $1 Million per year profit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you take the median of this small sample ( $81,000 to $120,000 ) , it translates to between $221/day and $328/day in profit . I would put this at the very start of the Intermediate bracket , partly because the income has to be sustained over the course of a year . And this bracket is where most established affiliates stay . <p> Note : Not all affiliate forums are created equal . If you were to take a median sample from The Warrior Forum , I 'd bet my shit that the average earnings would barely cover the typical London gas bill . <p> The jump from earning $300/day to earning $3,000/day and sustaining it is what separates a successful , established CPA affiliate from the very best in the business . <p> Its worth noting , the best in the business are not always the happiest with their incomes . <h> Aligning Expectations with Earning Potential <p> My answer to the question , " If I quit my job , how long will it take me to earn X/day ? " is often a swift " Forever " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ align their earning expectations with work that is actually capable of delivering the desired income . <p> here 's a breakdown of where each type of affiliate is likely to invest his time : <p> Low Level Affiliates : Focuses on pockets of profit around the web . He ignores economies of scale in favour of high margin campaigns on smaller traffic sources that tend to be extremely volatile . Examples include POF dating campaigns , small scale Facebook Ads , Juicy Ad buys . <p> Intermediate Affiliates : Focuses on high volume traffic sources with smaller margins than the Beginner , but more volume . Obscenely clustered around the dating niche ( and more recently adult dating ) . High competition on large traffic sources reduces the size of the pie for all . Smart movers in this category target mobile marketing and pop traffic . <p> Apprentice Affiliates Focuses , invariably , on all of the above , to his own detriment . <p> Bag of Dicks Affiliate Focuses on Fox News . <p> So , what do you want to be ? What are you happy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted with an extra $100/day , then fuck anybody who tells you to throw down $10,000 on a costly media buy . POF is a brilliant low-level traffic source ( with a few Intermediate exceptions who rely on economies of scope ) and you need never risk your coat . <p> If you are happy with the intermediate earning bracket , then likewise , you can afford to avoid direct buys and risky investments but you will probably need to advance beyond the low-risk pockets of profit favoured by newbies . <p> However , if you are the type of affiliate who 's going to feel like he has a ball missing until he s earning $5,000/day , then take a reality check . <p> Are you committing your time and energy to the types of campaigns that are statistically and logistically likely to open up the earning potential that represents what you want ? <p> There 's no point in carving out micro-niches on POF if your heart beats for a million dollar salary . <p> Its basic strategy . <p> What are you going to work on that can deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a commandment for life , not just affiliate marketing . <p> We CPA affiliates tend to gravitate towards High Level income targets , probably because we are young , greedy , obnoxious , unshowered mountain trolls with an appetite for lifes luxuries . <p> And that 's fine , but there 's a catch . <p> Everybody has an earning threshold that represents a point of diminishing returns . And many fail to recognise it . <p> Your life situation might dictate that $200/day is the pinnacle of financial motivation . You can drive yourself to attain this goal , but any further and the motivation begins to slip . That 's a point of diminishing returns . Call it your comfort zone . Any work to advance beyond this point comes with the additional burden of pushing you out of that comfort zone . And so procrastination sets in , along with the dual crippling fears of failure and success . <p> Many affiliates struggle to take their businesses to the next level because the nature of the game is such that you can be an Intermediate banking one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push it further ? <p> Well , there 's a good reason why we have to be aggressive , greedier and pushier than most . Affiliate marketing is not a career ladder in any traditional sense . <p> We are only ever as successful as our last campaigns . <p> We cant progress through the ranks . There are n't  any . There are no fallbacks , no safe landings , no room for a performance marketer to live off past glories . <p> The guy at the top can become the guy at the bottom in the time it takes to shit his pants with campaigns burning around him . <p> And that 's a good thing . If you 're sporting shit-stained pants and a negative balance , you might not believe me , but its true . <p> Performance marketing is what it is . An industry that rewards the deserving and punishes the lazy , the unworthy , the bullshit mongers and the just plain wrong . Its everything I wanted but could n't find in a 9-5 . <p> The amount you can earn is almost as staggering as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason why you should focus less on counting notes and more on your value as a marketer . <p> Enjoy the ride , and get a good accountant . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Volume X is now the bestselling release in my entire Premium Posts series .

As long as you choose a market with enough consumer interest . The poll represents mostly CPA arbitrage affiliates . To earn the big money , paid traffic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty standard target for CPA affs . You have to set your targets high because the business is so volatile . <p> Affiliate marketing is great to make money in short span of time . You only need few things a loyal readers and rabbit followings of subscribers or followers . Adsense is also good but if you compare adsense income vs affiliate income you feel that affiliate is best . <p> All CPA marketers put their eggs in one basket . I 've seen plenty of the greats go from zero to hero and vice versa several time in their careers . The smart ones learn to build their own business in the process and pimp their products to CPA newbies ( where the real money is ) . So if your only focus is to make the most money you can I would advise you not to spend it all because that business model wont last . <p> I would like someone to show me a website they have created to make money other than selling WA . There are lots of websites selling WA . Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed several niches but are unable to see the website . <p> hi finch , looking to start in the affiliate marketing just as extra income for an engineer student who still has papers to clear , and time to invest . my comfort zone should n't be above 100 , because i do n't  have any money to invest in this . So where should i start ? <p> I had a chance of looking at how much some CPA marketers are earning . My jaws hit the floor . How can anyone make 32k in a day ? It is not some Photoshop screenshot but the CPA company interface allows earning shouts which is drawn live from the system and displayed on a live chat . That 's where I saw those big figures . Remember I said 32k in a day not in a month . Now that is insane .

@@106277689 @1677689/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> If you are an avid reader of self-help books , or a fan of productivity lifehacks , then its very likely that Getting Things Done ranks highly on your all-time list of important reads . David Allens seminal business book has proven a massive hit across all ages , drawing widespread acclaim and spawning multiple time-management applications . <p> In 2007 , Getting Things Done was touted by Time Magazine as the ultimate self-help business book of its time . Strong words , no doubt , and I agree with them 100% . <p> The latest application to digitalise the Getting Things Done system is Nirvana , and thankfully for any Mr. Shallow Pockets among us , its completely free to use . <h> What is The Nirvana System ? <p> Nirvana follows the same blueprint touted by David Allen in Getting Things Done . Allens system relies on two core principles perspective and control . Any task that occupies our mind , whether it be doing the laundry or launching a high profile website , needs to be recorded and removed as a distraction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds are comparable to the RAM in your computer . A complex library of thoughts , reminders , things to do , and things to act on . He believes that we create mental blocks by attempting to carry so much information in our short-term memories , and that we can make immediate progress by using a workflow system based around 5 stages . <p> 1 . Collect things that command our attention . 2 . Process what they mean and what to do about them . 3 . Organise the results . 4 . Review as options for what to do next . 5 . Do it . <p> So , how do these steps result in improved productivity with Nirvana ? <p> An example , not my real account ! <p> The interface is segmented in to 4 key areas . <p> Inbox Where you record tasks and to-do items as they enter your mind . <p> Actions Once a task has been entered in to the system , it can fall in to four focus areas . <p> Next means it is the next required action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task can not be completed until a certain requirement is met ( e.g. your colleague sends you the files you need to work with ) . <p> Scheduled means this is a task that you have planned to do on a certain date . <p> Someday is for all those arbitrary tasks that would be nice to complete , but ca n't be worked on in the present . Its an incubation folder for all the tasks that you might do on a lazy Sunday afternoon in the future . <p> Focus Once you 've decided what tasks to work on for the day , you can star them . Its essentially your to-do list . If you have scheduled tasks for the future , they will appear here once their doing day has arrived . <p> Projects Here you create projects for every conceivable group of tasks that you might want to work on in the future . <p> Launching FinchPremiums.com was a project with about 60 tasks that I slowly chipped away at , focusing on 6-7 every day . <p> Similarly , planning a trip to America is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen before you can tick it off as done and dusted . Buying tickets , choosing hotels , finding a dog carer and etc . <p> To get maximum value out of Nirvana , you should first add a project for every single " I want/need to do this " that enters your mind . Most people will have at least 50 projects that they 're working on at any given time , from arduous 3 year work projects to preparing a fancy dress outfit for the weekend . <p> You can assign the projects to the same subsets of Next , Waiting , Scheduled or Someday . Maybe you do n't  want to plan a trip to America , but you do want to travel round the world by the time you 're 40 . One is a next action , the other is for someday . <p> The key to freeing up your mental RAM is to get the thoughts documented and contained within Nirvana so you do n't  have to carry them in your short-term memory . The ultimate goal is to free your mind so that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GTD system is a very effective framework , and Nirvana makes it easy to follow . But to do so successfully , you 're probably going to need to spend an entire weekend getting your projects added to the application . Not only that , but you will need to define the next actions for each and every project . <p> Its no good saying " I 'd really love to do this project " . Your projects must have next action steps so you do n't  have to waste valuable mental energy thinking about what you need to do next when you come back to them . You just do it . <p> Tasks can also be set with contexts and priority ranking . You can group tasks based on where they need to be done ( at home , in the office , at the store ) , or even how much energy they require . <p> So if , like me , you find yourself sagging on a Friday afternoon with only an hour to go before you 're done , you can filter for tasks that match the requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of my favourite ways of getting the most out of my least productive time . <p> There 's nothing worse than sagging at the end of the day and feeling overwhelmed by the lofty ambitions of what you hope to achieve in the bigger picture . Setting low energy tasks gives you small victories to keep you moving forward . <h> Nirvana vs . The Competition <p> How does Nirvana stack up against the rest of the apps based around David Allens system ? <p> Arguably the biggest player in the GTD marketplace is OmniFocus , an excellent and comprehensive application that has the added advantage of being compatible with iPads and iPhones .

Just me , Netflix and an ocean of possibility . <p> When I 'm home alone , I like to watch documentaries , shit panel shows , and TED . 8 out of 10 Cats is n't the best fodder for the brain , but the documentary section on Netflix has yet to let me down . <p> Ive been inspired by three documentaries in the last week , each in a very different way . Instead of burying their lessons in my viewing history , never to be recalled , I thought I 'd share them with you guys . <p> Each film is around 100 minutes long , and utterly compelling from start to finish . I suggest getting your little grubby paws on them . <h> Man on Wire <p> The Fearless Genius <p> On August 7th 1974 , Philippe Petit set off on a quiet stroll from the World Trade Centers South Tower to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroll . It was the wire walk that stunned the world . <p> A quarter of a mile above the ground , Petit walked between the ill-fated towers not once , not twice , but eight times . <p> He enthralled the stunned crowds , somehow finding the grace ( and the balls ) to lay flat on his back , to kneel to the heavens , and to mock the enraged NYPD who spent over 40 minutes pleading for him to retreat to safety . <p> At one point Petit offered to surrender . He neared the guards , clearly amused by their dumbfounded horror . A performer to the end , he could n't help himself . He turned 180 degrees and raced back in to the abyss , his feet leaving the wire , dancing , showboating . All this a mere 110 stories from instant death below <p> It took the threat of being captured by helicopter to bring an end to Petits stunt . He stepped back on to the roof , straight in to police custody , and that was that . New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagger . <p> Philippe Petit had dreamed about the Twin Towers for six years . He planned his stunt long before the towers had been fully constructed . He called it his destiny , and he spent a lifetime training to make it so . <p> It was the ultimate heist . To break in to the towers , to evade security , to rig his wire in darkness , and then to walk . <p> The only thing certain was that failure would result in death . <p> Petits life was a combination of gruelling training both physically and mentally and undercover sleuthing , of which Solid Snake would be proud . <p> One does not simply break in to the World Trade Center , climb to the roof , set up a wire and dance across merrily , balls flapping in the wind . <p> Such acts require grapefruits of steela lot of careful planning . <p> Petit had an unwavering belief that he would one day step across the New York skyline and be immortalised for the feat . <p> Against all odds , he is remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misty morning . And perhaps even more remarkably , he is still alive to tell the tale . <p> Its difficult to contemplate what rushes through a mans mind as he takes his first step off the edge of the South Tower <p> Imagine the mental toughness required to place your entire body weight forward , away from safety , on to a three quarter inch wire , while every bone in your body buckles from vertigo as the 1,368 foot drop looms ever closer below . <p> It can barely be quantified . I shit my pants at the very thought . <p> But then the average onlooker has n't  spent a lifetime eating , breathing and sleeping the same reality as Petit . Total conviction drove this man to an achievement that went beyond impressive . It was superhuman . <p> Petits stunt was beamed around the world . There was no publicity , no advance warning , and no precedent . Just 40 minutes of daredevil lunacy that forced an entire city to stop in silence , and to stare at a man in the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wire documentary . <h> Bobby Fischer Against The World <p> The Calculating Genius <p> Successful businessmen are distinguishable by their ability to think several steps ahead of the competition . They visualise the game we call life , they gauge their moves as well as what life intends to throw back at them and they make a decision based on the likely outcomes . <p> To be just one step ahead is to be blessed . <p> Now consider the excellence of a chess grandmaster <p> " There are 400 different positions after each player makes one move apiece . There are 72,084 positions after two moves apiece . There are 9+ million positions after three moves apiece . There are 288+ billion different possible positions after four moves apiece . There are more 40-move games on Level-1 than the number of electrons in our universe . There are more game-trees of Chess than the number of galaxies ( 100+ billion ) , and more openings , defences , gambits , etc. than the number of quarks in our universe ! " Chesmayne <p> A novice chess player can enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps ahead . <p> A grandmaster will regularly think up to 12 moves ahead . <p> The best of the best have such astonishing memorisation and visualisation techniques that their brains can filter through billions of potential positions and pick the best possible move while you and I are still processing the last . <p> What made Bobby Fischer so remarkable was that he could make those calculations barely a decade after leaving the womb . <p> His excellence was the result of endless hours analysing positions and outcomes in excruciating detail . He was a child prodigy in every sense . <p> Aged just 14 , Fischer became the youngest ever US Champion . A year later , he was the youngest grandmaster in chess history . He would travel the country holding exhibitions where he would compete against 30-40 amateurs at the same time , soundly beating them all , swaggering from one table to the next . <p> Fischers life revolved around the chessboard to such an extent that his mother forced him to see a psychiatrist to try and kick the addiction . It was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The problem for Fischer , as many calculating geniuses have discovered , was that he never knew how to switch his brain off . He would n't just think 12 steps ahead on the chessboard . Hed think 12 minutes ahead at the supermarket . Hed analyse each and every part of his life in such cynical detail that , inevitably , his world came crashing down . The paranoia turned Fischer in to a recluse . <p> In 1972 , Fischer took part in the Match of the Century against World Champion Boris Spassky of the USSR . It was the game that put chess on the map . A battle of East vs . West during the height of the Cold War . The tormented , troubled Fischer vs. the latest in a long line of Russian champions . <p> In the days leading up to the showdown , Fischer was suffering from such inner turmoil that there was doubt he would even show up . After several delays , he eventually got on the plane , and promptly made one of the most spectacular blunders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Game 2 . <p> Facing a 2-0 deficit and written off by almost everybody , Fischer surged back in to the match and eventually beat Spassky 121/2 81/2 . He returned to the United States a celebrated hero ; an A-list celebrity ; the 29-year-old World Chess Champion . <p> It was the last competitive match he ever played . <p> Bobby Fischer refused to defend his title in 1975 . He disappeared in to obscurity , fled the USA , and eventually became known for an anti-Semitic political agenda that would see him die in lonely exile . <p> Fischer had a brilliant mind capable of superhuman calculation , but he was just as capable of self-destructing at any given moment . It is a sad and familiar correlation of genius . <h> Indie Game : The Movie <p> The Artistic Genius <p> Indie Game follows the exhausting efforts of four independent games developers as they battle through deadlines , Internet trolling , and Microsofts lame support to catch a lucky break . <p> Now , I do n't  know much about designing games ( even though I once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film does n't  require any inside knowledge .

This is a documentary made for affiliate marketers . <p> Indie Game covers many hotbed talking points , including artistic integrity vs. monetary return . Most interestingly , it touches on the process of launching a product and watching the online world react . <p> If you 've undergone this cathartic rites of passage , you 'll be able to relate to the uncontrollable nervous energy .

The sheer blindness of working on something so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether its a work of art or a glistening turd . <p> One developer states matter-of-factly that if he does n't  launch his game , hell have no choice but to kill himself . Its an extreme threat , but clearly non-negotiable . <p> Another developer suffers a launch day bitch slap from Microsoft where its a wonder that he has n't  yet been arrested for hunting down Bill Gates and burning him at the stake . <p> The film is slow out of the blocks , but its impossible not to be fully invested by the final third . The payoff is immense , a proverbial kick up the arse if ever you needed one . <p> Anybody who works online can relate to that passing moment of accomplishment between achieving one goal and drowning in the next . Indie Game : The Movie is like a surge of adrenaline for those on the brink of achieving something awesome . <p> Watch this shit and your motivation will soar .

@@106277693 @1677693/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> To cloak or not to cloak ? That seems to be the question for many disillusioned Facebook marketers these days . <p> Facebook has grown increasingly picky over the ads that it accepts . I doubt you needed me to tell you this . The endless stream of disapproval notices and the fist-shaped hole in your wall should be evidence enough . <p> While Facebook seeks to tighten its noose around the necks of certain rogue affiliates , many of these marketers simply ca n't stand to give up the ghost . They are head over heels with Facebooks enormous earning potential , and perhaps the knowledge that it made them good money in the past . So instead of playing by the rule book , they eat the rules and crap them out the window . Cloaking enters the equation . <p> Cloaking is the mischievous art of showing one page to the Facebook approvals team , and another to the unlucky guy who clicks on your ad . When cloaking Facebook , you can launch a series of pant-wettingly lucrative ads simply by ignoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow . <p> Naturally , Facebook does n't  take kindly to having the wool pulled over its eyes . If you are caught cloaking ads , you can consider yourself banned , along with any other accounts that you may already be linked to . <p> Its clear that cloaking on Facebook is a high stakes game . The need to avoid detection has led to the launch of several professional cloakers , which can cost from a few hundred dollars to several thousand . Most of these cloakers rely on huge databases of IPs , and the hope that Facebook does n't  get any smarter than it already is ( a flimsy leg to stand on , if you ask me ) . <p> I do n't  want to delve in to solutions that are currently on the market . What good would it do for anybody ? You need only sign up at a private forum , or pay attention to your email newsletters . They are not hard to find , although their degree of effectiveness can vary dramatically . <p> If you 're going to skimp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook cloaker is probably the dumbest decision you could ever make . Well , almost <p> My mind boggles at how many affiliates are still fond of the classic bait and switch cloaking that was popular 3 years ago . <p> If you 're not familiar with the technique , well , there 's very little science to it . <p> Cowboy Affiliate #1039 submits an ad promising dramatic weight loss , while redirecting to an innocuous article on a reputable site . Let 's say " 7 foods that will help you lose weight in 30 days " on Mens Health Magazine . <p> Facebook follows the link , sees no harm , and approves it for public display . <p> Roughly 20 seconds later , Cowboy Affiliate is changing his redirect so that instead of the article on Mens Health , the ad now routes through to a monster flog that 's painted in pictures of the 300 workout . Instead of 7 healthy foodages ( Thanks , Karl Pilkington ) , the user is confronted with 2 bottled health supplements , and a recurring billing cycle buried somewhere in the footer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be achieved without technology . You need only guts , balls and a heavy dose of naivety to get your first cloaked campaign live and profitable . Facebook traffic converts so well that having the right ad live for a week can net five figures of profit quite comfortably . <p> Unfortunately , its also about as suicidal as affiliate marketing gets . If your business can only make money with such crash and burn methodology , its already infected with a terminal cancer . I give you about 3 weeks . <p> My recommendation is to avoid cloaking altogether . If you are in this business to make money over the long term , without burning every last bridge along the way , there is little sense in committing to a business strategy where the only person who wins is yourself . <p> In most cases , it would be more accurate to say that the only winner is your affiliate network . They enjoy the fruits of your traffic , without the risk of getting their Facebook accounts banned . <p> But there 's the catch . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term . Some of you guys reading this now have no interest in being full time affiliates . Maybe you have day jobs or other business ventures , and you see cloaking Facebook as a funny little moneymaker on the side . " Hey , Mark Zuckerberg ! Suck my berries " <p> No words of mine will deter those individuals from investing in the technology necessary to cloak Facebook profitably . So to answer the question , " Is cloaking Facebook worth it ? " , only you know the answer . <p> Are you trying to build a business , or are you trying to pillage quick cash like a bull in a china shop ? Your answer should reveal the way forward . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Head over to Finch Premiums for 300+ pages of my affiliate marketing tips . <p> I 've just taken on modding duties over at the StackThatMoney Forum .

I 've personally debated whether or not to use a cloaker in the past . The concern for me is when affiliate networks are actually recommending a cloaker and mentioning it in their newsletters . Do you feel these networks are pushing it a bit by doing so ? <p> I guess there 's nothing to stop the networks from trying it . Whatever gets them traffic , right ? But ita shame that affiliates will follow the advice blindly without looking out for their own best long-term interests . <p> I know people who have been cloaking traffic successfully for years and rely on it as a profitable and stable business model . I 'm not sure what you mean by cloaking is a high stakes game , when you only pay traffic sources for traffic that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new accounts ? : : confused : : <p> Even though it can work over long periods of time , I would be reluctant to call it stable . The traffic sources ( Google , Facebook etc ) have made it clear that they do n't  want certain types of offers being promoted , so cloaking is essentially a battle of wits . But what happens if Facebook chooses to get more aggressive in the way that it combats cloakers ? There 's always going to be a question mark over the long-term sustainability , because the business model is only designed to satisfy one party . <p> If somebody trespasses in to your backyard every day , sets up a stall and starts slinging acai berries to the neighbourhood , how many times are you going to let it happen before you increase the measures taken to stop his access ? Or set the police on his ass ? He can try to fool you , and he can come back in a million different disguises , but sooner or later you 're gon na get smarter and find a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admittedly , but its the same way I look at cloaking and riding these traffic sources to the bank against their will . Just because its always worked , does n't  mean it always will . I could never see cloaking as a stable business model personally , because the concerns I have about both its ongoing viability and the legal implications in the future would make me , by definition , pretty mentally unstable . <p> The process of cloaking can be damaging to all affiliates . It can lead to advertising platforms banning any form of redirection , negating an affiliates ability to utilise a tracker in his/her clickpath . <p> As we all rely heavily on accurate data for split testing and trending , we really do n't  want this to happen across the media-buying board . <p> Cloaking ai n't  for me . <p> I agree with Finch . Having to rely on shady tactics to bank , indicates a very flakey business model . <p> So this guy made an AMA on reddit on how he was making 20 K a month on cloaking fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 360 in the near future . It just amuses me how people will do anything to make a quick buck at the cost of a real long term business . Facebook has been cracking down on these rogue affiliates no doubt and will close down the loop hole due to the recent media sting that showed that facebook ads were 80% garbage . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277694 @1677694/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> There are three things you can take for granted when you run a highly opinionated blog . <p> Criticism , haters and trolls . <p> The first in that list , criticism , is perhaps the hardest to swallow . <p> I believe one of the reasons why so many blogs die is because their owners find it tough to deal with the raft of criticism when their writing reaches a wider audience . <p> When you stick your neck on the line and make your opinions heard , it can take a while for the first criticism to appear . Many times , bloggers will get used to a small crowd of praise and positivity towards their posts . Followers congregate much sooner than haters , and its only when a brand verges on the realms of notability that the haters are likely to come out of the woodwork . Its at this point that many bloggers , in my opinion , get trigger-shy . <p> They realise that with a growing readership , there are so many more toes to stamp on than there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get thrown out of the window , replaced by non-offensive and fence-sitting gibberish . They are less keen to offend , or risk a great backlash . They would rather satisfy every eyeball to the point where their voice becomes weak and mixed , or they will abandon the blog altogether . <p> Its a great shame . Some of my favourite bloggers , through no coincidence , attract more than their fair share of haters and trolls . <p> Haters and trolls are irritating . But they are not the end of the world . What really can frustrate is the justified criticism . There are two forms of justified criticism : a difference in opinions , which is unavoidable and not a bad thing . Or a hole in your argument , usually the result of lazy posting or ill-considered comments . <p> A few months ago I wrote a supercharged negative review of Rich Dad Poor Dad . I wrote it in about 40 minutes after devouring the book in all of its gory mediocrity . Now I 'll admit , I got carried away with some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Top 5 on Hacker News and send thousands upon thousands of Rich Dad junkies my way . <p> In retrospect , I have now adopted a no post goes live on the day of writing policy . The cooling off period allows me to read the post with fresh eyes and detect any unnecessary exaggeration , or to add extra reasoning where needed . I believe I was also guilty of small blogger syndrome . <p> I wrote the post expecting it to appeal to my usual motley crew of readers , which it did , but I got lazy and perhaps defeatist in not considering what would happen if the post actually ventured outside my usual readership . The result was tens of thousands of new readers either loving or hating ( depending on their take on the book ) my preaching to the choir . <p> That lesson has taught me a lot about best practices for those running highly opinionated blogs . <p> Firstly , keep your usual readership in mind , but do n't  fall in to the trap of preaching to the choir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avoid simply phoning in posts . A lot of bloggers never venture beyond cult hit status because they 're too paralyzed with fear to overcome the criticism they might receive from existing readers for growing as a brand . <p> This can backfire spectacularly if your writing becomes so niched-in that your arguments are dripping with in-group bias . The outside reader sees only a very closed mind , even if your followers love you . <p> Secondly , if you are going to make a controversial statement , prepare to be challenged by those who stumble upon your views with their own fully fleshed arguments to the contrary . In essence , prepare for criticism before it arrives . You ca n't slag off people , concepts and arguments and expect your blog to be a widespread success without very sound reasoning to back up your points . <p> Nothing intimidates haters and trolls like a confident voice in charge of his views and muse . <p> Objectively , however , criticism and mixed opinions are unavoidable . If you get lazy with your argument , and that argument goes viral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffled by your obnoxious 24 year old entrepreneur posturing you 've only got yourself to blame . A cooling off period is essential . <p> Re-read your work and play Devils Advocate . What are the weak points ? What statements are poorly backed up ? Its easy to miss these vital factors when you hit the Publish button while your cheeks are still flushed with writers venom . <p> I 'm slowly learning that the best time to publish new material is when I 'm in a neutral mood . Not angry , not sad , not overwhelmed with joy ( psst , last spotted in 1997 ) . Tilted emotions typically lead to skewed views on the world . You will attract rightful criticism , and rightful criticism is always the most demoralizing to your work if not learnt from rapidly . <p> Its fine to write material when you 're in those moods . But when you are the editor of your own content , its important to separate the ego from the neutral observer . You cant do this by publishing 5 minutes after writing . <p> And what about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing . They are the evidence that your brand is sticking , and moving in the right direction . The best way to deal with such urchins is to carry on as you were . Embrace the disagreements , and those occasionally hateful voices . At least it means you 're being heard . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I do n't  know much about these " Rich Dad Poor Dad " imbeciles , but having read the review comments , I 'm inclined to think a little unjustified criticism is what the doctor ordered . <p> After the haters came rolling into town , did you consider redoubling your criticism ? <p> Something like " If this Kiyosaki does n't  have kids , I sincerely hope Rich Dad Poor Dad does n't  allude to some sick sex game he plays with his wife .

You suck . <p> I think most companies who attend these corporate events are under the illusion that affiliates are dumb , blind and blissfully unaware that suits and jargon speak actually add up to not much . <p> Christ , the second you mention that you 're a CPA marketer who works from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tutting of dismay and a polite ending of the conversation while the poorly educated twat turns his back on you to deal with other more respectable attendees . <p> The latest event on the horizon here in London is the A4U Expo . I do n't  know about you , but I stopped taking this event seriously when I saw that it was sponsored by Argos . <p> What 's that all about ? <p> Am I supposed to be seduced in to promoting Argos ? With an entry pass starting at -395 , I 'd have to spend the rest of my life shelling Argos links to come anywhere close to making a return on that investment . <p> The only affiliate who will pay -395 for access to this kind of corporate circle jerk is the affiliate who is being sponsored by his company . <p> Now , I realise there may be corporate suits reading this now who gasp at the idea of their favourite event being compared to a Yuppies Day Out . But really , that 's all this shit is . Every single keynote spirals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better placed collecting a list of the speakers , Googling their blogs , and reading up on the tips that everybody else will be paying -395 to hear a speech about . <p> The corporate affiliate marketing landscape couldnt be further detached from the hard working affiliates who drive the industrys popularity forward . Some of us are educating ourselves to build sustainable businesses , others are spending lavish amounts to dress with sophistication and learn how to make 4% on a fucking book sale with Amazon . <p> Good luck with that . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Pick up a copy of Premium Posts Volume 1 if you like the content on this blog .

I went to ASW last year , and was shocked that most of the people seemed to not understand the " real " affiliate . Either that or I am mistaken on what this is all about . I talked to many people who did n't  know that PPC-to-affiliate-offer existed . I met tons of SEOs who seemed clueless . Most of the booths I spoke too seemed to have little knowledge in what affiliates want , and instead tried shoving their business card on you so you would try their content locking system . Maybe I missed the point , but to be honest , the conference was n't nearly as great as I thought it would be . A lot of people are just full of shit . It is a good occasion if you know people already and just want to meetup , but it is n't worth it if you 're going there to learn . <p> Nice one , totally agree with you . Problem is : Best customers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business hotel , 10000 Euros for a first class flight to Asia or 15 Euros for 3 hours of shitty hotel WIFI or about 400 Euros for a conference pass ) are people who spend OTHER PEOPLES MONEY ( aka coporate people ) . Real affiliates spend their own money and will think before they drop that kind of sum for some useless suit event . Anyway , the corporate guy walks home with his couple of thousand each month for slaving away in some suicide-provoking cubicle , so in the end the joke is on him <p> I 'm a regular reader at A4U but I 've never quite got their Expo . I certainly cant justify spending the best part of -700 on an event that 's going to teach me about the same thing as some decent blogs . <p> If you 're a super affiliate who can afford to go , and want to network and meet some other affiliates for the craic , then fine . But -700 is a lot of dough and its does n't  seem like it will offer a good ROI for me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit and tie " big corporate " events " ( organized by Asda for gods sake ! ) because pretty well without exception they all turn out to be full of idiots and a complete waste of time and money . <p> The employees who attend these occasions are mostly clueless about online marketing . They have very little freedom to do anything innovative . <p> All they can do and all they want to do is quack the standard bla bla they have been told to quack . The last thing they want to do is appear to be stepping out of the corporate line of their organization and antagonizing their " line managers " next up in the hierarchy . <p> One positive thing you take away from these crap corporate events is how , unlike them we small guys have the edge . We can move quickly , we can act on trends , we can innovate and we can take risks . And we do n't  have to answer to anyone else to do so . That 's a BIG business advantage at practically nil cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 114275 @qwx974275

@@106277697 @1677697/ <p> Let me start , in keeping , by talking about the WORST affiliate marketing forums . Ironically , they happen to also be the most popular . You should understand the pyramid concept behind forums . The bigger they get , the worse the content tends to become . Unless you 're in the business of slinging shitty false dreams to other newbie marketers , you will want to steer clear of the larger Internet Marketing boards . They attract useless advice , the same rehashed " success formulas " and people who miraculously do n't  make a single dime of profit outside the " make money online " niche . <p> The biggest offenders are The Warrior Forum and Digital Point . Both have minor redeeming qualities in the form of occasionally useful buying/selling sections ( if you 're looking to outsource ) , but make no mistake , these are cesspits of bold promises and eternal letdowns . If you spend your days trawling these boards hoping for the one golden nugget of information that propels you towards riches , take a good look in the mirror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . <p> These forums recycle the same whimsical bullshit . You can expect topics like " Where do I get the best backlinks ? " followed by some dude with a paedophillic avatar answering " By using the social media " . This is usually followed by a stack of posts thanking said idiot while offering some other utterly useless advice of their own . <p> I 'm not exaggerating . The majority of the topics , bar a few actually useful posts that as a newbie you 'll never be able to recognize from the trash , are a complete joke . Stay away from them . <p> Now that were on the same page . Let 's take a look at some Internet Marketing forums that actually deliver solid info . This should n't take us long . <h> Aff Playbook <p> Aff Playbook , previously known as PPV Playbook , is one of the best forums to learn about Internet Marketing in the world today . It was one of the first to introduce a subscription model , and has really flourished in the last couple of years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful info that you just do n't  see splashed around on any of the free Internet Marketing forums out there . <p> I 'm willing to bet that of all the Internet Marketing forums , Aff Playbook has the highest average earnings per member . I do n't  know that for sure . But it seems pretty likely given the thousands of dollars I know several active members to be producing on a daily basis . You will need to subscribe to gain access , and I do n't  even know if I should be referring newbies . But hey , check it out . Give it a shot . <h> Stack That Money <p> Stack That Money is a private community for CPA affiliates which houses some of the most vocal contributors to our industry . Its packed to the rafters with excellent case studies , competitions and follow alongs . <p> I post there regularly , and it really impresses me to see the calibre of advice that gets given away . The community is driven by publishers who are making a lot of money , and they share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in getting involved with mobile , or Plentyoffish , or Facebook Stack That Money is an excellent learning playground . Slightly expensive , but highly recommended . <h> WickedFire <p> There are two ways of looking at the WickedFire community . On one hand , you have a bunch of highly intelligent and very successful marketers who DO make a lot of money . And on the other , you have a bunch of loose cannon pricks who will bite your hand off at the slightest mention of a topic that breaches whatever happens to be making them money at the time . <p> I find WickedFire to be quite polarizing . There 's so much alpha male jostling that it can be hard to filter the good information from the red herrings and general bullshit . Its an intimidating place for a newbie so think twice about registering if you are n't  adept at choosing your words around posters who get their kicks out of taking poor gullible bastards for a meatspin . <p> Do n't  expect " money knowledge " to be handed to you with zero posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to offer , without stepping on the wrong egos , there 's some good working relationships to be established here . <p> WickedFire has an excellent buy/sell area where you can do business with some very talented freelancers , most of whom are extremely well versed in all things affiliate marketing . <h> Affiliates4U <p> Ill probably get shot down for recommending the Affiliates4U Forum , but I do n't  agree with the reputation it often gets tagged with . If this place can be accused of anything , its that the general community is a little corporate-heavy . You 'll find a lot of affiliate managers recruiting to their networks , and merchants seeking advice at the top end of their business . <p> I like Affiliates4U for the simple reason that its not plagued by the egos and drama that you 'll find elsewhere . It does n't  have the stupidity leaking through the walls that youd associate with Warrior Forum , but it DOES have a lot of people in powerful positions within their companies . I 've done a lot of private networking on this forum , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staples in my business . <p> Do n't  expect as much discussion of techniques relating to what its like to be an affiliate in the trenches . Use this place to spread your wings and gain a broader view of the industry , while developing some relationships with influential people that can help the growth of your business . I 've always been a strong advocate of affiliates removing themselves from their own side of the story and looking at our industry from all perspectives . Reading the concerns of merchants , affiliate networks and other small businesses is a great way of digging your head out of the sand . It gives a sense of direction for what we can do to make sure affiliate marketing does n't  disappear overnight in a cloud of scandal . <p> Whatever problems you come across in this industry , the forums above should hold the answers or some perspective from people whove been there and got the t-shirt . But part of being successful means that you 're busy taking action today , and tomorrow , so that you have something to show for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading blogs like this . <p> Remember that there 's no success formula . No shortcut to millions . No golden nugget of information waiting to be read . The only way you can make this industry work for you is by being busier , smarter and more proactive than your competition . <p> So on that note , what are you waiting for ? Get out there and make some money . <p> Thanks for checking out My Affiliate Toolbox . I genuinely appreciate it .

@@106277698 @1677698/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Since I posted about potential Valentines Day campaigns , Ive spoken to a few marketers and the consensus seems to be that although it would be nice to profit well on a Valentines Day campaign , it is n't a long term recipe for success . So a lot of marketers do n't  bother . <p> I think a couple of the people I spoke to were trying to schmooze me over having read the previous posts about focusing long term . There 's a difference between focusing all your profits on the short term , and understanding the consumer cycles that exist to be exploited . <p> " Why should I bother with a Valentines Day campaign when I can only get two weeks of profit out of it ? " <p> Its a fair question . But let 's say you DO make the effort to put together a profitable Valentines campaign . You may only get two weeks of hard profit from it now , but you 're also safe in the knowledge that you 'll have a campaign to roll out next year , and the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivers long term results . <p> As affiliate marketers , we are n't  blessed with working for large companies that can hand out Christmas bonuses when December rolls around . We have to make our own bonuses . <p> If you were the manager of a high street store , would you neglect Christmas festivities on the basis that itll be January soon ? No , you come up with a marketing strategy and you use it to take advantage of the current consumer mindset . <p> When people talk to me about building long term campaigns that can profit all year round , I do n't  see that as a bad thing . I just see it as an opportunity lost . Valentines Day is n't going to disappear from the calendar anytime soon . <p> You can choose to ignore every single one of these events on the principle that you 're happy with your stable campaigns and do n't  want to rock the boat . Okay , but are you simply turning down the equivalent to your Christmas bonus ? <p> If you were to turn each of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be extremely profitable you will have done a lot to boost long term profits . Why ? Because we know that they 're going to roll around in 2011 , 2012theres no expiry date in sight . High street shops and online retailers know this . They adapt to whatever current event is being pushed on the consumer and they increase their sales accordingly . <p> I 'm not only talking about seasonal campaigns . Most of us have had a profitable short term cash cow on Facebook at some point . You know ? The kindve campaign that delivers three straight days of super high profits and then nosedives in to a loss . Is this sort of campaign worth ignoring ? <p> I do n't  think so personally . I like these campaigns because I can slam the Pause button , leave it for a month , then cream another couple of days of profit . It might be a short term coup . But its a long term option to have . The more of these campaigns you can have at your disposal , the larger your reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a big song and dance about focusing your efforts on the long term , and I do n't  back down from that at all . But it genuinely surprises me how many marketers are happy to neglect seasonal opportunities . Tapping in to the current consumer mindset is vital . Just as its important to be able to produce consistent stable profits , its also important to predict those consumer cycles . You do n't  think an actual marketing agency would let you ignore them , do you ? <p> I remember reading a post recently about focusing efforts in to one niche and adopting tunnel vision to stick with it until it succeeds . While this can work , I do n't  see it as a sensible decision unless you 're getting closer to owning a product , or at least having a long term asset in that niche . If you 're simply doing CPA lead generation , you NEED to be aware of what 's happening around you . Especially if you 're working at the volatile end of the market where products can disappear overnight . <p> My job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively looking to buy . If there 's one thing that definitely is n't a short term gamble , its that Valentines Day will be just as culturally significant in 2011 as it is 2010 . <p> So are you going to adjust to the seasons ? Or carry the same message all year round ? 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277699 @1677699/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> If I could show you my hairline before and after tax crept in to my life , youd appreciate just how integral its role has become as the chief tormentor of my business . <p> There are Republicans in the world who dread tax less than I , and that is saying something . That is really really saying something . <p> Anyway , political bumberclarting aside , what are the factors that convinced me to invest in an online accounting service ? <p> Lost sleep , notepads full of calculations and four muddled bank accounts these were just some of the symptoms that finally drove me in to the loving arms of Crunch Accounting . I considered us somewhat of a forced marriage , but one worth consummating for the good of my sanity . <p> I 've had the best part of a year to weigh up the benefits of using their service , so here are my two cents for anybody else who is interested . <p> Note : This is only going to be relevant if you run a business in the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the pond . Understandable , right ? Who would want to vacate the lovely sunny landscapes of East Sussex during a fantastic English summer ? Besides fucking everybody , of course <p> Crunch is an online accounting service that handles all your paperwork and tax filing . It has a very sleek interface , allowing you to add expenses and invoices on the move . You can get a running total of what you 're due to be raped for in corporate tax , what you can afford to pay yourself in dividends , and all the cretins that currently owe you money . <p> For a monthly subscription of -70 , you can avoid hiring an accountant ( who would probably run the risk of contracting Herpes if forced to do the books in your cheesy wotsit contaminated basement/office ) . <p> Instead of having that personal accountant , Crunch supplies you with a qualified account manager who you can call , email or badger over Skype . <p> You may have to book in an appointment first , but hey , its probably more reliable than calling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up redirected to voicemail while the bastard enjoys his impromptu two week vacation in the Bahamas . Oh that vacation , the one he did n't  tell you about . <p> It took me several days to transition my accounts to Crunchs system . If you 're firing your accountant during the middle of the year ( always better to be an arsehole before Christmas ) , expect to spend a good few days loading invoices and expenses in to the system . <p> Crunch glosses over the process and makes the system as user-friendly as can be , but let 's face it , this shit is never going to be Friday night entertainment . Adding expenses is a pleasantly brainless experience , and that 's exactly how I like my accounting to be . <p> You can reconcile accounts automatically by feeding a spreadsheet of your bank statement and letting Crunch go fishing for correct matches . This thought would usually fill me with dread . The last thing I want is for some crazed machine to start reconciling thousands of payments with 85% accuracy , but it seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because my bank ( If you can honestly call yourself a bank , Santander ) is a cock . <p> All in all , Crunch has gone to painstaking measures to ensure the online software is user-friendly , intuitive and easy for a tax-hater like me to get to grips with . <p> So what would I like to see improved ? <p> The single biggest beef I have with Crunch is their non-support for foreign currency invoicing . Its possible ( and convenient ) to invoice companies in Sterling from within the control panel , but the system will have a bitch fit if you dare to bill companies in anything other than GBP . <p> That 's bloody inconvenient for me , given how a large number of my invoices are actually in USD or Euros . However , you can work around the kinks by entering a quick invoice in GBP after the hard copy has been processed by your bank . Its not a perfect solution but it will do for now . I hope you 're listening , Crunch ! <p> A year in to our relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is still going strong . <p> Crunch has saved me a lot of time , not to mention the sleepless nights , by simply providing a qualified barrier between myself and the dreaded tax man . <p> They deal with my paperwork . I deal with the playfully coloured forms and buttons . This is how business should be . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Not sure I agree with you regarding accountants . Having someone on board who knows what they 're talking about and can offer you a personalised service is really important I feel . <p> I have had bad luck in the past when dealing with accounting companies as they do n't  really care about small clients , but dealing with one man bands has worked a lot better I find . They give you a personalised service , just be sure to discuss/agree with them regarding invoices to get some visibility regarding how much invoices will be , and ask for estimates so you do n't  get nasty surprises . <p> I use the Sage online service ( -10 a month ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that , annual returnsetc . Pretty easy now we 've got a system in place , rather than what I used to do of sending over all my bank statements . He lives locally , but most communication is done by email and he works at his office . <p> All in I probably pay -1,500 a year on accounting costs , and know that someone who knows what they 're doing is helping look after my business and helping to minimise taxes . And if HMRC have queries , they generally go to him first , as he can answer questions a lot better than I. If its a small query , he probably wont even charge me for that . <p> I personally feel getting your accounting/taxes right is something where you need a really personalised service since things are constantly changing . And along with making things as easy as possible for the accountant ( which ends up in smaller invoices ) by using something like Sage . Probably takes me one hour a month to take care of my accounts now . <p> Forgot to mention the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online currency converter like xe.com to convert the foreign currency into - and use that figure in my accounts . Seems to work fine . It does n't  match up exactly , but that can easily be tidied up as Cost Of Currency Exchange or something like that . <p> And a potential danger of messy accounting is getting an HMRC investigation which can cost a small fortune in accounting fees , so setting up everything in a neat way with a professional looking after you can greatly help avoid that I feel . Plus you can buy insurance against that if you 're worried about that happening . <p> Do yourself a favour and get a proper accountant . Things start unravelling when crunch have to do something that even slightly deviates from their fixed processes . <p> I paid a bit extra to my previous account ( who I 'm now going back to ) , and they could problem solve and find solutions . Whereas Crunch seem to screw things up . For instance , my crunch system wont let me put any director salary through saying " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , please select another date . " The accountant dealing with the problem just says " sorry , you cant have any salary . " OK , so Ill just not put through the basic salary and instead pay tax on the initial -7400 ? Idiots . And from my experience it seems to be a catalog of problems like this . Plus their system is very inflexible , and it often errors . <p> Crunch has at least taught me how to maintain my own books , which should reduce the money I pay to my accountant , and make their lives a bit easier . <p> We did n't  realise there is a few replies here ! Very sorry for the delay in replying ! <p> 1 . Tijn <p> As you probably well know we introduced multi-currency 2-months ago and customers are loving it ! <p> 2 . LA <p> I created Crunch to change the way accountancy was delivered and this required starting again from scratch . <p> Fundamentally accountancy and tax is rule based and so if you spend long enough and invest considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual labour from undertaking the accounts . <p> Using intelligent software , along with a strong account manager , allows the accountants ( dedicated to customers ) to spend far more time helping them . <p> The old approach which you may be referring to is to carry on as normal , using the same high manual levels of work , deliver it really cheap and be unable to afford a big enough team to deliver a good service . <p> Crunch has spent 5 years and -millions to deliver a fantastic service with stacks of personalised service for what is normally 3 times the price . <p> 3 . LB <p> Mmmm , its interesting that there 's an LA and a LB one after each other in these replies = <p> LB , we are a proper accountant and with a team of 70 and growing fast we have a skill set way beyond any normal practice . <p> First and foremost we are an expert accountancy practice and can adapt to special situations I.e we can make adjustments to fix any odd scenarios . <p> Did you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own accountant and account manager and we can solve almost any issue . <p> LB why do n't  you get in touch with me and be interested to find out how you never managed to get something so simple sorted ? Call 0844-500 8000 and ask for Darren Fell . <p> I am a small business owner and have used Crunch for less than a year . On the face of it I found the software to be very handy straight forward and made my life easier . I found my liaison person attentive and helpful . <p> Then I moved over seas for a job and stopped earning in the Uk . At that point crunch began to fail . They started sending me notification to put forward Vat returns with out any income coming into my accounts . I even paid a few of these assuming I must have made a mistake and only found out after chasing them up that they had made mistake and I had paid unnecessary returns . When I tried to cancel my account they failed miserably to end my accounts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is now 7 months down the road since I closed my accounts with them and I have still not received my end of year company return . I still am getting Vat return requests and my account has not been deactivated . <p> What 's been most amazing is that I must have sent well over a dozen or more emails over the last 6 months trying to solve these problems and not one of the issues I have raised since back in November of 2012 has been dealt with . The software may work on the face of things . But it does not seem to have the support of the people running it to ensure viable successful service . <p> Ive been shocked at the total lack of support and follow up from their accounts team and would not be recommending their services to my colleagues or friends . <p> My regret now is that when I first started using crunch I recommended them to everyone .

@@106277700 @1677700/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Anybody can be a Guru on the Internet . And unfortunately , nearly everybody tries . <p> The Internet Guru has become a caricature figure tainted by laughable self-promotion , boundless ego and really poor end product . Some of the ill-sentiment is driven by jealousy , and most of it is entirely justified . <p> Its depressing for a new blogger to commit blood , sweat and tears to a project and still only reap 14 hits per day while a bumbling Super Personality typos his way to the next million . <p> If you are moving in to a new market and wish to establish yourself as an authority , there is an entire textbook of Guru Psychology for you to master . <p> I aim to she 'd light on some of it with this post . <p> There are 5 key skills that separate the biggest **34;0;TOOLONG from those youve never heard of . Let 's tuck in. <h> 1 . Relate to Your Market <p> Imagine you are campaigning to be President of the United States . What 's the first thing you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people whose opinions and trust you hope to gain . You seek common ground . <p> Every Presidential candidate in the modern age has fought to gain trust by creating an illusion that goes simply , " I 'm just like you . " <p> How does this tie in to guru psychology ? Well , let me put it this way . If you cant convince your target market that you share the same hopes , values and dreams , they will vote for somebody else who does . <p> Familiarity breeds popularity . It wins votes , as well as readers , leads and sales . <p> There 's a very simple process that is capable of popularizing you to any market in the world . <p> It goes like this : <p> Find the hopes , dreams , fears and complaints of the audience you wish to speak for . <p> Create a persona that is the Superhero Conquerer of the emotions above . <p> Those who can put in to elegant words what their peers can only feel intuitively in their heads will always inspire and captivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let your blog become the voice of expression that readers can link to and say , " I agree with that guy . " <p> Every guru knows that his ship will sink or sail on the back of one question ; <p> " Is my story empowering or disempowering ? " <p> I 'll give you a clue . People wont read your shit unless it affects them . And theyll only read it once if it affects them in the wrong way . <h> 2 . Monitor the Industrys Engagement Rate <p> If you are a long time reader of this blog , you will probably have a conscious understanding of how I choose to engage with you whether I tell you about it or not . <p> I post once per week . I believe firmly in " If you have nothing useful to say , STFU " . Every post I publish , I want you to read fully . If I start hitting you with infographics and irrelevant Mashable style Top Tens , you will stop listening so carefully . I know this because , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you already feel guilty how you spend it . <p> My posts touch on personal , professional and industry topics . Roughly 50% of the content is designed to be actionable marketing information . The other 50% is designed to portray me . Who I am , what I believe in , which ball Im scratching . <p> I release a product every 3 months but will rarely tell you about it until the day of the launch . And yet , if you read some of my alias blogs , you 'll catch me promoting products religiously weeks before they 're due . <p> Why ? The type of shadowy bastards that read this blog do not like to be marketed to . You will notice that when I do try to seduce you to click an affiliate link , or to buy one of my products , it is nearly always a contextual nudge blanketed by content that is designed not to ruffle your feathers . This is not by chance . It is how I have chosen to engage with you based on the type of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your audience should be based on the wants and needs of that audience . What is going to get them to listen ? <p> Some industries naturally require a great deal of social pandering to be successful . <p> If I wanted to be a successful Work at Home Mom blogger , I would no doubt spend twice as much time scratching backs , liking cute babies , and networking on crocodile feminist forums as I would preparing informative posts . No offence to the WAHMs ( maybe I 'm not American enough to understand ) . <p> Similarly , if I wanted to be a successful fashion guru well , fundamentally , I 'd be shagged . I 'm about as fashionable as a rats arse . Secondly , I 'd have to learn beautiful photography and visual aesthetics . <p> Fashion , crafts , and foodie authorities place a high esteem on the eye-candy appeal of their content . Words are not enough . If you try to engage an audience with the wrong kind of content ( i.e essays on How to Do Makeup ) , its going to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must first learn the currency of that market . <p> It could be video , podcasts , vivid imagery , technical writing , illustration , or what I like to call bitesize content ( think The Daily Mail , Mashable etc ) . <p> Establish how people want to receive your content . <p> Do they need to be spoon fed blog posts every day ? Should you be tweeting in the trenches ? Can you get away with a barrage of emails ? Is it beneficial to give your content a personal touch ? <p> Hint : For a WAHM blogger , it is . For an expert in nuclear waste disposal , a personal flavour may cast you as a dangerous megalomaniac . <p> The best way to monitor your industrys engagement rate is to look at trusted authorities in the space . How do they communicate ? How often ? What social networks and forums do they use ? <p> Just remember , you will always find this research more revealing when you look at what the experts were doing 12-24 months ago . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different to how he spent it when he was creating his initial success . Look to the past for the true success story . <h> 3 . If you 're going to be Social , do n't  be a Social Asshole <p> Many authorities thrive from an active presence on social networks . The vacuums of Facebook , Twitter and Pinterest are great arenas to engage your audience . But you truly do need to think before you post . <p> What would an authority say ? <p> Engagement is about more than barking nonsense in the hope that you 'll be heard . The dog who barks loudest all through the night is rarely the most loved . I wish a few more Social Media experts would understand this . <p> Too many people treat social media as the means to a one way conversation . Perhaps the best advice I 've heard on using social media is to set a goal for yourself : aim to help one person in your market every single day . <p> I do n't  mean answer their questions in 140 character or less ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  mean send them a link to one of your archived blog posts . Instead , you should go above and beyond the call of duty to help them without asking or expecting anything in return . This might involve emailing a detailed reply , or posting a long piece on a forum . It could even involve giving away one of your prized products for free . <p> If you do this every day , a year from now you are likely to have 365 true fans who respect and appreciate you . That is not a following that will change the world . But if you believe in the law of reciprocation , which you should , its a following that will prove immensely helpful . <p> People remember good deeds . Better yet , as human beings we are compelled biologically to return them in spades . <p> You might only send Joe Bloggs a 5 minute email to answer his tweet , but when he stumbles across your product six months from now , the chances of him responding to your sales plea are significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how powerful that tug can be . <p> When you nurture a huge following , your personal taste is more likely to crossover and influence the public domain . But until you 're Tony Robbins ? Planting a thousand good deeds is far more likely to create goodwill than retweeting your own articles . <h> 4 . Search for your Platform of Knowledge <p> You do n't  have to know everything to be a guru on the web . You can get away with knowing marginally more than 95% of your readers . <p> The Internet Marketing space is notorious for blogs and forums that claim to offer the secret sauce to success . Most of the owners are no closer to success than the puppets they hope to seduce . Its a circle jerk , and it works . <p> Do you know why it works ? <p> There 's an unfortunate law , shat on by many , that dictates that the guy who has spent 6 months failing knows more about his industry than the guy who entered it today . He does n't  need to have the blueprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotal evidence of it along his merry way . <p> I call this the Platform of Knowledge . <p> You can be an authority figure without being famous , without having a degree , without practicing what you preach , and without being what your audience aspires to be . All you need is a Platform of Knowledge . An understanding of your field that is better than the average reader . <p> If you have this platform , you can speak for the common hopes , dreams , fears and concerns of your audience . In many ways , the ability to relate to these emotions is much more powerful than the innate ability to solve them . <p> So how do you acquire a Platform of Knowledge ? <p> It falls back to understanding your audience , and what knowledge they are most likely to benefit from . <p> I would advise any aspiring marketing bloggers to indulge in books from the Direct Response greats , then to get a grip on psychology , influence , and the emerging field of behavioural economics . These are topics I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my marketing campaigns , but it allows me to talk about issues that would pass over the average affiliate bloggers head . <p> Whatever market you plan to enter , there will be low hanging fruits of knowledge at your fingertips . Your job is to push yourself to consume them . Surround yourself in a wide range of literature , subscribe to challenging blogs , devour industry journals that inspire you to think independently . <p> I can guarantee that being dedicated to your field will ensure you have a distinct competitive advantage over the authority figure who decides to wing it . <p> Do you see what I 'm saying here ? To become a guru , you should stop being a lazy bastard . Try learning more . <p> Its groundbreaking advice , is n't it ? Precisely what you were not looking for . <h> 5 . Make Split Second Judgments Favourable <p> When somebody lands on your site , how long do you think it takes them to judge you ? <p> The Halo effect is a cognitive bias where we associate that if somebody is skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and C. A positive first impression let 's say an initial aura of authority is likely to shape the users thoughts for good . <p> In the fraction of a second that it takes for a user to judge your website , what opinion are you encouraging ? <p> If you want to personify authority , look no further than the example set by Dr. Direct , Drew Eric Whitman . Go to his website and you will find this banner : <p> Already , your brain has interpreted a number of visual cues and condensed them in to a cohesive stereotype . <p> You noted the symbolic doctors coat ( an advertising prop that is outlawed , such is its potency ) . It triggered a split-second assumption that the author is powerful , responsible and qualified . <p> You saw the hand-scrawled signature and associated it with noteworthiness . <p> You saw the book , which confirmed your bias and validated his credibility . <p> You subconsciously interpreted the dollar bill in the background , as well as the $ in the book title . Your mind is primed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surgeon and D.R.S to feel somehow inferior to the author . <p> Before you even know it , you have been conditioned to see Dr. Direct as an authority . Once that opinion has been shaped , it is almost unshakeable . You will search for confirmation and you will find it . <p> Now look at your own website . <p> Where can you insert authority signals and social proofing ? <p> Here are some mental shortcuts to consider : <p> Ensure any personal photos are aligned with your brand . Putting on a doctors coat without the qualifications is , as far as Im aware , illegal . The best alternative that Ive found is the traditional library bookcase . It projects authority very well . <p> If you have been featured in noteworthy magazines , shows or blogs , crowbar them in to an " As Seen On " section . If you have n't been featured , get featured . Join Haro . <p> Use your Twitter following , RSS subscribers and Facebook Likes to validate that other people are already your fans . Only do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your degree initials after your name ( if you have one ) <p> If you win any kind of award or even get nominated for one steal the badge and make it a prominent part of your layout . <p> Ask readers to vouch for your character and expertise in the form of a testimonial . I did this just last week with my Premium Posts and it is already producing more sales . <h> The Transformation Starts Now in Your Head <p> Aspiring to iconic Guru status is a recurring theme for new Internet Marketers . People are beginning to recognise that fortune in 2012 favours those who get behind their content and put a face on it . <p> If you want to gain traction in a market , a pile of 500 word articles will no longer suffice . <p> The reality of the changing web is cause for optimism : Google cant save you now . <p> Well , Halle-bloody-lujah . Have we not waited for this day ? <p> To enter and dominate a vertical , you are going to need to do what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Not systems , not search engine algorithms , not shitty rewritten content . <p> Its time to lose the cutting corners mindset . The transformation has to start in your head . <p> If you want to become an authority , start acting like one . You do n't  need to be the best . Simply better than most will do . <p> Be sure to check out Adsimilis , the official sponsor of Premium Posts Volume 5 &amp; 6 .

@@106277702 @1677702/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> The great appeal of affiliate marketing , besides scratching my balls in bed at 10am , is undoubtedly the ability to do my work anytime anyplace anywhere . For 18 months now , I 've been preaching the harsh realities of running your own business . How the dream is not always what its cracked up to be . How it takes hard work , a lot of patience and no end of creativity to remain successful . <p> Well , its easy for me to sell the problems . But what about the rewards ? <p> Make no mistake . If you succeed as an affiliate marketer , you 'll have one of the greatest freedoms a job is ever likely to afford you . Its like having , quite literally , the world at your feet . Ive been laying down the foundations of my business for what feels like an eternity now , and its only next month that I 'll finally begin reaping the rewards . <p> This December , I 'm leaving London and embarking on some serious air-miles to see as much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and basing myself in Bangkok . <p> Now I know what a lot of you think when I say that I 'm moving to Thailand . <p> The answer is no and no . Though I bet I could find both at Justins house . Come on , man . You do n't  have 5000 friends on Facebook without at least a few gender benders slipping through the net . Its the law of error . <p> The truth is , just two weeks ago , I was searching for a flat in Central London . There are n't  too many cities more expensive to rent in than London , believe me . I was staring at prices of $3000/month for a small two bedroom squat that a hooker probably died in . <p> I think it took me witnessing the smarmy look on an estate agents face as he insisted I was n't going to find any good deals at +-1500/month before it dawned on me . What 's the point in even looking ? I can afford to pay the premium to live like a king here in London if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded to make that decision . The grass really is greener away from the capital . <p> As affiliate marketers without office jobs , we have the luxury of moving anywhere in the world and still earning the same money . Ive been operating with a disadvantage compared to other affiliates for the sheer fact that I live in a city where they charge you 30p to take a piss in a train station . The prices in London are sky-high and my cost of living is probably much greater than what other young affiliates are having to deal with . Obviously I 'm discounting those of you with kids and families to support . <p> I want to get full value for my hard work . Given the choice between frosting my bollocks off in London or stomping around a five bedroom house with a private pool in 30c December heat , its pretty much a no-brainer . I hate frosty bollocks . <p> So I plan to work from a laptop and travel around Asia , experiencing different cultures and living on beaches while the rest of London skids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I quit my day job . And after months of posting about the brutal home truths of surviving as an affiliate , I guess I should re-address the balance . The rewards of succeeding are totally fucking worth it . <p> I realize most people do n't  come to this blog to read about my travels or to know which corner of the earth I 'm currently festering in . So do n't  worry . This is just a notice to expect less posts over the next six weeks or so . I will be busy smearing suncream on my titties and getting traditionally burnt to shit like any self-respecting Brit on his travels . 114270 @qwx974270 <p> A few weeks ago , I set my alarm for 8:30am with thousands of other UK music fans . It did n't  matter that I was hanging like a dog without a bone . I wanted to buy Glastonbury tickets and I knew the usual painstaking process of navigating an online jam on SeeTickets.com . <p> If you 've never been sat at your desk trying to buy Glasto tickets , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on sale at 9am . Tickets somehow end up going on sale at 8:50am . SeeTickets.com couldnt handle the demand and crashed at 8am . <p> What usually follows is a three hour F5 mashing session , hopelessly contesting with thousands of other users the chance to buy a ticket that at +-185 , is bordering on scandalous for a festival where not a single act has been confirmed . <p> I was one of the lucky ones . After receiving dozens of error messages and " server timed out " notifications , I finally made it to the booking page . I guarantee you this . Youve never seen somebody fill out a form and hand over their credit card details so quickly in your life . <p> It was n't until my confirmation email arrived that I thought to myself " Actually , that 's quite an effective selling technique " <p> Frustrate me to the brink of tearing my hair out by not letting me buy something I want . I had a think about the psychology behind it all . On Twitter , I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their inability to bag a ticket . <p> It dawned on me that , actually , the Glastonbury organizers could n't give a shit how bad the ticketing process is . They probably quite like the sound of a thousand music fans begging for the chance to buy a ticket . Its the creation of high demand . It adds to the prestige . <p> This week it happened again . Take That , a group you need not investigate if you do n't  already know them by sigh , crashed every ticketing website that was supporting their tour . BBC and Sky News reported on the incident and what happened 24 hours later ? The group released ten extra dates ! I 'm willing to bet that any Take That fan who was n't already aware of the concerts , will have rushed out with even more incentive to buy tickets upon hearing the demand . <p> Creating an illusion of high demand is something that can be applied to your affiliate campaigns too . I started to think about how I could use a scenario similar to a frantic rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my service by creating this illusion of such high demand that the user HAD to act now or miss out altogether ? <p> Well , I 'm not going to give away my exact creatives . But I came up with a unique slant on my dating landing pages that looked like this : <p> " PAGE LOAD ERROR ! <p> " We are experiencing an unprecedented high demand from 35-40 year old females to join DatingSiteX.com . We could not process your request . " <p> " As a result , we are only able to accept another 4 new registrations before *insert your little PHP date script here* when our invitation will be closed . " <p> Please click here to try our mirror site <p> The " Fake Error Page " , if you will . A landing page so fiendishly innocent and so clinically effective that I felt bad for even using it . I 've often enjoyed an upturn in conversions when I 've put it to the right use . But as with most things affiliate marketing , the money is in the execution . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that this really was the " next big thing " in terms of dating sites . So your banners are going to be important in that stake . But critically , the landing page was to establish an illusion of high demand . Now let me just say that you 're not going to enjoy much success without a very specific line of approach here . It ca n't be a standard error page . <p> You have to get creative and design something that retains the readers attention . And for that , you 're going to have to stop reading this blog and grow your own ideas instead of jacking mine . <p> Of course , when the user clicks the mirror site link , they get taken straight through to the registration page . Except they 've had the illusion enforced in their heads that this site really is the dogs bollocks . Be careful not to use this ploy on the wrong crowd . You do n't  want to advertise to tech savvy bastards who take your page load error as a sign of weakness and leave on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody wants to feel left out . Its a very simple technique . Its also a technique that needs to be applied VERY carefully to avoid losing too much traffic . When I tell people that I blew X amount of dollars sending traffic to an error page , I 'm not always pissed off about it . <p> There are many other ways to establish an illusion of demand in your service . I 'm sure a lot of the guys whove published flogs and farticles will be aware of them . Some are misleading , some are just too downright effective for mainstream advertisers ever to dare use them . Either way , you shouldnt be afraid to get creative and try something different . <p> Some of the most effective campaigns I 've come up with have been born out of religiously studying peoples browsing habits . What they do , what they click , why they click it . You can drive yourself to the point of insanity just by watching how people react to various traits of the web around them . <p> Ironically , as I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received an Internal Server Error . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

This campaign was freshly launched so each ad was given an equal distribution of impressions . Each ad cost the same . <p> As for angles , yes . If your angle does n't  match up to the copy on the LP , the results are going to be skewed . I use a dynamic LP and pass my angles headline/image via the URL string . Saves a lot of time . I will throw up another post about that . <p> Yeah , sorry , to clear up any confusion , the views column in the table above refers to clicks not impressions . The clicks column refers to landing page clicks . That 's just the way CPVLab titles them for some reason . <p> I 'm not really good at math . And I do n't  understand why the clickthrough-rate is not calculated with CPM bidding , whilst it is with cpc bidding . Do you mind clearing this up for me and maybe other less math-savvy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only see it at the traffic source end ( in TrafficJunky ) . Which is where my mistake came from . Its easy to look at the data in CPVLab/iMobi/T202 and pick the best converting ads from a % , but the data has to be cross referenced . Often the best converting ad is not the best performing ad , precisely because CTR is critical to CPM campaigns . <p> If this were a CPC campaign , the best 3 ads would have been those I chose originally . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277706 @1677706/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> It never ceases to amaze me how my best laid marketing plans struggle so consistently to match the power of boobs . <p> You might think boobs are just boobs . Squashy mounds of goodness that sit at the heart of the WickedFire ecosystem . But actually , boobs are much more than that . They are lethal weapons of mass destruction , and when dropped in the right places , you can practically stun your readers in to handing over their credit cards . <p> I wish I was making this shit up . <p> No matter how many times I split test the effectiveness of boobs in ad images ( and conveniently , I try that tactic a lot ) , I keep getting the same results . The ads showing boobs consistently outperform those where cleavage is tucked safely out of sight . <p> This is understandable if you 're promoting dating offers , a vertical where physical appearances are likely to play a significant hand . But the CTR also jumps , with the help of a little cleavage , whether you 're promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique decking furniture . <p> Boobs sell . To both men and women . <p> For some first hand examples of just how well they can sell , check out the Facebook Ads presentation by Shoemoney last year . I 'm not a regular reader of Shoes blog , but the video has some great insight . <p> I wish turning on the money tap could be as simple as collecting a stockpile of cleavage photos , but you can probably see the flaw in that plan . Facebook is not particularly friendly when it comes to approving ad creatives that draw attention to skin . <p> If you 're ready and waiting to upload 63 saucy images of low-cut tops and enormous G cups , think twice about the repercussions of doing so . Have you received an email like this ? <p> Hi useless tool who pays us money , <p> We 've noticed that you are currently running Facebook Ads that violate our Advertising Guidelines or Terms of Use . <p> We do not allow ads to contain images that are overly explicit , provocative , or that reveal too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are excessively suggestive or sexual , or in violation of community standards , will not be allowed . <p> Please delete any ads that violate these policies within 48 hours to bring your account into compliance with Facebook policies . Continuing to run ads that violate our policies may result in additional action being taken on your account , including possible termination . <p> Thanks for being an affiliate so we do n't  have to care about you , <p> The Facebook Ads Team <p> When I received this message a few months ago , I did what any fast thinking affiliate would do . I removed every last one of my dating campaigns and replaced them with adverts to raise money for the Japanese earthquake victims . <p> I feel dirty for admitting it . But the easiest way to preserve an account is to give Facebook a damn good reason to think twice before pulling the trigger . So to this day , my account looks like the workstation of a good samaritan , promoting a hundred valuable causes on budgets of $1/day . <p> Does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point I 'd like to make is that sexing up your campaigns on Facebook is a risky strategy . As effective as boobs can be , you should definitely be focusing on the figure and suggestion of cleavage , rather than flat out shoving some titties in a jpeg . <p> I always try to aim for photos where the skin is completely hidden but the outline of the cleavage is plain to see . I do n't  know what kind of science this is bordering on , possibly whatever science applies to generating a good CTR without getting banned for having a great CTR . <p> If you cant bring yourself to risk banishment from Facebook , there are plenty of traffic sources that are much more lenient when it comes to allowing boobs . Christ , if you dare to venture on to a network like Traffic Junky , you 'd be a square to even consider publishing an ad without full frontal nudity . <p> Perhaps the best advice I can offer is to actually consider why it is that boobs are so effective as marketing tools . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the users mind that responds to a trigger . There are many other visual clues you can use to produce this reaction , and many of them have nothing to do with sex . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Lots of Ads is the latest service to offer spying capabilities over Facebooks most profitable ads .

The demographic that overwhelmingly makes dentists appointments is female , age 25-40 or something . We were both blown away that when split testing image ads , the booby woman ( who I believe , in this case , was just wearing a tight shirt ) outperformed the image of the dentist and all other ads by a factor of 8 or something ridiculous . <p> I still do n't  get why women click on boob pictures , but there you have it . It works . You 're crazy not to use it . <p> Finch , the humanitarian campaign idea is BRILLIANT ! Just brilliant ! I 'm not currently running on facebook , but that 's an idea I might have to implement when I get back to fb . <p> Also , maybe we all could stand to do some real humanitarian work with our checkbooks once in awhile , instead of $1/day ad campaigns to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works " in image ads , supposedly this exact combination is inconceivably good : Blond-haired busty female wearing glasses ( not sunglasses ) .

@@106277707 @1677707/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> For everybody else , I apologise . What follows is not likely to make much sense unless you 've been watching the ponzi unravel over the last 12 months . <h> The Current State of BannersBroker ( Have we got all day ? ) <p> To say that BannersBroker is unravelling would be to say that the Titanic got a little damp on her way to New York . Sinking ship is an understatement . BannersBroker , as an investment proposition for anybody reading this today , is absolutely toast . <p> It is dead . Game over . <p> If you put money in to this programme today , you will not see it again . <p> While we can speculate with conjecture over what is actually happening behind the scenes at BannersBroker HQ ( and I know many of you are ) , it has been confirmed that the company is under investigation by the Ontario Securities Commission . <p> That does not bode well for BB , and it is the reason why you see CEO Chris Smith brandishing buzz words like " active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying desperately to paper over the cracks and present BannersBroker as a legitimate business , but its too late . <p> The reason for this post is due to recent evidence that it might not be too late for you to get your money back . <p> Note : But only your initial investment and subsequent deposits minus withdrawals . If you think you 're actually entitled to those net profits , you should go slap yourself with a wet fish . <h> Getting Your Investment Refunded <p> I have received a full refund into my bank account from BB/Stellar Point INC after threatening legal action in the Ontario Small Claims Court to recover my initial deposit . A group of us here in the UK ( my upline and other referrals of his ) have had significant success with this approach . 3 of us have had full refunds so far . <p> If you want your money back my suggestion is do this ASAP ! ! <p> <p> I did n't  need to take them to court . Just threatening to was enough to get my account with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team a full refund was made to the card so originally paid on . Actually made a good return as the British Pound had strengthened compared to the USD over he last 6 months . <p> I cant really speculate but it was very clear to me they did n't  want to go to court hence the full refund . <p> You will have to wait until you 've missed a payment cycle before you can start the legal proceedings ( or threatening them at the very least ) . <p> Fortunately , it does n't  look like you 'll have to wait very long . <h> Chris Smiths Endless Excuses for Nil Payouts <p> Below you 'll find a timeline of recent excuses for why BannersBroker members have n't received full payments . Now bear in mind the company policy that negativity should be punishable by account termination . <p> Any member who complains about these delays faces the likelihood of having his account suspended . Or he would do if BannersBroker bothered to check their Facebook pages ( last update in March and counting ) . <p> 23rd May Last Payza payout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the dates there are 2 reasons , one is a mistake and one by design . With Payza , its an Excel sent to the system and it pays based on that file . I created this file and put it together . It is date order , but if someone has say 4 pay requests , we will pay one and move to other members . When I did this , I sorted by IDs , and I forgot to sort by Date ( by person ) . So someone may have received an April payout and March is still pending . By design , due to the OSC investigation , we did choose some of the members who have never been paid before , so that everyone got their money back . <p> Finch : Were you not paid due to the OSC investigation or because Chris Smith is simply that incompetent ? Who knows ? <p> 31st May Payouts " I mentioned on Friday that we were doing STP last weekend , but it was not completed . We will be doing that this weekend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Excel file that must be done correctly . In the past there were errors with that batch file , so now have to make sure everything is correct . There is alot of important data in that file and it invoves alot of money . <p> Finch : So a giant company like BannersBroker processes payments manually in an Excel spreadsheet ? Seems legit . But not just an Excel spreadsheet ! An Excel spreadsheet with errors in it . <p> 7th June STP payout yesterday . It took longer than anticipated , but did go out . ( Finch : No it did n't  ) We have alot of positive comments from members ( Finch : No you have n't ) . If you have n't received yours you will be on the next run ( Finch : No they wo n't ) . Payza is coming up shortly . I hate to give definitive dates . But it will be soon . <p> Finch : Realising that a new line of defence is needed , Smith plucks a points system out of his arse <p> 14th June Payouts : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alot different than before . Let 's say if you have a $2K w/d on Jan 1st , than another on Jan 2nd , same person . Person B does a request on Jan 5th for same $2K . Order is Person A gets w/d , then person B , then Person A , in that order . Points are assigned by order . Your first request will get more points than your next requests . More points are awarded if this is your first withdrawal . <p> 21st June Next Payday : we were hoping to get Payza out last weekend . we can not send it out if its not accurate . ( Finch : You seem to send out payments with inaccuracies all the time , sometimes to the wrong account . Never stopped you before . ) I am very confident that if its not today , then it will this weekend . I will make it a point to see that it goes out . STP will be shortly after that . We want to keep people satisfied . We are going in a point system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a payment . However , everyone will get paid so please be patient . <p> Finch : A hilarious contradiction at the end there , synonymous of the misinformation this company breeds to stay alive . All members are equal , but some are more Simon Stepsys than others . <p> Those are the excuses from the last month , but they stretch all the way back to January and February . For a full timeline of lies and deceit , check out the Banners Broker Iceland page . <p> Want to know a golden rule of running a ponzi scheme ? Never tell your members why you cant pay them . Blame it on everything under the sun , including your own incompetence , but never ever reveal the truth that the pyramid is unsustainable , and the men at the top have milked it dry . <h> Clarifications and Conclusions <p> Several months ago I received this email from a reader who attended a local BB recruitment drive : <p> " You may or may not be pleased to know that you were personally mentioned by David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he advised us to ignore your blog , I think they are trying to pre-empt the fact that people will try and do research . They also interestingly claimed that your wife ( ? ! ? ) is a BannersBroker Affiliate . I somehow doubt that is true , but I think you should be aware that that is what they are claiming . " <p> " It was your wife he said , he implied you had her join in order to try and drive revenue from banner advertising on your own site higher . The manner in which it was said was just outright nasty . " <p> Firstly , my wife was actually my fiancee , and were no longer together . Secondly , she hated BannersBroker just as much as I did . Thirdly , what difference would that make to the banner revenue on this site ? <p> So , BannersBrokers Director of Compliance ( no less ! ) gets his balls in a twist with yet more malicious lies designed to pull the wool over cautious investors eyes . Upon being confronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised not to run his little mouth in future . <p> Evidently the promise did n't  extend as far as his Facebook fan page where he is still blabbering pseudo motivational bollocks to anybody wholl listen . <p> " Courageous ! Determined ! Driven ! " <p> If this man has conned you in to handing over your hard earned cash , feel free to pay his page a visit and tell him what he really is . <p> For what its worth , David has recently removed any reference to Banners Broker or Stellar Point from his LinkedIn page . Make of that as you wish . <p> Another lie I 'd like to put straight : <p> " Heard at a meeting in about the start of February ( 2013 ) , that BannersBroker flew you to their HQ after seeing the bad press you had spread . They said it changed your mind about them . I just want to confirm whether that is true or I misheard ? " <p> Its not true , and I doubt you misheard . <p> I 've had a few emails from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months since my last post as a sign that I 've changed my mind about the scam , or that Ive been bought out . <p> The reason Ive been quiet is actually far simpler . I havent had to defend myself . <p> When I originally posted about the scam in October 2012 , I was pelted with abuse from trolls , shills and damn near anybody with a penny invested in the scheme , as well as being publicly slandered by executives ( ! ! ) at Banners Broker recruitment drives . Time was always going to shine a rough light on the BB business model , and so it has . <p> The users who flocked here to defend the scheme can now be found venting their anger at BannersBroker instead , or promoting the next garbage ponzi . Some , to their credit , have publicly admitted that they were conned . <p> There 's no shame in being swindled by an international crime syndicate that has dedicated a lifetime to fooling you . Unless you let it happen repeatedly . <h> Where is Rajiv Dixit ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has decided to keep his head low since the damaging security investigations kicked off . This is a man already linked to other failed scams , like the ICF World Homes scheme that he swears was legitimate but somehow still ended up frozen by the Competition Bureau . <p> When the Securities and Exchange Commission come knocking ( as they have been recently ) , Mr. Dixit knows hell be paying the piper some jail time . <p> I 've heard some thoroughly unsavoury stories about Dixit that I cant repeat here for obvious reasons . Some who know Raj on a personal level would be more than happy to throw him under a bus . And from what theyve told me , I would n't blame them . <p> In a bid to keep angry affiliates at bay , Raj changed his Facebook name to Rajeeve EswarRao , before seemingly deleting himself from the social network altogether . <p> Not sure where he stumbled across such a PR masterstroke . Maybe the Handbook of How To Run A Company Like Google ? <h> What about Chris Smith ? <p> Smith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or b ) getting paid enough , to continue talking shop with angry BannersBroker investors . <p> My impression of Smith from his rumoured links to securities in the past is that he is a pawn . He does n't  seem smart enough to mastermind a program like BannersBroker , but is happy to stick his face on the front cover . <p> The general consensus is that Dixit pulls Smiths strings , so that Dixit can stay somewhat out of the spotlight . As for the geeky genius who created the multi-million dollar Banners Broker algorithms ? Wake me up when he has a Wikipedia page . <p> On the subject of Banners Broker management <p> I read a depressing post on Facebook yesterday from a BB affiliate criticising the recent troubles , but still refusing to write off the company : <p> " Love BB , Hate the managers who run it ! ! " <p> Edit : The original message was much longer but evidently the user does n't  wish to be quoted . See the comments ! <p> This kind of apologetic bullshit is the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who run BannersBroker ARE BannersBroker . They are the men who sat around a table and devised this damn near incomprehensible system with one intention : to fleece you of your money , and to get richer themselves . <p> Another depressing comment : <p> " OK there are far more experienced players in the on-line advertising industry , but had BB started out purely as an advertising company , I 'd have no doubts they would have attracted some long-term business partners . " <p> Banners Broker has never been involved with the advertising industry . Any revenue they make from the banners on their network will be pennies . It saddens me that people are still falling for this idea that BB are transitioning towards a more non-passive business . It has always been a ponzi scheme . You cant pluck a legitimate advertising business out of the carnage just because the Ontario Securities Commission is on to you . <p> So I guess the real question is <p> Are you going to let them get away with it ? Will you continue to buy the panels lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Its a cultural hallmark of greed and easy-living . Youre told that you 're just one week away from receiving the riches you were promised , and you continue to believe . A week turns in to a month , still you cling to the belief . When somebody tells you to join the Next Big Thing , you dive straight in because you want to believe in your divine right to easy money no matter how many friends and families you trample over in its pursuit . <p> Note : If anybody asks you to join FlexKom , Ripplin , or Adhitprofits , do yourself a favour and do n't  . Vultures like Soozi Scoones and Jamie Waters would sell your dying grandmother if it earned them a pot to piss in . <p> There 's no magic pot of gold under the rainbow and there 's no magic business waiting to fall out of Chris Smiths arse . Only jail time , and hopefully lots of it . <p> Eventually BannersBroker is going to disappear and the negative bloggers like myself who have been predicting this demise for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rich quick scheme . <p> Why ? Because of the greed . <p> I hope those who are still clinging to a belief that BannersBroker somehow has legitimacy will wake up and smell the coffee . For those who are taking action to get their money back , good luck to you . I hope you do n't  make the same mistake again . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> And suddenly its no longer a case of moving 7 figure amounts around or processor problems , its simply that the funds are n't  there , but they should be because panels complete when sales are finished right Chris , that is how your business was explained to thousands of people . <p> Chris just made his hole even deeper with more lies . <p> Duncan Wood in the UK is still doing BB meetings and getting paid directly by BB for doing this , the guy should be an outcast and in jail for the damage he has caused and his theft . <p> Good point on the TalkingBB admins Waters and Scoones Finch , they silenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship into Ripplin and AdHitProfits silently thinking they are beyond any come back . <p> After todays webinar its a whole different playing field , the apologist best be scared . People are broke , desperate and in debt because of their actions and those of Chris ( Pinocchio ) Smith , Raj ( the puppet master ) Dixit , David ( coward/backstabber ) Hooker , Terry ( village idiot ) Stern and all the ICs . <p> They officially have nothing to lose by taking any kind of action against the above , now that Chris has finally let us know the money is n't there , despite how the business workings were explained over the past years . <p> You referenced my post on Facebook in your blog , and referred to it as apologetic bullshit ? Which i find offensive , in appropriate and mis leading as you clearly have n't read my comment . <p> Please take this message as formal notification that unless your reference to my post is removed from the blog in the next 7 days , i shall take further action to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'd like too resolve this reasonably and if you need more information please contact my email address attached . <p> That 's not the right address .

I 've seen some stupid requests in my time , but threatening legal action against somebody for replying to what you said comes pretty close to gobbling the biscuit . Especially when they never actually quoted you specifically in the first place . <p> It might suck to see somebody disagreeing with you on the Internet , but that 's life . It happens to me every day . Deal with it and move on . <p> Reminds me of the times Raj and Chris started threatening to take everyone to court . Which of course running a ponzi they never did . We just laughed at them then , same as we are laughing at you now . Charles Ross , loves bb and hates the managers lol . Complete muppet and bonehead . <p> I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had dealings with the likes of clicksor , but suppose the revenue base would have been insignificant in the scheme of things , new people coming on board obviously is where the bulk of the money comes from to pay others , things have clearly dried up . <p> I 'm quite surprises so many are jumping ship to Bank on Traffic , looks like the same kind of thing , in some way or other , than BB .. <p> Chris Smith paid Kul Josun and Lieven Van Neste millions , to avoid them bringing Chirs/BB to court due to their insider knowledge which they threatened to use when they got kicked out ( Kul in Portugal for attempting a coup ) ( Lieven after a power play for account management control , by Kul/Raj ) which seems to be now resulting in what we see . They stayed quiet took their payoffs and allowed people to get ripped off to this very day . <p> I live in Toronto , Canada . ( Not far from where the current Canadian head office of BB is in Whitby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who helped to fully inform me about BB in August of 2012 is now very much involved with Adhitprofits.I state all this becausewhen you cited the names of the companies FlexKom , Ripplin and Adhitprofitsyou soon afterwards cited the names Soozi Scoones and Jamie Waters.As you made no previous mention of these two individuals in this blog posting , I only want to know if these same two individuals are involved in the sat-up/operation of one ( or all ) of the three other companies Ive cited here.Thanks kindly ! <p> URGENT : &gt;&gt;&gt; PLEASE READ &lt;&lt;&lt; Just got off the phone with a Canadian BB affiliate who says he has contacted the different Canadian authorities . They need more Canadians to step forward and contact their local Canadian police dept. when multiple provinces are contacted the Canadian National authorities can get involved . PLEASE step forward . They say many people are embarrassed when they have lost money in a PONZI . Contact anyone you know who is a BB affiliate in Canada immediate and ask them to take action . <p> New docs acquired tell the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically try to say these documents are photo-shopped , fake , etc . Do your due diligence . These documents are a matter of public record . <p> BB has seemed to hide who Chris Smith really is Look up Banners Broker BBB ( Google IT ) , then do the same for Stellar point .

You will find a direct link to the BBB review for Stellar Point Inc LONG ... <p> Who is Chris Smith ? Is that his real name ? Why is Chris Smiths name not mentioned as CEO on most of the documents ? Did Chris Smith have a previous Canadian Securities violation that prohibited him from promoting other ponzis ? Why havent the webinars told us the executive officers have resigned in may of 2013 ? Why so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ? Where is the transparency ? Have Certain " Recruiters " been paid recently ? To keep the lie going ? Is Stellar Point and Banners Broker Really One Entity ? ( See Canadian Docs ) Why do they have a corporation management company in the isle of man hiding their identities ? Why have Raj and David Hooker distanced themselves from Banners Broker ? Does Banners Broker Still really exist other than a website ? <p> Who Is Chris Smith ? Why can we find no history on him ? Is this the SAME Chris Smith ? ===&gt; LONG ... Has anyone seen his passport or I 'd ? If he is such an IT expert .. Where did he get his experience ? Where is his resume ? Does he really live on an upper floor of the Stellar Point Office like some other blogs claim ? Did " BB " pay off Leiven , Kul , and may others as " HUSH " money ? <p> I watched their video about " how banners broker makes money " which is the most fucking boring and confusing waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated . Guess you already figured it out . Its just bullshit . <p> The BB skype rooms are reporting emails being sent out stating that Chris Smith and Raj Dixit are going their own separate ways . <p> THIS IS BIG NEWS ! <p> Email Sent Out To An Irish Team : <p> <p> We have been advised that as of today , our contract as the Irish Independent Contractor for Stellar Point is terminated . <p> Banners Broker International and Stellar Point have mutually agreed to end their contract . As a result Stellar Point have concluded all contracts for independent contractors worldwide to handle support and training for Banners Broker . <p> We are now obliged to cancel all bookings for training at the Cork office effective immediately . <p> If you have any additional training requirements , please log onto your Banners Broker account and refer to your Dashboard .

Banners Broker will advise shortly of a worldwide contact number if you wish to speak to customer support . <p> Although , it is with great regret that we received this news , we would like to thank Banners Broker affiliates for their support over the past two years . <p> Sincerely , <p> Maconne Team <p> <p> The BB Leaders are all ready putting the SPIN on this as a GREAT thing . <p> Reports of Raj and Chris Screaming and in chaos . <p> Chris reportedly is in Denial . <p> I wondered as I saw a recent Stellar Point video of Raj on Youtube with NO Mention of BB . <p> I think it was pretty clear when the BB Mastercard was withdrawn that was the final nail in the BB coffin.I have not been paid since then and have clearly been scammed . On the plus side I have withdrawn roughly $1100 more than I invested . <p> I signed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked OK . However when the rules were changed in April it became impossible to make a profit unless you had a sales team under you . It then became clear exactly what the real purpose of the business was : To build up a vast number of affiliates that BB could then sell on to other businesses as tame clients who will willingly like your website write favourable reviews and anything else requested to earn a few measly traffic hits . Very clever set up . Not illegal but immoral in my view . <p> I complained on the official BB blog and immediately had my comment functionality withdrawn . Dan Dare on Facebook has captured BB very well with his excerpt from Valkery video . Check it out . <p> a friend of mine told me about this probably8 or so months ago , i checked out the terms and conditions , read how it works and in roughly 10 minutes saw that it was n't worth the money and eventually you could be just paying them and receiving nothing which is how it works i suspect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made changes to really " seal the deal " . if people carefully read how it works you see that you end up paying monthly out and receiving nothing back . <p> i would just like to thank doc Alex for all his help and care .. i highly recommend anyone to try him and believe in him it truly honestly works , he was able to help me get my money back from the scam person , thank u so much for helping me in my time of need .. email him on **28;36;TOOLONG <p> Chris Smith &amp; BB have come up with a load of BS , they think were going to jump in to V3 by adding new fresh cash from our creditcards , then they must be on drugs or something . Todate they seem to be running the panels a lot faster now so they cap faster and then the panel will not be transfered to V3 , This is just steeling members money .

I would n't know where to start . I 'm 22 and own 4 houses HOMs and SOHs so that 's rolling , occasionally stumbling but that 's part of the job . I can invest in other houses ( not my passion ) or venture into a world that excites me and can potentially give me a higher profit , the only issue is I have n't a clue where to start . I do n't  know anyone within the industry nor am I one of those gifted people that can read pages of tedious crap and retain it for life so it gets overwhelming trying to figure out what door my 6inch heel should go it . Any thoughts ? I 'd LOVE to invest in lots of peoples dreams and do something to help whist taking a honest cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought . Truly enjoyed your articles and I never write to people asking for help so you must have caught my attention . Hopefully you do n't  read this and think I 'm slightly slow , I just do n't  want to fuck up at the starting line , drag behind , embarrass myself and finish with nothing but a do n't  worry at least you tried . <p> I like to call this starting with the end in mind . Good planning on the frontend should make sure you 're not working on limited potential campaigns . People often say well I spend 2xs the CPA . <p> If I really believe in something well spend 5k to 100s of thousands in testing a campaign and/or building a product .

I would invest in a good VPN and study my chosen market obsessively . <p> A Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) let 's you access websites using an IP in a different country . <p> Why would you want to do this ? <p> To spy on foreign ads and affiliate campaigns , of course . <p> There are no secrets in affiliate marketing . <p> Most profitable campaigns are running in full view of the public . <p> You can use spy tools like WhatRunsWhere to harvest banners and landing pages , but these are often lacking in context . <p> The best way to see which creatives are dominant is to load up a VPN , access a placement , and note which banners appear first ( and most often ) . <p> For this , I use HideMyAss . It has servers in over 128 countries , is pretty reliable , and works on mobile phones . <p> Note : A monthly charge to HideMyAss ' is definitely one of the more interesting expenses on my bank statements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Software ' actually means , lest he fear your affiliate business is a racket for the Russians . <p> If you do n't want to shell out on a VPN , you can crawl the web at a snail 's pace by Googling proxies in country here ' and trying them one-by-one . <p> Once you have access to dozens of countries , you can start gathering intelligence on any markets that are active with affiliates . <p> You can see exactly what offers are being run ( without getting redirected ) , and you can jack all manner of useful creatives. <h> 3 .

If they do , it will be an afterthought . <p> This leaves the path clear for a newbie affiliate to sweep in and serve those demographics with a message that strikes closer to home . <p> While a small budget demands that you out-work the competition , take note : this is not a scalable advantage once you enter the mass markets . <p> To be a dominant affiliate in the big-money open waters , you need to build structural advantages in to your business . 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I can tell because the seasonal fatty in me aches for Gingerbread latte and industrial-sized buckets of mulled wine . <p> Now is a great time to be an affiliate marketer . <p> Mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Take the rest of the workforce , for example : <p> Wake in the darkness , spaz at the cold , wrap in seven layers , power-walk through the black ice to an overheated tube where the chances of catching a nice , hearty flu increase fivefold with every station passed . <p> Rinse and repeat , Monday to Friday . <p> The thrill of watching it all unfold from my office window is the pinnacle of working from home . <p> And if anybody disagrees , trust me their priorities are all wrong . <p> I 'm only half-joking . <p> I enjoy London in the winter . <p> But I 'm still excited to get out of here . <h> My Plans for 2015 <p> If you 've read this blog for a while , you 'll be aware that I am perennially on the edge of moving somewhere that is n't London . <p> I have a success rate of about 20% . <p> Well , something will have to go seriously wrong for that not to change . <p> My girlfriend and I are moving to Thailand in March . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a second home . <p> Its difficult to explain , but South East Asia has a magnetic pull .

Unfortunately business got in the way of writing , and by the time I returned to finish it up , I was n't happy with the content . <p> So on to the scrap heap it went . <p> One complete rewrite later , and the next volume is almost ready to be unleashed . <p> It will cover a huge amount of ground : from adult dating , to mobile campaigns , the current Facebook and Google landscapes , to new areas like pay per call , Teespring and several unfashionable sources of traffic that can blow up your earnings biggie style . <p> This is going to be a mammoth release . The chapter covering adult dating alone is bigger than the entire Volume X ( which was dedicated to it ) . <p> I think you 're going to struggle to find a more definitive pillaging of the affiliate marketing industry as it stands today . <p> Stand by for a lot of brain farts when it goes live on December 17th . <p> In the meantime , here is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice . <h> How to Build The Future <p> I read a lot of business books . Sometimes mindlessly . <p> When you 've chowed your way through the entire Amazon bestsellers , you become familiar with the arcing topics that every writer and his dog likes to bark about . There 's only so many times I can relive the story of Maslow , Kitty Genovese or a room full of marshmallows . <p> The mind doth start to play with its balls . <p> Zero to One , by Peter Thiel , is the rare type of business book that stops you dead in your tracks . <p> " Notes on Startups , or How to Build The Future " sounds like a bold strapline . If anything , it undersells . <p> Thiel outlines the concepts that can make or break a startup , without resorting to magic bullet steps to pique interest . He talks innovation , technology , team-building and most effectively how to stand apart from your competition . <p> The book is a page-turner that demands to be put down . A rare thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notepad . <p> It forced me to digest its concepts slowly , chapter by chapter . <p> Any book that begs to be placed aside while you question the wisdom of your current beliefs deserves the highest praise , especially when it 's so much easier to publish the opposite . <p> Thiel is a legend of the tech sphere . He did n't  need to write a book . <p> Likewise , when you have Mark Zuckerberg ( " This book delivers completely new and refreshing ideas on how to create value in the world . " ) and Elon Musk ( " Peter Thiel has built multiple breakthrough companies , and Zero to One shows how .

@@106277710 @1677710/ <p> I get many readers who stumble across my posts and end up slightly confused . <p> When I launched FinchSells.com , it was aimed at paid traffic affiliates ' . <p> As the blog has grown , it has attracted readers from the wider online marketing world , as well as those who have no idea what affiliate marketing is " but want to make money from it . <p> This page is to clear up the confusion . <p> Its designed to explain : <p> What I do for a living . <p> The difference between paid traffic affiliates and free traffic affiliates . <p> How the affiliate industry is segmented . <p> How you can get started in it . <p> Let 's not get bogged down in too much detail . <p> You only need to understand the basic models for now . <h> What I do for a living <p> I am a performance marketer who relies on paid traffic to generate sales . <p> A performance marketer ( interchangeable with affiliate marketer ' ) is somebody who only gets paid for results . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve : sometimes it is user acquisition , but normally it will be sales . <p> Performance marketers do not typically own the products , services or apps that they promote . <p> We operate as non-contracted middlemen . <p> We deliver customers for somebody elses business , but we only get paid after those customers have been delivered . <p> It is your typical commission model . <p> It could involve : <p> A payment per lead " referring users to try a product or service . <p> A payment per sale " referring users who become paying customers . <p> A payment per install " referring users who install an app or piece of software . <p> A payment per call " referring users who pick up their phones and call a sales team . <p> In short , affiliate marketing means : to refer users to somebody elses products or services and get paid for the results delivered . <p> It is a revolutionary industry where you get paid your exact worth . <p> There are no politics . <p> The industry attracts thousands of enthusiasts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this transparency . <p> If you want to earn a million pounds , you can earn it this week " by finding a way to deliver a million pounds worth of value , to any of the thousands of companies waiting to work with you . <p> Needless to say , this is easier said than done . <p> Note : If you are wondering where we find these companies to work with , the answer is ( usually ) through an affiliate network . An affiliate network is essentially another middleman that connects merchants needing customers to affiliates who know how to get them . <h> The difference between paid traffic affiliates and free traffic affiliates <p> Once you understand the model of getting paid for results delivered , the next obvious question is this : <p> " How am I actually going to deliver these leads , sales , installs and calls ? " <p> There are many ways to generate customers . Each strategy will fall in to one of two groups : <p> Free traffic or paid traffic . <p> The majority of the affiliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free traffic <p> The most obvious example of free traffic is when a user searches Google , finds your website , clicks the link , and arrives on your page . <p> Another example would be the affiliate who dedicates his time to building Facebook Fan Pages . He can then post an update and have it seen by hundreds ( or thousands ) of users . <p> Note : I say free , but no traffic is ever free . There is always opportunity cost " the price of your time . <p> Free traffic is the cheapest way to get started in affiliate marketing because it only requires an investment of time . You do n't have to pay for advertising . <p> This advantage is also its greatest weakness . <p> It is very difficult to scale an online business if you are relying on free traffic . <p> Likewise , if you do hit the jackpot and get your affiliate website listed at the top of Google , you are at the mercy of Google being kind enough to keep you there . <p> Search Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ball-ache . <h> Paid traffic <p> Affiliates who rely on paid traffic , like myself , are using an arbitrage model . <p> 2 . Instead of building his own fitness product , the affiliate signs up to promote Get Ripped Quick on a pay-per-sale basis . <p> 3 . Instead of building his own website to showcase the product , he puts together a brief sales page that explains why everybody should be using Get Ripped Quick . <p> 4 . Instead of waiting 6 months ( or longer ) for his sales page to appear at the top of Google ( a long shot ) , he buys advertising using Google AdWords and receives paid traffic from Day 1 . <p> 5 . Let 's say the affiliate receives -50 from Get Ripped Quick for a new customer , and he delivers this customer at a cost of -30 using Google AdWords . He has just made -20 in profit without having to own : a product , a website , or a working SEO strategy . <p> 6 . The affiliate pours more and more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) he s spending -3000 per day , and making -5000 in commission . <p> The beauty of the arbitrage model is that it is infinitely scalable . <p> Millionaires are born from it . <p> The downside is that by relying on paid traffic , you might end up losing your time and the money spent on advertising , too . <p> There are gazillions of marketing blogs out there happy to teach you how to exchange your time for a long shot chance at success . <p> By reading this shit , you join a small club of paid traffic enthusiasts who do n't  have the time or desire to wait forever for success . It is a skill that " if mastered " can make you one of the most sought after advertising experts in the world . <h> How the affiliate industry is segmented <p> If I were to promote a product called Get Ripped Quick , I would be working in the fitness market . <p> Understanding the fitness market is a challenge unto itself . <p> The best affiliates are blessed with a vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The profile of a typical customer <p> The behaviour of the target demographics <p> Any trends that are exploding <p> It is extremely rare to find an affiliate who excels in more than one market . <p> For example , you are n't  going to find too many super affiliates who do big numbers in both the fitness and dating verticals . <p> For your best shot at success , you need to choose a segment of the affiliate industry and really nail it . <p> The most popular segments include : <p> Weight loss products <p> Fitness products <p> Skincare products <p> Mobile app installs <p> Gaming offers <p> Dating offers <p> Adult services and products <p> Finance products <p> Business opportunity packages ( bizopps ) <p> Insurance products <p> Most of the examples on this blog over the years have come from the dating and adult verticals , because that is the market segment I work in . <p> It is very difficult to be dominant in more than one segment . <p> I suggest you choose one , and choose it wisely . <h> How you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I am a performance marketer who relies on paid traffic to generate sales . <p> Well , let me add to that : <p> I am a performance marketer who relies on paid traffic to generate leads ( and app installs ) in the dating and adult markets . My focus is on mobile traffic sources . <p> Does that seem very glamorous to you ? <p> I 'm guessing 95% of my readers would n't read a blog that used said explanation of what the author does for a living in its strap-line . <p> But my niche business exists in a multi-million dollar industry , and that explanation is a damn sight more accurate than the umbrella term of making money from affiliate marketing . <p> Which means what , exactly ? <p> Ignore the bullshit artists who try to convince you there are millions to be made without targeting a single legitimate industry " it 's simply not true . <p> Affiliate marketing is a smokescreen to the real challenge : to find , master and dominate a market where customers are ready to spend money . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . Will I rely on paid traffic or free traffic ? 2 . Which market will I operate in ? 3 . If paid , which traffic source ( Facebook , AdWords etc ) will I use to reach that market ? <p> Answering these three questions will not lead you to success . <p> It will lead you straight in to battle . <p> And make no mistake , unless you have some extremely novel answers to those core questions , a battle is exactly what you will face . <p> What this blog is not : a guide to some intangible form of online success ; where money rains from simply knowing about it . <p> Affiliate marketing is a massive industry with equally massive competition . <p> Whether you choose free traffic or paid traffic , your execution needs to be brilliant . Or success will fall to the next guy . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277711 @1677711/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Affiliate marketing is all about creating angles . Its about playing cupid between merchant and customer , finding the common ground where the two parties can be brought together in profitable matrimony . <p> Creating angles is the part of affiliate marketing that I enjoy the most . Its the brainsplurging stage where I sit down with a blank whiteboard , scribble the offer in the center , and then force myself to concoct dozens of incentives and selling points for that offer . <p> In my opinion , one of the main reasons for offer burnout is plain uninspired thinking . If 1000 affiliates choose an offer and run with the first angle they think off , there 's likely to be a bottleneck where most people lose . <p> If , however , you take the time to venture beyond the tried and tested angles , you can come up with some creative takes that will prolong the lifetime of your campaigns and therefore your sanity . <h> What Makes a Good Angle ? <p> Not all angles are created equal . Some have better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . <p> The Life Force 8 consists of eight very basic human needs that are hard-wired in to each and every one of us . They do n't  need to be sold to us . They exist by default . <p> Survival , enjoyment of life , life extension . <p> Enjoyment of food and beverages . <p> Freedom from fear , pain , and danger . <p> Sexual companionship . <p> Comfortable living conditions . <p> To be superior , winning , keeping up with the Joneses . <p> Care and protection of loved ones . <p> Social approval . <p> A campaign angle can consist of just about any hook you can imagine . But to really get under the skin of your target market , the angle should embrace one or more of the Life Force 8 factors . <p> These are n't  wants . They are needs . <p> Let 's use my favourite example , RichMen.com , to show how angles can be constructed out of thin air . <p> Now , I 've trolled the RichMen dating offer . I 've spied thousands of ads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've been pretty vocal about the fact that I think most affiliates phone in these ads . They rarely get their creativity out of second gear . <p> The default angle used by most affiliates is broody gold-digger seeks wealthy fancypants . While that may be a perfectly viable take on the offer , its also a bottleneck waiting to happen . <p> I 'd say 80% of affiliates scramble to make coin from the same 20% of ideas . <p> They enter new verticals and go for the lowest hanging fruit , not appreciating that there 's a crush in the market because every other beginner is working on the same Plan A. <p> When you brainstorm your angles , its often a good idea to discard the first 2 or 3 ideas that come to mind for popular offers . Why ? Because your first 2 or 3 ideas are going to lead you in to that bottleneck , in to the crush . <h> How to Easily Source New Angles <p> So , going back to RichMen.com , assuming we avoid the original gold-digger angle , how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliates have n't already beaten to death ? <p> An easy method is to take your offer and stack it up against the Life Force 8 . <p> Survival , enjoyment of life , life extension . <p> " Joining Rich Men gives you the chance to meet a man who will get you out of the rat race , let you retire early , let you enjoy the peace and freedom you 've earned for yourself . " <p> Enjoyment of food and beverages . <p> " Joining Rich Men is your ticket to be wined and dined . No more scoffing takeaway with a derelict Stella swigger who answers you only in grunts . Drink the finest sparkling champagne in the city with a mouthwatering date ! " <p> Freedom from fear , pain , and danger . <p> " Joining Rich Men removes your fear of living from pay check to pay check , of wondering who is going to pay your 13 year old daughters University bill . Rest easy with a man who can take care of you ! " <p> Sexual companionship . <p> " Joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These men are confident passionate winners and the only thing bigger than their wallets is , well " <p> Comfortable living conditions . <p> " Joining Rich Men is a commitment to the life you 've always wanted and deserved . Does this mansion look big enough for you ? Can you imagine the walk-in closet space ? Find a man who has room for your shoes . " <p> To be superior , winning , keeping up with the Joneses . <p> " Joining Rich Men is a statement that you only settle for the best . Imagine the look on your colleagues faces when you introduce them to Mr. Right . That 's your Mr. Right . " <p> Care and protection of loved ones . <p> " Joining Rich Men will give your child the best possible upbringing , and the best chances in life . Its tough out there . Meet a man who 's already made it . You only deserve the best . " <p> Social approval . <p> " Joining Rich Men will finally put an end to the smug gloating of your married friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch how green it turns them ! These guys are IMPOSSIBLE to find elsewhere . " <p> Now , some of these examples are a little crude , offensive , sexist , whatever . But my point is that by keeping the Life Force 8 in mind , you can easily brainstorm and stretch an offer in to multiple different forms . <p> Once you 've chosen an angle that you 're happy with , you can then worry about getting the pitch of the copy right , not offending anybody , and adjusting your voice to the style of the market . That 's the difficult part , but its usually the step that comes before success . <h> Plug in Your Eyes and Ears <p> I often say that the many niches of affiliate marketing are trapped in the vision of a male twenty-something scumbag . That 's the typecast demographic of the average affiliate marketer , and we tend to see the world through our own eyes for better or worse . <p> Most landing pages look and read as if they 've been written by well , the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers aimed at 25 year old horny men , that can be a good thing . For parental offers aimed at 40 year old single mums , its definitely a bad thing . <p> So , this is an important point : <p> Angles exist outside your own mind . <p> Yes , they do . Some of the greatest selling angles known to man ( or woman ) are foreign to us because we are in radically different life situations . <p> For example , an affiliate marketer who has been sitting on his arse for 4 years , never having to commute , never having to engage in office politics is going to slowly disconnect from the professional lifestyle . Hell forget what it felt like to be struggling in that day job . Its one of the reasons , in my opinion , why so many affiliate marketers start in the bizopp niche and then move in to new verticals over time . <p> How many blogs have you seen from Warriors looking to make money by posting about their journey to make money ? Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , its how to struggle for a living online . And that struggle sells . Its not the shit they post about that drives the comments and sales , its the shared struggle of were in this together . <p> Its easy for me to sit here and judge . But the reality is that just because a Warrior Forum moneymaking angle is alien to me , that does n't  mean its any less valuable . Okay , it probably is less valuable . But the insight in to people is not . <p> Its the same for all the Work at Home Mom blogs . I find them to be pretty weak imitations of the better marketing blogs out there . But then I have to bring myself back down to reality and remember that its not the marketing advice that 's being sold . Its the lifestyle . Its a shared sentiment that has no relevance to me , but is powerful nonetheless . <p> The WAHM gimmick is an angle that exists outside the scope of my own mind , until I wake up enough to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own life situation . <p> You cant afford to trap the world in your own eyes . Your eyeballs need to be hanging vacantly in the middle of the street , soaking up conversation and watching the shit out of people . You need to be listening to their needs , acting on their desires , and transmuting that information in to a body of work that smells less like the aforementioned twenty-something scumbag in disguise . <p> Good angle creation is rarely about agreeing with something , or holding any kind of positive or negative sentiment towards it . <p> Its about spotting the way people see themselves and living vicariously through them for a few sweet seconds . If you can translate their least public thoughts in to ad copy and images on a page , you stand a good chance of controlling the next move . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Make sure you grab your copy of the newly released Premium Posts Volume 5 .

@@106277713 @1677713/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> If a task is too daunting , or your goals too distant , search for the bright spots and focus on what 's already working . <p> This is a simple but powerful concept of great significance to Internet Marketers . We are notorious multi-taskers . Our greatest fault is traditionally that we spread ourselves too thin and do n't  see projects through to their conclusions . <p> Think of an SEO project as an example . In your head , you have a starting point it might be the Google Keyword planner , or an exciting new niche you 've heard about . And similarly , you have a final destination typically a highly trafficked , super profitable web property that earns money while you sleep . <p> The hard part is travelling the road that connects those two destinations . More specifically , its the feeling of " What in the hell am I supposed to do now that I 've launched this shit and I 'm sick to death of it ? " <p> Somewhere between defining our vision , and reaping the rewards of its fruition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from completing the project . The middle part the long open road is always the hardest . <p> To use the SEO project example , our open road might involve endless backlink building , content creation and keyword tracking . Much of this is laced with dead-ends and hours spent unproductively . The only way to finish these projects , to realise our vision , is to keep searching for the bright spots . <p> Ask yourself , " What is working ? How can I build on it ? " <p> Maybe one of the pages on your site is whoring the majority of the traffic . In which case , can you isolate the variables that are fuelling its popularity ? Is it being shared socially ? Why is it being shared socially ? How can you create more content that ticks the same boxes ? <p> This flexible mindset of learning on the road is vital if you 're going to connect your launch foundations with the end vision of a prosperous money machine . <p> A fixed mindset rarely ever works in business , and certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful when we pinpoint the areas that are bringing us the most success , and adapt our work going forward . <p> This is a fault that has troubled me no end in the past . I have a habit of being too concrete with my processes , and not allowing user feedback or valuable data to manifest itself and shape a more productive strategy going forward . I 'm a pretty stubborn bastard , and its probably cost me a lot of money . <p> Switch certainly struck a chord with my stubborn side . I 've started to re-evaluate my career objectives and match them up to the bright spots of my current business model . Its resulted in me culling two entire dedicated servers and dropping about 20 domains , but I 'm pretty sure I 've made the right decision going forward . <p> If you feel like your wheels are spinning in the tracks , and you cant seem to inch closer to your defining vision , the easiest and most damaging attitude is to focus at what you 're doing wrong . Its much more productive to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hinge your business around what 's already working . Focus on your strengths . <p> I really enjoyed the first half of Switch . It packs in a lot of useful actionable advice that I have n't read in any other change bible ( and I 've read my fair share ) . The book loses its focus around the halfway point and descends in to more of a tribute towards the authors favourite social psychologists , which might go unnoticed and appreciated by some , but for others will feel like a Robert Cialdini overdose . Still , a recommended read . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> One Comment <p> Nice post . I have n't read it , but it sounds like you are drawing the usual distinction between being employed and an entrepreneur . In employment , it always seems to be about the things we do n't  do well or have cocked-up holding us back . As an entrepreneur , we would outsource these things to other people that are better at them , or simply find another way to to the result . <p> For what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mention above . Great in concept . Initial research went well . Lots of pages are built . Lots of links happened . The site generates traffic , but not enough to make me jump for joy , so I did n't  get around to monetising because I became bored and well , you know , another idea came along 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277714 @1677714/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Christ , I almost forgot about this place . About two weeks ago , I had a fetching list of topics to post about . So what happened ? <p> Amsterdam happened . <p> An extended break in Holland has helped to relax my senses . Unfortunately to the point where I cant remember much of what I wanted to say . Whenever I tell people that I 've been to Amsterdam , I always feel the need to make it perfectly clear that " No , I did n't  . " <p> And even if I did , I probably would n't remember , okay ? Perhaps my single most striking memory of The Dam was being perched in a toilet , space caked out of my face , wondering what would happen if you whipped a pigeon . I swear to God , it seemed philosophical at the time . <p> Anyway , I believe the last post was about shock marketing tactics and how you could stun somebody in to clicking a creative if you pressed the right buttons . <p> This post swings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at how you could go about laser targeting a favourite term of mine with a traffic source as anonymous and faceless as PPV . Its incredibly easy , but to do so , you will invariably need to sacrifice the one thing that keeps a super affiliates bed wet at nightvolume . <p> Since I decided to start rambling about PPV again , I 've been bombarded by contextual marketing virgins who would like to get a piece of the pie but just do n't  know where to start . So I will say that this road is generally much easier and much cheaper than the methods outlined in my last post . <p> The best way to take a vice like grip over your PPV targeting is to only actually target one site . In some cases , even one page . <p> While providing a visual shock like the car crash scenario is often good for general targeting , you may find more success by designing your PPV creatives to be a working extension of the site that you 're targeting . You cant go ripping the brand name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users web location to your advantage . <p> One option may be to target the sport section of a national newspaper to crowbar in a PPV campaign along the lines of <p> Yes , it sounds pretty much identical to the recent banned Facebook ads citing the users age as a barrier to entry . And that 's true . But the secret is to make the reader feel as if they 've stumbled across a mystery freebie while carefully avoiding any suggestion that you 're the actual owner of the target site . Sound a little shady ? Yep , so is a large segment of the shit that actually works for affiliates in the CPA space . <p> Another favourite tactic of mine is to hijack the inferiority complex to make the user click-through to where I want them to be . <p> Ill use Runescape as an example . Here is a game where you can register a character and engage with thousands of other users in a sprawling virtual world . I 'm no market research wizard , but what can I say for sure about a lot of Runescape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  like to be made to feel inferior . <p> That said , I thought itd be a good idea to design a PPV creative that would be specifically catered for Runescape users persuading them to register on the closest matching gaming offer I could find . <p> But I cant tell you until you click through and see it for yourself " <p> I was hoping to spark an immediate reaction where firstly , the player does n't  like being left in the dark or having it implied that he s not good at Runescape . And secondly , there 's the inquisitive nature of wanting to know more about a new game that ranks well with the same crowd . <p> Given that so many of the Runescape crowd are young , retarded , and living in cloud cuckoo land , you can have a field day with your creatives until you 're driving a decent amount of clicks and conversions . <p> I 'm using Runescape and the gaming niche as a convenient example because I know it wo n't make you much money if you rip it like several people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to start thinking outside the box . Look at how you could apply the same logic to offers with higher payouts and higher traffic . <p> If you 're new to PPV , I would strongly recommend you learn to walk before you try to run . Just choose one target site . Maybe even one page within it . <p> Search for a suitable offer that can be wedged on to the back of your target for maximum relevancy . Nothing grabs the users attention like a creative that asks them whether they really want to do what they 're about to do , but maybe that 's a method for a whole new post <p> As I 've said all along , when you 're advertising with PPV , you need to understand the way that interruption marketing works . While the last post detailed a method of interrupting the user with something visually extravagant and attention catching , it does n't  have to be that way . <p> Sometimes you can exploit interruption marketing by making sure the user does n't  even know that there 's been an interruption . Blend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the users natural navigation through the target site . I 'm not going to go in to specifics , but when I 'm planning my PPV campaigns , I like to ask myself three questions about the targets I 'm adding . <p> 1 . Why is the user on this page ? 2 . Where is the user most likely to click next ? 3 . Where did the user come from ? <p> If you can begin to paint a picture of the users browsing habits , you can design a creative that captures their attention so much more readily . Headline phrases like " Before you " and " Now that you 've " play a key role in my PPV creatives and if you plug your brain in , you can probably put two and two together to see why . Happy hunting . <h> Get profitable with CPV Lab <p> If you can+GGt get profitable with PPV , you need this . If you can get profitable with PPV , you still need this .

I always struggled integrating exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spending cash on gym memberships that I did n't  use often enough , I cancelled , bought a spin bike and put the thing next to my PC . I now do 40mins first thing every morning on it , 6 days a week , listening to audio books at the same time . Definitely a worthwhile routine change that 's stuck for several months now . <p> That 's an interesting take on in compared to the other affiliate blogs I have been reading . They imply that at the beginning you 'll spend 8 20 hours a day online but I 've always questioned what the point of this was ; are they spending all day creating new campaigns from scratch ? Just seems like a way to burn through cash fast . How long can it possibly take to design creatives ; upload them and design new ads ? I understand that you 'll have to review the data and split test , but I cant comprehend how you would spend 8 20 hours a day on campaign activity ( weekends included ) . Alot of the content on other blogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative newbs who automatically defer at the slightest bit of self-righteousness on the authors part . <p> Yeah , that 's true . Some people say they work 12-18 hour days , but if you actually timed how many of those hours were actually productive I bet its not that many . For most people its only a handful of hours where they can do really focused intense work . Also , having a balanced lifestyle means you 're less likely to burnout ( as well as being healthier for your body ) <p> Saw this floating around Facebook before and its an interesting infographic . <p> At the end of the day I think my take away and everyone else takes away is to control and schedule your time as best as possible .

@@106277719 @1677719/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Blogging has an awesome upside . There are many advantages , and not all of them revolve around making money . <p> If you 've ever dabbled with the idea of launching your own blog , here are 7 unexpected benefits that might tip you towards your first post . <p> 1 . A Good Blog Makes Money <p> Okay , that 's get it out of the way , shall we ? There 's no denying that one of the greatest benefits of running a successful blog is the money that it brings . <p> There are many ways to generate money . You can sell banner space , sling affiliate products , or use them as battlegrounds to take over the blogosphere with your own shady product creations . Many writers use their online reputations to pick up consulting gigs . <p> The money should never be your number one reason for starting a blog . But I also do n't  buy the overused line that " I write to help others " . Thats bullshit . Every blogger has his own agenda , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its a bit of both . <p> 2 . Free Shit is Nice <p> My girlfriend and I are both writers . She is a fashion , beauty and lifestyle blogger . I 'm an affiliate marketing blogger . Guess who gets the better free shit ? I 'll give you a clue . If you think its me , you need your head examined . <p> My favourite freebie was an expenses-paid trip to an absolutely luscious hotel called The Library in Koh Samui . Imagine waking up to this in the morning <p> and knowing that you got it because you splurged some opinions on a WordPress once upon a time . <p> So what freebies do I receive as a blogger in the Internet Marketing space ? Well , other than the occasional trip to visit a network , and the thank you Christmas presents , the biggest perks are the free access to paid services and products . <p> Its not five star hotel material , but I 've saved thousands of pounds with free copies of products that have come in very useful for my business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleashed a wealth of information that has been both profitable and practical to my business . And of course , it tastes even sweeter when its free . <p> I regularly get blitzed with software and tools before they go public . Not that I end up reviewing many products , but I simply would n't receive them if I had n't  established a blog . <p> I 've learnt that free shit is good , which is why my next blog will probably be called FinchTravels . <p> 3 . Preferential Treatment <p> In affiliate marketing , having a blog is n't just the trademark of a huge ego . Its a valuable device for getting preferential treatment , and for deterring shady companies from screwing you over . <p> Many affiliate networks will have no problem in stiffing a loud-mouthed publisher who does n't  follow their guidelines to a tee . But if you have an influential blog , those same networks will always think twice before messing with you . <p> I 've heard many horror stories of new affiliates getting rough treatment that simply would n't happen if they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . I 've never directed a complaint at a company over my blog , and that 's probably because they bend over backwards to make sure I do n't  have a reason to . <p> The downside to having an influential blog is the enormous amount of sucking up that comes your way . Internet Marketing harbours a lot of fake individuals , and if you have a platform where they can promote their message , you 'll find the urchins congregating around your inbox like flies to a turd . <p> 4 . Stay Social in an Unsocial World <p> My industry is not the sort where your day ends at 5pm , and you can hit the town to wash away your weekly sins with seven pints and a J+gerbomb . <p> The opportunity to wade through Londons bars and clubs does n't  present itself very often now that I work at home in the suburbs . Since I quit the day job , my social life has become something that requires effort . It demands jumping on a train and heading in the opposite direction to the hoards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogging come in to this ? Well , firstly , I would n't call blogging a form of socialising . As I look around me , Im accompanied by a Maltipom and a bunch of sausage roll wrappers . <p> Social , my arse <p> But what blogging does offer is an opportunity to express yourself explicitly . <p> When I blog , its like a tsunami outpouring of whatever is frustrating me on a given day . Occasionally , people will leave comments telling me Im a closet genius , although more often theyll compare me to a complete dumbarse . Hey , whatever , that 's okay . <p> Simply expressing myself and reading the comments has a therapeutic appeal . It opens the walls of my home office and assures me that there are other people out there facing the same challenges . <p> If you 're working a lonely job like Internet Marketing , or coding , or anything that happens to be remote running a blog can help you connect to your peers . It takes away the illusion of isolation . <p> If Jack Nicholson had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit together . <p> 5 . Lend Authority to Other Projects <p> Assuming you 're building a blog that is just as focused on you as the brand , as it is on the subject matter , there 's enormous potential to use it to lend authority to other projects you may be working on . <p> Launching a new website from scratch is a tiresome struggle on many fronts . There 's the SEO , the initial word of mouth , the seeding of fan pages . Christ , the process can suck the giblets out of even the most patient of souls . <p> Having a blog to lend authority to your new projects is an excellent headstart . Its like a piggyback over the first few weeks of trauma , tantrums and ball-ache . <p> I actively cross-promote my projects , and if I ever want to give a new site a boost , I can generally drop a link to lend some authority . This works both in the eyes of interested readers , and the Google juggernaut . <p> Blogging gets a bad name for relying too heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindless self-promotion rocks when you can get away with it . Why the hell not ? Nobody has to read your drivel . Most just choose to anyway . <p> 6 . Getting a Job is Much Easier <p> How many people spend 20 years traipsing through education only to find the dream job is still out of reach once theyve graduated ? <p> That 's not to say you should n't list your qualifications and achievements somewhere on the site . If you have them , anyway . I 'm a high school dropout , and school is something I try not to talk about . <p> The beauty of a blog is that you will be judged by the thoughts , arguments and knowledge you put forward . Every comment , every subscriber and every reader is a testament of your influence even if they do n't  agree with you . <p> Blogging is a way of proving your worth that does n't  cost a penny . <p> Unfortunately , if your dream job involves rising through the football ranks or becoming a world renowned brain surgeon , you should probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to know that they 've been to university and paid their dues , not that they 've dabbled with some WordPress widgets in their basement . <p> Ever since I was 16 , I 've kept some form of journal or blog to document my various moments of insanity over the last eight years . <p> The vast majority of those outpourings I can not look back on with anything other than disgust and a beetroot face . I find it impossible to read my own writing , even on subjects as notoriously heartless and cold as affiliate marketing . <p> Regardless , writing has a therapeutic quality to me . Just by putting in to words whatever Im feeling ; professional , personally , even politically ; I can isolate the mood swings and stay focused on my actual goals . <p> Its a tough process to explain to anybody who does n't  share the feeling . I 'm sure many readers will treat the idea of therapeutic writing with looks of disdain . Writing is certainly not a universal passion . <p> Nonetheless , I would explode if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . Making money , expressing myself , and not exploding . The only incentives I need . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 9 Comments <p> I 'm always inspired when I hear of successful high school dropouts . Being one myself I get many of my friends/family questioning whether I 'm going to go back for my diploma . I always tell them itll never happen . Besides the fact that I 'm working toward being self employed . Employers I believe are doing more research now online on their prospective employees . I prefer to compete in the informal job market . The informal job market is so much less competivie but far more lucrative . <p> I was lucky to never have any family objections when I dropped out of school . But I think that 's probably because I was so clearly unhappy at the time . <p> I think its a shame that so many parents are stuck with the status quo mindset of how employment worked 20 years ago . Many opportunities now exist where it simply does n't  make sense to go through university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( As usual . ) I found myself to be initially motivated by money , and its still a driving force for my diligence in posting , but as I became more comfortable in my subject matter , and started to take greater ownership over my work and connect with people in my niche I find myself more responsible for my audience . So I want to do the best job that I can to receive positive feedback from them and also provide value . So my ego has definitely played a greater role as I have wandered down the rabbit hole . Its a lot of fun and the benefits can be tremendous . I should consider starting a personal blog in addition to my more affiliate marketing centered niche blog . Its probably therapeutic . <p> Btw , if you think reading your own writing is painful , try recording videos or podcasts ! Man its hard for me to watch my own work , but surprisingly people seem to enjoy it . At least with writing there is always the edit button at least in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about blogging . I 'm not sure I have ever actually made money from a blog , but I run a political / policy blog and it has brought in a few consulting gigs , and I have had unpaid but expensed trips to Lisbon and Berlin and paid trips to Copenhagen , Montreal and Florence on the back of it . So there really can be some cool life enhancing benefits . And as you mention , writing is a form of thinking and can be very good therapy . <p> Blogging might not make you money directly , unless you run ads on the blog ( which is a bad idea anyway ) , but it can definitely lead to opportunities that will make you money in the long run . Blogging is a great way to prove that you " know your stuff " and can be considered a trusted resource of information . It takes time , but this often opens doors to new business relationships that would n't have happened otherwise . <p> So true . Blogging surely is beneficial in more than seven ways .

@@106277720 @1677720/ <p> Once you 've joined an affiliate network or two , you will no doubt find some offers that you 're interested in running . Whether you decide to promote a weight loss product , a dating website or an auto insurance quote it does n't  matter . You still need to buy traffic or find traffic . You need to be able to send people to the offer to have any hope of making money . <p> No eyeballs = better luck next time . <p> Buying traffic will affect the thickness of your wallet , but its the sophisticated cousin of the many free traffic generating methods out there . I do n't  mean to knock the potential of SEO ( which is enormous ) , but optimizing a website to rank well in the search engines can feel like moving at a snails pace while you wonder whether you 're actually going anywhere at all . You want to see results fast , right ? The easiest way to see quick results is to put your money where your mouth is and buy some guaranteed traffic to your website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're worried about losing money , give up reading this blog right now and save yourself some time . There are too many marketers willing to invest in making this career work for Johnny No Pockets to cruise in with his budget of zero and expect to be a success . <p> I 'm going to give you two examples of three different kinds of traffic sources where you can buy advertising . <p> Two are search based the user types a keyword in to a search engine and your ad displays as one of the results . <p> Two are social based the user qualifies to view your ad as a result of your demographic and profile targeting ( for example , show my ad to women on Facebook aged 35-40 in Canada ) <p> Two are contextual based the user receives a pop-up or pop-under when he accesses certain pages on the web . The advertisements are served by third party software ( also known as those shitty screensavers you used to download as a kid ) . <p> Whether you choose to become a search , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful affiliates choose to be all three . If I could give you one piece of advice , it would be to become an expert on one traffic source rather than a fledgling amateur who juggles his time and knowledge between all three . <h> Search Based Traffic Sources <h> Google Adwords <p> For many years , the most obvious place for an affiliate to buy his traffic . Adwords let 's you advertise to users searching on Google , by choosing which keywords and phrases youd like your ad to display for . Nothing says prime target for your weight loss product quite like a user searching " help me lose weight fast i look like i ate a small child " . <p> If you 're a newbie marketer , Adwords is a great place to start . It gives you the opportunity to hunt down customers who have illustrated a likeliness to buy your crap by the virtue that they 're actively searching for it . Unfortunately , Google can make life very difficult for affiliates , so make sure you brush up with the editorial guidelines . <h> Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as strict . Microsoft Adcenter let 's you bid on keywords with the aim of attracting customers from the Bing and Yahoo search engines . Many would say that Adcenter is more forgiving towards affiliates , and you 're less likely to have your account penalized for trivial infringements , but that 's open to debate . Personally , I think the last twelve months have seen a major change . Adcenter is no longer easy pickings for the bait and switch tactics that affiliates have become so notorious for . <p> While you wo n't find the same volume of traffic as Adwords , this is hardly an issue while you 're getting started . It can be a little expensive depending on your niche , but the traffic is usually high quality . <h> Social Based Traffic Sources <h> Facebook Ads <p> By advertising on the worlds largest social network , you can drive a LOT of traffic to an affiliate offer . Those rectangle adverts you see on the right hand side of your profile are all making use of the Facebook Ads platform . As an advertiser , you can choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year old Americans ) , or by keyword ( show my ads to users who mention " football " in their profile ) . <p> Facebook offers a rich palette of targeting options and its possible to create some extremely effective campaigns . You can tap in to an almost unlimited supply of traffic , much of which converts very well and is suitable for your affiliate campaigns . Be prepared to have your patience tested , however , and take a thorough read over the editorial guidelines . Facebook interns are trigger happy little bitches when it comes to declining adverts they deem to be inappropriate . Show the slightest glimpse of a breast in your dating ads and you 'll be banished forevermore . <p> Some affiliates have even had their actual Facebook profiles deleted as a result of advertising campaigns that breached the T&amp;Cs . It sounds horrific , I know . All that work theyll be able to get done now <p> While Facebook Ads are no longer cheap , there are several untapped markets where you can exploit low costs . Advertising in Mexico , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than targeting middle-class America . So think wisely , target accordingly . There 's a lot of money to be made from Zuckerbergs brainfart yet . <h> Plentyoffish Ads <p> Plentyoffish is a dating site . Since opening up its advertising inventory , affiliates have been loving the flexible targeting options that you could expect from a site that is designed to capture user attributes . <p> Why advertise on a dating site ? The great appeal is hidden in those targeting options . What do people do when they sign up to dating sites ? They post crap about themselves . <p> " Hi , Im Finch . I watch TV , play with my balls and like to collect stamps . Oh and I love blondes . Message me plz . " <p> Huzzah ! What 's this ? " Blonde Loves Stamp Collecting Freaks " Jeez , this dating site looks like it was made with my meaningless criteria in mind . I better join today , right ? <p> And there 's the appeal of POF in a nutshell . <p> You can write copy that targets individuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all the more greater . <p> I recommend POF as the best place to get started in social marketing . Its like Facebook Ads , except cheaper and with editorial guidelines that will keep your hairline in tact . They 're not complete and utter tits , essentially . <p> 4 . The user visits one of these selected URLs and receives your pop-up . <p> There is no way of blocking the pop-up , the system is perfectly legal and the advertising is dirt cheap . A pop-up will set you back as little as $0.01 . So its a great way of marketing on a budget . <p> You can put together some very targeted campaigns with PPV . I 'm sure you can imagine the benefits of triggering which exact pages you want your adverts to appear on . And the beautiful catch is that you can advertise on websites you would n't otherwise be seen dead on . Front page of Fox News ? Yeah , throw my ad there . Checkout page on Amazon ? Yeah , sure , put a pop-up there offering the user a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggering . <p> Anyway , Media Traffic requires an initial $200 deposit to open an account . Once you 're registered , you can get campaigns approved and running usually within 24 hours . The quality of the traffic is decent by PPV network standards , not great , but there is still good money to be made . If you cant get campaigns approved on Facebook or Google , consider hitting them here where the approval guidelines are much more lax . <h> Trafficvance <p> Trafficvance is a very popular PPV network , admired by many marketers for its high quality traffic . But its also quite elusive to join . Trafficvance requires a $1000 deposit and a direct referral in to the system . So unless an existing member of Trafficvance puts in a good word for you , that 's all she wrote . <p> Youll be hard pushed to find a PPV network that outperforms Trafficvance . But as a beginner , you do n't  want to be diving in at the deep end before you 've learnt how to swim . I know that because I 've tried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Anyway , get started with PPV traffic using Media Traffic and then if you manage to get profitable , scale across to Trafficvance . <p> These six traffic sources should give you more than enough food for thought as you consider how to attack the affiliate marketing landscape . Of course , I 'm merely scratching a huge iceberg with the websites Ive listed . There are hundreds , no THOUSANDS , of traffic sources that can be leveraged in to great ways of promoting an affiliate offer . Intrigued ? Be sure to check out this excellent list of the many different places to buy traffic . <p> A trait of a good affiliate marketer is being able to work with multiple traffic sources , understanding how each of them can be beneficial in their own ways . If I 'm going to give one piece of advice to a beginner , it would be to stick with just one traffic source . Master it . Forget about moving on until you know that traffic source inside out . <p> Too many marketers fall in to the trap of throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to cover too many traffic sources , too many offers , too many landing pages . Inevitably , they end up with too many variables . So not only do they fail , but they fail in such a way that they never truly understand what they did wrong . <p> These are the kind of people who walk away from affiliate marketing , tails between legs , claiming the concept of " making money online " is simply one giant scam . That 's great . The rest of us are busy doing what they could n't manage because they were approaching it all wrong . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277721 @1677721/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I remain convinced that most dating affiliates lack the balls to really get aggressive with their advertising efforts . <p> Why is it important to be aggressive ? <p> Remember this . If you 're in the dating niche , you 're not marketing to the trendsetters and early adopters . You 're marketing to the crusty old goats who have had many chances to register before , and have found many reasons not to bother . <p> Why do you suppose the 600+ login crowd on Plentyoffish is deemed to be low quality traffic ? Its mainly because such users have had the chance to be converted , and the moment has passed . <p> You have to be aggressive if you hope to enter such a competitive market and walk away with conversions . <p> For that purpose , I 'm going to suggest you sit back and watch Se7en a masterpiece of filmmaking and one of my favourite movies of all time . <p> No , I 'm not implying that all of your dating creatives should be littered with quotes and photos of Brad Pitt . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These sins provide valuable angles that we can use to get aggressive with our marketing efforts . <p> There 's a sinner in each and every one of us . And if you match the right pair of eyeballs to the right angle , your hopes of a conversion will rocket so far through the sky that you 'll begin to wonder why you wasted so much time spunking dollars on that whimsical " Oh hello darling , come join my dating site , Its free " bullshit . <p> Who do you think you are ? Hugo from Made in Chelsea ? <p> Most dating affiliates seem to be experts in pandering to the proletarians , while the successful guys are busy exploiting them . That may be a cynical attitude towards life , but forgive me , I 'm a cynical bastard and its early in the morning . <h> Converting Users with The 7 Deadly Sins <p> Ive replaced lust from the list . If you cant see a way to use lust to your advantage on a dating site , its probably time to find another niche . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough members of the opposite sex . Socially accepted reason #1 is " Oh , I never get time to socialise outside work . " For these users , frank and to the point is the way . A sloth responds to instant results . <p> Greed <p> Dating sites give keyboard charmers the opportunity to test-drive seduction techniques on large samples of women . No keyboard charmer can resist the chance to message as many women as his Sent box can handle , even when he s found one he likes . <p> Online dating to a man , is what Pick n Mix was to Finch as a child . <p> Envy <p> Envy is a natural by-product of dating sites where the women are severely outnumbered by guys actively messaging them . A lot of men are competing with each other , and as we all know , men do n't  compete with each other particularly well . <p> Acedia <p> Acedia is the overwhelming feeling of listlessness . Which is how a lot of singles feel about their love lives when making the decision to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most dangerous sin of all , and it goes hand in hand with bitterness one of my favourite cards to play when advertising a dating site .

" to their relentless advances . <p> Gluttony <p> Okay , were pushing it . When I came up with the idea of this post , I forgot that one of the 7 deadly sins involves eating too much . Forgive me if this example gets you banished from multiple advertising platforms in one hit . <p> Vanity <p> Vanity is a quality nestled in just about every idiot who ever joined Plentyoffish and posted a small essay to justify something as retarded as his favourite colour .

Yep , you know who I 'm talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing yourself that somebody gives a crap . <p> Disclaimer : I will leave it down to you guys to interpret and replace the sarcasm in each ad . Its my new way of punishing the guys who rip ads word for word . <h> To summarise <p> Because a post like this needs a summary to actually have a point . <p> Airy fairy dating ads that throw out broad headlines such as " Want a Girlfriend ?

Waiting on ads to be approved . Waiting on data to accumulate . Waiting on landing pages to be approved .

@@106277724 @1677724/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Previously we looked at how social proof can lead to more conversions , more sales and more money in your bank account . <p> Social proof is a cornerstone of neuromarketing . <p> But its not the only child . <p> In this post , were going to look at three of the most powerful selling techniques known to man . Some might call them the twisted twins of social validation . <p> These techniques are capable of wreaking some serious havoc on the fickle , fanciful minds of our target markets . Which is why I ask no , plead that you repent for your sins and wash your keyboard in soap after usage . <p> The three techniques are : <p> Scarcity <p> Reciprocation <p> The need to rationalize decisions <p> There is plenty of academic research to suggest that the techniques above are Grade A weapons of mass destruction in the war of selling . Yet still there exists a shortage of examples for how these techniques can be adjusted to the modern web . <p> Well , that 's what I aim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's start by looking at scarcity . <h> How scarcity sells <p> Scarcity works in tandem with social proofing . Like two magnetic forces pulling a consumer to shipwreck . Together , they are irresistible . <p> I gave an example of one of my preferred scarcity tactics in the previous post . <p> " There are currently 17 people viewing todays offer . " " 654 people have signed up since October 1st . " " We have exceeded our capacity ! The offer ends in X. " <p> IMGrind holds live masterminding sessions at factory line frequency . The events are an opportunity for Internet Marketers to get together and discuss strategies that are currently making money online . While I can not vouch for how effective these sessions may be , I do admire the precision that goes in to their marketing . <p> To my knowledge , their latest live event had just 20 seats available . They were selling these tickets at $247 a pop . <p> Scarcity sets the price point <p> Setting such a short supply of tickets provides two opportunities : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines like " Just 4 Seats Remaining ! Book Now or Never " <p> It adds value to their second option , which I assume is their primary method of monetizing the event : DVD recordings . It sends out a message , " This event is full of so much smoking hot info , we can only show it to 20 people . But you , you do n't  have to travel to New York City . You can get a copy of the DVD and watch from home . " <p> Of course , when the live tickets do sell out , the event gains prestige . Users are far more likely to part with their wallets . <p> And what about those $247 DVD prices ? Pretty extreme , do n't  you think ? <p> If somebody offered me a DVD for $247 , I would kindly take the disk , snap it in half , and take a swipe at their jugular . But this price works . <p> Why does it work ? It works because the anchor has already been set . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have social proofing that the event is worth at least $247 . You also have the scarcity of tickets painting a subliminal message in your head that you will be missing out on something great . <p> The information is not easy to access . Some marketers are travelling to New York City for the session . Let 's be honest . How far out of bed would you crawl for a free WSO ? <p> Remember : The harder it is to obtain , the greater the perceived value . <p> The final sucker punch in this awesome sales funnel is when IMGrind promotes the aftermath of the event . <p> They will duly blitz your inbox with success story after success story of how attendees have breathed new fire in to their careers after making the trip . This information is usually followed by an announcement : the DVD recordings will be taken offline in X days . <p> All that priceless information <p> Gone . Vanquished . Never to be seen again . <p> What you are left with is a scarcity of time + a scarcity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure theyll be eating pretty sizeable turkeys this Thanksgiving . <p> The lesson of scarcity : When we perceive information as being too easy to get , we lower the value of that information . Conversely , we can set high expectations and high demand by raising our prices and creating a bottleneck . <p> Open up a newspaper and chances are you will find a page dedicated to a stand-up comedian who has inexplicably miscalculated the demand for his shows . <p> I tell a lie . My one lasting memory of MySpace was that of the worlds most reciprocal social network . <p> At least 90% of my actions on MySpace were down to the compelling forces of reciprocation . <p> " Hey Finch . I just added you to my Top Eight Friends . Wink , nudge . " <p> " Thats extraordinary news , Brianna . One might call this the proudest day of my life . I guess you 've risen through the ranks to become my 6th bestest friend . Come and refresh the page . Oh , and jolly well done . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just answered this cool survey and chose you as my friend most likely to die in a hideous car crash before the age of 21 ! You should do it too . " <p> " No way ! I just answered it . You were my friend most likely to get pregnant in the back of a bike shed and have 3 kids before the age of 25 ! " <p> 7 years pass and Finch is proven correct . <p> MySpace was a lot of things . But above all , it was a land of scratchy backs . <p> While I hope you have set your goals higher than landing on somebodys Top Friends list , the psychology behind sites like MySpace can tell us a lot about how we behave . <p> Reciprocation is embedded in our psyches , particularly on a social level . <p> What many skilled marketers have noted is that reciprocation can be just as effective when it comes to selling . <p> We call it the feeling of indebtedness . <p> Every squeeze landing page in history owes its success to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  unsubscribe immediately after downloading a free giveaway . We understand that there is an exchange in place . <p> Historically , when we roamed the earth as cave men , to break the law of reciprocation would have been to invite trouble . In most cases , a club to the back of the head . <p> We have evolved , but elements of the old brain still exist . <p> You can tap in to this evolutionary hallmark by priming your web users via reciprocation . <p> How about a free gift ? A little something for nothing that looks innocuous but casts that sinking feeling of indebtedness . <p> Users were able to access 10+ pages of material without paying a penny . <p> Note : And if you wish to receive the same perk with Volume 7 , I suggest you opt-in at the bottom of this post ! <p> The purpose of giving away content I had shed blood , sweat and tears for was not to be a good samaritan . Do I look like a good samaritan ? It was to induce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several weeks , the sale would arrive . <p> A key element of reciprocation is that the scale of the good deed rarely matters . I may literally only scratch your back , but if you accept it as a favour , a seed of indebtedness has been planted . <p> The next thing you know , I 'm inviting you to bed <p> That 's great . How do I use reciprocation to make more sales ? <p> One of my favourite techniques is the double tiered landing page . It traditionally involves a free giveaway ; usually an ebook , or a personalised report ; followed by a CPA offer . <p> The user lands on my page and is asked to submit his name and address to access my prized content . As soon as he has done so , he s hit square in the chops with a CPA offer wrapped around a very carefully worded recommendation . <p> Just one more thing , if you 're really looking to save some seals , can I give you a recommendation ? <p> AdoptAPremiumSeal.com is my partners site . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , you should definitely check it out . After all , you have already shown me what a worldly soul you have by requesting my report . Most people are too cruel to get this far . <p> The next logical step , as I 'm sure you are aware , is to adopt a seal . Right now . <p> Seriously , I 'm waiting to take your call . <p> I 'd really appreciate it . And I know the seals will too ! <p> Note : I have used seals as an example , but I suppose you could easily use the same copy for Fat Local Slags . They need homes too . <p> If it seems like a ridiculous example , I have to tell you people commit to some ridiculous shit , especially when they feel that they owe you . <p> Whatever gets the reciprocation monkey off their back . <p> The lesson of reciprocation : If we want people to take action , a small favour will go a long way . Aim to plant a seed of indebtedness before the user reaches your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the web . The most potent weapon is a taste of the information they crave . If you can personalise the information , the results will be even greater . <h> How the need to rationalize decisions sells ( over and over again ) <p> Selling to a customer once is the weather smiling on you . <p> Selling to a customer for the rest of his life is a job well done . <p> Marketers like myself too often forget that the big money lies in attracting lifelong customers . We affiliates , we love to rinse and burn . <p> We 'd rather attract a million first time sales than deal with the threat of speaking once more to those weve used and abused . <p> The reality ? Its not easy to attract a lifelong customer . <p> You mustnt only attract the customers wallet . You must attract his best judgment , his sense of identity and his underlying belief that the decision to choose your product was correct . If this belief does not exist , his first conversion will be his last . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so providing sweet assurance that a purchasing decision was correct is just as important as getting the bloody minded fool to bust out his plastic in the first place . <p> How can we help a consumer to rationalise a decision ? <p> There are two techniques that I want to look at : <p> Appealing to the users sense of identity pre-sale . <p> Altering the users perception of an experience post-sale . <h> Appealing to the users sense of identity <p> I have tested hundreds of landing page variables . I cant think of a single variable quite so potent as the ability to tap in to a users sense of identity . <p> Consumers buy products that align with their opinions . <p> The products they love most are those that make them feel good about themselves , while expressing who they are . <p> The very first impression your landing page should create is a sensation of Us Against The World . You should know your target market well enough that you can express their single biggest fear in the headline , along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at the Work at Home Mom industry . It draws in thousands of mothers every single day on the basis of what exactly ? No more than a sense of identity . <p> " I am a work at home mom . " <p> Yes , you are . <p> And I am much more likely to sell merchandise to you if I pretend that I am one too . Of course , you 'll never believe me . My tits are too hairy . <p> You need only look at , oh say , every single religion in the world to see how tribal the human race can be . Neuromarketers understand that what we call in-group bias the tendency to side with people who share common ground is an incredibly powerful sales engine . <h> Appealing to the users perception of experience post-sale <p> Not only will people buy what they believe in . What people buy will often shape what they believe in . <p> If you want to create a lifelong customer , you cant leave them at the checkout cart . <p> Every single Multi-Level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with devout faith , that his money is being invested wisely . That 's because the MLM experience relies on shaping the users perception after the initial sale/investment . <p> Now , look at your own sales funnel . <p> Do you forget about your customers from the moment the sale is made ? <p> You should n't . This is the time to pounce . <p> If you want to create your own tribe , your own dedicated group of followers , you have to instill the belief that your product is an extension of their own identities . <p> Do n't  restrict freebie giveaways to your non-customers . Provide the best benefits to those who are already your customers . Do n't  be afraid to develop an email follow-up series after a sale has been made . And always promote your successes . <p> IMGrind , the scarcity exponents I referenced at the start of this post , are equally skilled at promoting their successes . An IMGrind event will rarely pass without an email landing in my inbox with the success stories that came out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations is one of the best ways to ensure that your customers stay loyal . It let 's you mould their perception of what you offer . <h> Reflections on Neuromarketing <p> This has been a long post , and my fingers are chaffed . If you are still awake , I salute you . <p> The truth is , neuromarketing is deserving of both your time and attention . It is one of the most exciting , baffling and lucrative fields you could hope to explore . <p> We cant control how we are wired as human beings . <p> Sure , we can make what we might consider to be logical decisions , but they are usually driven by split second judgments that marketers are only just beginning to exploit . <p> If you really want to understand how to increase conversions , its those split second judgments that you need to learn and embrace . <p> You will soon begin to understand how little we actually know about ourselves . And how what little we do know can be exploited by marketers with money on their minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official sponsor of Premium Posts Volume 5 &amp; 6 .

Props to you and your balls for taking the time to write such a long piece of excellent stuff in your truly unique ( but absolutely awesome ) writing style ! <p> One question : for shaping the users perception of their buying experience ( post-sale ) , is there anything else you can do other than glorifying the results other customers of yours got with the product ? <p> My balls say thank you .

I swim and exercise daily . I sweat out enough toxins to drown a small kitten in a bath of poison . <p> Because its so easy . <p> This country provides the perfect building blocks for a healthy lifestyle : bar a shit load of traffic fumes , and the constant threat of decapitation via motorcycle . <p> Its easy to feel great when the tools to defeat inertia are sitting on your doorstep . <p> That inertia bossed my suburban life in London . <p> I barely made it to lunch without a trip to the local petrol station for a muffin and a Costa Express . <p> Think Alan Partridges life choices infected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important for any job , but especially one with such high demands on your decision-making . <p> When you move here , your general health will improve . <p> It will have a positive effect on your work performance . <h> Thailand is Buzzing with Young Go-Getters <p> One of the more demoralising aspects of Suburban London , for me , is the infectious dawdle of life as it meanders from one season to the next : from childhood , to graduation , to getting a job , to marriage , to kids , to retirement , to a care home , and eternal buggery . <p> On an eventful day , I 'd look out my window and what would I see ? <p> A granny capsizing in a pothole as she battles to collect her pension . A few mums returning from their school run .

@@106277726 @1677726/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> A few days ago , I asked Twitter for some feedback on Rich Dad Poor Dad . I received a ton of replies with the consensus swinging from awesome , to a vanity project , to a complete waste of time . A number of people suggested I read MJ DeMarcos The Millionaire Fastlane instead , and having heard good things from sources I trust , I thought I 'd take them up on the suggestion . <p> The Millionaire Fastlane aims to dispel the myth of Get Rich Slow , aka every financial dream you 've ever been sold . DeMarco is a contemporary self-made millionaire ; the type that we traditionally look up to in the Internet Marketing world . But then , this is no ordinary world . DeMarco made his fortune by selling Limos.com for several million dollars in the early 2000s . Now , he wants to hand us his blueprint for early retirement , using a clusterfuck of petrolhead metaphors and really , really tough love . <p> It sounds like a very familiar story arc , does n't  it ? Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong all these years . Then fill his shattered dreams with hope that a quick fix solution is there after all . <p> DeMarco distances himself from the popular be your own boss gurus that he claims to despise . And yet his formula for setting the tone of the message is as textbook as a Clickbank sales page . While the first half of The Millionaire Fastlane is a merciless assassination of anybody and everybody who detours from his grand plan , the latter chapters are a brilliant portrayal of what it really takes to attract wealth . <p> Fastlane is a mixed bag . Its 100 pages too long , and starts terribly by ticking off every last painful cliche of the Internet Millionaire . DeMarco is an abrasive , obnoxious and sometimes annoying writer . That happens to be one of my preferred methods of relating to young cash-hungry audiences , but MJ really pushes the boat out . The tough love tone could be forgiven , if it was n't for the breathtaking nonchalance by which he dispels the merit in any lifestyle but his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of a shitty car , or as somebody in his 50s or 60s . DeMarco ridicules anybody who has n't  achieved early wealth as a urine-stained , wheelchair-riding lost cause of society . <p> The first 100 pages act as a relentless attack on what MJ refers to as sidewalkers and slowlaners , or anybody who has n't  discovered his fastlane mindset . He unleashes a grandstand assault on just about anybody with a day job , and anybody with the audacity to follow a profession that requires working for The Man , or getting a college education . <p> It takes 17 chapters of preaching to the choir for DeMarco to simmer down and accept that we get it . We know why most people are destined to never be millionaires . We know that working 5 days in an office to enjoy 2 days of peace is not the greatest of trades . But Christ , does he ever ram it down our throats ? Barely a page drifts by where were not forced to listen to his Lamborghini fetish , or an increasingly ridiculous diatribe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of this book . The empty rhetoric left me wondering how such a broken beat could ever have hoarded the 5 star reviews that Amazon suggests , which made it all the more surprising that the chapters to follow are perhaps some of the best ever written on the field of personal finance . <p> As brash as DeMarco writes , his assessment of entrepreneurism is the sort that really gets you lining up the parallels with your own business . He provides a much needed demolition of the myth that being your own boss is synonymous with wealth and freedom . He even accuses us affiliate marketers of hitchhiking the road to riches and not being genuine entrepreneurs . He s right , of course . And his message that creating systems is the true secret behind wealth will be reverberating in the head of anybody who persists with the first half of the book and gets so far as to read it . <p> There are moments in the closing chapters where The Millionaire Fastlane resonates with our kind in a way that I 've yet to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the GoDaddys . A much needed reminder that as long as we stay promoting other peoples products , we get no closer to dictating our own future . Indeed , DeMarco even confesses his love for affiliate marketing . He just wants to be in charge of the system , rather than a disposable part of it . <p> Without doubt , the first half of this book is a damning crucifixion of the modesty lacking in our industry , but by the time you reach the final page , you 'll be feeling too punchdrunk on inspiration to care . <p> You 'll feel the need to step out from the shadow of promoting products you have no control over . You 'll want to build real wealth that leads to real freedom . This illumination , if it comes , is the single greatest gift an affiliate marketer could ask for . For that reason alone , Millionaire Fastlane is a must-read. 114273 @qwx974273 <p> A detailed assault on monetizing Plentyoffish is covered in Volumes 1 and 3 of Premium Posts , which have both received widespread praise . Grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 which will be landing next month and covering some brand new topics that I think you 're going to enjoy . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 15 Comments <p> I recently read this book too and shared a lot of your same observations . It was an odd mismatch . on the one hand he had some luck . 10 years ago there were some great opportunities to create a huge lead gen business like he did where you could be the marketer selling all the leads ( e.g. to dentists , doctors , etc . ) . And his limo site is definitely one such example . However , the window seems mostly closed for these types of services as there are a million SEO/PPC/SEM marketing companies that seek this business now by going directly to each business . So what he did does not mostly seem replicable and certainly not any form of blueprint . I was left wondering what the goal of writing the book was and realized he had a forum of some sort . I signed up there and checked it out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types . <p> the thing that does distinguish him is that he clearly does have the proper mindset to run an offline business and the management skills and philosophy to do this . there is value in what he said there . It sure seems like most people who get interested in " making money online " certainly do not want to run a " real business " and usually not one with employees or an office , etc . <p> i read a lot so i do n't  regret the time spent on the book . If someone wants to understand the entrepreneurs mindset and what 's involved in starting a business , the best and most realistic book i 'd recommend is Carol Roths entrepreneurial Equation . and if you want to understand the right philosophy for building systems , then read michael gerbers e-myth. both of these books will fundamentally change your life . <p> and finchthanks for all the great posts and value both in your free posts and in the premium stuff ive bought so far . <p> I totally agree with you that the book could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) shorter and still cover all the same ground . Its a lot of reading for only a few lessons , but the lessons are important and maybe that 's his point . If you do put in the time to read the entire book you certainly wont miss what he s trying to teach . <p> I read the book . Yeah , it took a long time and he seeems to really love his cars . Basically , he urges people to try and create " real " businesses where you own everything.He says the only vehicle for wealth is to first become rich ( 5-10 million ) and live off the interest or other steady investments . And , in order to do that , you need to make a real business . Some things that really helped me were regarding the value of time and realizing it is precious . Also , it helped me realize just how skilled some of affiliates really are . And that affiliates , if they 're any good , already have the skills required to really get a business going fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at some point for 5 million or so and whala time to retire . <p> You have an interesting take on the book . I did n't  hate the first half as much as you did , but I did find myself scrolling down through parts of it simply because I was bored of his , " I have a Lambo and loads of money and you live on the sidewalk " attitude . When I finished reading it , I thought that it should have been much better edited and someone ought to have told him to make it 70 pages shorter <p> That said , the second half of the book did inspire me to start planning two new sites that I 'll launch later in the year . They are both in the same very competitive but bet very well paid sector , and my aim will be to build , make them profitable and sustainable and then sell them . My mindset is " build two websites , make them profitable , sell them and then buy a house " . So all in all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Having just read this book I must say that you made quite the accurate assessment . Most of the golden tidbits of knowledge can be found in 3-4 chapters . I feel the main recourse for the book is to enlighten and evoke entrepreneurial mindsets and that it did , and it did well . <p> Have to agree skip the whole first 3rd about where he bashes all other thought processes . The reason I say skip , is most people reading the book are already on board with " do n't  trade time for money " and its better to get rick quicker than slowly . <p> The real meat in my opinion was his 5 factors for evaluating a business . This really opened up my eyes and made it clear quickly what I have to do with my business . To date Ive been floundering like a fish out of water trying to grow , but this book was a dose of Adderal I needed to help me focus on the actions I need to take in the next 6 months to get to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing style is amazing you must write some sick copy . <p> I love guys like this he can create a million dollars whenever he wants but he s left selling the old " get rich quick " book the ultimate sign that you CANT make it happen anywhere else . <p> He gets lucky 10 years ago when a lot of people got lucky its like those 14 year old kids who got rich with their myspace/widget sites when adsense and yahoo ads first came out . <p> here 's the main point : The guys who own the products make the most money did anyone really need to spend $16 to figure that out ? <p> Oh and you need workable systems that other people can do ( hired workers ) while you sit back and collect your millions ( ground breaker ) <p> Why not just see what other successful businesses are doing and try to reverse engineer ? <p> Go through their entire selling process , check for reviews first so you know you 're not going to get charged up the ass for months then buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what they do well , then take that main game plan and replicate it either in the same niche or somewhere else . <p> I never take these types of authors seriously " You need to live in the fast lane " blah blah blah , but he could n't replicate his own success/luck again if he tried , so he s left selling get rich quick books . <p> And we 've already been through the whole " if you 're not an entrepreneur you 're loser " bit guys like these are the true morons what would happen if everybody was an entrepreneur ? <p> This review is total rubbish . And should be ignored it simply wreaks of jealousy ! <p> Read the book again and remember to bring your brains and possibly " some guts " next time mate ( and by the sounds of things your reading glasses ) ! <p> And next time if you do n't  like the first 100 pages use your better and judgement and move onto a book you have a greater affinity for do n't  just complain later that it was n't worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't  finish the book ? He does n't  consider himself a child of the " dot com boom " as you suggest , because if you read , he sold the business , bought it back from the company he sold it to ( that went bankrupt ) , ran it for 6 years , and resold it at a multimillion dollar valuation in 07 , far past the dot com bubble . <p> The last thing he wanted to do was write a book , so people like you could come along , read half of it , get all indignant and disregard the book , and start bashing what you assume his story will be . <p> Try looking for a bit more info on him rather than spouting off your " expertise , " and you could end up surprised . <p> I would respond to more of your post , but I think if you actually read the whole thing , you 'll find a lot of your criticisms of him answered . <p> And no , I 'm not affiliated with him or the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and really love ( not ) when people shoot down someone with a good story because they think they know how it ends , and of course , they know " better .

@@106277728 @1677728/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I can remember only embarrassing figments of my last few birthday celebrations , and sometimes I consider that a blessing in disguise . Between the ages of 18 and 22 , I must have untagged enough photos to fill an entire hard drive with scandal . <p> Instead of scraping pizza from a beer-sodden kitchen counter , I carved steak from a pool of watercress and braised shallots . Instead of being spanked , and whipped , and publicly abused by Geordie strippers with candles not designed for cakes , I enjoyed the quiet company of my girlfriend , who thankfully , was not carrying handcuffs . <p> Unlike those who create New Years Resolutions to focus on their goals , I prefer to wait until I 'm hanging up my birthday cards . I use the moment to reflect on all that I 've achieved , or havent , and I redefine goals for the year ahead . <p> I 've always seen New Years Resolutions as a shameless merry-go-round of excuses . If January 1st arrives and you 've missed your targets , there 's little sense of failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more powerful about using your age as a measurement of development . <p> " Before I turn 24 , I want to achieve " <p> As opposed to the open-ended , " My New Years Resolution is to " <p> You could be setting the same resolution for the rest of your life , but you 'll never turn 24 again . <p> Most people do n't  need to endure such a rigorous round of annual self-appraisals . But then , most people already have structure to their working lives . It comes in the form of a career ladder . <p> You aim for promotion at 25 , a nice middle-management role at 30 , senior responsibility at 40 and perhaps one day , with fingers crossed and wood touched , a stake in the company at 50 . <p> Your career ladder is placed before you in granite stone . If you have n't climbed sufficient rungs by your next birthday , you 'll choose politics or mismanagement as your justification , backed up by a hope , a prayer , and a promise from the wife that things will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly , but from a personal perspective , I never felt the same pressure to succeed as a 21 year old web developer , that I do as a 24 year old master of my own destiny . I think that 's partly down to having nobody to blame but myself . <p> We love hierarchies of order . For an Internet Marketer , there 's no hierarchy . We can only compare our fortunes with those posting screenshots of their earnings , and the forum members recounting stories of how much I earned today . <p> In a typical job environment , we look at ageing directors and senior managers with fading hairlines as the best representations of what we hope to become . These figureheads are reassuring to anybody with a 9-5 because they remind us that time is still on our side , or more importantly , that experience breeds power . <p> The same comfort does not extend to Internet Marketers , or anybody who runs a business online . <p> We are forced to look to the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world for our perception of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses is simply immense , and we formulate our own hierarchies around these vaunted young entrepreneurs . We want to be like them : rich , famous , powerful . <p> The fact that many of our role models rose out of nowhere to take the world by storm gives us many sleepless nights . The ambitious prodigy in his 9-5 may wish to leap up the career ladder , but its difficult to find examples where the road to success has been travelled at the speed of light , as it is so frequently by Internet millionaires . <p> The jump from office cubicle to directors executive suite is daunting but clearly mapped . We assimilate that time , politics and good fortune will get us there someday , so we are n't  hard on ourselves for the years that go by where nothing seems to happen . <p> For an Internet Marketer , the years that pass without huge success can be crippling to morale . <p> When people like Zuckerberg transcend industries before leaving college , it scrambles our perception of the hierarchy . We no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience and paid their dues ; we associate them with brilliance , innovation and the ability to rise from basement dwelling zeroes to billionaire heroes in the blinking of an eye . <p> The weight of expectation we shoulder by simply knowing what is possible in our industry makes it difficult to measure success in any reasonable manner . <p> In short , we lose access to all the excuses that justify the career ladders predictably slow ascent . <p> Were forced to accept that any mismanagement , politics or glass ceilings are strictly of our own making . <p> The regular reminders that other young entrepreneurs are blowing up billion dollar empires before their 21st birthdays adds even more pressure to our lives . We compare ourselves religiously , and its difficult to keep success in perspective when the scale of achievement is so huge . <p> What kind of career allows for you to double your income on a yearly basis and still feel hopelessly at sea ? I 've tormented myself on many occasions , stargazing at the obscure wealth I know to exist , while resenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even further ahead . <p> These are troubles that are best kept in check by developing a sense of what success means to you as an individual , rather than as an industry average . So when I was setting my new goals yesterday , for the first time in five years , my #1 target did not involve taking over the world . <p> Some might call that a stain on my ambition . <p> " Shoot for the moon , even if you miss , you 'll land among the stars . " <p> Well I fucking hate that quote . <p> Every time I hear it , I feel like offering the dimwit a straight swap with one of the Russian Cosmonauts currently lost in space . Go and see how much they enjoyed missing the moon . <p> Whimsical ambition should never be favoured over realistic , achievable targets . And that 's probably the biggest lesson Ive taken from the last year . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 3 Comments <p> Well said . I have been trying to make it online for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor my small mailing lists . My goal would merely be to make like 2k/month , and i just ca n't make it work . I know how bad one can feel . I sacrificed many years of my life , with the thinking that i did n't  care if i sacrificed a year or 2 if i would make 2-3k/month with an online business that would n't require me to work 9 to 5 , and allowed me the freedom to travel . <p> Well 6 years later , i just turned 30 , and am horrified and shocked that i wasted most all od my 20s for absolutely nothing that i could have had a lot of fun with the most basic of jobs with a low pay , and actually have a life and go out and do stuff and just enjoy life , without working from the time i wake up to the time i go to bed ( or near ) that i couldve done just like everyone else and have been light years more happy and even more wealthy that all i did was for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online , but if i cant do anything within a year or so i do n't  know if i should now waste all my 30s .. ? ( it could be a s possibility if i am too stubborn ) . <p> I wish someone like you , Finch , would spend an afternoon showing me some things first end , so i could get started with even a mere 500/month in revenue . <p> You actually lived the kind of life i always strived for : be in my 20s making some money , having the freedom to travel and just be that 20 something guy enjoy his youth . I respect you for that and wish i had makde it happen before . <p> Olivier I suffered through a couple of barren years before I got my first break in the industry . Its not easy to find the time or motivation to keep chugging away when all efforts seem to be failing . But I guess that 's just part of the love-hate relationship . <p> $500/month in revenue should be well within reach . There are plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably pull in $500/month . Once you get to $500/month , its actually quite easy to scale to $5000 . The big step is going from $5000 to $50,000 . But that said , making the initial breakthrough and finding a sweet spot can be difficult . <p> I think its worth sticking at , although even the big money is never worth putting your life on hold for . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

@@106277731 @1677731/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> If there 's ever a time to show up for work , that time is Monday morning . <p> Whilst most of the world is happy to celebrate Thank God Its Friday , anybody with a role in project management or self-employment is likely to be thinking the opposite , " Where did my week go ? " <p> For that reason , I love Mondays . Its another chance to deliver a flying clothesline to nagging targets , making sure they do n't  live on to become 2017s New Years Resolutions . <p> Monday mornings are doubly important because they set the tone for the rest of the week . <p> Start Monday badly and momentum is a bitch . <p> I 'm ashamed to admit that lazy Mondays have cost me entire weeks in the past . If I start the week drifting aimlessly between tasks of equal importance but little long-term value , morning turns to lunch , and lunch turns to dinner . Before you know it , I 've wasted an entire Monday with nothing but a headache and a sense of underachievement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week playing catch-up . <p> Fortunately , if you start Monday well and make good progress before lunch , momentum conspires to help your cause . Productivity is contagious , but so is flicking from Facebook to YouTube and back again . Momentum can be your best friend or your worst enemy . <p> In affiliate marketing terms , Monday is the day that I launch my new campaigns for the week ahead . Its wheels in motion day . <p> There 's nothing worse than launching on a Friday , waiting an entire weekend for your ads to get approved , then drifting in to a state of nonchalance with new ideas and brainfarts dominating your thoughts by the time they go live . <p> Get campaigns launched on Monday with the view to having them optimised and profitable by Friday . <p> I know a lot of affiliates ponder how long they should continue optimising before scrapping a campaign . Well , Monday to Friday is a nice time-frame . Assuming the ads are live by Tuesday , you have 3 days to accumulate data that should tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready to smash a home-run . <p> Simply launching a campaign and getting your paws on some data provides an excellent momentum boost on Monday morning . You 're committing to positive action . It does n't  stop there though . <p> Creating new ads does not constitute a launched campaign . A campaign is launched when the ads are approved and collecting data . Another guilty trait of mine has been to spend forever researching , eventually launch my ads , and then get declined for whatever reason . Instead of taking another hack at the submission process , I 'd let the campaign rot in the planning stages forevermore . With no data , every idea is a fail . <p> So what 's the opposite of a Monday morning well spent ? <p> In my opinion , that award goes to replying to emails . For the love of the anti-Christ , why do people wreck their morning coffee with this awful practice ? Okay , admittedly , some people are in the business of servicing customers . But the majority of affiliates have no excuses . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day jobs where we did n't  have the luxury ( or Hell ) of using Sunday evenings to clear out our inboxes . <p> I can guarantee that if you make replying to emails your number one priority , you will spend the rest of the day chasing tails and batting off distractions . Its impossible to make any progress that could be deemed worthwhile if you 're wedged firmly up your Gmails arse . <p> More importantly , dealing with emails scrambles your ability to focus on one particular goal , which should always be your intention on Monday morning . <p> Successful affiliates are excellent at spotlighting their biggest goals and putting the most effort in to the most rewarding work . If that means being impossible to reach on the phone , through email and by instant messenger then so be it . Most of us are pretty skilled at living like hermits . Celebrate it . <p> Monday morning is the perfect time to batten down the hatchets , leechblock Facebook , and unleash Father Zen on your most important project .

" I do n't  care if we kill somebody " <p> So , how many affiliates blew their entire January budgets in the casinos at ASW ? For the sake of my own business , I 'd be happy to hear of a busy weekend . <p> Did you learn a lot from the networking experience ? Was the conference worth the trip ? <p> I find it a little strange that affiliates will fork out hundreds of dollars for seminars , key-notes and Q&amp;A sessions when perhaps the biggest inspiration is Vegas itself . <p> If ever you wanted to learn from a well oiled moneymaking machine , you would be advised to tear your head away from the Meet Market and consider the windowless , clockless micro-economy that is Sin City in the middle of the night . <p> Nickycakes wrote a piece several years ago that summed it up well . Vegas is one of the most fitting metaphors for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your pocket , carress the balls , and expose your wallet . All , of course , without shaking the drunken smile from your face . <p> In many ways , Vegas is untouchable as a sales funnel . Not only does it skillfully and rapidly relieve us of our finances , but it does so in a way that we doggedly admire . Somehow , the art of cataclysmically gambling the night away , has been turned in to pop culture that is part of the experience . You go to Vegas expecting to come home lighter than you left , in every sense but the hangover . <p> So how can we improve our own marketing efforts to create the same free spending escapism ? How can we build landing pages as positively badass as The Strip in the dead of night ? <p> Perhaps the best guidance is to determine your goal first . Vegas gives the impression of a city built around a slot machine . From the ground up , it weaves a gigantic web where every road leads back to the desired action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the execution is so consistent . When you get off the plane , make no mistake : Vegas has you now . Opt-outs are hard to come by . The message is loud and clear . <p> How loud and clear is your marketing ? Is your message being scrambled by half-baked execution ? The slightest slip of bad copy , or conflicting calls-to-action , and you 'll suffer the equivalent of daylight pouring through a gorged window in the Palace casino . The user slips away and does n't  look back . <p> Our job when were creating sales funnels is to fully immerse users ; to guide them to a state where we have their full and undivided attention . Once we 've taken away their sense of daylight , their sense of time , their sense of financial good footing , we have to decorate that world with a brighter proposition . Be that an illustration of rapid weight loss , of finding love , or even the freedom of a new career at home ; our job is to channel the force of desire and guide it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I think , as Nick suggested , the pull of Vegas is the claustrophobia : a bombardment of the senses that monetizes your confusion whichever way you turn . <p> Its difficult to recreate the same psychological experience on a web page . Its even more challenging to recreate the justification that stalks you towards the departure gate , ably excusing the $3000 dent in your bank balance , as if it were money well spent . <p> Well , was it ? <p> I hope , for the sake of the affiliates who flew out to ASW on shoestring budgets , that it was a great conference and not simply a Tour De Force in young , rich and infamous binge showboating. 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Make sure you grab a copy of Premium Posts Volume 3 .

@@106277734 @1677734/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> This is a question that lands in my inbox every so often , and rarely does it have a straightforward answer . <p> Monetizing a website is simple if you do n't  care for how much money it makes . <p> How long does it take to slap some Google AdSense in to your sidebar ? About 17 seconds ? Great , then that 's how long it takes to monetize a website . You can now retire rich in the knowledge that you made money from the Internet . <p> But how much will you make ? Will your website ever fulfill its potential ? Or will you spend the rest of your online career waiting by the mailbox for a $50 cheque from Google ? <p> What Ive noticed from speaking to so many webmasters not necessarily affiliates is that monetizing a website is too often treated as a one dimensional affair . The process is rarely attacked from every angle . There 's a tendency to lock in the monetization aspect of a website , and then focus purely on content and backlinks thereafter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of your top priorities . <p> Here are 5 strategies to help you make money from any website in your portfolio , along with some best practice on how to do it well . <h> 1 . Promote products on a per-lead basis <p> Some websites are naturally great matches for CPA offers ( those that payout for a simple lead , no credit card necessary ) . <p> I have several dating related websites in my portfolio . Their primary use is to generate free traffic that can be routed through to CPA offers . One of these websites generates only 100-200 hits per day , but it still makes around $1000/month on auto-pilot . That 's a huge return on investment relative to what would be considered a rather small trickle of traffic . <p> Pros of monetizing by per-lead offers : <p> Your income is likely to be much more predictable promoting pay-per-lead offers rather than pay-per-sale offers . With a low traffic site , you may go through months where you do n't  score a single sale . But if you 're getting paid for something as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of income . Its psychologically crippling to work hard on a site that does n't  seem to convert . Opting for pay-per-lead offers may prove better for your mental health in terms of seeing some immediate results . <p> The ROI is excellent if you find a suitable offer , usually surpassing what is achievable by promoting per-sale offers , or using banner exchange networks . Very few banner exchanges are going to pay you $1000/month for 100 hits per day . <p> Cons of monetizing by per-lead offers : <p> It requires rigorous management . CPA offers go down regularly . To maximise your revenue from promoting them , you have to schedule a weekly check-in to make sure that the offer is still converting . And if it is n't converting well , you need to switch to a new offer . Depending on whether your ads are displaying as banners , or as contextual recommendations similar to my suggestion in Premium Posts Volume 2 , this can sometimes prove difficult . <p> It gets old quick . Many of us build our own websites to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We want to feel that our assets are built on solid foundations , primed to make money passively from now until the end of time . So does it make sense to then monetize those websites with CPA offers the most notorious whorers of time and energy in the industry ? Its a commitment to not-so-passive income . <p> Most CPA offers will only pay for leads from certain countries , whilst most websites draw traffic from all around the world . You will have to show different ads for different countries to get maximum value out of your traffic . This means you will need to have a geo-detection script . OIOPublisher is the best I 've come across so far . <h> 2 . Promote products on a per-sale basis <p> We 've all seen websites littered in ads for the latest Clickbank hype-job . Do they make money ? If there 's enough traffic for keywords with the right buying intentions , then yes they do . They can make a lot of money . <p> So , perhaps you decide to monetize your entire website with banners for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A critical question at this stage would be " Does my website attract users that are going to like this product and be willing to spend money on it ? " If not , this can turn in to one of the least efficient means of monetizing a site . In some cases , you 'll make a rosy $0/month . <p> Of course , pay-per-sale programs extend far beyond the shady realms of Clickbank . You 'll typically find that digital products aside , the most reputable products come attached to the lowest payouts . Amazon is a popular pay-per-sale program . But have you tried paying the mortgage while making 4% on CDs and DVDs ? If this is the only means of monetizing your site , alarm bells should be searing your ears . <p> Pros of monetizing by per-sale offers : <p> If you nail down your targeting , leverage a demographic in buying mode , and have the luck to find a program offering good payout terms and a stable conversion rate it can be both lucrative and long-term , which is the sacred cocktail of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There 's no such thing as a quality score . A sale is a sale , right ? <p> It requires very little management . Products that pay commission by the sale tend to survive much longer than offers from the CPA world . They also present a good bargaining position for the affiliate , who is clearly adding some real-world value to the sales funnel by supplying real-world customers . The question of " Whos Your Daddy ? " is turned on its head . <p> Cons of monetizing by per-sale offers : <p> By the very laws of economics , non-converting users are going to be much more common than those who are happy to bust out Mr. Plastic Fantastic . Are you happy monetizing a tiny segment of your websites core audience ? Do the payment terms make this sacrifice worthwhile ? <p> If your website is built around an obscure niche and there is only one product that you can sell , your situation is just as precarious as the rogue CPA cowboy cloaking Facebook . What happens if the merchant drops its affiliate program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you find yourself hoarding lots of traffic in an unsaturated market is quite simple : build your own product <h> 3 . Launch your own product <p> In my opinion , if a website does n't  have a feasible product that it could sell , its probably a waste of time , or a non-profit venture that is n't suitable for increasing your income . <p> Whether you build a website to promote affiliate offers , reap banner sales or simply monetize via Google AdSense , the reality stays the same . If the website does n't  produce a customer for somebody somewhere , its not going to be worth the hair on my arse . <p> Before building any website , ask yourself " What could I sell on this site ? " If you find yourself struggling for an answer , drop the project ! Its the same question any advertiser will be asking when he stumbles across your page . <p> If he sees no market , you are no more than a webmaster with a hobby a servant to the information age . Either way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would be a complete sucker for hopping over the edge on a whimsical hope and prayer . <p> A suitable product can be anything from an instant download ebook , to a rolling monthly subscription for private forum access , to branded merchandise . Pretty much whatever you can muster the balls to charge for . <p> Pros of monetizing by launching a product : <p> Gain complete control over the direction and future of your product . It can be adjusted to meet the very specific demands of your target demographic , which you define , while psychotically whispering " Whos The Daddy , now ? " and trawling the web for affiliates <p> You control the affiliate equation . Affiliate marketing is an incredibly effective sales model , especially when you are at the head of the chain . How many dating website CEOs do you suppose would spend their time in the trenches learning how to advertise on Plentyoffish cost-effectively ? Not many . But thanks to the art of delegating to small fish like us , they do n't  have to . Plenty of fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will fight hard for a few scraps . When you control that equation , you 'll regain much of the sleep you lost as an affiliate ( aka Guy with the Sore Arse ) . <p> The issue of trust becomes a benefit rather than a constraint . If your websites readers are faithful followers of your regular content , selling a premium product to them is natural progression . Premium Posts have been very successful for me , but that platform was built in the 2 years prior where I was dedicated to churning out decent posts for free . Trust goes a long way if you can resist the urge to exploit it . <p> Cons of monetizing by launching a product : <p> Taking the plunge is hard . Deciding to offer a paid product to your readers requires a certain deal of courage in the relationship you 've built . You do n't  want to be seen as cheap , or trying to make a fast buck from those who gave you a platform to be heard . The pressure to deliver is unmistakeable . A bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 4 . Join an Ad Network <p> Many webmasters opt to hand over the monetizing aspect of their site to banner exchanges and ad networks . Google AdSense is perhaps the most popular of the bunch . But there are many others , far too many for a guy of my attention capacity to list . See here for a comprehensive list . <p> Platforms like AdSense will pay you by the click ( or by impressions ) , which is naturally a smaller slice of the cake than per lead or sale . It may not be the most lucrative method of monetizing a website , but its by far the most hassle-free . The question is simply , " How much money are you missing out on ? " If a third party advertiser is making good hay from your website , why are n't  you ? <p> Pros of monetizing by joining an ad network : <p> There 's very little management involved . Turning your ads over to an ad network pushes the matter about as far out of your hands as any other suggestion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Perhaps , but out of sight and likely out of pocket too . <p> If you have a brilliant brand and a lot of traffic , the likelihood of generating good revenue from ad networks increases tenfold . When your website appeals to a broad and large audience , the volume and consistency of display revenue outmuscles the benefit of using your inventory to promote products whether they are somebody elses or your own . Promoting products is still smart , but as a secondary source of income . <p> If your traffic is low quality and there 's no obvious outlet , its better to have some money than no money . Whether you 're getting paid by CPM or CPC , you will receive more than you would by promoting a questionable product with a 0% conversion rate . When your conversion rate is 0% , the banner networks are a guaranteed improvement . <p> Using an ad network allows you to blame somebody else when an undesirable ad flashes up on your site . <p> Cons of monetizing by joining an ad network : <p> Unless you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain minimal . Its like following a stock index fund , knowing that the index represents the lowest quartile of growth in the market . Its stable and predictable . But for low to mid traffic sites ? The alternatives are usually more profitable . <p> This could happen : <p> If ads stating 1 Weird Trick swarm your site , you could potentially damage the relationship of trust with your readers which is dangerous if you are also selling your own products . Mmm , death by association . <p> Payment terms are not always the best for low traffic sites . If it does n't  take you forever to reach the minimum payout threshold , it will take forever for a bumbling intern accountant to process the bloody cheque . More waiting by the mailbox . <p> Many ad networks want 100% control over your entire inventory and will not deal with other networks on the same page . It makes sense from a business perspective , but it still sucks to be on the losing end of the stick when its your own website. <h> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strategy that is particularly rife across blogs in the affiliate marketing space , this glorious creation included . <p> If you hate the idea of an ad network pocketing a slice of your hard work , or of 1 Weird Trick being slapped across every inch of your hallowed HTML , there is always the option to sell your own ads ( as well as tweets , sponsored posts , paid reviews , daughters , wives and dignity as a whole ) . <p> Pros of monetizing by selling your own banner space : <p> If you run a site in a crowded marketplace where there are a lot of brands fighting for attention and manpoints , auctioning off your ad spots to the highest bidder will nearly always trump the rates achieved through ad networks . You can multiply your CPMs overnight by taking on advertisers of your own finding . <p> Its very easy to do , especially with software like OIOPublisher . Automate the entire process from start to finish and you wo n't spend half your working hours flapping around the inbox sending emails about renewals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close rein on any ads that might be harmful to your brand , or designed to game your very own readers . <p> Cons of monetizing by selling your own banner space : <p> Finding advertisers is not easy if you operate in markets where the majority of product owners would rather use affiliates than buy ad space out of their own pocket unless those affiliates are hot on your heels . Affiliate activity is a good marker of how likely you are to be able to sell your ad spots . Got a dating , bizopp or weight loss themed website ? There 's likely to be strong demand for good quality inventory that ticks these boxes . But if your website is an information portal of the best mahogany rocking chairs from 1954 good luck , happy fishing . <p> Income is variable . Many advertisers love to buy traffic for a month , see how it converts , and then cull where necessary . This means you have to be offering a good deal for the ad spot to be worthwhile ( and if that 's the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result of having lots of advertisers passing through is a lurching income that could be great one month and barren the next . The best way to solve this is to focus on selling your ad spots to brands that are less performance-driven and more perception-orientated . <h> Conclusion : " What 's right for me ? " <p> These five monetization strategies share the quality of being potentially good choices , or very bad choices , depending on the situation and the mechanics of the website you 're trying to monetize . <p> There 's no reason to suggest you should only use one method .

@@106277735 @1677735/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Last week , iPyxels Tom Fang kindly dropped his POF 7-Day Mastery Guide in to my inbox . Being a regular advertiser on Plentyoffish , I busted out my sponge , and set about soaking up his advice in the hope that itd be somewhat different to my usual tricks and shenanigans , a few of which I framed for mass consumption in Premium Posts Volume 1 . <p> Well , it was certainly different . Not a reference to my balls in sight . <p> Heres iPyxels breakdown of the content included . <p> Mass production of ads <p> Approaching broad vs. niche traffic <p> Tracking methodology and managing campaigns en mass <p> How to target and split test properly <p> Building long term campaigns by mitigating burnout <p> Detailed explanations of POF nuances <p> The POF 7-Day Mastery Guide takes a step away from addressing specific campaign ideas . You wo n't find case studies or ready-made banners to be stolen . Tom makes it perfectly clear that the creative process is not his bread and butter . He even surrenders that many buyers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money than he does . <p> That 's a tour de force in self-deprecation , although probably a confession hell want to disown if the Warrior Forum pounces on the product . <p> What the 7-Day Mastery Guide really homes in on is the development of systems , algorithms and cold-blooded ruthlessness in the way that you create , manage and cull your campaigns . <p> Unlike Tom , I am not a numbers man . I find it difficult to launch dozens of tightly targeted , flawlessly labelled campaigns , while tracking the entire process through Excel and running figures of continue/pause in my brain . But that 's not to say that I should n't make the effort to embrace his approach . <p> If Premium Posts Volume 1 sought to gun down some of the psychology that lurks behind a successful ad , the POF 7-Day Mastery Guide is a structured and highly organized manifesto for getting profitable as soon as possible , while losing the least amount of cash . <p> Throughout the guide , Tom keeps his core principles of sustainability and scalability close to every tidbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are guilty of sacrificing these qualities in the frantic search for profitability , so its definitely a mindset that should be taken onboard . <p> The information is broken in to 7 sections , with one for each day of the week . Knowing how proactive most affiliates can be , I 'd have been tempted to lower my expectations and call it a 7-Month guide , but alas . <p> The systems Tom endorses will almost certainly require a grand rethink in how you organize your campaigns . For example , after logging in to your account , what would you think if your campaigns were suddenly titled like this : <p> **29;66;TOOLONG <p> I 'd probably assume that I was having a stroke . But this is actually a hallmark of Toms immensely structured approach to his advertising . Campaign titles are decoded in to stone-dead giveaways of the targeting that lays inside , assuming you have n't lost the wall chart . And as for the targeting ? I found Toms insight in to compartmentalizing campaigns to be some of the best in the guide . <p> He explains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great detail , refusing to settle for that annoying nugget of faux wisdom " users with login counts below 100 are golden , only target them " , as so many fall in to the trap of believing . There are some great tips for sustaining campaigns over long periods of time . <p> Tom once again resorts to mathematics to explain why campaigns adjusted to higher login counts need to be different from those going after the new fish . This is where his methodology for creating systems really shines through . Whilst most of us are busy judging POF users as either in or out of a target group , Tom stalks the users from cog to cog in his system . The guide shows , very effectively , how to maximize your chances of a conversion via layered targeting . <p> For experienced POF marketers , particularly those like myself who operate by instinctive catapultations of shite at the wall , Toms adherence to structure will get you thinking about how you can operate your own campaigns more efficiently . <p> I doubt that many marketers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own POF systems , and much of the information could be repackaged for traffic sources like Facebook where it would be equally relevant . <p> That 's not to say I 'm a glowing advocate of every theory preached in this guide . Toms argument that 100 campaigns consistently making $5/day are better than one making $500/day has been used to divide affiliate marketers for years . <p> I fall in to the category that would much rather manage a single $500/day campaign , than spend my afternoon plugging tiny holes in tiny $5 campaigns . That 's just too much micro-management for my taste . <p> I also disagree fundamentally with one of the guides earlier suggestions that advertising to young men is easier than mature women . But I will avoid kicking up a fuss , blessed in the knowledge that this guide is likely to be consumed by a legion of Warriors who will follow that pointer to a tee . <p> As far as the quality of writing goes , I 'd like to thank Tom for releasing an ebook that is readable , eloquent and a distinct improvement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me gouging out my own eyeballs in disgust . Presentation is one of the areas where my own Premium Posts are in sore need of improvement , so I 'll be taking a page out of Toms book here . Literally . Sccchwipe . <p> All in all , I would recommend the 7-Day Mastery Guide to beginners and intermediates on the POF platform . Its not flowing with campaign ideas , but then it does n't  need to be . This is a practical , comprehensive and immaculate presentation on how to get your house in order . It will bring structure to your campaigns while focusing your mind on sustainability and scalability , the only qualities that really matter . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Check out the iPyxel blog for some free tips and pointers to go along with the POF Mastery Guide . <p> My own detailed assault on monetizing Plentyoffish is covered in Volumes 1 and 3 of Premium Posts , which have both received widespread praise .

I really appreciate you sticking to your chops and giving a clearly 100% unbiased honest review . Wouldnt want to change a word of it . <p> Finch and I have relatively different approaches to POF . That 's why I think the guide and the Premium Posts , especially Volume 1 , complement each other extremely well . You are getting an overdose of both sides : marketing techniques and holistic systematic framework , between the 2 . <p> I hope to promote Premium Posts more often myself . Its easy when you believe in the value . <p> i meant to buy this the other day but just did n't  have time to read it .. i definitely need better tracking and organization of pof campaigns . good review and i see myself falling into the 7 months vs. 7 days type of affiliate but maybe this will light a fire under me. 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277736 @1677736/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I recently registered with Volusion to setup my own commerce store at FinchPremiums.com . Ive been experimenting with the software for 2 weeks now , and I 'm impressed at how many bases theyve managed to cover . If you sell products online or offline Volusion is a powerful beast that deserves a closer look . <p> If nothing else , its certainly a step up from E-Junkie . <h> Volusion : The Basics <p> Volusion simplifies the process of running an online store . Its branded as the definitive all-in-one ecommerce solution , boasting 24/7 support , and over 35,000 active websites currently using the software . <p> Volusion looks mighty fine in the presentation stakes . Its sleek and professional . The product listings , checkout process and homepage are distinctly un-Clickbank , which is always a good thing in my book . <p> You can choose to install one of the many existing design templates , or hack it together yourself . I got lucky with one of the ready-made templates being a perfect match for what I was looking to achieve . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PayPal , Google Checkout , wire transfers , electronic cheques , money orders and straight up cash ( seriously , how many online stores accept a fistful of dollars these days ? ) . <p> You can also apply for a merchant account to handle credit and debit card transactions in-house . While I do like the idea of a one-page checkout , I do n't  hate Paypal enough to want to go through the ball ache of setting up a merchant account . Horses for courses , right ? <h> Why I 'm a Fan <p> Before using Volusion , I had been selling my products via a rather primitive Add to Cart button on your typical WordPress page . There are three features I wanted that required ugly hacks to mesh with the E-Junkie shopping cart : coupon codes , Facebook integration and an efficient affiliate program . <p> Coupon codes are easy to setup with Volusion . You can set as many codes as you want , and they look far less jarring than they did with E-Junkie . Previously I would be forced to ask the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking any checkout button . This led to many customers bailing on a purchase because they could n't find a coupon code and did n't  want to miss out on a deal . Not a problem with Volusion . <p> The Volusion affiliate program is a must-have for anybody like myself who relies on word-of-mouth buzz to promote his products . Affiliates can sign up and receive a fixed % commission , or a specific payout set at the product level . If you have super affiliates , you can reward them Amazon-stylio by ramping up their commission for extra sales delivered . Very nice , very sleek and very easy to manage . <p> Volusion is also nicely prepared to jump on future trends . There is complete integration with Facebook , the ability to set Daily Deals , and even the option to run your own rewards scheme . Some of the more visual features , like bestselling lists and featured products , can be added in the space of about 5 seconds using the many fully customisable widgets . <p> I have n't immersed myself in these features yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like excellent tools for increasing sales . Arguably Volusions greatest selling point is how effectively it presents your products , and how easily it let 's you promote them . <p> If you have a great idea , there 's every chance you can execute it within the hour thanks to the huge array of features Volusion packs in ; many of which are likely to sit dormant for months until a sudden brainfart alerts you to their potential . <h> The Packages <p> Behold : <p> Click to enlarge . <h> Problems Ive Encountered <p> I expect I will get to grip with the following grievances as the software becomes more familiar . But that leaves a question mark hanging over the learning curve . How long does it take to get to grip with Volusion ? I think you 'll need at least a week to learn this thing inside out . Even then , you 'll still be finding new functionality hidden four menus deep . <p> Some problems Ive noted : <p> Shipping has been behaving randomly . <p> Perhaps the biggest problem one that I 'm still in conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get lost in the shuffle . I 've had to send several customers their purchases manually . It would be mighty foolish to expect all orders to come in through 9-5 BST , especially with customers scattered all around the world , so I 'd like this to be automated and foolproof ASAP . <p> Im told that the issue is now fixed . Fingers and bollocks crossed . <p> Too many options ? <p> I understand the need for flexibility on an ecommerce platform , and I 'm admittedly biased from the viewpoint of a guy who only wants to sling his digital products . However , the number of options to get your head around in the configuration process may prove slightly overwhelming if you 're not a numbers man . <p> Just to add a product to the store , there are no less than 121 fields begging for your attention . Do they all merit the inclusion ? It depends what you 're selling , but I 've left a good 80% of my options empty . <p> If you 're buying Volusion with the sole intention of selling digital products , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant to your business , and yet you will still need to comb over it in case you miss something important . <p> Volusion could perhaps benefit from a modular approach . " Will I be shipping physical products ? " If the answer is no , disable these four million extra options and Finch will stop drowning his neighbours kittens in dismay . <h> So , Volusion : Worth The Investment ? <p> I shudder to imagine how many sales I lost with E-Junkies clunky interface and lack of marketing features . Volusion is exactly the opposite , and I 'm optimistic that itll make a positive impact on my bottom line . <p> All things considered , the price is outstanding . I 've started on the Bronze Package which is paid for with a single sale of my Premium Posts . <p> You can take a 14 day trial to setup your entire store on a demo server . Throughout the process , I 've found the support team to be highly responsive and well worth their salt with the " Were here 24/7 " claims . I 've had answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket . And I 've been submitting a lot of tickets . <p> If you like what you see , upgrading to a paid package and putting the site live is relatively pain-free . It took me 5 days to go from a completed demo site to the public launch . A little longer than I expected , but worth it in the end . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 7 Comments <p> Thanks for this !

As always , further updates will be provided as they become available . <p> Hello , Thanks for a review , it was very interesting to use . However , in the last few months Volusion had serious troubles with their servers . They went down several times and it was a real disaster . Moreover , you wo n't probably find any positive feedback about their support ( in 2012 ) . I would really suggest to consider 3DCart or BigCommerce . For more check this review that outlines all the pros and cons of these shopping carts . <p> One thing that Volusion does n't  do well or at all they say that they can process GST for Australian users , but in fact their calculation is wrong .

@@106277738 @1677738/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> If a business is centered around your individual talents , the need for good time management should be as obvious as a slap in the face . Running a business as the solo brains can be a grueling ordeal at the best of times . It becomes a nightmare if you are guilty of mismanaging time . <p> How often do you use time as an excuse for failing to meet the targets you set for yourself ? Anybody who uses the phrase " there simply are n't  enough hours in the day " needs to realise that time is always at their disposal , and the only thing lacking is personal drive . Yes , even for those with four kids , demanding wives and multiple jobs . Good time management backed by decisive action is an unstoppable recipe for success . <p> I have dozens of websites in my portfolio . Some are fully realised and highly successful , others are half baked , while the rest resemble hilariously ill-conceived brainfarts that never should have seen the light of a GoDaddy domain checkout cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the best ideas , but in the purest sense , they 're simply the areas you chose to spend your most valuable time . If you 're spending all your time on websites that have reached their peak and still do n't  provide the monetary return you need to run a successful business , you 're stumping your own growth . <p> I only started making money online when I established that the correlation between websites I enjoyed building , and websites I made money from , was n't as strong as I first imagined . While you should always pursue your passions and aim for something genuine ( it gives you a competitive advantage over the majority of Internet Marketers ) , you have to balance your time accordingly and work where the money is . <p> The biggest time management mistake , in my opinion , is the tendency to overestimate how long a task will require through to completion . <p> Before I grasped the error of my ways , I would assign myself task lists that looked like this : <p> Now , what is wrong with that schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to neat hourly chunks , but it would be foolish to do so . I would typically spend longer than an hour writing the blog post . But my " social bookmarking " spree would spiral in to 25 minutes of bitching on Twitter over nothing in particular . My schedule suggested that 30 minutes was necessary , and my attitude made it so . <p> You will naturally increase how long each task takes if you assign a longer time frame than is necessary . Doing so invites the draining twin sisters of procrastination and indecision in to your day . Work to a tighter deadline and you will often get a job done to the same quality in shorter time . <p> Deadlines are often seen in a negative light . They loom on the horizon as threatening confirmations of failure . But enormous power goes to the entrepreneur who can use the power of deadlines to control all he needs to be . I believe deadlines should be worshipped as the necessary milestones for turning our best kept ideas in to something physical . <p> In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to reach our goals , we are using perfect logic . You can often find a great sense of clarity and expectation by scribbling what it is that you have to do . Your brain never betrays you . The steps you write are typically accurate blueprint plans for creating the success you desire . Its the refusal to set a deadline that stops the plan from coming to fruition . <p> If your office storage is anything like mine , you already have a notepad tucked away somewhere with a foolproof idea worth millions of dollars . The moment you confined it to the back of your memory by refusing to set a deadline , you said goodbye to those riches . For your best planned ideas to be worth more than the paper they 're written on , they need to be set in to action with a definitive deadline . <p> Surely deep down , you understand that great achievers are never found guilty of underestimating what they can achieve in an hours work . If you spend day after day sending your brain in to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenting on articles , how do you expect it to develop a winning mentality that aspires to be more than just a slave labourer ? <p> But , I hear you say , those small stupor-inducing tasks add up . We need to build backlinks for our websites , and we need to share updates over Twitter . And I cant deny that its often necessary , but it should never be the backbone of your working day . Making it so is time management gone severely wrong . <p> People forget how the skill of managing time encompasses more than simply assigning scheduling tasks . It also means delegating or outsourcing the simple work . Anything that distracts you from being the creative and innovative brains at the helm of your business is a burden you should do without . <p> Likewise , cluttered to-do lists are a sign of poorly planned scheduling and short term thinking . A stressed looking businessman with seventeen items on his to-do list usually only has himself to blame . Half of those items should have been done yesterday , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks is the best way to ensure you 're left feeling unsatisfied at the end of the day , and unmotivated throughout it . <p> When allowed to degenerate , poor time management becomes a vicious cycle . We create new problems and then burden ourselves with enormous stress by losing the clarity of our original plans . <p> Many entrepreneurs persistently undervalue their time and by doing so , fail to realise the true potential of their businesses . It may start with a notepad scribble , but all achievement has to be nursed through deadlines and bouts of self-discipline . <p> Being too busy for a moment of inspiration could turn in to your million dollar mistake . 114274 @qwx974274 114272 @qwx974272 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277739 @1677739/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Three years ago , when I was still coming to terms with the good , the bad and the ugly in our industry , I had a brainsurge . I saw a campaign opportunity that would take upselling to the next level . It was perhaps the lowest I 've stooped as an affiliate marketer , which coincided quite predictably with the best ROI Ive seen to date . <p> The theme was simple . <p> I was to design a New Years Resolution flog . An epic landing page linking the most cited resolutions to some simple crazy tips , and a juicy affiliate offer that would cash in on each desire . <p> " Find out how I achieved these seven CRAZY New Years Resolutions in 2009 " <p> Written , of course , from the perspective of a frighteningly ordinary ( and now incredibly successful ) Every Joe Average . The flog took the seven most obvious New Years Resolutions and wove them in to a story of remarkable achievement . My character had been down on his luck at the end of 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To do so , he set not one but seven New Years Resolutions . <p> 1 . To lose weight 2 . To improve his income 3 . To find love 4 . To improve fitness 5 . To quit smoking 6 . To quit drinking 7 . To learn something new <p> The flog explained how with the help of a few unusual tips ( the more unusual the better , trust me ) and some relatively unknown products he succeeded in making the last year the best of his life the launch pad to enormous success . His resolution this year is to share the success story ; to reveal to a select few the secret products that helped him , and of course , to spread a little festive cheer . <p> The beauty of New Years Resolutions is self-explanatory . They read like a list of bestselling affiliate offers . I did n't  find it difficult to match any of the resolutions to a suitable affiliate offer . If you 're wondering , learn something new was crowbarred in to a pitch for the various Rocket Language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ClickWank , but if there 's ever a time to push one of their links , its on the sixth upsell . Just do n't  make a habit of it . <p> With a little tinkering , what I had on my hands was the grandaddy of all flogs albeit one that would be profitable for only a short period of time . Pretty much all New Years Resolution traffic was fair game , since 90% of the users were going to associate themselves with at least one of the resolutions . It was the making of my wettest dreams , and the ROI was insane . <p> As the months have passed , Ive become much more conservative ; in all walks of life , but particularly where risque moneymaking schemes like this are concerned . I do n't  wish to take the moral high ground affiliates can choose to focus their businesses where they see fit . Its none of my business . But I do n't  plan to roll out a 2011 take on the New Years Resolution flog , which is why Im happy to post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will run wild with such a campaign on the Adsonars and Pulse360s of the world . But it does n't  have to be scandalous . You do n't  have to sling 7 different fragrances of the same bullshit in scumbag flogging style . You can use the New Years Resolution angle to improve just about any sales funnel . <p> Now is the perfect time to give your landing pages a face-lift with some hard selling copy ; the type that appeals to the resolution setting nature of your users . Its not hard to see how dating can be assaulted from a make this a better year angle . The same for weight loss , bizopps and especially those offers related to going back to school . <p> Christ , its the only time in the year where the masses are searching for the shit we spend half our working hours trying to convince them they need ! <p> Do n't  miss out on the New Years Resolution madness .

While I took a big hit when I decided to stop slinging them , I 've stabilized my business with offers that I 'm not too guilty to talk about when somebody asks me " so what do you actually sell for a living ? " . We 've all got ta have values as affiliates . I made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backtracking to make sure I do things in a way that is n't going to end in a lawsuit . <p> That said , I 'm thinking of dipping back in to the rebill market . I miss the sweet ca-ching of another $35 being credited to my account when I refresh the page . I do n't  want to touch another Google bizopp . And I 'm definitely not slinging an acai berry supplement having actually bought a bottle of the damn thing from Marks &amp; Spencers the other day . What was I thinking ? Ive been doing this shit so long , I 've sabotaged my own shopping habits . <p> So , I 've been signing up to various obscure networks in the hope that I 'd find an exclusive offer . Something that inspires me to crack open Adwords . The trouble is , a lot of the offers that I 'd like to promotedont exist . <p> I 've spoken to a couple of networks about pitching a variety of new products to the advertisers . This is an open plea to any advertiser who happens to be reading . The offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rebill <p> I cant believe there 's no sign of this on any of the major networks . If you asked the UK smoking population to name one habit theyd love to kick , its probably going to be the smoking . There 's a HUGE demand for giving up cigarettes and as we all know , a rebill works best when it appeals to the desperate nature of a poor helpless mope with nowhere else to turn . <p> The concept it simple . If a $39.95 monthly rebill does n't  shock you in to kicking the habit , the $19.95 upsell certainly will . If you do n't  kick that habit within 15 days , were gon na rebill your ass so hard that you 'll be puffing sweet nicotine forgiveness for the rest of your life . <p> In all seriousness , why isnt there an offer ? I can think of a million keywords that would convert . I 'm practically salivating when I think of all those dating websites that list " smoker/non smoker " as an option . <p> Just imagine the upsells . If you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they want to live a healthier life . They probably want to restore some youth along the way , right ? Christ , I bet that ass is ridden in cellulite . <p> A little persuasive " offer-shotgunning " ( that 's a double barrel hit ) , and you could have this desperate mope eating supplements for breakfast . My ethics are escaping me fast here . But you get the idea . I 'm not suggesting for an instant that we , the affiliate marketing masses , would resort to such mindless aggressive marketing but its easy to see how this niche market could be jacked up and turned in to a multi-billion sunlounger fetcher for some deep pocketed son of a bitch advertiser . <p> Quality products delivered by quality advertisers <p> Now , about those ethics . I honestly do believe that most rebills are a joke . Consumers have every right to feel ripped off by some of the products that I see shoved in to my weekly newsletter . <p> I do n't  have a problem with the weight loss vertical , or colon cleansing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry needs is a bunch of advertisers with products that deliver the goods . Or more importantly , products that justify their monthly rebilling structure . We have some of the best marketers in the business making hundreds of thousands of dollars . Just imagine how well theyd perform if you gave them something to work with . <p> The Google bizopp is a prime example of a product that has no rebill value . Have you looked at the inside of these " cash kits " ? I have . Pretty much everything that you see on day one , is what you will see when the merchant processes your next charge . <p> Likewise , I do n't  think a Google bizopp is the end of the world . As a concept , its perfectly legit . People really DO make money on Google . But if you 're going to sling a rebill without the General Attorney baying for your bacon , you need to justify that recurring charge somehow . Give the product some accumulating monthly value . Even if its just staggered delivery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept a $15 payout on an offer that does n't  generate a firestorm of bad press and converts better as a result . <p> This is all nice to talk about . But the reality is that too many people are filling their pockets with money for there to be the significant changes that would be required . Unless , of course , drastic legal action says otherwise . <p> Tutoring style rebills <p> I 'd love to see some rebills that are n't  designed to cater for a ) the dumb , b ) the vain or c ) Middle Class America . <p> Let 's be honest . The last time you sat down to do a character assessment of the target market for your newest rebill did you really branch beyond those characteristics ? Yet the problem with appealing to these people is that they also happen to be some of the most indecisive motherfuckers walking the land . They want to lose weight one day , and they 're stuffing their faces the next . <p> I 'd like to see some rebills designed for people who are genuinely committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of people out there are looking to learn an instrument and theyd probably pay for lessons to do so , in fact I know they do . One of my friends charges +-25/hour to teach guitar . He books them in for a lesson every week . <p> If an advertiser could structure a good online program , providing additional content every month , you 'd have a rebill that was perfectly justifiable and maybe just maybe I 'd feel like less of an asshole when I went to sleep at night . <p> What about learning a language ? A self help program that " slowburns " over time ? There are so many concepts that would sell , that do n't  have to be about popping pills and posting links online . These are markets that while profitable in 2009 , will ultimately , in my opinion , be found out over time . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> video professor kills a section of the tutoring vertical ( computers ) someone needs to take their model and apply it to school , math , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ive seen @ 65$ direct ) <p> You 're in danger of growing a conscience Finch , knock it out of you .

@@106277741 @1677741/ <p> Every now and then , an email lands in my inbox about the upcoming release of a hot new product that 's going to take the Affiliate Marketing world by storm . Very rarely do I bother to read beyond the first paragraph . <p> A couple of weeks ago , Robert from CPVLab.com emailed me about advertising his recently launched software for PPV marketers . I did n't  pay much attention at the time . It was only a week later when other reviews started to spread that my little rabbit ears stood up and took notice . <p> " Game changer " , " Prosper killer " , " A PPV marketers wet dream " hold on , I thought . It sounds like CPV Lab might actually be worth investing some hours in to researching after all . Well thank god I did , because this really is a donkey savage beast of a software release . I do n't  think " game changer " even does it justice . CPV Lab just widened the goal posts for a whole new wave of PPV marketers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tagged with my affiliate link , I can honestly tell you that the product itself is bullshit free . <p> You might not believe me now , but when you see this bad boy in action , I 'm pretty much certain you 're going to share the vision . The potential of this thing is fucking nuts . <h> What Is CPV Lab ? <p> CPV Lab is designed to help you track and optimize your PPV campaigns . Its billed as an advanced analytics platform and that 's exactly what it is . Many of you will be familiar with Prosper202 . The Prosper tracking platform is a fine solution but it also comes with limitations . Where you struggled to get it to do exactly what you wanted in the past , CPV Lab just clicks in to gear without breaking a sweat . <p> In fact , CPV Lab comes gift wrapped with a bow tie that says " Hello sweet affiliate , wo n't you make some money with me ? " The software is clearly developed with our very specific needs as affiliates in mind . It boasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . But its also laced with useful tools that can be tweaked to act like an artificial intelligence for affiliates . I 'll get on to those tools later . <p> Split testing is critical to the success of any campaign . CPV Lab is so flexible that if you so wished , you could compare the performance of a direct linked campaign with 3 separate landing pages . If you wanted to go further , you could choose to test three separate offers with each variation of the landing page . Or as many as you like . The software automatically adds the next variable in to the loop and distributes your traffic evenly . <p> This is a nice touch , but without flexible reporting , it just makes your life a lot harder . Well that 's why CPV Lab is such a beast of a creation because it tracks every single variation , every single time in every single way . Once your tracking pixel is added , even the primal newbie art of chucking shit at the wall stands a chance of succeeding . Each landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how your PPV targets are performing on that particular variation . <p> We 've all been left with the bitter taste of " Oh I could probably make money here , if I just knew which part of the process was failing me " But if you cant pinpoint where you 're leaking the cash , its a case of another PPV campaign bites the dust . CPV Lab sniffs and scratches under the surface . If there 's a part of your campaign that 's profitable , it will find it . <h> How Is CPV Lab Going To Help Me ? <p> I do n't  think many affiliates truly appreciate the importance of tracking , and tracking well . Its possible to optimize campaigns based on instinct alone . But with the sheer depth of the reporting on offer in CPV Lab , you really would be a fool not to get your feet wet here . <p> CPV Lab is capable of tracking every last keyword/URL target in your campaign . It will track the targets individually PER variation of landing page ( or direct linked if that 's your style ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defying logic , certain keywords convert better on your red landing page . While other URL targets work particularly well on a direct linked offer . Optimizing the results of your testing has never been this easy . <p> Another of my favourite features is the ability to track the future conversions of an email opt-in campaign . I wont go in to the specifics here because its a niche need , but watch the video demo of CPV Lab and you will understand exactly how flexible this tool is . <p> I mentioned " artificial affiliate intelligence " . You 're probably wondering what I 've been smoking on this Friday night so allow me to explain . CPV Lab has an additional optimization screen with your targets laid out and a marker next to each . Those markers are " Winner In Progress To Remove " . <p> If you 're worried about wasting $50 on a target and receiving zero conversions , you can use CPV Lab to set alerts that will inform you whenever a target receives what you deem to be a sensible number of views without registering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and add " www.google.com " as one of your target URLs . If you go to sleep , you 're going to wake up in the morning having rinsed your entire budget on one target . You 're probably going to be pissed off . Using CPV Lab , you can set criteria for a " To Remove " target . <p> So if a URL receives 100 views but does n't  produce a single conversion , an alert will pop up on your desktop and you can safely remove the target before you waste your entire budget . <p> Unfortunately the alert application is only available on Windows . I use a Mac so FML , but enjoy yours . It will probably save you a lot of money . <p> Another brilliant feature destined to make you money is the reporting PER HOUR on your campaigns . Its possible to see the hours where you were profitable against those where you took a loss . This feature alone is priceless . Those marketing in the dating vertical should be well aware of the variation in conversion rates at different times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try week-parting instead . Its possible to view your campaign performance by day too . <p> I could go on for hours about the feature-rich intricacies of CPV Lab . But you really need to watch the video demonstration to see what I 'm talking about . I promise that those 30 minutes will be some of the best invested of your month if you 're a PPV marketer . <h> How Does It Hold Up Under Strain ? <p> Its all hunky dory to have a tracking platform that looks and acts like the dogs bollocks . But if it ca n't handle the strain of scaling to track hundreds of thousands of clicks per day , its not much good to you . I 'm aware of this , and I 'd love to be able to say that " YES , it handles intergalactic oodles of visitors and does n't  budge an inch " . But I have n't personally pushed it to its limits . <p> I will say that Ive been very impressed so far with the accuracy of the reporting . Clicks in CPV Lab translate to clicks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an improvement on one of the things I hated about tracking with Prosper . <p> The application is self-hosted so depending on your usage , I would advise you load this beast on to a dedicated server if you intend to pummel it . Or at the very least , go virtual dedicated . Theres zero sense in having a sophisticated analytics machine if its going to break down in minutes on your Baby Host Gator plan . <h> CPV Lab Pricing &amp; Availability <p> CPV Lab is currently on the market at $297 . Rob has mentioned that the price will rise in the following months . That 's not a sales pitch masked with urgency , but rather an indication of the ongoing development . The CPV Lab guys are looking to roll out new modules in the future that I 'd imagine will open it up to more than just PPV marketing . That 's not to say you cant " adapt " it already . <p> $297 is a bargain price . I do n't  have any vouchers or coupons for you . And you know why ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shit , I 'm going to assume that you have the intelligence to know what 's important to you as a PPV marketer . When you see what CPV Lab has to offer , I 'm going to bet that you 'll head straight over there and cough up the money like I did . Its still too early to say , but this is about as close to a " game changer " as I 've seen in the last twelve months . <h> One Comment <p> advanced campaign setups . Do n't  believe me ?

@@106277742 @1677742/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> How many people saw the clip of Alessio Rastani brashly predicting the markets would crash ? The video turned Rastani in to an overnight Internet sensation , a banker with the balls to confess to his inglorious disregard for everybody elses money . <p> The video should be taken with a pinch of salt . Rastani has just as much to gain from outing himself as every other banker has in operating quietly . But hidden in the scaremongering is a beautiful little snippet of advice for any hustler , any affiliate with the initiative to make some money when the economy cracks again . <p> " We do n't  really care that much about how they 're going to fix the economy , our job is to make money from it . " <p> " If you have the right plan set up , you can make a lot of money from this . " <p> These are words of encouragement that should ring out to any readers who enjoyed the bizopp boom of 2008 . <p> I enjoyed my first break in affiliate marketing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a keyboard and some web hosting could have copied and many did . <p> When people are fearing for their jobs , and when the mortgage walls are closing in , the opportunity to make easy money and become self-sufficient is even harder to resist . <p> Who would n't want to get rich posting links on Google ? Who would n't want to earn $693/day by clicking a button and counting the profit ? <p> Affiliates , blessed with the flexibility of changing business strategies overnight , swept to meet this demand and banked millions of dollars . In the news , and in the papers , all you would see was doom and gloom . More jobs lost , more disaster predicted and even greater incentives for affiliates to leverage in to their landing pages . <p> Now , admittedly , the products that were rushed on to the market to meet that rising demand were flimsy at best . Anybody promoting them was likely to wake up richer , but in a bed that smelt distinctly unlike roses . <p> There 's another reason why we should be optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they start to feel the crunch ? They go online ! Instead of spending money willy-fucking-nilly like a single mum of six on benefits ( fuck you all , maggots of the state ) , they actually have to think about their purchases . That means our chances of courting such transactions are massively improved . <p> Any economic disaster is likely to be devastating to high street shops , or for intricately designed businesses operating on wafer thin margins . But in our industry , the margins are apple pie deep . We can sell products globally and move towards the money in a blinking of the eyelid . The flexible will survive . The smart and flexible will thrive . <p> Alessio Rastani has copped a lot of jealousy-driven YouTube comments from the proletarians of society . Those who feel eternally battered in to submission by bankers and giant corporations , despite their own mindless devotion to the very entities they claim to hate . <p> Image jacked From Sean Powl on Facebook . Cheers ! <p> But what Rastani says is absolutely true , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be his real agenda , very similar to the Warrior Forum pyramid ) . <p> A downward market is brilliant for entrepreneurs and innovative minds . <p> Fear is the incentive to end all , and as we know , every single commission you 've ever received was registered for no other reason than because the incentive was great enough . Why shouldnt we be pissing our pants in excitement at the idea of fear sweeping in to households around the world ? <p> When society feels beaten down in to submission , the little hand offering escapism is worth more than ever . As affiliates , we often find ourselves charged with convincing users to behave as we want them . The task becomes much easier when indifference is replaced with fear , insecurity and a constant desire to change . <p> I certainly wont be sobbing if the markets crash , or if fear sweeps the nation . If I were you , I 'd be preparing for the worst and getting ready to deliver that escapism . If the worst comes to be , escapism will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already checked out my $27.95 Premium Posts , the power of these balls compels you to do so immediately . If you 're a Plentyoffish affiliate , or a dating affiliate in general , there 's a lot of info to be grabbed inside . Sceptical about the quality ? Google it and sniff out the feedback . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 16 Comments <p> Why do affiliates and many entrepreneurs have to be so self-centered ? All about themselves ? Even though certain trends and certain times in the economy provide greater opportunity for us , there is no need to go out and say that " wed love for the economy to tank " . Does anyone in this business have any feeling for anyone other than themselves ? I watched that video a few weeks back that guy is a total twat . Some things are best left unsaid . <p> Its self centered , I agree . But its true . A bad economy provides some of the best opportunities for entrepreneurs . <p> I 'm not going to will the markets to collapse , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The markets are inevitably going to collapse . They 're built on a culture of greed and individual irresponsibility that is n't sustainable anymore . <p> The only question is how people actually respond to the challenges ahead . <p> They can play the blame game , protesting in streets for change that they barely know the meaning of or they can teach themselves a lesson in self-sufficiency . Self-sufficiency does n't  have to be affiliate marketing , entrepreneurshipor whatever . In my mind , it simply means not spending money that you do n't  have . A crime for which most of our greedy society is guilty . <p> Yeah , I agree . There is always a huge opportunity for anyone , yet nearly no one does anything ( but complain ) . I am still unsure why so many people do nothing . But that does n't  mean we need to criticize them or wish for worse . Let them live their lives like that if that is what they want . Even with the state of the economy now , there is tons of money to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our focus should be helping people , not wishing them hell . People who are praying for a financial meltdown are self-centered , arrogant assholes . The meltdown is already occurring , we are already making loads of money , why wish people worse ? Like I said , some things are better left unsaid . <p> Patrick " If I see an opportunity to make money I go with that " . There are other businesses that flourish in a bad economy ( Rental agents , dollar stores , walmart , etc . ) I feel like the point of this article is stating that you should turn a bad economy into something good for yourself . I have plenty of care for the worldbut I still need food &amp; a roof . <p> @Patrick I understand what you 're saying , but I think you 're basing my view on the title rather than the content of the post . Its not that I 'm willing a financial meltdown because you 're right , there are a lot of hard working individuals who would be affected that do n't  deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable . Its unavoidable , and in my opinion , a lot of individuals deserve very little sympathy if the sudden dawn of austerity forces them to stop spending money they never had . <p> I understand the humanitarian argument that we should never wish doom on the world , but this post has absolutely nothing compared to the gigantic media machines that print newspapers by the million to encourage fear in the masses . Again , that 's unavoidable . All I 'm saying is that we should collectively stop shaking with fear , stop listening to the hysteria in the press of " jobs lost , futures ruined " , and actually do something ourselves about preparing for the worst and being ready to monetize our own businesses . <p> @Justins VA A financial meltdown affects everybody , but not everybody has to be affected for the worse . <p> Monetizing your business through financial meltdowns are not a bad thing ! Think of all the people enrolled into higher education courses due to affiliate marketers putting education campaigns in front of them at the right time . Although affiliates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a win win situation as the users that filled out the lead forms and enrolled into the schools that contacted them now have added value to themselves through higher education . <p> The problem , at least to me , is not that you are advocating monetizing economic downturns or crises . Its how some would suggest we do so . Like you say , people are more likely to be looking for " escapism " when things are shitty . But this is a very general term . If you 're offering this escapism through garbage bizopps that will do nothing but make peoples lives even worse , then you are just selfishly exploiting the situation . True its their own fault for being stupid , but the blame does n't  fall entirely on them either . If you are running legit offers that could actually help people , like the education offers Ruben suggested , then obviously there 's nothing wrong with this . <p> And I also just have to say that the picture above is extremely disingenuous . Of course they are going to use products from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society ? And most of them ( although admittedly there are some crazies like any other giant crowd ) are not trying to bring corporations down , they are just trying to get some of their bullshit under control . Case in point : LONG ... <p> One common theme you 'll find amongst those that are aggrieved about others making money in times of economic hardship is the idea that the world owes them something . It does n't  . <p> Theyve worked hard but have now lost their job . Its unfair . The world is unfair . <p> Sure , it would be really nice if everyone got along and the world was one big utopia . But it is n't . It would be just lovely if governments treated all their citizens fairly and disbanded their armies . But they wo n't . <p> And that 's the crux of the matter . There are things that are within our control and things that are n't  . <p> No matter what you think is right or wrong , its unlikely that you 're in a position to stop a financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event that such a situation were to occur . <p> What you need to realize , is that the very people that protest now , brought this onto themselves . And its always the corporations to blame . <p> Corporations were not responsible for any of these events : <p> The Most Recent Boom Period The Most Recent Recession The Most Recent Hyperinflation The Most Recent Stock Market Crash The Most Recent Currency Crash or any event of such nature that preceded them <p> World War 1 World War 2 The Cold War The numerous adventures of american military in the iraque/afghanistan general area <p> The 7 to 8 figure body count of the war on drugs Millions of people losing their homes Millions of people losing their jobs <p> The ONLY thing corporations are interested in , is making money . Homeless/Jobless people are not a solid boundary condition for making money . <p> I can not stress that enough . Corporations do no evil . They invent cool things to make our lives cooler and we pay for them . Or we do not . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like them ? Do n't  pay them . Easy as that . <p> What 's responsible for these events is the ill-minded attempts of western governments to control the market by employing the teachings of keynes . <p> When the economy is down , americans go to war . Germans use a 10 figure amount of money to build new streets . Its what they do . They have a fixed growth per year target and want to meet that . In germany , its 2 percent annual growth . <p> When the economy grows more than that , they actively suppress it by raising taxes and whatnet . When it grows less or even declines , they do all sorts of vicious shit to get it back up . <p> These boom recession cycles are all caused by keynesianism . Every single one of them . <p> here 's a simplified example of keynesianism . Do n't  take it too seriously because its obviously not exactly what 's going on , but gives insight to the principle : <p> Keynes says that by spending instead of saving , you end up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plumber : <p> Joe the plumber has 1000 dollars and can either put them in the bank and save for rainy days or buy a new plasma . By keynes laws , he gets the new plasma and afterwards has a plasma plus an amount in excess of 1000 dollars in his bank account . And that 's not an exaggeration , its exactly as weird as it sounds just on a way larger scale . That 's the reason these wars are fought because highly decorated economists insist that these principles hold . <p> The other thing governments have to do or want to do is to reign . Even though they 're " omg only elected for such and such amount of time " the reigning powers even though they 're two opposing parties act and behave a lot like a unit protecting their select few positions at the top from anyone trying to enter . Just think about how they treat newcomers like ron paul . All their animosities do n't  matter the second a new player enters the game . <p> Another thing they have to do is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep their people in check . <p> To do that , they employ a divide and conquer approach . In this case I can more easily draw from my experience with germany . Germany is a lot more socialist than america ever will be and a lot more vicious in dealing with their paying customers ( income tax victims ) . <p> The german government sucks up as much money as it can only to release it back to its people . <p> here 's a general example : <p> Family : 4 kids , 1 Dad , 1 Mom not divorced ( rare enough ) : <p> Dad goes to work , earns above average money , gets to surrender most of that to the government . We are talking about 80% and that is no exaggeration . In a second round , he gets most of that back because he has 4 kids and a lot of tax reducing plans that the government approves of , and ends up with about 50% . That is still a lot but its actually 2.5 times what he originally ended up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% to 50% ) . <p> People then say : how does it matter whether he only pays 50% tax or goes this way ? It matters , because it forces people into behaving the way the government wants you to . And if you do that long enough , it actually forces the mind into this slavery-like mindset . And germany begins to treat its kids to it at a very young age . <p> Now , some day people could decide that its not for them anymore , and rise up against the reigning class . In order to prevent that , the government splits up the benefactors of money-redistribution into tiny groups that all receive essentially the same but under differing circumstances and rules . <p> The most recent change to parents receiving money for having kids is that parents who were actually employed get a couple more euros than those who werent . What happens ? Media shitstorm . " Oh my god that 's so unfair " . There you 've got two parties who now are pitted against in public opinion . <p> Family structures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on help from their families but upon the well-meaning government helping them through every minor inconvenience in life . <p> Families that stay together , have to work together . <p> Mothers that divorce from the dads of their children can get a court-order in no time that forces the dad to take as many jobs as it takes to pay for the children and often even her . People think that that 's well meant and it might even be . But think about what a gigantic incentive that is for couples to not stay together and disrupt every bond that has ever existed . <p> And stuff does n't  end there . There are so many rules and laws and bullshit that makes everyone miserable . Everyone involved . <p> Governments always find someone who is responsible . In this case its wallstreet , a couple years ago it was BP , before that it was wallstreet , before that it was something else . <p> Evil tax evasionists , evil car manufacturers , the jews , the bankers , the blacks , the bible belt , the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government fucks up . Blame can be pushed onto anything and it does n't  matter , because people will believe . Because people cant elect not to believe . Their minds are clouded . Every day they turn on cnn and treat it like its objective reports . <p> Sure , on paper , media is objective . Just ask the german newspaper cicero that got raided by the german " secret service " because it published details that had better gotten unnoticed by the public . I do n't  make that up and its no rumor over media reported on it . <p> Just do yourself a favor and , for once , use your own brain think stuff through do the numbers , and then blame whoever you think is responsible . If its still the corporations , then that 's cool . Its your judgement . I 'm probably not on your side but at least you tried . <p> I 'm not some insider , and i 'm not claiming to be . All you need to understand what 's going on is a working knowledge of 6th grade math . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to understand and they use all theyve got to shape public opinion . <p> Every single human being on this planet is responsible for not questioning what 's going on . <p> Governments do : <p> Take your money and give you nothing in return Make you miserable Tell you what to do with your property and what not Employ a personal army ( the police ) Make law for better or worse Do n't  report to anyone especially not you Get involved in your life if you like it or not Pay " experts " to make public opinion <p> Evil corporations do : <p> Take your money if and when you feel like they should <p> How do corporations destroy the world ? Seriously ? If they were such a huge threat and the governments so well meaning , they could destroy every single one of them over the course of a friday afternoon . <p> This is a very long rant and my point is a really short one . The thing is , you arrive at the world naked and broke , and nobody owes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even your mother . You do n't  owe anyone either . Not your mother , not your favourite evil corporation and especially not your government . All they receive from you without having your permission to take it , is a crime . It is your life that 's getting spent , and if you want to spend it at wallstreet protesting , then so be it . The gentlemen inside those buildings spend their time at wallstreet , gaming the a system that the government built up . Its a flawed system and they make the best of it . They do n't  cheat you because its not their job to make your life pretty . That 's your job . <p> You have to realize that even the bible is twisted and turned beyond recognition by what government deems good public opinion . <p> When jesus told his people to not fight back but endure the punishment , that was said regarding the oppresive roman government and their tax antics . It was not the intention to make 2000 years worth of servants . <p> The bible very clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bible says a lot of things that speaks from the hearts of those who despise it . I was the same . I did n't  like religion , because of what its become . Its just another way of saying that we should serve , when in reality , it does n't  . <p> Read the damn book , its lecture in how to live a life that you can look back to and not feel like a despicable human being . <p> That being said , I am a trader and proud of it . Again , people only see the side painted by the government/leftist media . We do obviously take our cuts but is n't that what business is about ? The guy making computer takes a cut . The guy producing the processor takes a cut . The guy fixing your roof takes a cut . And we take our cuts . We provide liquidity in the markets , the stocks your pension fund holds ? They were that cheap because we were there to sell them . If we did n't  exist , farmers would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil would be more expensive , some parts of everyday life would not be the way they are . We get rich in the process , that 's a fact , but if the garbage collector would get rich , would you mind ? He does a necessary job just like we do . People need to get over the jealousy and turn their life around . <p> A last word on nuclear power/fukushima : <p> Fukushima was totally safe . It survived the largest earthquake in recent history and a fucking tsunami . It was a partial meltdown but it is secured under lots of metric tons of concrete and steel and a lot of other protective measures that are only there because they are proven to work . Then the german " technische hilfswerk " that gets called when someone technical turns sour arrives and tells everyone how they are qualified . And they pump the entire powerplant full of hydrogen in an effort to cool the reactor . A reactor that is close to meltdown but if it melts down , its secured under what 's a lot like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last for a very long time . <p> Hydrogen is one of the most reactive substances in the universe . Reactive means explosive . After the thing is full of hydrogen , it explodes . Which is totally expected because fucking hydrogen . There are a million substances that they could have used for cooling that are totally not dangerous and they choose hydrogen . I 'm not a chemist so maybe there are upsides to hydrogen over every other element but wtf ? It explodes , and if you watch the video closely , you see the concrete shell of around the core vaporize . And that 's when shit gets real . Because now radiation can actually be released . <p> I have a hard time calling conspiracy on such events because i 'm not a conspiracy guy . But they get the alleged best trained force in the world to deal with a problem that 's not really big . I know that its big in public opinion because oh my god nuclear , but in reality its not big . And the first thing they do is explode the outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  make anything up here . Every fact i use got released by mass media . No special reports or anything , ive just followed the events and apply my own technical knowledge . <p> Then we get into nuclear storage . What people get mixed up is actual radiation and radioactive material . <p> There are three kinds of radiation , two of them only last very very short distances and are thus not dangerous , even if you are in direct contact with the material . The other one behaves like light and has just way higher energies . Thats radiation . If you radiate something like a mountain for an infinite amount of years , it does n't  get radioactive . Maybe it gets hot because of energy transmission , but elements that do n't  get radioactive do n't  do so ever . Thats chemistry . <p> The other thing is radioactive material , which radiates . This is where radiation comes from . If you inhale an alpha radiator , you 're dead . But this radioactive material gets stored in barrels which are then stored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is radiation , not actually material . If you put such a barrel into a river and the water was clean , then the water does n't  get radioactive just because the barrel is in htere . The only thing that might happen is that the water gets warm because of energy . <p> The entire nuclear stuff is dangerous is a hype . If it was dangerous , powerplants would not run . Obama might not understand that . German Prime Angela Merkel is a Physics major and knows it . And she ignores her knowledge because it does n't  matter . Governments are all lies and zero facts . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277743 @1677743/ <p> Update : Looks like Facebook pulled the plug on this tool . I 've seen several other bulk uploaders floating around so I will keep you all updated if anything looks like becoming a like for like replacement . <p> Affiliate marketers have flooded Facebook over the last couple of years . As one of the largest traffic sources in the world , you can understand why marketers are keen to tap in to the lucrative nature of the Facebook Ads platform . Unfortunately , being first on the scene was necessary to exploit the full potential . These days , if you 're looking to succeed with your Facebook campaigns , a competitive advantage is going to take you a long way . <p> With the release of 4 Hour Affiliates Facebook Ads Manager , that competitive advantage has arrived . Here is a tool that might just help you resist the urge to want to choke an intern over at the Book HQ . Most of us have experienced the trauma of never ending inconsistencies when dealing with the ad approval team . While there 's no sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball ache with this excellent tool . <h> What Is Facebook Ads Manager ? <p> Facebook Ads Manager is one of those simple yet functional tools that wo n't really impress until you 've sat down and counted the hours that you 'll save when you have it at your disposal . Developed as a Firefox Extension , it sits quietly on your browser and integrates with the native Facebook Ad Manager . <p> The tool automates the process of creating , copying and launching campaigns . When opened , it will appear as a sidebar in your browser with a variety of options . Most will look familiar from the basic Facebook interface . <p> At the press of a play button , Facebook Ads Manager is capable of spitting out dozens , hundreds or even thousands of ad variations . It does this by simply mixing and matching the parameters that you 've chosen for your creatives . Ill touch on why this is so helpful in a minute , but just ask yourself . How many hours have you wasted sitting at your desk and submitting tiny variations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend an hour launching one campaign only to have an intern auto-disapprove every single god damn ad because of " too much skin " . <p> Does Facebook let you replace the image and resubmit all of them at the click of a button ? No , the cretins require you to access each creative and make individual changes . To summarize , Facebook Ads Manager can save you this pain . But far from being a mere anger management slash damage limitation plugin , I 've found Facebook Ads Manager to be a vital ingredient to a successful campaign . <h> How Can I Use It To Make Money ? <p> Going back to the mixing and matching formula , let 's take an example of a real life campaign . I once had a dating ad on Facebook that was cutting a small loss and not quite delivering profitability , but I knew that it was a strong concept and that with a little optimization it would probably bring home good money . <p> My original ad creatives were targeting groups of males within 6 year age brackets . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . I used the same group of ad texts and images on each demographic and the closest I could ever get to profit was on the weekend where my CTR was naturally higher . <p> Thanks to Facebook Ads Manager , I was able to break those ad groups in to dozens of small clusters and really analyze where each creative was succeeding or failing . I launched 60-70 new ads in a matter of minutes , setting the manager to test subtle variations of each ad across much smaller age brackets . With a little help from my best friend automation , I was able to divide the ad groups in to one year age brackets and not want to kill myself . <p> It really took me by surprise how the same ad creative could perform so differently with a user just 2 years younger , or how blondes and brunettes attracted more clicks with subtly different text variations . I would never have had the time nor patience to track these performance quirks if it was n't for the automation machine behind Facebook Ads Manager . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its that often you have a profitable Facebook campaign on your hands and do n't  even know it . Youve got too many bad apples in your basket . Too many harmful demographics hurting the profitability of that one killer creative . With Facebook Ads Manager , you can really drill down and get the absolute maximum from your campaigns . That 's how you use it to make your money . <h> What Are The Risks Involved ? <p> The developer behind the tool recommends that you submit no more than 200 ads in one session . Facebook has been known to crack down on accounts that have been flagged for excessive automation . I say excessive automation because there 's always going to be a tipping point . I cant see Facebook having a problem in letting a customer use technology to automate the creation of a campaign . <p> But you 're probably going to ruffle feathers if you think this is Badder Adder and start launching a new campaign every 5 minutes . Those interns have got ta have their lunch breaks and I cant see them being too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blink an eye . <p> I cant imagine you would need more than 100 ads to grab some incredibly useful test data from your campaign . And even if that 's not enough for you , just wait a little while and run another batch . The main risk with Facebook Ads Manager , as is so often the case , is that it falls in to the hands of a bumbling clustertard who thinks technology is his bitch . Exploit the tool recklessly and you 'll get shut down . <h> Facebook Ads Manager Pricing Options <p> For what the tool is , a simple browser extension , Facebook Ads Manager is priced quite highly at $199.99 . If you 're a beginner with minimal cash to invest , I 'd advise you spend that money on raw testing rather than splashing out on fancy tools . But for intermediate marketers and those whove spent a fair amount on Facebook in the past , $199.99 is the price of taking the next step and upping your game . Its possible to get by without the tool , but what price do you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never fulfilled their potential ? <p> All future upgrades are free with the initial purchase . You do n't  have to worry about your software becoming obsolete if Facebook decide to overhaul their interface , which they seem to do all the time . There 's no trial version available , but there is a 60 day money back guarantee for your sampling pleasure . <h> Overall Thoughts <p> I 'm a fan . I 've got thumbs up for any tool that detaches me from the heartbreaking process of dealing with Facebook interns . But especially one that can uncover so many hidden gaps in a market . By combining Ads Manager with your tracking software of choice , you can really fast-track your progress on the Facebook platform and cut through the crap to find ads that just work . There 's no explanation for why , and sometimes the logic is backwards . To be successful as an affiliate , I 've learned to automatically disregard what I think is going to workand just test everything . <p> I wo n't bullshit you with ROI stories of how I 'm so much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Facebook Ads , you 're still going to need to be creative . You 're still going to need to innovate to stay ahead of the field . But you should be grasping at whatever can give you an advantage in a very competitive market . Facebook Ads Manager might just be the tool that kicks you on to the next level . Check it out . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277744 @1677744/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Affiliate marketing arbitrage is one of the simplest careers in the world . There are no politics , no glass ceilings , and no barriers to entry . The focal point of 99% of what we do is numbers . Can you make them work for you ? <p> From CPCs to EPCs , from CPMs to CTRs what may appear to the uninitiated as random digits on a screen , can be optimised and manoeuvred in to a recipe for serious , serious moo-lah . But only if you know how to work them . And thankfully most people do n't  . <h> The EPC Spreadsheet <p> Many affiliate networks distribute spreadsheets of their top performing offers , complete with EPCs , conversion rates and ranking by revenue . <p> Affiliates seem to love these documents , despite the warped data they can represent . It does n't  take a genius to work out that if 50 new publishers are direct linking one offer , while 5 veterans are pre-selling another , the EPCs are going to look favourable for the pre-sold offer . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of easily consumable golden nuggets . <p> EPC spreadsheets are good for ruling out dud offers , and a welcome helping hand for deciding where to start , but they are not an accurate representation of how your marketing will perform . <p> If you run a lot of campaigns , and particularly if you are an adopter of the throwing shit at the wall technique , I suggest creating your own performance spreadsheets . <p> In short : Learn to make use of your data . <p> You pay for it . You bust your balls for it . Why waste it ? <p> If affiliate marketing is all about numbers and it is then failing to stockpile your data should be seen as a karate cock slappable offence . <p> With every campaign , you can store data on multiple levels . <h> Country Specific Data <p> I have a file for every single country that I advertise in , as well as an Excel spreadsheet with an overview of the key points I need to remember . <p> In the spreadsheet I aim to correlate some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of dollars I have spent arbitraging my damn hairline away . <p> Metrics such as : <p> The best offer in that country , by EPC <p> The second best offer , by EPC <p> Average CPM/CPC to draw traffic from each of my favourite traffic sources <p> Note : Media buyers should have doubts about running a campaign if the gulf in performance between best and second best offer is enough to eat up most of their profit . Have a Plan B , or stick to low-risk marketing on self-serve platforms . <p> There 's no shame in being a one trick pony , and there 's no sense in being an over-confident donkey who just blew $15,000 on a campaign that has no viable Plan B. <p> How many times do you find yourself surfing through new traffic sources , checking out the minimum bids and running calculations in your head to see if you might get profitable ? Get that data out of your head and on to paper . <p> I will say it again : affiliate marketing is all about the numbers . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and archiving it for future reference , you will soon find that there is no such thing as a failed campaign . Only more numbers . Numbers that will lower the risk , and the uncertainty , of your next investment . <p> There are two forms of filing that can also help you . <h> Digital archiving <p> What do you do with those landing pages and creatives once you 've pushed them through the FTP ? <p> I used to let them fester on my desktop before eventually click-and-dragging in to a spiralling abyss marked To Sort , one day to be found a dozen archives deep . <p> Ive since got in to the habit of storing every single landing page in a country coded folder . If you start this today , you are unlikely to see immediate benefits . But six months down the road you will have enough assets to move quickly in to just about any market in the world . <p> Naturally , a good labelling system is vital . 1001 folders titled LP1 are more trouble than they are worth . Name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Qualifier , Short Sell , Sales Letter , Squeeze , and so on <p> If you are particularly adventurous , you will have multiple sub-variants inside each folder . Again , name them based on their distinguishing qualities . Future You will be grateful , unlike 2011 Me , who spent many hours fishing through his Trash Can looking constipated . <h> Paper archiving <p> Besides the overview spreadsheet and the digital files , I keep a paper record of every single country that I advertise in . As you might imagine , some are thicker than others . Australia is starting to resemble a J.K. Rowling brainfart , whilst a stiff breeze sends China in to my laundry basket . <p> Cheat sheets of common language translations so I can understand my own ads ( surprisingly helpful ! ) <p> Popular local slang terms <p> You could probably do this shit in Evernote , but I like the smell of paper . <p> Every single campaign you run is a haven for data and insights that can be tucked away and referred to in the future . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others to a country , and lots will be to a particular offer or creative approach . If you are the kind of affiliate who regularly gorges on network EPC spreadsheets , there 's very little excuse for placing less value in the data that you bought . <h> Data is no guarantee of success <p> Affiliates are pretty lousy at predicting how their campaigns will perform . This is a damn near universal trait . <p> I thought it was just me ; a bumbling fool in an ocean of wizard mathematicians . But no , having sat through my share of mastermind sessions recently , I can say with confidence that many of you are just as bad . Collectively we project numbers about as accurately as ReBumberclart Republican Karl Rove on Election Night . <p> Nate Silvers , we ai n't  . <p> Let 's see <p> Youve spotted that you can snap up 200,000 impressions per day at a CPM of $0.70 and you hope that with a combined ad CTR of 0.25% , a landing page CTR of 30% and a conversion rate of 1/10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as to multiply your $140/day profit by 30 , and have tentatively pencilled $4200 next to a sketch of JUNE with doodles of the cocaine and hookers that you 'll buy with the harvest . <p> Initial estimates are fine . But do n't  kid yourself . You are not going to have an accurate idea of the true numbers until you bite the bullet and go live . And its usually at this point that most of us scrunch up those hopeful projections , launching them in to the office bin while snarking viciously : <p> If you place too much trust in your estimated numbers , you will find yourself so disenfranchised at the end of Day 1 that there 's a good chance you 'll have abandoned ship before the weekend . That 's how money gets wasted and confidence wanes . <p> Data spreadsheets and detailed files can help to rein in your focus . But they will not perform miracles , and they will not turn your brainfarts in to fairy dust . <p> There 's a famous quote from Thomas Edison : <p> " Genius is 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like any wise bastard from years gone by , his words have been passed through memos and mutilated on blogs to the point where you 're just as likely to recognise them as : <p> Its tough to say how much of an affiliates success stems from genius . But I do know that moments of creative brilliance are rare , and data is not . <p> Many affiliates carry around their stats as a burden ; a constant reminder of how wrong they can be . The best affiliates bounce off their data not as crushing evidence of an initial bad judgment , but as vital signposts for where they need to improve . Sometimes the signal gets lost in the emotional sting of losing money . Cest tragique , now get over it . <p> You can make a lot of money by applying basic data-driven principles to very ordinary advertising . Its not rocket science . And the next time somebody asks me what I do for a living , that 's exactly what I wo n't tell them . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

I would invest in a good VPN and study my chosen market obsessively . <p> A Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) let 's you access websites using an IP in a different country . <p> Why would you want to do this ? <p> To spy on foreign ads and affiliate campaigns , of course . <p> There are no secrets in affiliate marketing . <p> Most profitable campaigns are running in full view of the public . <p> You can use spy tools like WhatRunsWhere to harvest banners and landing pages , but these are often lacking in context . <p> The best way to see which creatives are dominant is to load up a VPN , access a placement , and note which banners appear first ( and most often ) . <p> For this , I use HideMyAss . It has servers in over 128 countries , is pretty reliable , and works on mobile phones . <p> Note : A monthly charge to HideMyAss ' is definitely one of the more interesting expenses on my bank statements .

Its also fiercely competitive . <p> A newbie entering these waters is going to be swallowed up by one of the many great white sharks , AKA your direct competition . <p> So you start in shallow waters . You ask questions about the huge German dating market and you segment it in to smaller chunks . <p> There are many ways you can do this : from age , to cities , to needs , to marital profiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating market is a great example because it serves a universal need ( to find a companion ) with endless smaller pockets of demographics that can be targeted . <p> What you will find is that your biggest competitors are drunk on their economies of scale . They wont bother to devise campaigns for the smaller traffic sources , or the minority demographics . If they do , it will be an afterthought . <p> This leaves the path clear for a newbie affiliate to sweep in and serve those demographics with a message that strikes closer to home . <p> While a small budget demands that you out-work the competition , take note : this is not a scalable advantage once you enter the mass markets . <p> To be a dominant affiliate in the big-money open waters , you need to build structural advantages in to your business . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Well finch , high patout offer it s not true that you need to spend a lot though , i have this offer that pays 20$ and i have 600% roi Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the right combination , offer with traffic source , that is all = Of course there is a lot more to say <p> I did have a post for affiliate managers actually , but I cant find it or remember what it was called ( helpful , I know ! ) .

If you show the " PRO BANNERS BROKER PEOPLE " items like this , first they say " do n't  listen to the bloggers " then they say " oh , that was photo shopped " then they say , " so , what does it matter " . The situation with Banner Broker is very frustrating . I do not know of a single business that has survived this long after not paying people for 7 to 8 months or longer . We all have seen so many scams come and go , yet few seem to learn anything from it . One argument that is pro-BB claims that BB ran great the first 2 years . I have to remind them that BB and the leaders told most to roll their money over the first 12 15 months . Banners Broker has lied consistently to the affiliates . The excuses are too numerous to mention . Plus the inconsistencies . In april 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says there is a cash crunch . They still TEASE the affiliates with a NEW processor . So many defend Banners Broker that it is NOT a PONZI . BB fits a PONZI model by the very definition . Money paid based on NEW money coming in. there is no REAL product generating all the money they claim it did . Few remember that BB started out as a " front line doubler " The back office has become no better than a monopoly game from hell . sure , they made payments so did 100s of other scams . Bottom line : they can not pay everyone . <p> I have to ask myself , why do n't  more people take action against Banners Broker ? <p> I have come to the conclusion there are a few basic groups concerning BB ==&gt; <p> 1st Group : some complain , few take action , some take the time to educate themselves . <p> 2nd Group : a friend of mine contacted the police and fraud unit in Canada .

Many online scams go unreported . <p> 3rd Group : Totally brain washed , they really do think they will make a million overnight by investing a few dollars . they do n't  want to hear anything negative and will even inject God into the sales pitch . I call this group " The Sheep " <p> 4rd Group : This group wont report BB because they also have good reason to hide . they do n't  pay their taxes , or , they themselves fear being called out for lies and bad recruiting practices .

Many of these guys use God and religion to sell and many take advantage of Christians . <p> I hope there is a lesson to be learned by all of this . a good company should be transparent and accountable .

Really ? <p> There is a loud and passionate argument against Shreks pay raise . <p> One that goes ( and often spells ) like this : <p> Ah , yes . <p> Wealth Redistribution : splitting the right from the left since the beginning of politics . Second only to God Almighty . <p> The NHS attack is a common analogy used to explain why men like Wayne Rooney should be held in contempt for rolling in the moolah . <p> " I saw Aunt Betsy scraping her pennies together in the post office today . Bloody terrible , it is . She does real work that saves lives . If anyone deserves a pay raise , its Betsy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> Or so goes the line of thinking . <p> Yes , Wayne is rich and the vast majority of Aunt Betsys are not . <p> We get it . <p> So loaded is Shrek , in fact , that he can afford to buy an hour-long romp with one of his premium grandma hookers and still come away making a net profit under services provided . Now that is rich . <p> And its all because of the market a judge of value somewhat more sophisticated than a Daily Mail comments section free-for-all . <p> There is a school of thought in the UK that goes like this : <p> High wages should be reserved only for those who perform life saving feats , or me . <p> Or me ? ! <p> Well , why not ? <p> Show me somebody who does n't  think they deserve a pay raise and I 'll show you somebody who has reached the very precipice of their career ladder . <p> I have trouble finding those from the 99% who are happy to turn down a pay raise on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us take what we can get , while we can still get it . <p> Those who do n't  fall in to two groups : <p> a ) Philanthropists : who often spend the prime of their careers as devout capitalist pigs . <p> or <p> b ) Hippies : who believe that money ca n't buy happiness , and seldom give it the chance . <p> Wayne Rooney is called a mercenery for taking the best possible deal on the market . <p> The same could be said for movie stars , bankers and the entire herd of Kardashians . <p> But it can also be said for me , and probably you , and certainly anybody who ever let their eyes linger on the salaries in the local job listings . <p> The cold , hard truth is this : <p> What you earn has absolutely nothing to do with what you deserve . <p> Nothing , zero , nada . <p> Your passions wont make you rich , and neither will your daily good deed count . <p> Only the market can make you rich . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are the two best options you have besides winning the lottery : <p> Develop a skill that somebody will pay a premium for . <p> Develop a product/service that can be packaged and sold for a lot of money . <p> Given the choice , most people are already reaching for their lucky dips . <p> In a parallel universe , the next Wayne Rooney is developing his football skills and getting ready to sell them for -300,000 per week . <p> A thousand pounds for every brain cell , or so the joke goes on Twitter . <p> Well , I would be retweeting my way to the bank on those numbers . <p> It does n't  matter what Wayne deserves to earn , the point is that he does indeed earn it . <p> And who benefits ? <p> Shrek , undoubtedly . <p> But 45% of Shreks pay raise gets sucked back in to the system as taxed income . Which in turn is redistributed to pay for things like NHS doctors and surgeons . <p> Of course , the economics are forgotten in a heartbeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surgeons . Or economics . <p> It has everything to do with jealousy . <p> Its his wage vs. your wage . Simple as that . <p> There is only one judge to determine who wins ; who makes a killing and who breaks a back for small change . His name is the market . <p> And a cruel judge he can be . <p> " What is somebody willing to pay me ? " This is the only truth that has any meaningful impact on your earning potential . <p> The way many people lead their lives battling for wealth , youd forgive the market for stopping the fight in the first round . <p> They are woefully unprepared , trained in the wrong disciplines , mastered up to the eyeballs in degrees that might as well be titled fannying around , pushing shit up a mountain in jobs that can never give them what they want . Because what they want leads back to more money . <p> If the market had a voice , it would need only four words to get its message across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not everybody defines happiness as the pursuit of money . <p> That 's probably a good thing . <p> But if you are one of the many who do , you need only look at the market for the clearest sign of what you should be doing with your life . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 13 Comments <p> Your writing style sounds like you 're hyperventilating and what you are trying to say just seems obvious and bullish . I do n't  think I learnt anything from your article . Plus , why keep referring to Wayne Rooney as Shrek so often ? Its pretty lame . <p> I 'm guessing this post is part of some strategy to write about things that are in the news with posts that are tangentially related to your info products in order to get more page views and sell more of them . Pretty nicely done if so , but do n't  forget your core audience . Most of them probably do n't  want to read content like this . I know I certainly do n't  . <p> I like the analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good marketer if I catered to loyal readers over a larger audience that is willing to pay .

Nothing could be further from the truth . There are people who are lucky enough to work online a year and make millions . Call it what you want , luck , whatever . However , the main point to take away is that capitalism is not fair . As they say , hate the game , not the player . <p> With regards to Rooney , I do n't  see why he is getting bad press for the money he earns .

It shapes existing beliefs in to motivation for taking action . <p> Something I try to get across in every landing page I build is that the user is always right . That does n't  equate to being smart , and it certainly does n't  mean rational . It means the users beliefs and motivations are worth infinitely more than any of the bullet points on my page . <p> When we start replacing product benefits with nods to the users belief systems , we erase all friction and speak directly to the identity of that user . This is powerful because a customer will only buy what he believes in . <p> Look around you . <p> Your possessions are a testament to who you are and what you believe in . Everything from the pile of books , to the brand of laptop , to the type of drink you 're swigging is a mark of who you think you are . <p> So , if a swaggering arsehole were to fall from the ceiling , slap you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your predisposition or beliefs you would n't buy it . <p> And yet many affiliate marketers will try this technique regardless . <p> To give you an example of a particularly embarrassing howler I made in the past , I once tried to sell the angle of dating at Christmas to a target demo of 250,000 Jewish women who werent necessarily even single . <p> Does n't  sound like a profitable campaign , does it ? No shit . <p> While my clanger is an extreme case , the mistake I was committing is the same that many marketers are committing every day . They try to sell a story , a concept , an idea , that simply is n't relevant , wanted or desired . <p> When it fails , what do we blame ? Probably a bad offer that did n't  convert , or a banner that did n't  draw enough clicks . Rarely do we criticize the story being told . Were reluctant to question the authenticity of our sales message , and how it might be received by the people with the pleasure of experiencing our ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes skill ! Its no lazy mans cup of tea to connect with real people . <p> We too often take it for granted that our target markets are packed to the ceiling with numb nuts who need only see a " Click to Order Now " to part with their cash . <p> There 's a real lack of authentic storytelling . <p> What happened to that priceless ability to sell not by preaching what the user does n't  give a shit about , but by tapping in to their beliefs and convincing them that Product X is who they are ? <p> The best sellers in the business rarely sell . They reassure . They mould their products in to extensions of the customers belief systems . Sometimes those beliefs are deluded , stupid or wrong ; but the customer never is . Selling requires that you embrace that insanity and shine a light on it . <p> Yesterday I found myself scanning through the holy motherload of landing page collections . <p> Its probably not the most glamorous way to spend a weekend peering shamelessly at the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration , and a reminder of the thousand scandalous ways to skin a cat . <p> What struck me is that while our industry never tires of finding new and inventive ways to build trust usually through association and brand misdirection there are very few affiliate marketers who truly get the art of selling . <p> You sense that affiliates are making money in spite of their copy and headlines , rather than because of them . That 's a testament to some of the sick creative minds out there , and their ability to find the perfect amount of cleavage that steers clear of the Facebook Banhammer while still popping a monster CTR . <p> I do have to wonder though , from a career advancement perspective , what is going to take you further ? A library of 56,000 high-CTR 110x80s or the ability to use words that spark conversions through the power of classic story-telling ? <p> The next time you launch a campaign that bombs in the first hour , resist the urge to throw new offers , images and landing pages at the wall . Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total sum of your product benefits a person that the target user would want to be ? <p> If the answer is no , you 've sold the wrong story . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Make sure you grab your copy of the newly released Premium Posts Volume 5 .

This is something that Eugene Schwartz talks about a lot in his book Breakthrough Advertising ( great book , by the way ) . Lots of marketers are so busy selling that they forget that people enjoy buying , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " create the market " they channel the desires , wants and beliefs that are already there . <p> Something else that helps me tell the right story is to write about who the offer is n't for . Disqualifying does a bang up job of defining the market and making them say , " yeah I hate that ish too ! " All of the sudden they trust you , and you 're seen as more than a sleazy affiliate in the business of collecting souls for a $5 CPA . <p> Good post . Really hits home . I think you 'll find this is just the same within the Corporate world too . So many campaigns are launched where I currently work and they are poorly executed and hell bent on SELL , SELL , SELL . They are obsessed with call to actions and all the cookie cutter crap you have mentioned above . <p> My take on the affiliate marketing/make money online industry is that its a pure popularity contest . Although there is a craft at selling ultimately the successful sales are either through someone who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an internet celebrity . <p> The key to success otherwise is what you have mentioned . Write a great story and make sure the customer base are sold by what you have an offer . If you can do that then it does n't  matter how green the call to action button is . <p> Sometimes what people say and what they actually do can be two completely different things . In ( offline ) tests carried out by Professor Cialdini ( yes , he of the Influence book fame ) , he found that people were influenced by their neighbours , but when surveyed they claimed were not . So , in many cases , we can only find out what copy works by testing . <p> @Finch Speaking of sales copy , if you promoted offers for an affiliate network with good conversions , then one day they turned around and said that you must put a disclaimer badge above the fold on every page of your affiliate sites containing the following text : I name or company name am an affiliate marketer . I receive a commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Penalty for non-compliance would be removal from the network . Would you still promote them ? <p> @Raphael Yes . There has to be a balance . You cant expect to get profitable with even the most expertly written copy in the world if your CTR is 0.01% . But angles are just as important . The way I look at it , you have to make the user feel like buying the product is the most logical decision based on his own actions in the past . He has to sell it to himself . <p> @Pete Probably not . But I cant imagine any situation where disclaimers would be forced above the fold for the majority of offers I promote . Maybe hidden in the footer , but not in a way that shatters conversion rates . <p> Remember , its not just affiliate marketers who use affiliate marketing . Some of the biggest companies in the world have business models that rely on taking commission . I 'm sure theyd put up a very vocal fight if they had to slap text along those lines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its likely to kill conversions , but this particular network has been working with the OFT to improve transparency for the consumer and come up with this affiliate disclosure badge ( please scroll LONG ... <p> The network claim it wont affect conversions much , but as you 've mentioned the biggest brands have nothing like this , so why should affiliates. 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

Would you rather author a mediocre book gathering cobwebs at Barnes &amp; Noble or a hugely profitable eBook with a fraction of the prestige ? <p> One glance at the Internet Marketing landscape and you should be calling me a fool for begging the question . eBooks are cheaper to produce , more lucrative to sell , and a whole lot easier to distribute . <p> Why , oh why , would anybody bother with print publishing in the 21st century ? <p> More specifically , who in their right mind would choose the traditional route through a publishing house when its a million times easier to self-publish through services like Lulu and CreateSpace ? <h> Why I Love and Hate Selling eBooks <p> I 'm no stranger to selling eBooks . I spent the first half of my online career bitching about them , deploring the very thought of committing my ideas to a PDF in a shitty $5 cover-art . <p> Well , somebody must have woken me up and splashed coffee up my nostrils . It sure did n't  take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually sold out jumped on the gravy train and started publishing them on this very site . I now have six fully fleshed volumes of Premium Posts , a title that I specifically chose to avoid having to use the term eBook . <p> There are obvious advantages to the eBook model . <p> In the 12 months since Volume 1 went live , I expect revenue to nudge past $100,000 from zero marketing spend . While that is certainly not baller status , its personal justification that I made the right decision in asking people to pay for my best blog posts . <p> You might have noticed that I no longer have ads on this site . That 's a positive upside to monetizing through the eBook model . I make more money by dedicating pixels to my own real-estate . <p> In terms of fast , easy money selling eBooks is infinitely more appealing than taking my ideas to a publishing house and spending the best part of 18 months ball-dallying back and forth . <p> The downside to the eBook model is that its tarred by default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Before any of you smartarses reply with " Six , all of yours " , let me turn your attention to the insanity you 're confronted with with every time you log in to Clickbank . <p> No niche escapes Clickbank unscathed . <p> There are gazillions and bazillions of " WTF ? " eBooks burning consumer trust as we speak . <p> A whole raft of them belong to the Make Money Online space , but let 's not be too inclusive . Very rarely does a niche escape without at least a handful of shoddy eBooks stinking up its ranks . <p> The problem with eBooks is that just about anybody with an FTP client can smuggle one on to the web , and it does n't  have to be verified or edited by a reputable agent along the way . Christ , many eBooks are available without being proofread by their own creators . What does that say ? <p> No great writer justifies his claim with the opening statement , " I once wrote an eBook . " <p> It just does n't  happen . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm a published author . " Especially if their book has n't  been self-published out of vanity ( or industry rejection ) . <p> I 'm sure this is nothing you have n't heard before . Why does respect matter ? Who cares about aiming for the airports bestseller shelf when you can make fast , easy money by distributing digitally without even sniffing life outside your mothers basement ? <p> It matters to real writers who care about their craft as much as they care about their bottom line . Its an enormous achievement to publish a book through the traditional means . <p> For me , its the pinnacle . <p> Acceptance as a professional writer . <p> An acknowledgement that you 're more accomplished than the whimsical step-aunty who keeps threatening to turn her diarrhea of half-thoughts in to a bestselling novel . <h> The Pros and Cons of Traditionally Publishing a Book <p> Is it any wonder that so many writers choose eBooks to distribute their ideas when the road to Barnes &amp; Noble is littered with snail-mail rejection , drawn out contracts ( if you 're lucky ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many reasons , it would be impossible for me to release my Premium Post content through a traditional publishing company . It typically takes at least 12 months and sometimes up to 3 years to get a book published . By the time my book hit the shelves , affiliate marketing might actually be dead . <p> You must first decide between approaching publishing houses directly or going through a literary agency . <p> If you are a well-known name , or have a stack of accreditation on your mantlepiece , its possible that a publisher will take you on based on the book concept and your reputation . <p> Likewise , if you have an insatiable audience of 250,000 subscribers waiting to devour your every last word , it should n't be too long before a publisher is blasting your door down for a slice of the pie . <p> Their chief concern is selling enough copies to make a profit , and with an army of fans , you tick the right boxes . There 's a market attached to your name . People waiting to buy your precious hardback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishing deal . <p> For lesser known names with smaller followings , a few thousand subscribers is by no means a guarantee that a publisher will share the vision of your million dollar idea . Its better than nothing though . I find myself in this bracket . I have enough readers to justify an industry presence . But not enough readers to rename myself Sir King Honeybadger of the Affiliate Marketing Masses . <p> Give it 4 months . I 'm working on it . <p> My best option is to write the book , approach an agent and pray that I have n't sold his goodwill down the drain on an acai berry subscription in the recent past . <p> Many publishing houses will refuse to even look at your manuscript unless you go through a literary agency . <p> The agency is the middleman . They will negotiate better rights for your work , including the essentials that are difficult to secure when you 're flying solo : translation rights , brand ownership ; even movie rights if you hit the jackpot . In return , you give them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add up to a handful of magic beans . <p> Ah yes , the advance . <p> The idea of being paid before you 've finished the job will be music to the ears of those whove pummelled Elance for article gigs in the past . You can expect to receive an upfront payment based on projected book sales if a publisher agrees to send your crazy ideas to print . <p> You 'll usually receive 50% of your advance upfront , and 50% when the manuscript is turned in . Times are changing , however , and some publishers are now dividing the payment in to deliverable milestones . A subtle way of saying " Write , monkey , write . We have n't got all decade . " <p> That leaves a crap ton of writing to be done , and very little immediate financial return . Possibly just enough to brush your teeth and wolf down a Rustlers between rewrites . <p> Far from being a ticket to your first million dollar mansion , securing a book deal is actually quite a damp squib in the financial stakes particularly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance range from the low 4-figures to $35,000 . Much depends on the publisher , genre , your credentials and how much a faceless fat cat likes your schtick . Non-fiction authors traditionally receive more than those writing fiction . <p> While the advance makes for some nice coin on a rainy day , its certainly a low return when you consider the investment of time . And especially how much you could make slinging eBooks in the same time . <p> Thankfully , there 's an upside . If you write a massive bestselling hit that lands at number 4 in the NY Times and gets translated in to 17 different languages , momentum becomes your best friend . You 'll never have to worry about driving sales from AdWords coupons ever again . <p> Score a 4-Hour Work Week style success and the royalties will make you very rich indeed . If we go by the traditional theory that you can expect to make around $1 for every book sold ( after your advance has been earned back ) , you need only sell a cool 1 million copies before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many books sell like the 4-Hour Work Week ? Its only a tiny , tiny minority . <p> The average deluded writer is probably more likely to win the lottery . <p> Most books hit the shelves , gather some dust , then disappear to be talked about only in the authors Twitter bio . <p> The actual marketing of the book is a responsibility that publishers are increasingly passing on to the authors . Only a very small selection of books receive the Fifth Shades of Grey publicity treatment . <p> And that 's just as well or my list of Undeserving Writers to Hunt Down and Punch in the Face would grow immeasurably huge . <h> The Fallback : Self-Publishing Print Books <p> At the top of this article , I referenced two popular self-publishing platforms : Lulu and CreateSpace . <p> These platforms allow you to self-publish physical copies of your book and sell them on a single order basis . <p> If Cousin Jeff wants to buy the novel you 've been bragging about all over Facebook , he can place an order and have it shipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that 's still a much better rate than any traditional publisher will offer . <p> In the past , this form of vanity publishing required ordering in bulk potentially hundreds of copies at a time . Many self-published authors would thus end up with an attic full of yellowing pages and unshipped reminders of their broken dreams . <p> A situation not too dissimilar to the episode of Alan Partridge where his Bouncing Back memoir gets pulped . <p> Tragic times . <p> The indie publishing scene has grown at a rapid rate over the last few years . The arrival of Print On Demand services has reduced the risk behind self-publishing while also providing a welcome middle ground . If you feel that your book deserves a physical testament to its awesomeness , you can produce one for very little cost . <p> Unfortunately , the stigma of being self-published still remains . <p> Reviews are seen as the driving force behind bestselling hits . And most reputable journos will refuse to touch a book that has n't  come to market through the traditional means . <p> Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PW Select operate on a pay-per-review basis . I have doubts that paying to be reviewed alongside other desperate self-published authors is worth the money , but I may be wrong . <p> Successful print books the few that make it have a much greater capacity to spread around the world and capture the imagination of a giant audience when compared to your average popular eBook . <p> You need only look at the raging Fifty Shades of Grey phenomenon a series that was originally self-published to see how getting a physical book to market can lead to bigger and better things . <p> Many publishers will swoop to pick up vanity projects if they gain momentum ( and enough sales ) . <h> Where Next ? <p> Personally , I can see the merits in both extremes of the eBooks vs Print Books argument . <p> From a purely financial perspective , there is no better way to distribute content than by slinging eBooks . I charge $34.95 for my Premium Post products and pocket about 95% of the sale , unless an affiliate has referred the customer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what I would receive by releasing a book through a publisher . <p> My eBooks also take just 15 days to bring to market , compared to the year it would require to get a hardback on a shelf . Let 's not even consider the odds being stacked against a publisher accepting it in the first place . <p> What does that mean for you guys ? <p> If you 're an Internet Marketer looking for the fastest road to profit , do yourself a favour and stick to slinging eBooks . It will get you there in a fraction of the time . <p> My problem is that Ive only ever been a reluctant Internet Marketer . Writing is my passion . <p> Getting a book published professionally through the traditional means and received well is the ultimate acid test .

There comes a tipping point where its no longer satisfying . I do it because it makes me money , but that 's where the relationship ends . <p> So , here 's another question <p> If you won the lottery and had 148 million Euros deposited in to your account tomorrow , would you still be doing affiliate marketing ? <p> Most people will answer a resounding " No " . <p> I do n't  blame them . <p> Well , at what point will you be earning enough money to focus less on affiliate marketing , and more on the work that you could see yourself doing for the rest of your life ? <p> The answer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been earning enough money for a long time . I just did n't  want to push myself with a challenge that I was likely to lose . <p> No doubt , I 'll probably still lose . Bestselling authors are a rare breed , and chance has as much to do with perfection in the making of their success . But itll be fun to try . <p> And failing all else , if I can set a world record for most ball references in a manuscript , I 'll be chuffed . <p> Have you had success with the eBook model ?

So it would seem that e books is the future . Kindles and other readers are also getting better and cheaper so I expect this trend to continue for quite some time yet . <p> Interesting post . Although I just lost half an hour watching Steve Coogan clips . <p> I cant help but wonder how long it will take before getting a paper book published stops being the pinnacle of achievement for a writer . After all no one worries about their music being available on a CD any more . So is it the physically medium or the fact that a publishing house has picked it up that gives the prestige ? <p> In time I would imagine that a publishing contract will become more about marketing a digital book than actually getting an advance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon or Google rather than Random House or HarperCollins . Who knows , people may write the few first chapters to try and get crowd funding for the rest of the book . <p> You have to admire Bezos and Amazon for recognising the death of paper and helping to kill it off themselves and lead the way in the next wave of publishing . <p> The book you write , I 'm certain , will be more than adequate material for the zombies to consume in masses <p> BUT <p> Will you be able to deliver song and dance with it a little something extra to get you noticed and spark the interest of those same zombies , who seek only to be entertained to awaken just for a moment from their pathetic lives . <p> Can you rise above the allure of the Acai Berry promise that drives so many hypnotized consumers and create a buzz for what you would like them to acknowledge : namely , your first hardcover creation ? <p> Or will you die with few copies sold , only to be " discovered " years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the apocalypse ? <p> @Jimmy Thanks . It will be non-fiction . Non-fiction on the subject of Internet Marketing . I 'm not straying too far from my expertise ! <p> @Jon I agree . But there 's still a huge market for print books . Should be a very interesting decade for the publishing industry . <p> @Nick I think the prestige comes from being one of the very few writers that a publishing house deems suitable for the market . The agencies and publishers have access to a great infrastructure that can launch a brand quicker than digital self-published material . That may change . But I think the biggest compliment for a writer is to be picked up by a renowned publisher . Its a mark of quality . <p> @Brian Hopefully not the latter ! And it will definitely be a while before I crank out fiction . I 'm sticking with what I know for now . Sleazy marketing non-fiction . <p> Ebooks are turning the model on its head . There are some god awful authors who published fiction ebooks first that somehow managed to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ebooks popularity and number sold ( thank you amazon ! ) , they were beating agents off with sticks and were avle to leverage that popularity to have a much more favorable contract devised . On all platforms and markets . <p> One of the foundational keys to writing fiction ( if that 's where you 're going ) is to devise a series and have more than one book out . Release them in a tight schedule and price them according to the size of your audience . Series like Twilight/Hunger Games/Harry Potter set the example as a business model . <p> I hope you understand what an advantage you have to the millions of poor schmucks who labor writing an ebook then have n't the faintest idea what to do next . Your skillset is invaluable . INVALUABLE ! <p> Lastly , as I read your post a small section stood out to me : <p> " It matters to real writers who care about their craft as much as they care about their bottom line . It 's an enormous achievement to publish a book through the traditional means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Acceptance as a professional writer . " <p> Finch , I 've been reading your drivel off and on for a little while now and I can say that this is the first time Ive seen where you let a little of the real you poke through .

@@106277751 @1677751/ <p> This review comes a little too late to be taken seriously . Some upstart blogger offering his two cents on one of the darling networks of 2009 ? Most affiliates will tell you straight up that C2M is a candidate for being the top daddy dog network in the business and well I agree . Its pretty hard for any network to maintain a squeaky clean reputation given the amount of shit that gets slung at the walls on forums like Wicked Fire . Somehow Convert2Media has dodged the bullets and walked out strong as the network that 99% of affiliates refuse to criticize . <p> It sounds like I 'm building up to an attempted put down , but I 'm really not . C2M have earned their stripes and you 've got ta respect them , even if Rucks berries do n't  tickle your fancy . These guys know CPA affiliate marketing better than most . <h> What Makes Them Different ? <p> C2M is what I 'd call a very affiliate-centric network . I 've registered on networks in the past and instantly been left with the impression that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe its because it takes forever to get in touch with an affiliate manager . Maybe its because when I do , she 's cakefaced in to shape and does n't  know her pixels from her eyelashes . Oh the eyelashes . I think that 's how most networks get Shoemoney . Take your pick for eye candy from this bunch : <p> I 've worked with two affiliate managers at C2M and both of them have been insightful , helpful and to the point . Thereve been occasions where they 've looked at my situation and told me honestly that itd be worth testing an offer with a different network . Makes no sense from a business perspective , but somehow it does . They treat their affiliates with the respect that were not going to swear blind loyalty to a single network . I 'm a busy guy and I appreciate not being tapped up on AIM every 5 seconds and asked why I 'm not running offer XXX . <p> If you want to find out more about what truly establishes Convert2Media as a unique network , I 'd recommend checking out Andrew Wees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Payouts <p> The timing of this review is quite important in terms of scoping the variety of markets covered by C2M . Theyve been hot on acai , colon cleansing and bizopp for as long as I 've been active with them . But more recently , I 'm seeing a lot of micro niche offers rolled out . You 'll find rebills for combating flu , getting to sleep , quitting smokingall significant verticals that I personally see a lot of money in over the coming months . <p> As I understand , the guys are rolling out a bunch of cost-per-sale promotions in the very near future . Just this morning I received a network update announcing a backlog of over 25 offers that are about to go live . Clearly the advertisers are lining up to work with these guys . That says a lot for C2M , but also for the quality of the affiliates . <p> Private payouts are offered to the most successful publishers . You will generally need to be pushing over 100 sales a day to be considered for a bump . I 'd imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insurance type leads where a bump may come with quality traffic . <p> Either way , the street payouts are strong . I rarely see a rebill offer pushed for less than $35 . Some can go as high as $45 . For a street payout , that 's pretty damn impressive . <h> What You Need To Know <p> I was going to write a whole post dedicated to " things you could do that would probably piss Ruck off " , but I can summarize nicely here . Basically , you need to understand that the C2M guys are former heavy hitters as super affiliates in their own right . They do n't  hide the fact that they 've tried many of the darker arts of promotion that newer affiliates would consider new and clever . If you 're planning on black merry hatting your way to riches and fame , I dare say you could find an easier target than C2M . I have n't met the dude , but I get the impression that Ruck eats guys like you for breakfast . <p> Steve also knows a thing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I know the guys are big on getting their affiliates compliant and safe under the scrutiny of the FTC . If you 're serious about staying on the right side of the various advertising guidelines , C2M are happy to school you . When I was pushing bizopp traffic , I would regularly ask them for pointers on keeping my landing pages FTC-proof . I would suggest you do the same . They have a lot of helpful insight which you would do well to listen to . <p> One of the things Ive noticed about larger networks is that too many of them will encourage you to break whatever advertising boundary in the name of a conversion . Maybe its because your affiliate manager has n't  had his balls scraped for liability when the federal officers come calling . Either way , you 'll be told when you 're pushing the envelope . If your morals have n't already disintegrated completely . <p> All of the staff send out regular bulletins helpful bulletins . So many networks get lazy and list out the top performing offers expecting affiliates to do shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logging in 9 times out of 10 . C2M are particularly good in this department . If they have new offers going live , its quite common to receive tips in your inbox explaining methods of promotion . Do n't  expect a campaign to be dropped on your lap , but there 's enough hints to get your brain ticking . <p> If there 's one area I 'd like to see them step up their game , its in transferring some of those creative ideas to the newer offers on the network . The niche markets that were all stumbling blindly in to . If C2M can sell me a viable promotion method for anti-aging pet cream I will run that shit in to the ground as a mark of respect . <h> The Application Process <p> This is dangerous territory for retards . I remember not so long ago , C2M actually had to close applications to provide better support to their existing affiliates . Its a small network , but its growing fast . The floodgates have since been reopened and you can now submit an application . Get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you anything , it should be to hang the fuck up if they start talking to you about ninja optimization . Standard procedures apply for getting approved . Do n't  be afraid to chase them up if you have n't heard back from an application . Its clear that they spend most of their time pissing around on the phones to India . If you take the time to call them , you 're probably doubling your chances of getting accepted just through effort alone . Or if you 're unlucky , you might disrupt another YouTube outtakes video and end up blacklisted for life . In all the videos Steve has posted on his YouTube , I can practically smell the silence . This from a network that preaches the grind . <h> Overall Thoughts <p> Convert2Media receive enough praise from experienced affiliates to make this review totally pointless . Theyve built up an almost untouchable reputation for dealing with affiliates ( and advertisers ) fairly and transparently . I 'm not personally running much traffic through them at the moment but I always read their bulletins . <p> If I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is normally the first place I check . They have a ridiculous number of campaigns in hot demand verticals like acai , bizopp and teeth whitening . The signs are promising for finding a hot new niche given the recent influx of exclusive offers . <p> I would recommend Convert2Media to any affiliate but particularly to those slinging rebills . If you need a good selection of marginally different landing pages to test , C2M is literally packed to the rafters with good shit . Go and sign up . Just remember to deny all existence of SEZero. 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277752 @1677752/ <p> You can have the fastest web server in the world and the best domain , but if you do n't  have any affiliate offers to promote , you 're not going to make any money . Good offers are the reason for dinner on my table and stamps in my passport . They 're what makes our world go round , so promoting a good offer is pretty frigging important to your chances of success . <p> Before you can start promoting affiliate offers , you need to get with an affiliate network . These are middleman companies that will take a slice of your commission , in return for dealing with all the crap that you really do n't  want to be concerning yourself with on the advertiser side . <p> If you+GGve followed a network+GGs application process correctly , you shouldn+GGt have too many problems getting accepted . <p> However , there are some cases where you 'll need to make further contact before your application can be processed . Many marketers assume that if they+GGve heard nothing back from a network within a couple of days , they+GGve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rarely the case . <p> Its more likely that the network has simply put your application to one side and not acted on it yet . I+GGd recommend you pick up the phone and chase the network if you haven+GGt heard back from them within 24 hours . This might make you seem like a keen bean , but ultimately , it shows the network that you+GGre serious about working with them . Networks like to feel pampered by the enthusiasm of keen publishers . It gives them a break from dealing with moody bastards like me . <p> I+GGve had situations in the past where networks have failed to get back to me . Instead of grovelling on The Warrior Forum about another rejection , I+GGve busted out Skype and dialed internationally asking them to take a look over my application . Nine times out of ten you will be approved by the end of the conversation . Unless you suck really badly at talking on the phone . <p> You will find it extremely hard to get accepted on most mainstream CPA affiliate networks without a phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut in Indonesia . And if you happen to be working out of a hut in Indonesiasorry , pal . Maybe the Warrior Forum can help you . <h> What Kind Of Network Should I Join ? <p> There are enough affiliate networks to waste an entire day processing registration forms if you so felt the urge . Most of them will claim the same incentives : <p> If you believed every networks hype , you would n't have time to promote any actual offers because you 'd be forever bending over to register with another . The most important thing I can point out is that some networks are ideal for affiliates planning to drive traffic to their websites by paying for it . And some are more suited to the affiliates who use free marketing techniques . <p> You may have heard about CPA ( Cost-Per-Acquisition ) networks . These networks are famous for offers that are lucrative , easy to promote but often unstable . With CPA networks , you do n't  have to deliver sales . You can get paid for simply convincing a customer to register an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much more lucrative . A customer is generally much happier as long as he is n't paying money . CPA is known as a Performance-driven industry , however , and with good reason . If you send a bunch of crappy customers who do n't  want to spend money , the offer wont back out for the advertiser and everybody loses . <p> If you 're working with an ordinary network and only getting paid by the sale , you better be good at persuading those customers to whip out the credit card . <p> I prefer CPA networks , because that 's where I had my big break . But you will find many more reputable offers on networks like Commission Junction , ShareASale and Linkshare and most of these companies deal with advertisers who are paying by the sale . <p> So which type of network suits you ? The choice is yours . I 've included a selection of my recommended affiliate networks below : <h> Commission Junction <p> Youve probably heard of CJ . Its the largest affiliate network on the planet . Its size can only be compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ever need to speak to them . <p> Now let me get this out of the way before I go any further . Commission Junction is tainted by some of the worst publisher communications I 've ever had the misfortune of dealing with in my life . Emails go unanswered , support is aloof and the network has an uncanny ability of being able to make publishers feel like worthless small fish in a large pond . Even when they 're earning five figure sums in the space of a week . So why would I recommend them ? Quite simply because they have the widest selection of offers encompassing almost every niche you 're ever going to need in Internet Marketing . I fucking hate working with them . But its almost just about worth it for the rewards . <h> ShareASale <p> If you 're looking to work with sales rather than leads , I 've found ShareASale to be an excellent network that delivers a wide range of publisher features and much better support than the CJ juggernaut . It is n't blessed with anywhere near as many offers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of which I 've enjoyed a lot of success with on a personal level . <p> As far as the interface is concerned , you 're either gon na love it or hate it . I think its fine . There 's support for deep linking , all kinds of custom goodies and the tracking has never done me wrong . This is a stellar network , check it out . <h> Convert2Media <p> The first of the CPA networks I 'm going to recommend , and a powerhouse player in the rebill market . Convert2Media is one of the most respected CPA networks in the business . You know what you 're going to get with this crew . And that 's a two way relationship where respect is given both ways . So do n't  screw it up . From my experience , these guys are pretty strong on all rebill/continuity type offers ( some of the most lucrative in the industry ) . But more recently theyve been pushing quite a lot of gaming campaigns and zip/email submits too . <p> Its probably best to bed in at a more beginner-friendly CPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye for what you 're doing , shoot the C2M guys an application and go make some money . You can read my full Convert2Media review here . <h> Adsimilis <p> Adsimilis is a network I 've had a pretty close relationship with over the last few months . They are very hands-on with their publishers and the communication is excellent . If you ever have any questions about promoting an offer , or simply need to know what 's working well for others , they 're a great network to have in your repertoire . I recommend them primarily to publishers who are wanting to stray from the usual USA based offers . <p> The network has a large selection of campaigns for Europe and South America . It has some rare dating offers , usually on very high payouts . The management have proven to me in the past that they 're willing to pay you more if you 're willing to send them good quality traffic . If you 're not registered with these guys , I would highly recommend you get with them . Minor complaints over the irritating interface aside ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to drive some traffic . <p> Now that you 're registered with a few good networks , you need to select an offer you 'd like to promote and think about how you 're going to get some eyeballs to that offer . <h> Choosing The Best Offer To Promote <p> For those of you who suffer heart failure at the thought of selecting the right offer . Allow me to give you some blatantly phoned in advice . <p> The EPC is MUCH more important than the payout When you login to your affiliate network interface , you will be greeted by a bunch of columns and stats . EPC ( Earnings-per-click ) shows an average of what affiliates are making from an offer . A payout reveals absolutely nothing about the quality of the offer , or whether it sells . I could stick the essence of my balls in a jar and tag it at $100 , but it does n't  mean people are queuing up to buy them . EPC gives you an accurate baseline of how well an offer is converting . <p> Never promote shady offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your advertising account if you promote offers that do n't  coincide with their draconian guidelines . Be very careful about what and where you 're advertising . <p> Look at what offers other affiliates are promoting When you log in to Facebook , what advertisements do you see ? Are you being bombarded with dating ads ? Then there 's a good chance a large number of affiliates are profiting from those dating ads . Work out which offer they 're using , find the network that hosts it and copy them . <p> Avoid the most saturated markets if your budget is thin Industries like weight loss are worth millions and millions of dollars . So competing in that space is going to be a super competitive dogfight where you wo n't succeed unless you have a very unique take on the market , or a budget the size of Finchs pants . Choose an offer that has mainstream appeal , but a unique selling point that you can capitalize on . For example , instead of promoting general dating offers , try cornering part of the market . Like horny Catholic widows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older guys . Much less competition equals much greater chance of success . <p> Do n't  become loyal to an offer Never stick with what you know . You 're an affiliate marketer and your greatest strength is that you can change what you 're selling in an instant . Shop around with different networks for the best payout on any given offer . You can use this tool . Test different offers within your niche and keep testing until you find the maximum ROI . <p> Choose an offer that appeals to your strengths If there 's something we could use more of in the affiliate marketing industry , its definitely the presence of genuine experts in their field . If you 're knowledgeable on a subject , and can find an affiliate offer to match to that topic , by all means run with it . You have an enormous competitive advantage over 95% of the rest of us . <h> One Comment <p> Whilst I agree that EPC is more important than the payout , I would actually be careful about relying on EPC as a factor in itself ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are driving all sorts of traffic ( some from crappy sources ) to that specific offer . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

The secret to success lies in how we are perceived . By feeding readers the right blend of useless crap they already knew , and useless crap they always assumed , we can portray ourselves as figures of authority where it is n't truly deserved .

@@106277755 @1677755/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> One of the easiest ways to tell apart an affiliate marketer from another online professional is by inspecting his clusterfuck of a to-do list . On it you will find tasks that defy pattern , logic and too often sensibility . <p> I have explored many different theories of task management . From restricting my day to a maximum of 3 valuable tasks , to assigning letters and numbers to each , to completing the most important task first , to working in pomodoro sequence , to cramming more tasks in to a polyphasic sleep schedule ( and completely shagging myself in the process ) . <p> One of the takeaway lessons from these experiments , besides appreciating my need to sleep like a real human being , is that clustering similar tasks is nearly always more effective than jumping between projects like a Kardashian on crack . <p> Multi-tasking does not exist . <p> Science has a gone a long way to proving that effective multi-tasking is one of the great myths in our generation of workaholism . The brain can not focus on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and switch . Any illusion of multi-tasking is actually the ability to do this fast and effectively . <p> Affiliates , being suckers for to-do lists with juddering changes in direction , have it harder than most . We have to balance many different skills with the regular burden of being the guy who works from home and can therefore a ) pick up the kids , b ) wait for a delivery , c ) take an hour out of the way to run errands . <p> Go ahead . Look at what you 've worked on today and count the number of times you 've slammed the reset button . <p> Every time you switch from analysing campaigns to creating campaigns , that 's a reset . <p> Every time you switch from designing campaigns to blogging , that 's a reset . <p> Every time you switch from blogging to trolling oDesk , that 's a reset . <p> Every time you pick up a phone or refresh your inbox , that 's a reset . <p> Generally I find that the more resets I ask of myself the more shifts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to procrastinate . Too many resets and a kitten will eventually perish . <p> There 's a very simple solution . <p> Cluster your tasks and reduce the number of resets in your day . <p> Instead of working on multiple demanding projects , choose just one . Get in the zone and cling to it like a fly to a turd . <p> If you are anything like me , you will have 6 or 7 projects occupying your whiteboard at any given moment . In this case , a project per day is wishful thinking a great way to ensure you spend a lot of time grafting with none of the thrill of actually finishing something . If you are balancing multiple projects , I suggest dividing your days in to an AM and PM . Then clustering your tasks accordingly . <p> In the past , I would smatter my tasks on a colossal to-do list , which left me hopping between unrelated items , or worse , sandwiching my important tasks with stupid shit that would completely obliterate my focus . <p> By focusing on just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can leverage your lunch break as a natural reset . I have been known to go slightly AWOL on my lunch break , venturing in to town and succumbing to caffeine-aided introspection for hours on end . That 's okay . The AM and PM is purely symbolic ; a shift in focus marked by the annihilation of a Halloumi wrap and a brief respite . <p> Of course , the acid test of any task management philosophy is how you deal with chores and the arrival of the unexpected . For the latter , I have matured enough to pick my battles . That means slowly falling deaf and blind to the most common distractions of affiliate-kind , which from my experience is one question that never ceases to relent , " Could I be working on something that makes me more money than what I 'm already working on ? " The temptation is always to say yes , whereas common sense says if you do n't  finish your shit , you 'll never know and you 'll have wasted your time . <p> If an awesome CPA offer lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its gone by tomorrow . If my accountant has an urgent question ( " Hi Finch , where are you siphoning your money ? " ) , hell be phoning me instead of adding to my Inbox Unzero . <p> Acceptance that your entire life is n't going to crumble and burn if you fail to adopt a 24/7 vigil over the call of your name is pretty fucking essential to anybody who wants to stay sane ( or get something done ) in this industry . As for chores , well , there 's only so many times you can wear the same shirt before not smelling like a mountain troll becomes more important than your task management . <p> I have started to assign one day of the week to chores . <p> Just chores , nothing else . <p> Now that I live on my own , there 's a lot more flexibility in how I handle them . If i want to quit festering in my filth and bust out a vacuum , then that 's my initiative . The could rather than should makes a huge difference . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trash , or returning a phone call might only take minutes , but in momentum and concentration , they are like a sucker punch to the loins . Save it for your lunch break , or the end of the day , or just do what I am *almost* too ashamed to admit and hire a maid . <p> Remember , every time you switch attention from your goal , that 's a reset . <p> " We overestimate what we can accomplish in a day and underestimate what we can accomplish in a year . " Bill Gates <p> Its one of my favourite quotes , and its true . <p> How do you know when you 're overestimating what you can accomplish in a day ? 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I read " The Happiness Advantage " on your recommendation and loved it .

Being the sucker that I am for time management techniques , I thought I would share my favourite must-have tool for boosting productivity . <p> Its free , its simple , and as far as my whimsical attention span is concerned , its a bloody miracle that the thing actually works . <p> The tool in question is SimplyNoise.com . SimplyNoise is a white noise generator that serves no other purpose than to bombard your eardrums with a collection of static frequencies . At first listen , you will find white noise a poor alternative to whatever you had locked and loaded on Spotify . <p> There are no lyrics . The beat does n't  change . In fact , there is no beat . White noise is pretty much what Norman Bates would listen to and praise as his mothers favourite song . There is method in the madness , however , and there is good reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus . <p> As anybody who has recently seen Limitless will recall , the brain is a delicate organ . It can process a huge amount of information and then call upon it at will . But your brain does n't  always meet your demand when you want it to . Hence writers block , procrastination and those times where any little noise or distraction is capable of disrupting your thought flow . <p> White noise helps focus the mind by blanketing all the distracting sounds that our brain tries to latch on to . <p> If you imagine a room buzzing with 100 different voices , the combined frequencies produce a sound that the brain treats similarly to white noise . By tuning in to white noise you can therefore block out distractions like construction work , noisy neighbours and crying babies . The brain still hears them , but it adds those distractions to the rest of the frequency pile and allows you to maintain your focus . <p> If you work at home like me , you 'll probably appreciate that sounds can be amplified by simply being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barking to the building work going on outside . While I 'd be an utter fool to use this as the sole excuse for failing to meet my goals , it definitely pays to master your undivided attention . <p> Many people rely on sites like SimplyNoise to help them sleep . In fact , any insomniac should be able to relate to the frustration of things that go bump in the night . By blitzing the bedroom with white noise , you can sooth your brain and tune out of your surroundings . You can also irritate your girlfriend if she is n't the " Finchy needs to listen to his moonkissed dolphins or hell never get to sleep " kinda type . <p> You might not appreciate or even agree with the benefits of white noise , but a lot of workplaces already use it to generate a healthy working environment . Google search office white noise machine and you 'll find a bunch of companies that specialise in acoustics for the workplace . <p> My girlfriend refuses to acknowledge that SimplyNoise is anything more than a static irritant she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While she can happily work to the tune of Kim Kardashians inane fucking rabble on Channel E , I find myself getting distracted by my own iTunes playlists . <p> Let me know how you get on with the white noise generator .

@@106277760 @1677760/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Delayed gratification is the theory behind the old saying , " Good things come to those who wait " . It is our ability to resist the temptation of an immediate reward in favour of a larger prize in the future . <p> Numerous studies have shown the ability to delay gratification as one of the biggest indicators of success through life . <p> It can be relevant in so many ways ; from your ability to budget , to the type of woman you wake up next to , to your willingness to stoneface a Sausage &amp; Egg McMuffin in favour of training for a marathon at 5am . The latter of which , in my case , will never ever happen . <p> Those who can resist temptation in pursuit of long-term goals are blessed with an enormous advantage over the playing field . It is the essence of focus , concentration , productivity and even the classic quote that an affiliate ca n't go 7 hours without seeing on Facebook : <p> Looking at the career of Internet Marketers , many of us were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to running our own businesses . But it does n't  always stay that way . <p> In a rather cruel twist of fate , the more successful you become , the more distractions that entwine their way in to your life . Its kind of like Muse , the band . Does anybody remember how awesome Muse were in 2002-2003 ? <p> here 's a reminder : <p> Fast forward ten years and you 'll find a caricature of a space rock trio who have clearly spent too much time indulging in fantasies of the apocalypse . If Matt Bellamy spent less time playing with his admittedly very rich balls on Above Top Secret , and more hours alone with his guitar , hed probably write better rock songs . <p> Many artists produce their best work when the rewards and recognition are nowhere to be seen . It takes a special personality to cancel out the white noise ; to produce the best possible work ; when distraction is all around him . And that 's what success brings : distraction . <p> Vincent van Gogh , one of the greatest painters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could count on one hand the number of people that appreciated his work . Van Goghs tragedy , among many , was that he blew his brains out before seeing the recognition he deserved . But it does go some way to explaining why that work is so highly regarded , particularly for its emotional honesty . <p> There are only so many distractions that one man , a paintbrush and his mental illness has to bear . The product of that delayed gratification van Goghs lifetime battle with depression and introspection is what we now call genius . <p> I 'm not suggesting for a moment that the way to get in touch with your best possible work is to despair and retreat from the world . But I do believe that anybody who has the privilege of working from home has to become fine-tuned to his levels of comfort . <p> Too much comfort is a bad thing . <p> Too many distractions will fuck with your ability to see straight through them and catch the bigger prize . <p> On a personal level , this is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day job . <p> For a period of several months , I would work all day in the city , and then all night in my bedroom . There 's very little reward at 9:02am , day after day , parking at your desk and feeling like your every fibre has been shagged by a pygmy hippo . But there 's an awful lot of potential if you can sustain the act long enough to achieve progress that would n't have been possible at Pound a Pint Night . <p> The better you are at delaying rewards , the more productive you are likely to be in the meantime . Likewise , the more motivated you are , the more natural that is going to become . Learning to delay gratification is thus a two-part recipe of finding the right motivation and instilling the right discipline . <p> The effects it can have on your life are pretty remarkable <h> The Stanford Marshmallow Experiment <p> One of the most famous studies in to delayed gratification took place over 40 years ago at Stanford University , courtesy of psychologist Walter Mischel , 600 children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led each child in to a room free of distractions where they would find a treat of their choice , usually a marshmallow ( would have demanded a salted caramel brownie personally , but whatever ) . The children were told they could eat the marshmallow if they so wished or wait 15 minutes , and receive two . A very simple premise : more good things come to those who wait . <p> All of Mischels guinea pigs were aged 4 to 6 , and it was hoped that the experiment would reveal the age at which a child learns to defer gratification . Sure enough , there was a clear correlation between the older children and a better waiting game . But it was n't until a follow-up study , twenty years later , that the groundbreaking extent of those marshmallows became apparent . <p> The children who had shown the best ability to defer gratification ; to wait for the second marshmallow ; had gone on to lead strikingly more successful lives than those who caved in to the immediate reward . <p> The first follow-up study in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the self-imposed delay paradigm , were described more than 10 years later by their parents as adolescents who were significantly more competent " . A subjective analysis , admittedly , but one that would be backed by further findings . <p> The children who delayed gratification were later paired to better SAT scores , greater academic achievements , a healthier body mass index , among other favourable life outcomes . <p> Whether the ability to delay gratification comes from nature or nurturing is difficult to assess . A 2011 brain imaging study on the same Stanford test subjects ( now seasoned guinea pigs ) showed greater activity in the prefrontal cortex for the adept delayers , whereas those who struggled to resist the first marshmallow saw increased activity in the ventral striatum , an area of the brain commonly associated with addictions . <p> Biology and marshmallows aside , it does n't  take a rocket scientist to see how a talent for delaying gratification is useful in our world of immediate distractions . <p> A large number of affiliates walk this earth with the patience of bloodhounds ODing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theyd karate cock slap Mischel , steal the entire bag , and be promoting Adult Friend Finder before lunch . <p> Sohow do we manage that ? How do we keep an eye on the greater prize ? How in the name of Lucifers anus do we learn to defer gratification ? <h> Improving Your Ability to Delay Gratification <p> Alter The Path of Least Resistance <p> The Marshmallow experiment is interesting , but one of the conditions I find troubling is that the marshmallow had to remain in front of the child at all times . It was never more than a sweeping arms grab away , which is like sticking a bee in front of honey . <p> What would have happened if the child had been forced to stand up , cross the room , and climb up a pile of boxes if he wished to have the marshmallow ? This is what we call altering the path of least resistance . <p> You take temptation , you bag it up , and you get it the hell out of your sight . <p> In doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit , or not doing something stupid . <p> What 's a good way to stop yourself from splashing the cash on excessive online purchases that you probably cant afford ? Well , taking your credit cards and freezing them in a block of ice is one option . <p> I make this the equivalent of the consumer cooling off period . If a purchase is truly necessary , it can wait 24 hours while the ice thaws . <p> Note : I highly suggest you get your groceries in before freezing Mr. Plastic Fantastic , and do not try this with your business cards . It will not say much for your professionalism . <p> The frozen credit card is a good example of how placing a roadblock in the path of least resistance can save you during a moment of weakness . Its pretty extreme , but its a step in the right direction for people who never learn . <p> If you can take a bad habit and put it 30 seconds away , there 's a good chance you 'll remove the habit . I spoke about this before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting your phone in another room , hiding the PS3 controller in your loft , and so on . Alter the path of least resistance . <p> The less immediate the distraction becomes , the more likely you are to procrastinate over pursuing it , and maybe just maybe get some bloody work done . <p> I heard an amusing tale from a Yorkshire friend who did n't  want to have sex on a first date , so she would turn up in her least attractive underwear and abandon sexual hygiene for the day . The theory being that no matter how drunk she got , she would always remember that it was n't a good night to go home with company . I think she probably overestimated the underwear receptiveness of Sheffield men , but I can see her logic . Fair play to the crazy bitch . <p> Clearly , one of the best ways to delay gratification is to understand your own thought processes so that you can prepare for weak decisions and create gremlins to prevent them . <p> For example , if you are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to play a few games of pool , firstly a ) Do n't  be so stupid as to buy a pool table for your dining room . <p> And b ) If you are going to be so stupid , use it as a laundry post from Monday to Friday so it does n't  kill your career . <p> ( Life lessons . You 're welcome . ) <p> Kids Need to be Taught About Money <p> I believe in this quite passionately . <p> In school , we spend hours teaching our kids about how Jesus fed 5000 with bread and fish , but we do n't  teach them how to manage their money . That 's a pretty fucking big problem in my book . <p> Schools need to do away with political correctness , starting with religious education , and get teaching kids some life skills that actually matter . Like how to manage their finances . How to budget . How to distinguish between materialistic needs and paying the god damn gas bill . <p> While bestselling hack-jobs like Rich Dad Poor Dad have attempted to instill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should not be a responsibility left to men like Robert Kiyosaki . It should be taught in schools . In the absence of any foreseeable change , parents have to pick up the ball <p> Pressure on Parenting <p> I was having a conversation the other day about the difference between Yes parents and No parents , and whether it is good or bad for the kid being raised . <p> Like many key skills in life , the seeds of delayed gratification are sewn in childhood . Parents who feel inclined to say yes to their childs every demand are likely to give him a skewed attitude towards the supply and demand of getting what you want when he reaches adulthood . <p> I would argue that , similarly , parents who never praise , or who keep both eyes locked on expectations and minimum requirements ( you will get a degree ) are likely to inherit children with damaging self-esteem issues . And those can be just as difficult to shake . <p> Either way , I encounter so many 8-12 year old fuck-ups on the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " If you 're not ready for them , do n't  fucking have them . " <p> Parents need to prepare their kids for the real world by teaching them about money , and the critical law that governs just about every facet of our lives : supply and demand . <p> Money does n't  grow on trees , and neither should it . Expecting millions when your net output is peanuts just is n't going to work , as the Western electorate is only just discovering . If everybody could have what they wanted ; all of the time ; nothing would be worth having because all that would be left is sticks and stones . <p> Delayed gratification is a virtue to those who understand it , and a royal pain in the arse to those who do n't  .

Based on the first batch of data , I 'll be able to tell which angle/headline has the most potential then I 'll split test this against a new headline . And keep repeating until I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ill also weed out the images that do n't  get clicks and banish them from my hard drive forevermore . <p> As for landing pages if its a new angle , it needs a new landing page . Consistency in the conversion funnel is important and I think you can only achieve that by following through with your message . Baiting and switching is great for CTR but bad for CVR. 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

@@106277763 @1677763/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Its not rare to find that 80% of your sales are generated by 20% of your customers , or that 80% of your time is spent handling 20% of your chores . <p> This skewed outlook on life and business was first observed by the great Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto , who lent his name to the theory . <p> Pareto established , in the early twentieth century , that 80% of Italian land was owned by just 20% of the population . He later famously observed that 80% of the peas in his garden came from 20% of the pods . Spurred on by the unusual correlation , his work continued and the Pareto Principle became lodged not just in economic folklore , but in business minds alike . <p> By running a business that is effectively a one man show , I have become a great believer in the Pareto Principle . <p> Im convinced it can be applied to productivity . The principle is a great marker for ensuring I do n't  become bogged down in tasks that waste my limited time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I look at my to-do list , I can easily find tasks that satisfy my need to appear busy ; tasks that contribute very little to my bottom line . <p> As an Internet Marketer , I often find myself profiting from one particularly lucrative advertising campaign . On a good day , it makes my other efforts look like a complete waste of time . If the lucrative campaign earns more than the rest of my work combined , why would I insist on wasting 80% of my time chasing those dead ends ? <p> Probably because seeing the skewed reality is one thing . Acting on it is completely another . <p> The desire to appear busy is something that has been ingrained in us since childhood . Can you imagine the uproar at school had you refused to go to 80% of your classes ? Or the backlash from your employer if you only worked 2 hours of your contracted 8 ? <p> Where our productivity is concerned , we are highly trained animals . To stay busy is better than to look lazy , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so . <p> Sometimes its a welcome relief to step back and analyse where your success is coming from . What work is bringing in the bacon ? Which tasks are you splurging blood , sweat and tears over for little reward ? <p> These may seem like stupid questions . But I believe there 's much more potential in becoming a specialist , somebody who plays to his strengths , than a jack of all trades who could n't see his skill-set if it slapped him in the tits. 114274 @qwx974274 <p> Check out Filthy Rich Mind , a brand new project I 'm collaborating on with a couple of other writers in the self-improvement market .

Despite what they officially preach , they will do everything they can to avoid having to give you customer service or if they do its template replies , because that is the 80% of tasks that do n't  generate profit when customers do n't  want to pay extra for quality support . <p> Thanks for sharing about the Pareto Principle .

@@106277764 @1677764/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> At about 9pm on most nights , I find myself detouring from the productive tasks I 've been grinding away at during the day . My attention will begin to sag , and my browser will find its way back to Facebook or Twitter with increasing regularity . <p> 9pm is where my productivity ends and staying busy begins . <p> There 's a huge difference between productive work and work that simply keeps you busy . Arguably that difference is life and death , living and slaving . When work becomes a matter of passing idle time , our mental breakdown is soon to follow . Its the magic cocktail for exhaustion , depression and a tunnel with no light . <p> How do you know that you 're working to stay busy ? <p> You have 17 tabs active on your web browser . Four of them are Facebook , 1 of them is Twitter , and the rest are a combination of BBC Sport stories and Wikipedia entries on the First World War . <p> Your workflow consists of a juggling act between refreshing Facebook for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your control panel to see how many of the clicks have converted . You slip away in disgust at your lack of revenue , crack open a new browser on Mashable , and then repeat the same bloody process 4 minutes later . Probably in a new tab . <p> You cruise through the entire database of gigs on Fiverr , despite having no precise idea of what you 're looking to buy . You just know that you 're missing something important , and its being snapped up by your competition . Of course , your competition does n't  have a name or a face . Its simply a projected vision of your own self if only you were working twice as hard . <p> You invest an aimless hour of your time in to figures projection . Yes , this is the useless affiliate art of taking his stats from Day A and B , then multiplying them by a combination of 30 , 90 and 365 to find out how rich hell be 1 month , 3 months and 1 year from now . I have done this many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You refresh your bloody Gmail ! To hear from who , I have no idea . Perhaps the National Lotterys unclaimed millions department <p> You click on link after link of mildly stimulating headlines , knowing all too well that the information to follow is a rehash of a thousand similar articles youve already eyeballed to death . You know the information ca n't possibly help you , or it would have done 5 months ago . But you read it anyway . Why ? Because staying busy is better than being stationed away from the computer screen , where the magic email that says you 've finally made it ca n't land . <p> Do any of these symptoms sound familiar ? <p> Learning to recognise this transition in your day is the key to understanding where productivity ends and staying busy begins . Once you 've pinpointed the divide , you have half a chance at correcting it . <p> I 'm not saying recognition alone is a cure . We are highly trained creatures of habits . Its all too easy to convince ourselves that time is being spent effectively , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nutritious delicious Rustlers burger you ate in all of about 14 seconds . <p> Tip : Want an indication of how busy you feel ? Take a look at how quickly you eat . If you attack your meals like a wolf at a tea party , there 's probably a little voice in the back of your head singing , " Hey , you , do n't  you have some place to be ? " <p> We are fixated with the idea that doing something is better than nothing . But guess what ? That 's a steaming pile of horse shit . And you know it . <p> Doing nothing and shutting the hell up is important for many reasons . Not least because it gives your brain a chance to digest the ticking matrix of data and meaningless tasks that have bumrushed your day . <p> here 's a challenge . <p> Take 5 minutes . Sit your arse down away from the computer screen , and be silent . <p> Treasure them . They are the silent streaks of creativity that are routinely pummelled in to submission by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . <p> Without silence there is no context . Without silence there is no opportunity to disconnect from the day and regain control of where its heading . So , if you 've reached the tipping point where staying busy is your only desire stop . Disconnect . <p> Go outside and shut the fuck up . <p> Everything will make more sense when you return . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> I recently did an interview for GenerationY ( good new site ) on the trials of working from home .

@@106277766 @1677766/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> The line between profitability and hopelessness has become so thin that you are royally shooting yourself in the balls if you are not fighting for every last conversion . <p> A common problem I see with affiliate sales funnels is a lack of understanding for what constitutes a conversion . Sounds pretty obvious , right ? " Duh Finch , I get money when another sucker joins True . " Well , that 's almost correct . Unfortunately , the almost cripples many campaigns . <p> Before promoting any offer , you must take the time to research exactly when the conversion pixel fires . There 's no room for vague assumptions . " Joining True " paints a picture in my mind of the conversion pixel being fired as soon as the user selects a username and hits Next . Most of the time , this is not the case . <p> We have zip submits , single opt-ins ( SOI ) , double opt-ins ( DOI ) , questionnaires to answer , profile pictures to upload , applications to download , first orders to place every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be fired . <p> The definition of " joining a site " is black and white . But your conversion is n't . Do n't  make the mistake of assuming they are one and the same . <p> Here are some general guidelines for how your landing pages can be adapted to suit each conversion type . <h> Zip submits <p> Generally seen as the easiest affiliate offers to promote , zip submits do exactly what they say on the tin . As soon as the user submits his zip-code , you get your conversion . The payouts on these offers are predictably low to offset the unpredictability of the traffic quality . <p> The golden rule of promoting zip submits is to hold the advertisers hand and give them exactly what they want . There 's no point in delivering poor quality traffic . Youll be scrubbed to Timbuktu in no time . <h> Single opt-ins <p> A single opt-in requires the user to submit his email address . However , the conversion is triggered after the submission rather than at the point of confirmation . You 'll find a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big bucks , but its better than a zip submit . <p> In my opinion , the large majority of affiliates use landing pages that are aimed at achieving a single opt-in . Its the standard entry point . But think about it logically . If the advertiser is paying out on a single opt-in , you can probably increase your traffic quality substantially simply by treating the offer like a double opt-in . Encourage and incentivize the user to confirm his email address . This may have to come at the price of one of our favourite affiliate tactics : completely bullshitting the real nature of the offer . " Hey , where all the single soldiers at ? " <h> Double opt-ins <p> A confirmed double opt-in is worth infinitely more than a single opt-in . Your payouts will traditionally reflect this by offering double for the confirmed email . <p> Something to keep in mind with double opt-in campaigns , particularly in the dating vertical , is that it makes no sense to calculate ROI on an ongoing live basis . A small but significant percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will get busy , distracted , or otherwise torn away from their Gmail . This can lead to a small trickle of conversions being fired the next morning . Ever had 0 clicks and 3 conversions ? Well , there you go . <p> However , if you 're monitoring your stats like a hawk , what are you going to think when you finish the evening taking a loss ? Youve probably already deleted the campaign by then . <p> Always let your conversions filter through before making any snap judgments . <h> Survey/questionnaire completion <p> Some offers require the completion of an entire questionnaire before the conversion is recorded . Now imagine you 're the stereotypical battering-ram of a publisher who cares not for such details . You design a landing page with a teasing call-to-action like this : <p> " Register in 45 Seconds or Less ! " <p> Sounds nice and coaxing , right ? In some cases this works as a great hook . But its a terrible call-to-action when the conversion pixel is only fired after a 15 minute questionnaire . <p> I see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealmakers . They sell every offer with the brevity of a single opt-in , when they should actually be shooting for a solid incentive to complete Steps A , B and C. <p> In instances where the user is required to navigate his way through a complex 15 minute interrogation , your landing page has a duty to sell this process and make it seem worthwhile . How could you get a user to answer a questionnaire ? <p> To give you an example , on dating sites , I use it to filter out the bad dates that the user will be avoiding when she joins the new service . Its quality protection , because she only deserves the best . <h> Profile photo upload <p> This is another common requirement on high-payout dating offers . <p> Offers that convert only after a profile photo upload would have worried the crap out of me 5 years ago . But now thanks to Facebook , even technophobic 75 year old grandmas have photos at their disposal . <p> The secret to nailing these conversions is to make a direct reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branding the site as an unusual paradise where men actually receive messages from hot girls , you should make it clear that communications increase X% when the user adds his photo . Or say that members without a photo are being culled and will not qualify for the free trial offer . Whatever puts the thought in his head and safeguards your conversion . <h> Converts on download <p> There are many toolbar and gaming offers out there where the user is expected not only to sign up , but to download and sometimes even play the game for the first time . <p> For single opt-in minded folk , I like to call this the minefield offer . <p> Its littered with so many what-ifs that the challenge is as much about hitting the right carefree demographic as it is selling the product . A golden rule that Ive adopted is to avoid targeting users who are likely to be on their work computers . This crowd does not want to download and leave a trace . So you will need to day-part and keep a tight hold over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con the user here . Your best step forward is to sell the offer as a legitimate must-have and hope that the users interest is perked enough to follow the necessary steps . <p> For gaming offers , " Can you beat this ridiculous score ? " is a winning hook . <h> So , how are your conversions today ? <p> Take a look at your own sales funnels . Be honest . <p> Has it all gone slightly tits-up ? <p> Your landing page must not only sell the offer . It must sell the required steps necessary to secure the conversion . <p> As I said on StackThatMoney this week , your sales funnel has to be designed to shove the user to the conversion pixel , NOT purely to get them to choose a username and press Next .

I always tell affiliates to understand how the offer functions , its even more important with mobile where you have everything from ppCall call length , to 2 click flows , to app downloads/installs . <p> EWA Helps More ! I 'll give them that . You really ca n't beat Ryan as a network owner , and their guides are pretty decent . However , their AMs , including his brother are complete fucking lazy butt-tards . Basically , if the network was 10 Ryans theyd have great management . <p> EWA Pays More ! This statement is about as murky as an outhouse shitter . Do the offers pay more ? Clearly not in every instance . Do they pay more on volume than any other network ? CJ probably has them by $1.28 <p> Wait , what ? This was just about annoying banners ? Not really , guys . This ties in quit nicely to the forever-21 year olds post . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of context . Just as , pump and dump copy will lead to dumped , half-ass conversions . <p> You want to sell a lot of someones on something here , right ? Trust me , you do . <p> To further expand on my favorite biscuit eaters post , you need to mind the backend . What does that mean ? Well , simply . The advertiser does n't  give a flying fuck how many conversions ( CPL , Signups , emails ) you send . Why ? Because it has to BACK OUT for them . If you 're just thinking " pixel " , you 're fucked in the long run , but David touched on something besides innocent farm animals here , the whole point is that you need to focus on what the advertiser wants . If you 're pushing a dating offer that pays CPL , yet really only makes any money for the advertiser on CPShow well do you think cramming a boatload of misled people up their ass is going to fare on your stats ? Or your longevity in that program ? Any guesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPL is a great way for them to get a KPI at a **29;133;TOOLONG margin than direct advertising , but ultimately , they only care about the final conversion the sale ; and that sale will only come from quality traffic that has been groomed to convert from the start . <p> Treat every offer like they have to hit the wall of conversion , the last stop on the train , and you 'll be a better person . Ok , you might still be a dipshit , but you 'll at least make enough money to hire a designer to make your fucking banners . <p> I 've always preached the need to deliver traffic that backs out for the advertiser , and it certainly makes sense to aim for a sale rather than a conversion pixel somewhere in the funnel . <p> That said , I still think affiliates would save themselves a whole lot of money and time by evaluating offers and their conversion point more closely . Extra steps in the process demand extra dollars on the payout . You can rule out a lot of offers just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Completely agree with you . Its too bad most networks are in the business of short term game and so that ideology gets passed down to affiliates encouraging cloaking , non compliance , and outright fraud . <p> Not sure what " aka Zig " means , but ya AR , I agree MANY networks preach the short game , because being an affiliate in this climate is short by nature ( thank you , fraud , small-time offers , and advertisers hiring people like us ) . <p> In Finchys defense , he did just write an anti-cloaking post recently that more people should read as much as I hate to admit that . <p> @Still right . I do n't  know who you are talking about EWA like that.But I love you . Every point you made is right on point . Funny thing is they 're one of the few networks that constantly advertise " WEEKLIES FOR EVERYONE ! " yet I know a handful of affiliates ( no longer running with them ) that went 4-6 weeks over the last few months to get payment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucks ass . Its propaganda at its finest with their martyr affiliates and Facebook group BS . <p> EWA is also another network that encourages and even provides a resource to buy and use a cloaker . Way to go ! But I wo n't run with a network that does that . <p> @smutmoney one of these days I may reveal myself and reach out to Finch and say " Dude , I 'm sorry for constantly bashing on you " but now is not that time . <p> Heres what I 'll give Ryan , he s hustling . And by hustling , I do n't  mean in the retarded inner-city rapper way that you pretend to work for a living while writing poor lyrics about shit you never did and hoping to live off your meager record advance for the rest of your life , I 'm saying , he actually puts in time to achieve a goal . Is it mostly ego and selfish ? Sure . No different than us . Does it mean his network rocks ? No , quite the opposite . Do I like him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industry of networks that do n't  play ball . He DOES respond to emails , and if he ca n't help , he points you in the right direction . Does that mean I get fucking paid on time ? Not so much . Does that mean I get top tier rev share ? No , you go direct for that . He does however try , and that 's more than I can say for many AMs that take a week to respond , and push the same stale email submits like they actually fucking deliver ROI for anyone not running a torrent site . <p> First and foremost , remember you 're dealing with a marketer running a network . He s the Tony Fucking Robbins of network owners , but you cant knock him for putting on a show . One of these days , probably when he turns 25 or so , hell realize a show , and the subsequent product/service that follows , must have enough substance to stand on its own . You can push shady shit for only so long before you get burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolt and very few network owners are working towards a " long money " solution including him . Its more a " state of the industry " problem than greed , if you get that . <p> I respect him as a marketer , and " drive " should be respected by everyone ( unless you 're talking about the movie ) . My hope , really . Is that more of the networks start making pushes to follow a similar style . " Do more , do better " , whatever the fuck it is he s preaching , because that 's at the core of what we all need competition , equality and stability . I think he s truly trying , and I can tell you networks like CJ truly are n't  . <p> You know , now that I think about it . Maybe we should just start bagging on all the so-called " super affiliate " bloggers out there . Its laughable .

We found plenty of good food and some interesting Japanese bars which reminded me just how much I do n't  miss life before the smoking ban in bars and clubs . <p> The city has lots of British-style architecture as remnants of its colonial past . A nice place to walk around with beautiful Mediterranean style weather . <p> We used an agent to get our visas renewed while we were here . <p> You know its a funny year when you 're sitting in a hotel lobby , wearing sunglasses , waiting for Abdul the runner to come and pick up your passport . <p> You wonder what the doormans thinking as he sees the money change hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , at 3 ? Do n't  be late we 've got a flight to catch . " <h> Vientiane , Laos <p> Would I recommend a visit to Vientiane ? <p> Sure , just like I 'd recommend shutting your balls in a car window . <p> We stayed in a hotel that I later discovered had been busted for child trafficking . This mute point has n't  affected its lofty ranking on Trip Advisor , which says a lot about the competition . <p> And the Gary Glitter types congregated around the pool . <p> ( I purposefully did n't  shave for the entire holiday . ) <p> There are some nice temples , cheap markets and a massive fuck-off river with some history behind it . All things somebody with a little culture might appreciate . <p> Alas , I spent most of the time patching in to BBC Sport to keep up with the cricket . <h> Saigon ( HCMC ) , Vietnam <p> The War Remnants Museum was worth a visit for its ( one-sided ) account of Americas crimes during the Vietnam conflict . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genocide Museum in Cambodia , which is by far the most affecting war museum I 've visited . The stench of death there gets under your skin and lives on in your dreams . <p> We made a huge tourist error in boarding a taxi parked up outside the museum . Of course , the meter was obviously going to be rigged . <p> The fare started bouncing upwards within a couple of minutes , leading to a classically British display of anger : politely asking to pull over whilst openly discussing how much to pay the scammer . <p> We eventually decided : nothing . <p> And ran away . <p> But not before I found time to take this photo of the chancy prick : <p> We should have known better . <p> Tourist 101 . Never get in a parked taxi outside a tourist attraction in South East Asia . <h> Balancing Work and Bangkok <p> Between trips abroad , and seeing various parts of Thailand , there comes the small issue of work . <p> One of my biggest concerns about moving to Asia was , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , admittedly , a creature of habit . <p> Back in London , I could n't function in the morning until I 'd conquered my daily routine : <p> Feed the pups <p> Have a shower <p> Head to the Petch ( my affectionate term for a Petrol Station that stocks Costa Express and vanilla muffins ) <p> Scan The Times <p> Wallow in coffee beans and rifle through my inbox <p> This routine guided me to a moment of spark at about 10:25am when I 'd suddenly think , " Shit , hold on , am I not supposed to be working on campaigns ? " <p> And with a nervous fart , I 'd assault the day . <p> In Thailand ? <p> Not much has changed , except the scenery and my choice of breakfast . <p> For those who give a shit about daily routines , here 's how I design mine . <p> I divide the day in to four periods : <p> Before Breakfast : 8:30 to 10:45 <p> After Breakfast : 11:00 to 12:45 <p> Before Lunch : 1:00 to 2:00 <p> After Lunch : 3:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating to literally everything I do . ) <p> I also divide my work in to four distinct phases : <p> Management <p> Creativity <p> Production <p> Autopilot <p> I assign them like this : <p> Before Breakfast 8:30 to 10:45Management Phase <p> Here I 'll take on management tasks like briefing my team , responding to emails , tracking projects , and viewing the trends of campaigns . I 'll examine my scorecard ( KPIs ) of the previous days stats , which gives a breakdown of performance across my entire business . <p> Whatever needs following up gets assigned and scheduled . <p> By the time 10:45 arrives , my loins are quivering for coffee beans . <p> Its off to Au Bon Pain , Wonderwall , or some other random establishment on Sukhumvit Soi 31 . <p> After Breakfast 11:00 to 12:45Creativity Phase <p> After breakfast I enter my creativity phase . <p> This is when I will carry out any writing ( e.g. Premium Posts ) , lay out ad copy , and find solutions to problems in websites and campaigns I am working on . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period . <p> I find it easy to experience flow in the morning in coffee shops so I use the opportunity to attack any task that needs my full concentration . <p> I wish I could do more of this work , but it requires an intense focus the likes of which I can only muster for around two hours per day . <p> One thing Ive learnt is that two hours is all you need to achieve more productive work than most people manage in their entire week . <p> Before Lunch 1:00 to 2:00Execution / Production Phase <p> The walk home is a good chance to mentally reset . <p> I now have two pomodoros to charge through production related work . This could be making campaign changes , preparing websites , tweaking landing pages , or most often split testing ad combinations . <p> I like to restrict the window to just a single hour since this work is very easy to conflate in to half a day if you give it the chance . <p> My irrepressible rumbling gut assures that I get through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then I go out for lunch , usually with my girlfriend . <p> After we 've eaten , I 'll disappear to another coffee shop and enter the longest period of the day : <p> Autopilot work . <p> This is the stuff I need to do that does n't  occupy any significant brainpower . <p> I find that my mind and body naturally crash after lunch , so this is a good chance to crack out Spotify and cruise through the afternoon with a series of easy wins . <p> I assign any tasks that do n't  require major decision making or creativity to my Autopilot phase . <p> This is the session for detailed emails , or phone calls , or follow-ups . Its where I evaluate the work from my team and provide feedback or new instructions . Ill also carry out research to support the rest of my phases . <p> At some point between 6 to 7pm , I 'll head downstairs to the pool or the gym . <p> After which , surprise suprise , I 'm hungry again . <p> Fat bastard . <p> Could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The main gains I have in Bangkok are : <p> The food is amazing <p> The location is inspiring <p> The weather is glorious <p> I have a pool and gym downstairs <p> The small things add up to a daily routine that suits my lifestyle perfectly . <h> Plans for 2016 <p> Were staying in Thailand for at least another year . <p> Next stop is back to London to see friends and family in April . <p> One of the things I learnt when I moved back from Thailand in 2011 was that while you miss people , naturally , the pang does n't  justify relocating 5000 miles just to be permanently near them . <p> Quality time together is better than the false comfort of knowing somebody is 5 miles away and yet still not seeing them . <p> Some of the places I plan to visit in 2016 : <p> Mount Kinabulo ( Borneo ) , Australia , Cambodia , Germany ( for AWE ) and one of the major US conferences " probably ASE in New York City . <p> Plus , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its a stunning country . <p> Stunningly flawed in so many ways , and yet still an amazing place to live . <p> Plans For This Blog ? <p> None . <p> I 'm releasing a new volume of Premium Posts next month , which is likely to be the final post on FinchSells.com , and my last public contribution to the affiliate industry . 114270 @qwx974270 114270 @qwx974270 <p> We have a natural bias to focus on the bright spots of campaigns ; the 2% of conversions in the 10% of campaigns that whisper , " Money not wasted .

Some affiliates manage it better than others . I cant for the life of me understand how any of you achieve more than a sustained migraine by logging in to AIM , or by relaying your every thought to Twitter . <p> For all the productivity tips in the world , I have three simple commandments that cut straight to the chase . Oh and a split personality , to hold myself accountable . <p> Do n't  log on to a computer out of boredom . <p> Do n't  open your emails if you do n't  plan on replying to them . <p> Do n't  sit down to work without a tangible target of what you plan to achieve . <p> When I look back at my failed projects and I 'd need 20/20 eyesight to see to the bottom of the list there 's a recurring trend that sets the losers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sheer indifference towards thinking about them every day . <p> So after flicking through my Analytics account yesterday , I guess you could say the skies parted and a lightbulb flashed above my head . One of my dearest old websites , and very first affiliate project in fact , was about to get the chop . <p> The website receives a small trickle of hits . On a good week , itll even turnover a few sales . But the site is about learning French ( among other languages ) , and as most people who know me can confirm mon francais est a petite bit shit , merci beaucoup . <p> To invest any more energy in to establishing a website where I have no reputable knowledge , and no vision for how I could make it work , would be like Wayne Rooney sitting down and attempting a crossword . There 's just no point . <p> This takes me back to Do n't  Number Three from my commandments above . <p> I can guarantee that if I sit down at my desk without a clear vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sodding off for an early lunch having achieved what I started with absolutely nothing . <p> Why bother to enter your office if you do n't  have an objective ? This is the type of mistake that I would compare to jumping in the middle of the ocean on a raft without an oar . You 're never going to control where you end up , and you 'll probably just exert a lot of energy to end up where you started . <p> How many affiliates have felt that at the end of the day before ? <p> A useful exercise , which I believe every affiliate should swear by , involves a month of keeping accurate records . <p> I know its not cool to keep a journal . But for the purpose of evaluating your own productivity and potential , go ahead and spend a month recording exactly what you work on every day . Do n't  get sloppy . Record every last meaningless task you devote your energies to . <p> In an additional spreadsheet , record your daily earnings and match the income to the corresponding tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for a reality check . I predict that 20% of your time spent working will be responsible for 80% of the income produced . <p> That 's probably not surprising to many of you . But where the reality check becomes necessary is in justifying the merits of the other 80% of work that occupies our schedules during the month . <p> Look closely at the tasks that swallow 80% of your time . Which of these projects do you have a clear vision for , and which are simply helping you to stay busy ? <p> Scrap whichever projects are making slow progress , little money , and perhaps even more importantly the projects that you do n't  see yourself being involved with 3 years from now . The " do I truly give a shit about this niche ? " question has always been my great acid test for whether I 'm going to see a project through to the bitter end . <p> If my answer is no , the likelihood is that I 've spent too long logging on to my computer out of boredom , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> here 's a suggestion for you . Next Monday morning , pencil in some appraisal meetings with each of the projects in your Analytics account . Take on the split personality of an overbearing boss who cares little for sentiment and everything for results . <p> " How do you think you 've performed over the last six months , little affiliate site ? " " Where do you see your earnings this time next year ? " " Are you capable of reaching your targets or are you full of bullshit like Finchs french ? " <p> Now let the boss in you decide the fate and credibility of those answers . You would n't hire a professional to do a bad job , would you ? So why excuse your own poor performance ? <p> Cut the crap and optimise your business like you would with any lucrative affiliate campaign . Theres money to be made , and time to be saved ! <p> If you 're not already registered on PPV Playbook , you are missing a beat sunshine !

@@106277774 @1677774/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> This is a law of affiliate marketing that will remain true as long as the industry exists . It does n't  matter how skilled you are , or how ambitious , or even how lucky ; if you fail to appreciate the importance of concentrated effort , you will forever be surrounded by mediocre results . <p> The law applies to monetizing traffic sources , succeeding in new verticals , building websites , running ad campaigns , as well as to learning just about any part of our craft . <p> If you do n't  focus your efforts , you 're destined for mediocrity . <h> Ping Pong Marketing <p> Ping pong marketer is my friendly term for the many , many affiliates who are reactive rather than proactive . They get bounced around the online marketing table by two highly skilled players : the traffic source , and the merchant . <p> In the space of just 24 hours , the ping pong marketer may find himself smashed in to a corner by Facebook , only to be crashed back by a merchant that did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whooping him over the net ( and banning his account ) , before Mate1 gets pissed with his leads , unloads a mountain of chargebacks and sends him scuttling once again . <p> The ping pong marketer is forever getting his business scattered across the table by other real players who know exactly how to use and abuse him . Eventually , the ping pong marketer is left battered , broken , and disregarded . <p> It does n't  have to be this way . <p> The ping pong marketer is often responsible for his own demise . He commits an act of affiliate marketing suicide , tightening his own noose while remaining blissfully unaware . Do the scenarios below sound familiar ? <p> First degree suicide Where you bounce from niche to niche , offer to offer , and traffic source to traffic source . Your guideline for launching a campaign is hearsay , or what a rogue affiliate manager from a network you do n't  even recognise told you . Your attention span is so fleeting , your commitment so flimsy , that you rarely get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ( many ) campaigns . <p> Second degree suicide If you swing too far to the opposite end of the OCD scale , you can ruin your chances of success by becoming a micro-management extremist . These individuals cant go 10 minutes without checking their ad spend , or their clickthrough rates . They do n't  focus on the end game . They focus on the emotional highs and lows of losing or making money , and they react accordingly . If you are not focused enough to reject short term decision-making that is not backed up by data , you will once again become the ping pong marketer . <p> The cure to ping pong marketing is to react less and plan more intensively . To bring value to a sales funnel the primary job of every affiliate marketer , let us not forget you must increase your level of knowledge and expertise . Its all about mastering the craft of relating back to what people want . <h> How to Master Any Part of Affiliate Marketing <p> Unless you are blessed with incredible fortune , the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concept 100% and execute it better than your peers . The web is littered with half finished affiliate websites , and badly executed CPA campaigns . You can always tell the guys who attempt to master their craft from those who attempt to go live on every project within 15 minutes . The latter are rarely seen again . <p> So , how do we commit to a project 100% ? <p> Besides the golden rule of taking immediate action , here are some important considerations . <p> Immerse yourself in the trenches . <p> If you advertise to 50 year old women on Plentyoffish , sign up on Plentyoffish as a 50 year old woman and take notes on the experience . What ads do you see ? What messages do you receive ? What is the typical user experience of a sweet middle-aged lady searching for love on the Internet ? Until you know what it looks like on the other side of the fence , you cant possibly hope to create masterful ad campaigns . <p> I know many affiliate marketers will shit bricks at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information to be gleaned from what customers like and what customers hate is absolutely priceless . It helps that so many consumers are bordering on the retarded , happy to report companies as scams when its their own sense of judgement that should be brought in to question . Lemmings will be lemmings , right ? <p> Use forums like Scam to search for similar sites in your niche , and particularly any undercurrent concerns that might be present when you bombard those same users with your ads . Dig under the fingernails of your target market . <p> Do you research your competition ? Really ? <p> We overestimate what we can achieve in a day , and underestimate what we can achieve in a year . This saying rings loud and true when it comes to weighing up our competition . <p> I sense that many affiliates commit the mistake of over-simplifying how easy they can replicate the success of their peers ( see the number of ripped ads and landing pages ? ) , while underestimating their own ability to create powerful engaging campaigns when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time you spent more than 24 hours researching a campaign ? Or more than 24 hours analysing the exact blueprints of the competitors you hope to brush aside in one swish of your mouse ? Respect your competition but avoid an ugly case of small man syndrome . <p> Elabourate sales funnels and sophisticated affiliate campaigns might not be executable by 5pm , but they wo n't take the rest of 2012 . Take your time to do the job properly , especially the pre-execution phase . Many affiliates end up with failed campaigns not because their execution was wrong , or because affiliate marketing is dead , but because their maths did n't  add up . <p> Leverage people wisely <p> When I say leverage people wisely , I do n't  mean sign up to the first thousand dollar consulting gig that comes your way .

Make sure they know that you are their man ( or girl ) when a hot bizopp comes through the gates . It sounds like a mute point , but simply establishing yourself as a specialist at X gives you a much greater chance of monetizing the hottest offers before they become saturated . <p> Do n't  brand yourself as a bits and pieces marketer . You 'll find your inbox full of more bits and pieces than you could ever shake a stick at . Make your speciality clear . Tell everybody you work with that you are focused on X , and you do n't  want to be tapped up with a thousand distractions per minute unless they are directly applicable . <p> Even if you are running zero traffic through a network , it will instantly elevate your credibility to have these clear expectations in place .

I want them . <p> There are networks with gigantic lists of inactive affiliates . <p> How do you get that traffic back ? <p> There 's one outreach method that remains vastly underrated by pretty much every network that I work with , and that is the weekly EPC report . <p> Networks that keep me in the loop about their best performing offers get more of my business . <p> Guys , I would pay you to keep your stats up to date . It saves me money in the time that I do n't  waste chasing them . <p> here 's a little perspective : <p> On Monday morning , every Monday morning , I search my Gmail for the terms weekly EPC and top performing offer . The networks that have contacted me with this information are instantly filtered from the rest of the chaff . They are brought to my immediate attention . <p> I 'm probably running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What excuse do you have for not telling your affiliates which offers they should be promoting ? <p> 3 . Resist the industry marketing jargon . <p> We work in advertising . <p> Correct ? <p> Its amazing how many networks promote their features rather than their benefits . <p> High payouts are not a benefit . They are an expected feature of a good network . <p> Weekly payouts are not a benefit . They are a necessity . <p> Access to thousands of offers ? That 's not a benefit . That 's a pain in the arse . CPA affiliates do not promote thousands of offers . <p> The language networks use to attract affiliates is littered with features , not benefits . And that 's why your marketing is so ineffective . <p> If you really want to get our business , here are some pointers . <p> 1 . There is no such thing as unrivaled in the network space . No matter how good you are , we will always do business with your rivals . Positioning your brand as the only option hurts your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major unspoken benefit . <p> 2 . We are banner blind to the best payouts . If you are going to promote a real benefit , tell us what is new , exclusive , and unsaturated . Where these offers are concerned , the payout takes care of itself . <p> 3 . Make us like you . <p> Given the enormous competition , and how relatively little there is to distinguish you by , a simple way to get more business is to make us like you more than we like your rivals . <p> We are fickle , yes , but this applies to just about any industry . <p> The more we like you , the more we want to work with you . <p> How do you make us like you ? <p> Engage in the affiliate community . Learn the language spoken by your publishers . Appeal to it . Hold your own meetups . Use Facebook and Twitter to create dossiers on your affiliates . Use what you learn to engage them before you pitch them . Use it to make outreach more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff to trawl the forums offering insight and perspective ; do n't  wait for a negative thread with your name on it . Resist slagging wars with other networks . Never call yourself the best network , or the most exclusive network . Act like one . We will always be the judge . <p> In short <p> Most networks rely on a theory that the best payouts , best terms and widest array of offers will be enough to seduce an affiliate . <p> From my perspective , what we are actually looking for is responsiveness , honesty and likeability . <p> Providing your features are on par with other networks , it is these benefits that will get you ahead . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Volume X is now the bestselling release in my entire Premium Posts series .

" or " How do I get in to Alexas top 100,000 ? " <p> It has become popular geekspeak to dismiss both PageRank and Alexa as useless metrics from a prehistoric age . Neither are accurate depictions of your sites success , so why bother paying attention to them ? This advice typically comes from the same mob who insist on not providing support for IE because its the worst web browser , in their expert opinions . <p> I agree with the sentiment , but I completely disagree with their interpretation of what equals value on the web . In my opinion , Alexa and PageRank will be valuable metrics as long as paying advertisers continue to use them as guidelines for measuring their investments . <p> Google PageRank has to be one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk mail right now , Im guaranteed to find a whole bunch of sales pitches from so-called SEO professionals offering to improve my PageRank so that I can drive more traffic to my site . This evidence , right here , goes a long way to explaining why their shit lands in my junk box . <p> Toolbar PageRank is disconnected from the actual ranking algorithm that Google uses to place your pages in its search listings . They are not related , although they may share similar data . PageRank has developed a reputation as a useless metric . Its the distant bastard cousin of the true ranking algorithm wed all love to know . <p> However , PageRank can still add value to your website . There are swaths of advertisers with money to spend . Advertisers who will continue to place artificial value on PR . And if that 's the difference between your site attracting advertisers or not , would n't you be a fool not to value your little green progress bar ? <p> The Alexa rank is very similar . Most of us with our heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is twisted at best , and complete bollocks at worst . But does this matter if advertisers are investing in what they believe to be one of the top 20,000 websites in America ? <p> There 's a small but very active market for professional site-flippers who know exactly how these factors can be used as an advantage . I know one particular site-flipper who develops turnkey websites and massively inflates their value by playing to the perception . <p> He does n't  bother with the chore of building a brand . No , that would n't catch the eye . Instead he works meticulously to inflate PR , boost Alexa rank and improve a bunch of other key measurements that he knows the buyers are impressed by . <p> He banks a lot of money by simply knowing his market . <p> If you 're building a website from scratch with the intention of turning it in to an advertising machine , or flipping it for profit , look closely at what your market values and then build it in that image . <p> PageRank and Alexa rankings are only useless metrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who still care . I would never encourage somebody to base their marketing efforts purely around increasing these values . But to dismiss them as pointless is as dumb as not listening to what your customers are basing their purchases on . <p> In my opinion , your website is only as valuable as the money you make from it . If your primary income is through selling advertising space , you need to be speaking in the buyers language . This is something I stress time and time again . It does n't  matter how much knowledge you 've accumulated to tell them otherwise . Putting across the right image and ticking the right boxes is all you can do . <p> If the people buying ads are basing their decisions on search engine rankings , you need to rank well . If they 're basing their decisions on branding , you need to brand well . If they still cling to measuring scales like Alexa and PageRank , I hate to say it , but you need to consider them too . <p> I do n't  want this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because that 's the last message I 'm trying to convey . I 'd be about as popular as the guy petitioning equal rights for IE6 . But I do believe that any measurement of a sites value can be given a positive spin and used as bait to attract more advertisers . If this means agitating a few of the Google PR " myth debunkers " , then so be it . <p> We often confuse our webmaster ideology with real world practicality . What we know means precisely squat diddily compared to what the guy with the credit card in his hand thinks he knows . 114274 @qwx974274 114272 @qwx974272 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 2 Comments <p> " The Unfashionable Value of Alex and PageRank " Do your Alexa and Google PageRank ratings actually indicate anything at all ?

@@106277778 @1677778/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> One of the most common questions I see on affiliate marketing forums is the classic " Should I link directly to an offer or build a landing page ? " <p> I can count on one hand the number of campaigns Ive made money from without the help of a landing page . Direct linking may work for some . But its never outperformed any of my campaigns where Ive pre-sold the offer ahead . Now that does n't  mean you should take my words for gospel . The equation is altered by your choice of niche , traffic source , keyword targets , and probably what you ate for breakfast this morning . <p> But that 's besides the point of this post . I think if you 're going to use a landing page , the least you can do is make it a good one . I 've seen some jawdroppingly bad landing pages over the years . So bad they could only have been designed by the Escobar Status dude ( baby please come back ) . <p> If you have n't checked it out already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven conversion boosting scripts . Some of these are highly relevant to the landing pages you should be creating . But while they will all make a difference , they do n't  quite add the missing ingredients which most marketers tend to overlook the language you use to persuade . <p> Our actual landing page copy is one of the most important links in the affiliate chain , and its often the last to be split-tested . We pay so much attention to our faltering CTRs and our faintly different banners that we often forget to split test this decisive persuasion tool . That 's probably because its a lot easier to find a new dating stock image than it is to learn how to write better copy . <p> The best landing pages act on the message of the ad that preceded them and channel the focus towards your end goal . Presumably to get the user to sign up to some crappy service hed be embarrassed to tell his friends about . If you 're wondering why your landing page is n't making a difference on your bottom line , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the offer does n't  deliver the benefits you 've described in your landing page , the EPC is going to be low . <p> I look at dating ads on Plentyoffish and often see headlines like " Our Women Need More Tall Smokers , Join Now ! " And I think to myself , okay , maybe I missed the release of Mate 1s latest " Free Weekend Pass For Nicotineheads " landing page . But I have n't , so is this really a sophisticated marketing ploy ? No , its just a cheap trick to increase CTR based on user attributes . It may enjoy short lived success while the CTR is strong , but inevitably it falls apart because the correlation is wafer thin and built on cones of sand . <p> If you 're going to exploit user attributes for your ads , you have to choose attributes that actually have some relevance . Otherwise you 'll lose way too many eyeballs in the jump from ad to landing page . Getting a user to click from your landing page through to the merchant is actually very easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to the benefits you 're about to sell . <p> At the heart of your campaign , it does n't  matter how great your landing page is as a standalone advertisement . It has to tie in with your previous ads in order to be effective , or the user will simply leave disenchanted . <p> I 've regularly touted the benefits of using " YES language " on a landing page . This is a copywriting technique where you ask as many rhetorical questions as you can , always the with the intention of getting a resounding " YES ! " from your reader . A headline like " Do You Want To Get Ripped In Time For Summer ? " is more of an attention grabber than simply stating " New Formula Promises Abs Within Months " . There 's another language tool at work there , which I will come to later . It involves getting the reader to picture himself in various states . If you can control the states , you can control his emotion . And if you can steer his emotion in to a buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than most affiliate marketers out there . <p> Use concise language and always write for the subordinate classes . Just because you have a degree in English literature , that 's no license to alienate 70% of your target market by typing like a pompous prick with his head up his arse . Short snappy sentences are the way to go . Something I like to remind myself in any of my copywriting is that ambiguity is never a good trait when you 're trying to sell something . Its the mark of a copywriter who is n't truly invested in a product or its benefits . <p> There 's a beaten dead horse lurking around affiliate marketing blogs that says you should always sell the benefits , not the features , of whatever you 're promoting . <p> Yes , you should . But understand that there 's a difference between selling the benefits and simply listing the benefits hoping one of them fills a " tick if applicable " box in the consumers head . I spy on many affiliate landing pages and it really shines through how bland and uninspiring the writing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features , " simply is n't good enough . You need to sell those benefits in such a way that the reader has no choice but to imagine them sweeping through his life and making a change for the better . Reeling off the A-Z of " Things My Product Can Do For You " is technically correct in the marketing sense . But its just not effective , in my opinion , unless at some point those benefits flick a switch from " this could be me " , to " this WILL be me if I act now " in the readers head . <p> How do you do that ? <p> You either have the natural talent , or you hire somebody else who does . It goes back to what I was saying in my last post about outsourcing . If you want the best , you better be the bestor be prepared to pay for the best . 114274 @qwx974274 <p> Looking for some excellent landing page case studies ?

@@106277779 @1677779/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> It is with great sadness that I announce my impending departure from our Company . I have decided to retire from all business so that I can put my feet up in the leafy suburbs , desperately attempting to convince myself that there 's more to life than work . <p> I 'm sure you will have many questions . Why now ? Why so young ? <p> Please accept my decision . It shows that Ive achieved more than you in a shorter space of time . <p> I am greatly looking forward to tackling the next challenge in my life : puberty . <p> Yours truly , Young Retired Dipshit <p> Many people consider retirement the reward for a lifetime of turmoil . Its the bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow . The day of reckoning when we can say " Ive done my bit " , and stop worrying about surviving from one pay cheque to the next . <p> The Internet age has spawned a generation of online entrepreneurs who are capable of retiring in their 20s . Does Mark Zuckerberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does if he likes to keep track of his billions . <p> Even though Zuckerberg can retire , I 'm positive he wo n't . And there 's good reason for that sentiment . <p> The next step after retirement is death . <p> Who would want to retire in their 20s ? The idea gets bounced around with prestige and glamour . There are websites dedicated to the ambition of retiring young , but I shudder to imagine how somebody capable of assembling the finances so young would react to the transition of pottering around a garden and writing Christmas cards in September . <p> Its a paradox if ever I heard one . <p> When you have nothing left to work for , you have nothing left to live for . Anybody who believes otherwise might as well go hang out with Macaulay Culkin . Smoke some pot , watch Home Alone 2 and revel in your own waste of potential . <p> Time and time again , I have friends cross-examining me on the nature of my work . In their eyes , Im retired . I make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook while the dollar bills grow in my fridge , right ? They 're wrong . <p> Even though I work in comfort , there 's rarely a second in the day where work is n't close to my thoughts . It follows me around like an infection that just wo n't shake , so why do n't  I learn to forget about work and switch off ? Its simple . I do n't  see work as a bad thing . <p> If you take a human being and strip him of his desire to work towards a goal , what do you have left ? An empty shell that 's retired and ready for death . There is n't much of the person left over . <p> Work does n't  have to be employment as you and I know it . It can be charity-based volunteering , or even just a commitment to stay busy . However , the retirement yearned for at unhappy office cubicles is no more than a desire to believe the grass is greener on the other side . It rarely is , and retirement is seldom the experience you crave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can believe in . You want to spend energy completing tasks where you give half a shit about the end result . Who does n't  ? This is the great illusion of retirement . Giving up a mundane chore is n't going to fill the void in your life . That void exists because you have n't felt the passion to get out of bed at 8am out of choice . <p> If financial independence was all we longed for , millionaires would be happy and averagely paid employees would be jumping from office blocks . Happiness is not a flexible hours agreement , or retirement altogether . Its the desire to get out of bed . To do something with your plain existence and convince yourself that retirement would only get in the way of all the things you have left to prove . <p> If that means changing career , go right ahead . We spend a third of our lifetimes at work , or thinking about it , so it makes zero sense to be working for the wrong reasons . The day you wake up and do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you have problems . That 's when retirement will become the death of you . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> You 're associating retirement with those 60-somethings who are too old to do anything besides tend to their gardens and do nothing all day . <p> I 'm planning to sell up projects in my late 20s or so and call it quits . Probably not forever , but until I 've had enough of non-work related things . <p> Living by the beach somewhere in Cali , surfing , scuba , parties etc . How about skiing/boarding in Switzerland ?

@@106277781 @1677781/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> If your inbox is anything like mine , your Monday mornings are probably spent combing through network emails of what to promote , what to test and where to send your traffic . Of course , working out what to do with our traffic is a minor point . Getting it profitable is the hard part where wed most appreciate advice ! <p> Good old fashioned affiliate arbitrage is beginning to feel like running from a tsunami of problems . <p> If it does , we have something in common . Ive been looking at several ways to combat the challenges faced in advertising on the major social platforms . Let 's face it , neither Facebook or Plentyoffish are getting any easier to crack . You can concede defeat , or you can retreat and regroup . <p> So what actions can you take to avoid becoming the next affiliate casualty ? <p> Open your mind to new bidding strategies <p> This is particularly important on Plentyoffish . Bidding strategies can make or break you . Making a simple change can completely turn around your fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head that bidding $0.67 with a frequency cap of 4 was the sweet spot for one of my campaigns . For a long time , this was very profitable . But you shouldnt be afraid to bid on different groups of traffic . When my campaign ran dry , I was forced in to a change . Eventually I regained profitability on the same offer , with the same creatives , just by bidding $0.48 with a frequency cap of 7 . <p> Sometimes you have to bid less , and live with the lower conversion rates , to achieve a greater ROI . For Christs sake , do n't  live and die by your conversion rates . Live and die by what 's making you money . <p> Dayparting , weekparting , monthparting , retardparting . <p> Have you scrutinized your stats and analysed them on an hour-by-hour basis ? If you 're working in the dating niche , this is pretty fucking significant . Forget about conversion rates . Look directly at the EPCs vs . CPCs over a 24 hour period . <p> You also need to consider a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't advertise dating offers during certain hours . On the flipside , traffic is a lot cheaper for those of us who decide to take that path . Probably because those saying you should n't bid in the morning , are the same idiots bidding the same fixed amount 24/7 and then wondering where their profitability went . Well , duh . <p> Use language that sells your offer twice as hard . <p> If you 're not yet using landing pages , you might as well be a dinosaur dodging asteroids . It may be fun for a while , but sooner or later its going to be game over . Something I always look to do when my ROI drops is sell the offer twice as hard . Particularly if I 'm in a small demo where a lot of eyeballs have already seen my main sales pitch . <p> Go back and look at your landing page . Give it a language makeover . Take every single descriptive word and ramp it up a notch , particularly the words that are being used as anchor text . Bust out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every single conceivable concern or restraint from joining Site X now needs to be dispelled and extinguished . You simply cant afford to lose as many clicks as you used to . <p> And for this , I 'd give you one piece of advice . Do n't  write on your own level . You 're not trying to sell a Rocket Science degree . Write as if your landing page is going to be read by the dumbest idiot in America . <p> Scale away from the competition . <p> This is the single easiest way of regaining profitability that you 'll still choose to ignore . It simply involves taking the components of your most successful campaigns , having them translated , and targeting non-English speaking markets . By advertising in non-English speaking countries , you instantly eliminate the competition that inflates your prices elsewhere . <p> But you 've got to remain patient . Just because your campaign is nicely formalized in the mother tongue of the poor bastards you 're advertising to , that does n't  make it a guaranteed success at the first time of asking . And many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign in a foreign market . There 's also lazy scaling syndrome . Where you translate your creatives but do n't  bother with the landing page because itd mean shelling out a few extra dollars . <p> This is particularly mind-boggling logic when it comes from the very affiliates who know first-hand what difference a landing page can make to ROI . Do n't  be a fuck nugget . Do the job properly . <p> If straight arbitrage fails , capture the data . <p> The way we operate as affiliates , our mathematics are very simple . We need to get traffic cheap enough so we can sell it and make a profit . Okay , great . But most affiliates leave themselves exactly 5 seconds to play God with that data . If the click does n't  convert , its forever lost . <p> Just yesterday , I received a network email advising me to target users earning over $100,000 to maintain maximum quality on an offer . It got me thinking . This moron earns $100,000 in a year and he s clicking my link , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case scenario , I 'm only going to make $7 from him if he converts on my offer . How much money am I leaving on the table by not keeping the schmuck to myself and upselling like there 's no tomorrow ? <p> By building your own email lists and capturing data , you can afford to compete with the rising click costs . Because each conversion is worth so much more . You do n't  even have to build an email list . Just brand your landing page in such a way that if the user decides not to click through , he has somewhere else to go where he can provide value to you . That 's a gigantic tip right there , and I 'll let you interpret it as you wish . <p> I 'm guessing many marketers are finally recognising how replaceable an affiliate engaging in straight arbitrage actually is . Its not too late to do things differently . But do n't  say you did n't  see it coming when Plan A hits the wall . 114274 @qwx974274 <p> Looking to finally get your campaigns translated in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Hour Translation is fast , cheap and thankfully much more accurate than the badass copy and pasting skills that took Finch to an unexpected C grade win in his French GCSEs .

And yeah , email lists are the best way to create recurring income , as you can branch and scale that out so many ways . <p> Damn Finch , for someone so involved in dating , you really have n't explored outside of POF and facebook . Consider getting into display/media buys can use cleavage galore , few/no offer restrictions , and landing pages that actually sell are almost never necessary . Just slap a couple offer countdown scripts and some half-naked models on your LP , call out a specific gender , and you 're good to go . No need to worry about quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys for dating offers will get your AM changing your affid every other day for you just so you can stay on the offer . And either way , its hard to complain about offers going down if one made you 500 grand last week <p> @hoo That 's a pretty brave business plan . You do 500 grand in a week and do n't  stop to worry about quality ? To each his own , but I do n't  think I 'll be following that path anytime soon . Especially when I work with several advertisers directly and do n't  have an AM to hide my tricks <p> In regards to media buys though , yes , I have explored them . About six months ago , 90% of my traffic was coming from them . But its nowhere near as simple as slapping some cleavage on a banner and waiting for the jackpot like you 're suggesting . <p> Building a list is such a good way to monetize traffic . Have you tested using Facebook Connect as a secondary option to capture the users e-mail ? Its something I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side project of mine , but was wondering your thoughts on it and whether you 'd tested it or not . <p> I actually just posted a blog post on this as well with an article I found on how Facebook has increased the self-serve advertisements CPC by 40% which is pretty crazy . Have you found profitability decreasing with Facebook since last year ? <p> I agree with Finch . Quality is important , because while you may be making money by sending junk leads , the advertiser also has to make money as well so theyll kick you off the offer . <p> Actually this is n't a dating offer . Its for a targeted list Im building in a different niche . I am running some dating offers though that have higher cpc , around .30 range and am getting epic of around .70-.80 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277782 @1677782/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I seem to publish a new Facebook post every quarter , and with each time lapse comes the news that it just ai n't  as easy as it used to be . I 'll save you the doomsday speech and get straight to the point . There 's still a lot of money to be made on Facebook , but the bidding process could easily convince you otherwise . <p> I 've seen some suggested bid prices that resemble first class tickets to bankruptcy . Want to advertise to over 30s in Australia ? Thatll be $1.50/click , says Facebook . You know you 've been doing this shit for too long when you find yourself staring at a delicious Ginster sandwich in your local petrol station , and mentally equating it to the cost of two Australian housewives accidentally clicking your ad . <p> What make a successful Facebook bidding strategy in 2011 ? Christ , that 's not even contemporary enough , is it ? What makes a good Facebook bidding strategy as of 6pm GMT on Monday the 11th July 2011 ? <p> I do n't  have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what works for me . <p> Costs are going to continue to rise , artificially at least , so its important that we roll with the punches . If Facebook decides to raise their suggested bid prices , we have to follow suit if we want to lay claim to the same volume of clicks . <p> CTR is as important as it always was , and if you can score an excellent clickthrough rate , you will pay much less than your bid . This is the beating heart of what advertising on Facebook is all about . The confusion stems from where to start bidding , how to adjust as you go , and how to sustain the CTR . <p> I like to operate dual campaigns for whatever Im promoting . This means I will create two campaigns for essentially the same offer , but changing the creatives for each . Fresh images and fresh headlines are my priorities , the actual ad text itself rarely makes a difference . <p> Assuming both campaigns have been tested and are pulling in good CTRs , I will run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindness and helps me to sustain each campaign a little longer . Facebook has been known to become a bigger bastard than usual if you attempt to resume a campaign that was already on the slide , grinding impressions to a halt . But personally , I 've found this to be a non-issue as long as I keep pausing before the decline sets in . <p> I also like to create day-specific campaigns for my dating ads as another way of providing short term boosts to CTR that can also help to alleviate banner blindness . For example , " End Sunday With Her Phone Number " followed by my buxom wench of choice , and a demand to register now before weekend registrations close . <p> As a general rule , I swear by lots of fresh high-CTR campaigns that I can alternate and switch out when necessary . <p> All this counts for nothing if you receive a grand total of 14 impressions , or spunk an entire budget on an hours worth of graveyard converting clicks . Youve got ta know how to start the bidding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal experience to draw conclusions from . <p> You can usually guarantee significant volume by bidding at the very bottom of the suggested bid range . So if Facebook is suggesting $1.11-$1.45 , start your bidding at $1.11 , and you should get plenty of clicks . For the overwhelming majority of CPA offers , Facebooks initial suggested bids will prove utterly unsustainable . Over a dollar for a click to a dating offer paying out $5 ? On your bike , mon ami . You can tell the wife your summer vacation is cancelled at those rates . <p> However , and this is very important to consider , bidding at the bottom of the suggested margins gives you a window of opportunity to score a high CTR . If you can show Facebook that your ads are suitably click-friendly , the suggested bid margins will lower dramatically and your actual CPC will be a lot cheaper than what you tentatively opened the bidding with . <p> For affiliates promoting low-payout offers , the temptation is to scoop junk traffic by bidding way below the suggested price . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid at 50% of your payout and still see profit on the horizon . <p> The problem with bidding significantly lower than the suggested price is that Facebook will only give you a very limited number of impressions , usually on lower quality pages , and if your CTR is n't immediately impressive , that will be all she wrote . Unless your ad campaign puts the wowsers down your markets trousers , its tough to sustain these types of campaigns . <p> There are some exceptions that I 've noticed . Less saturated international markets and under 18 demographics are often easier to hit with low bids , presumably because the competition is lower . <p> I actually spoke to one affiliate who had the cunning plan of building an opt-in list of 17 year olds in the hope that hed have a freshly plucked market of viable 18 year olds to send to dating offers in 12 months time . Scheming ? Yes . Viable ? No . Facebook does not appreciate the tactic , and I 'm personally convinced that the dating advertisers would have harboured a few reservations about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering where CPM fits in to all of this , my opinion is that it does n't  . Once upon a time , CPM was the most logical method of advertising on Facebook . Then Facebook decided that CPC campaigns should get first dibs on the best pages for ads unofficially , but very noticeably and the benefits in bidding CPM disappeared . <p> Some might argue that CPM still has a time and a place . Yeah , sure . For heavyweight brands who want their message on the page and do n't  actually care about attracting clicks . There are similar exceptions for international traffic with CPM bidding , but even those are typically less profitable than the same campaign with a CPC bidding strategy . <p> As always , you 're welcome to take a giant dump on this advice by outing your own yacht funding CPM campaigns . I 'd be happy to hear about them ! 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Lots of Ads is the latest service to offer spying capabilities over Facebooks most profitable ads .

@@106277783 @1677783/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> How do I even begin to review What Runs Where ? This is the rabbit hole of all software releases for 2011 . <p> Ill start by giving you the basics . What Runs Where is a competitive intelligence service for online media buyers . The hook is to discover new traffic sources , to become more efficient at monetizing your existing campaigns , and to open your eyes to a simply mind-boggling data dump of what your competitors are up to . <p> Spying on competition seems to be one of 2011s hottest angles for marketing products . I 've already reviewed several other products , all aiming to make our creative process less troublesome . The difference with What Runs Where is scale . <p> It all looked so simple when I first logged in . <p> A nicely tiled interface allowing me to search through the most popular ( and most relevant ) adverts on 18 of the largest display networks as well as 6 text ad networks . <p> And then I clicked through to view some data . And then I clicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I 've clicked through about seven times and the What Runs Where software is tracing everything from the entire banner portfolio of True.com , to the exact eye colour of the bastard who keeps outbidding me on TribalFusion . <p> This thing is a well oiled data whoring machine . And there lies its greatest strength and biggest weakness . To get the most out of What Runs Where , you have to be able to handle lots of data . You have to practically thrive on it like some kind of sick perverted numbers freak . There 's a lot to take in , and I can see how the fledgling baby affiliate could be swept under within minutes . <p> Let 's take a look at what you can analyse <p> If you 're short on inspiration , you can use the What Runs Where system as a means of researching the most popular banner ads by strength , relevancy or recency on any of the following platforms : <p> I know many affiliates feel naked and lost if they 're forced out of their comfort zone ( Facebook and Plentyoffish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is made particularly if you 're dabbling in rebills . <p> If you 're in research mode , you can use What Runs Where to assess the ads that are likely to work on each of those traffic sources . But that would be purely skimming the surface . The real value , in my opinion , is in the ability to perform searches for particular advertisers and to see the most popular placements on any given site . <p> If I run a search for True.com , I can uncover a huge number of banners that have been used to promote the site . here 's a tiny sample : <p> Fair enough , its nice to see which banners are popular . But what I really want to see is the traffic sources and specific placements that have proven to be the most successful over time . <p> This information gives me some food for thought over suitable placements in a similar campaign . Christ , if I was running PPV , I 'd have more than enough targets to keep myself busy . But its not quite giving me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most suitable for each placement ? <p> Now where the data really gets interesting is when you start cross-checking ads that have appeared in a particular placement . Let 's say I want to buy some banner space on TheFreeSite.com , I can use What Runs Where to perform a seperate placement analysis . <p> ( I 've purposefully chosen a very broad target ) <p> This gives me the breakdown of just about every advertiser that has been spotted on the site . If I want to see more recent placements , I can adjust the slider . I can also view the top banner ads on this single placement , as well as the strongest ad texts . Has one banner been hogging 50% of the impressions ? What traffic source does it come from ? All this data is at my fingertips , and its enough to make me slightly nauseous . <p> The data pool is truly gigantic . You can easily lose a couple of hours sifting through it . <p> So what can be improved ? <p> The software currently tracks ads in four countries : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This should keep most of you happy . But for advertisers like myself those who have departed the popular English speaking regions in favour of dirty Eurotrash campaigns and the odd cheeky Brazilian I would definitely like to see some Euro inventory added . <p> I also think the interface could be given a once-over and sprinkled with some explanations of how scores are calculated . Strength is annotated as a number , and while I 'm sure the tech guys have perfectly valid logic in ranking the ads as they do , it could be made clearer . <p> Much of the data meaning has to be assessed relatively by looking at more data . If the team could find a way of leading lambs such as myself to the opportunities rather than more numbers , it would open up the software to a whole new realm of buyers . They have a hell of a lot of features , its just rebranding a few of them as benefits that will convert this thing in to an unslayable savage donkey beast . <p> What Runs Where is n't going to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're kidding yourself if you buy this thing expecting it to churn out profitable campaigns while you swing lackadaisically in the hammock . <p> And while it is by far the most sophisticated ad spying software Ive yet to come across , its also tied to the same limitations as its many rivals you , the user , have to turn that data in to a competitive advantage . It wo n't appear by magic . <p> If I had to pull a metaphor out of my arse , I would compare the software to a very deep bucket full of jigsaw pieces . Inside , you will find just about every component of that one lucrative campaign you 've always dreamed of . But to put the pieces together , you 're going to have to insert yourself balls-deep in to a matrix of data some of which will take you a few days to properly understand . <p> If you 're a regular media buyer , or looking to venture that way , What Runs Where is a must-have . I 'd recommend it to intermediate affiliates , and anybody with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , you may have already heard , but What Runs Where has just opened up a special $1 trial package . If you have any doubts , or simply want to take the software for a test spin , quit reading my drivel and go see it for yourself .

" <p> Well , it was true two years ago . <p> Now I 'm a 28 year old high school dropout . <p> Having to share a platform with the candid thoughts of your much younger self is one good reason not to sustain a blog for almost a decade . <p> Before I rip up this site forever , here 's an update on where I 've been , what I 'm working on , and how I 'm surviving in South East Asia . <h> Thailand : 12 Months On <p> This blog has at times descended in to farce as I 've tried to justify my jumping around : moving to Thailand , moving back to London , moving to America , not moving to America , moving back to Thailand , and so on . <p> Last March , I sold ( or gave away ) 95% of my possessions and moved to Bangkok with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazing year .

A nice place to walk around with beautiful Mediterranean style weather . <p> We used an agent to get our visas renewed while we were here . <p> You know its a funny year when you 're sitting in a hotel lobby , wearing sunglasses , waiting for Abdul the runner to come and pick up your passport . <p> You wonder what the doormans thinking as he sees the money change hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , at 3 ?

All things somebody with a little culture might appreciate . <p> Alas , I spent most of the time patching in to BBC Sport to keep up with the cricket . <h> Saigon ( HCMC ) , Vietnam <p> The War Remnants Museum was worth a visit for its ( one-sided ) account of Americas crimes during the Vietnam conflict . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genocide Museum in Cambodia , which is by far the most affecting war museum I 've visited .

Never get in a parked taxi outside a tourist attraction in South East Asia . <h> Balancing Work and Bangkok <p> Between trips abroad , and seeing various parts of Thailand , there comes the small issue of work . <p> One of my biggest concerns about moving to Asia was , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , admittedly , a creature of habit . <p> Back in London , I could n't function in the morning until I 'd conquered my daily routine : <p> Feed the pups <p> Have a shower <p> Head to the Petch ( my affectionate term for a Petrol Station that stocks Costa Express and vanilla muffins ) <p> Scan The Times <p> Wallow in coffee beans and rifle through my inbox <p> This routine guided me to a moment of spark at about 10:25am when I 'd suddenly think , " Shit , hold on , am I not supposed to be working on campaigns ? " <p> And with a nervous fart , I 'd assault the day . <p> In Thailand ? <p> Not much has changed , except the scenery and my choice of breakfast . <p> For those who give a shit about daily routines , here 's how I design mine . <p> I divide the day in to four periods : <p> Before Breakfast : 8:30 to 10:45 <p> After Breakfast : 11:00 to 12:45 <p> Before Lunch : 1:00 to 2:00 <p> After Lunch : 3:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating to literally everything I do . ) <p> I also divide my work in to four distinct phases : <p> Management <p> Creativity <p> Production <p> Autopilot <p> I assign them like this : <p> Before Breakfast 8:30 to 10:45Management Phase <p> Here I 'll take on management tasks like briefing my team , responding to emails , tracking projects , and viewing the trends of campaigns . I 'll examine my scorecard ( KPIs ) of the previous days stats , which gives a breakdown of performance across my entire business . <p> Whatever needs following up gets assigned and scheduled . <p> By the time 10:45 arrives , my loins are quivering for coffee beans . <p> Its off to Au Bon Pain , Wonderwall , or some other random establishment on Sukhumvit Soi 31 . <p> After Breakfast 11:00 to 12:45Creativity Phase <p> After breakfast I enter my creativity phase . <p> This is when I will carry out any writing ( e.g. Premium Posts ) , lay out ad copy , and find solutions to problems in websites and campaigns I am working on . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period . <p> I find it easy to experience flow in the morning in coffee shops so I use the opportunity to attack any task that needs my full concentration . <p> I wish I could do more of this work , but it requires an intense focus the likes of which I can only muster for around two hours per day . <p> One thing Ive learnt is that two hours is all you need to achieve more productive work than most people manage in their entire week . <p> Before Lunch 1:00 to 2:00Execution / Production Phase <p> The walk home is a good chance to mentally reset . <p> I now have two pomodoros to charge through production related work . This could be making campaign changes , preparing websites , tweaking landing pages , or most often split testing ad combinations . <p> I like to restrict the window to just a single hour since this work is very easy to conflate in to half a day if you give it the chance . <p> My irrepressible rumbling gut assures that I get through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then I go out for lunch , usually with my girlfriend . <p> After we 've eaten , I 'll disappear to another coffee shop and enter the longest period of the day : <p> Autopilot work . <p> This is the stuff I need to do that does n't  occupy any significant brainpower . <p> I find that my mind and body naturally crash after lunch , so this is a good chance to crack out Spotify and cruise through the afternoon with a series of easy wins . <p> I assign any tasks that do n't  require major decision making or creativity to my Autopilot phase . <p> This is the session for detailed emails , or phone calls , or follow-ups . Its where I evaluate the work from my team and provide feedback or new instructions . Ill also carry out research to support the rest of my phases . <p> At some point between 6 to 7pm , I 'll head downstairs to the pool or the gym . <p> After which , surprise suprise , I 'm hungry again . <p> Fat bastard . <p> Could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The main gains I have in Bangkok are : <p> The food is amazing <p> The location is inspiring <p> The weather is glorious <p> I have a pool and gym downstairs <p> The small things add up to a daily routine that suits my lifestyle perfectly . <h> Plans for 2016 <p> Were staying in Thailand for at least another year . <p> Next stop is back to London to see friends and family in April . <p> One of the things I learnt when I moved back from Thailand in 2011 was that while you miss people , naturally , the pang does n't  justify relocating 5000 miles just to be permanently near them . <p> Quality time together is better than the false comfort of knowing somebody is 5 miles away and yet still not seeing them . <p> Some of the places I plan to visit in 2016 : <p> Mount Kinabulo ( Borneo ) , Australia , Cambodia , Germany ( for AWE ) and one of the major US conferences " probably ASE in New York City . <p> Plus , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its a stunning country . <p> Stunningly flawed in so many ways , and yet still an amazing place to live . <p> Plans For This Blog ? <p> None . <p> I 'm releasing a new volume of Premium Posts next month , which is likely to be the final post on FinchSells.com , and my last public contribution to the affiliate industry . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Is this the end of your affiliate marketing career ?

What can I say , there is a lot of good stuff for most affiliates in there . I would not say its best for a newbie but its definitely worth reading for someone starting out , even he or she does n't  understand everything in there . <p> On the other hand , in my opinion , its an awesome read for any past newbie to intermediate affiliate . There are good tips , unknown facts for many of us ( because of lack of experience ) and what is most important is that it opens your eyes and makes you see the industry more relaxed and from above . Its really hard to take your eyes off all the details and shiny options we encounter everyday so seeing everything from the perspective of a more experienced guy helps a lot . <p> Want to feel more secure on launching mobile , read the guide on that , feeling lost on angles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll feel like a real Jedi when you come back to regular online marketing . <p> My favourite part was the 1% post . It really makes a difference once you understand how fast you can improve on anything knowing this . Want to go to the gym or have a bike in your house that you store clothes on ? Just try and exercise 2min/day everyday , develop a habit and you 'll be years ahead at the end of a 30 day trial . Same thing with your 1% Chapter and I 'm glad I underlined the importance of this strategy once more . <p> I know Charles always says in his blog that its amazing how for $10 you can learn about a topic that took the writer maybe a lifetime to understand and then put together in a book . Its the same here . there are n't  many good and so complex " guides " on the market when we think of the affiliate industry so once in while when something like this comes up , take advantage of it , buy it , read and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that moment in time . That 's my strategy anyway .. <p> So , regardless of your skill level , I think its best for all of us to take some time off , clear our minds , look over 2014 and think about next year from our own perspective and through the eyes of someone else as well . <p> This is completely unrelated to AM , but I have to call you out on something . You are always blaming your receding hairline on stresses from AM . How do you not know its genetics ? I think its kind of a cop-out to blame it on your campaign stresses . Its widely accepted that male pattern baldness is like 99% genetics . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

@@106277789 @1677789/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> While this is true from a managerial perspective , its also valid for freelance writers . <p> If you write like a monkey , you better get used to peanuts . <p> Before I moved in to affiliate marketing , I was a prolific freelance writer who tore through 50,000 to 75,000 words per month . <p> I learnt several tricks of the trade , including the near universal habit of stretching 250 words in to 3 pages of dross . Like many , my output was shaped by webmasters who cared only for keyword density and having the longest How To guide on Google . <p> If you 've ever taken on a writing project driven by volume , or a dissertation with a lofty word count , you know how to say less with more . Its your blood . <p> Well , I have a brand new problem . <p> My work now requires that I hire writers . <p> Many of my writers simply havent been very good , for which I take full responsibility as the donut hiring them . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . A lazy writer does . <p> Lazy writers who have the talent , but lack a high regard for their work , leave me wanting to gouge out my eyes with a rusty steak knife . <p> They could be making so much money , we could be making so much money . <p> here 's how we both make more money : <h> 1 . Get to the point , always . <p> A lazy writer , when handed a topic , will find 3 or 4 interesting points and wrap them in lines of setup prose . <p> Do n't  wrap what you want to say in fluff to meet a word count . <p> Take this passage I was handed : <p> If you 're still not sure when to get a divorce , then there are a couple signs that you may consider looking into so that you can ensure that your marriage is n't something that you can save . One of the first signs that may help you as a husband to finally figure out whether to get a divorce or not is to simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex as much as you did in the past , or if the sex you 're having does n't  feel the same , then maybe your relationship with your wife is n't the way it was in the past . <p> Thats 105 words . What a little scamp . <p> I paid his fee , then set about editing it : <p> If your sex life is a distant memory , or a forgettable blur , your marriage may be tough to save . <p> 19 words that cut to the chase . <p> I understand why capable writers rely on setup prose . It is a useful tool in academia where students are schooled to say much about nothing . <p> Unfortunately , it does not sell . <p> And it reads like a fist in the balls . <h> 2 . Find the right voice . <p> Read this piece I wrote for ProBlogger on finding your voice . Now ask the hiring manager , " Who am I writing as ? " <p> here 's another passage from the same divorce article : <p> I personally think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , that is when you should get out and leave her . However , you need to look at the things you will lose when you get a divorce and determine whether the advantages of getting a divorce outweighs the advantages of leaving your wife . <p> You personally think ? <p> Of course you personally think ! You wrote it . <p> Hiring managers can save a lot of time by addressing the voice of the copy . <p> Who is speaking ? <p> What is his position ? <p> Is he neutral ? <p> A writer can make a lot of money by understanding the above . <p> There are times to be creative . But in choosing the voice of the copy , creativity is suicide . Mixing your voices is treason . <h> 3 . Up the pace . <p> Its not Shakespeare , but its effective for an audience with little time to spare . <p> Compare it to this piece I was handed : <p> You do n't  even need to see the content . <p> Those blocky paragraphs give the game away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd have to pay me to read it . <p> Chances are , if you are hired to write , you are also hired to sell . <p> Up the pace , trim the fat . You will retain readership and sell more . <h> 4 . Adverbs . <p> Until you know how to use them , do n't  use them . <h> 5 . Never say more than you have to . <p> In Wartime Britain , Winston Churchill had little time to spare . <p> He despised wooly phrasing and would return reports that took up more than a single side of paper . His memorandums became as infamous as the rollocking that followed them : <p> " Pray let me know by 4PM today on one sheet of paper " <p> here 's a memo circulated by Churchill in 1940 : <p> The irony for writers is that projects routinely come with word counts , and essays with page requirements . Quantity is seen as a virtue . <p> You should not be disheartened by this . <p> The web is changing and a premium is emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging the audience . If you write an excellent 400 word piece and a blind fool turns it back for lack of padding , save the file and keep it handy . <p> You 'll sell it for twice as much to somebody who gets the price of quality . <p> A student taking a philosophy class once had a single question in his exam : <p> " What is courage ? " <p> While the rest of the class splurged their souls in to essays , he wrote one word : <p> " This . " <p> He took top marks , and promptly became a hero for anybody who gave a shit about brevity . <p> If this style sounds familiar to you , please get in touch .

@@106277790 @1677790/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> here 's an explanation of what AuthorRank does , straight from the horses mouth : <p> The identity of individual agents responsible for content can be used to influence search ratings . Assuming that a given agent has a high reputational score , representing an established reputation for authoring valuable content , then additional content authored and signed by that agent will be promoted relative to unsigned content or content from less reputable agents in search results. taken from Googles patent <p> Changes to Google and impact on affiliates are two phrases that we 've grown used to interpreting in a negative light over the last few years . <p> So forgive me for asking what immediately springs to mind <h> What is AuthorRanks potential to mess with my shit ? <p> As a concept , I actually quite like AuthorRank . <p> I like the idea of writers being able to lend credibility to their content through reputation alone . Yet affiliates have a somewhat mixed agenda <p> Essentially , by using the rel=author tag , I could send a signal to Google that the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts related to weight loss , dating , Justin Bieber and whatever other scumbag projects I might or might not be working on at the time . <p> That signal could be translated in to my gleaming face , and my social profile , sitting next to those links in the SERP . <p> Now , the dilemma for myself and many other readers , is do I really want the world and its dog to be able to see what I 'm working on ? Do I want my name attached to niche exploitation where my true expertise is little to none ? <p> Its a tough one . Our industry is still somewhat obscured by a veil of secrecy . <p> Affiliates rarely like to talk about their works-in-progress . If somebody comes along with a bigger budget and blows them out of the water , well , you get it . That 's bad business . <p> Many of us invest in private domain registrations , multiple servers and a crap load of pseudonyms to hide our footprint . <p> Personally , I feel that if a site requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good indication that I 'm engaging in some murky shit that is n't compatible with my long-term business objectives . Or that its porn . I try not to get too paranoid about people spying on my projects . <p> In reality , as long as you keep executing , you will stay ahead of those who keep chasing tails . <p> That said , I believe its important to lend an identity to every website I launch . It might not be run by Finch , but it has to have a name attached to build some vital bridges of trust . I 'm a big fan of pseudonyms , and so AuthorRank is likely to require a new level of thinking . <p> Whereas in the past , I could get away with a pseudonym and a fake profile , I can see it becoming necessary to embrace those fake identities on a social level . Perhaps building author reputation will become as important as traditional backlink development . <p> I cant imagine a situation where I would want to lend my real name to every affiliate project I work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in , that I certainly do n't  wish to come back and haunt me over a dining table in the future . <p> However , if AuthorRank takes off in a big way as many suspect it will I would definitely look to exploit my existing assets by placing my name on new projects where I can justify an involvement . <p> This is one of the rare few Google developments that I see as a great opportunity for content creators . For those of us involved with affiliate sites , however , I see a lot of profile juggling ahead . Could it be time to think of a pseudonym for every niche you work in ? <p> Okay , that 's probably a little extreme . But it will be interesting to see how Google evolves with this change . <p> Will you be making any preparations or changes for AuthorRank ? 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Head over to Finch Premiums for 300+ pages of my affiliate marketing tips . <p> I 've just taken on modding duties over at the StackThatMoney Forum .

Then when needed give " Sketchy " juice from content written by Finch from separate domains . Wouldnt this transfer authority to Sketchy while keeping Finch invited back to the dinner table ? <p> I do n't  think this is a totally new concept , in publishing people have used " pen names " for years to mask their true identities . <p> This has been one of the biggest downfalls of the social web IMO the inability to create multiple identities .

We as a collective ( meaning everyone in the world ) need to be held accountable and validated through algorithms to the point where we essentially become a " trusted " source or a " potential fraud " . Of course , I 'm very happy to share my newest ventures with anyone that 's interested . <p> Both are lies .

@@106277791 @1677791/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Outsourcing to India is no longer as cheap as it used to be . The race to the bottom of bargain basement prices for skilled workers has shifted in a different direction , a little further east to be exact . <p> If you 're constantly on the hunt for cheap labour , youve probably already heard that Filipinos are doing it cheaper , and doing it better . Well , certainly if you 've spoken to enough Filipinos . <p> I am a firm believer in outsource arbitrage . If somebody abroad is willing to do work cheaply and to a high standard , I have no problems in taking business away from my own country . This has become widespread not just on a small business level , but in worldwide corporations that are desperate to maximise profits . <p> In an economic sense , its a disaster . How can America and the UK continue to thrive if jobs are being sent off-shore ? We hear a lot of media scaremongering about jobs not being created but everybody knows , this is bullshit . Jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour from a warmer climate . Its tough to envision a situation where that trend will be reversed . <p> So its on that basis that I recommend EasyOutsource as a good stomping ground for those looking to hire labour without paying the premium . <p> EasyOutsource was recommended to me by a friend when I asked him who had been responsible for the swish custom coding job behind one of his sites . I was pretty stunned when he told me the wages he was paying his staff , and it was much more competitive than the rates you typically see on Elance and oDesk . <p> EasyOutsource is free to use , and is essentially no more than a portal bringing buyers and service providers together . There are zero hoops to jump through . Just register a profile and post a job , or cruise through the profiles of workers and message them directly if you so wish . <p> Its very easy , though I can understand why serious project managers would have apprehension about dealing with workers in such an uncontrolled marketplace . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses relevance . Outsourcing is an art . You can not expect to simply bagsy a foreign worker , throw them a brief and expect it delivered to spec without any hiccups along the way . This applies to EasyOutsource and every other freelancing site on the planet . <p> You really need to spend time weeding out the pretenders from the legitimate workers who can add to your business . Get them on Skype and ask to speak directly to the individuals who will be responsible for the work . <p> I once took on a highly skilled University graduate who wrote like a fluent subcontinental Shakespeare in her briefing . I was impressed , almost shamed by her writing . But that means very little if she delegates the actual work to her bumbling school children and their shaky grasp of Indlish . Which is exactly what she did . <p> Also beware of the super talented programmers who tell you they 're capable of working full-time , but take 2 days to reply to the shortest email . ( ie. " Hello , are you working , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skilled art . Outsourcing unwisely is a waste of time , energy and subsequently your will to live .

Ive been looking into outsourcing to the Philippines for some time , but have n't taken the plunge yet . I 'm still dealing primarily with Indian workers . This is mostly due to not knowing how to deal with the Filipino culture and already having connections in India . I 've heard dealing with Filipinos is very different than working with Indians , but that they are awesome once you learn the ropes .. <p> For reference there is another job board for Filipinos called onlinejobs.ph . I have not hired from there but I was thinking about it . You have to pay a monthly subscription to use it . I will check out Easy Outsource and Pepper Virtual Assistants before hiring . <p> Great info . My sister used to worked online and she have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what good thing about this is that , online jobs can be done at home without irate boss and traffic jam everyday plus the fact that you have the control of your own time schedules and you can work freely . I will try this kind of job as well and thanks for sharing this info . <p> Outsourcing sure is an art you need to set it up well at the beginning by making the brief watertight in its clarity , and keeping a close check on quality until you feel confident to let the reigns go a little bit . Eventually , you can achieve the leverage you need , but it takes a bit of investment . <p> very bad outsourcing site the freelancers there try to rip you off . I wanted to test a provider but he end up erasing my filesgood I had a backup anyhow there is a big different between providers and also with the websites you find them .

When you make the decision to travel , whilst working on the move , efficiency becomes a major issue . How can you get the most out of your time , while severing many of those hours in pursuit of greater thrills ? <p> I recommend travelling to anybody who has the chance . If your business is self-managed , it makes little sense to constrain your time and freedom to a single city , especially if you already know that city inside out . Many people cite the influence of outside factors for not being able to travel . <p> Admittedly , those with less ties than myself have more problems to solve before they can take off around the world , but none of the factors are hammer blows to the idea . They just take a greater leap of faith and/or commitment to overcome . <p> If you 're stuck between indecision and lack of information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way : <p> 1 . Travel as lightly as possible . <p> If you are a notorious hoarder of junk , traveling is an excellent excuse to throw out the crap that 's being cluttering your garage for so long .

Of course I did . <p> Its tempting to fit a lifetimes accumulation of crap in to your suitcase , but ask yourself one question . Is this so important that I cant buy a replacement while I 'm away ? The answer to most items will be no . Traveling light makes moving around much easier , not to mention saving you many many pesos in excess baggage charges . <p> 2 . Hotel Wifi has a recurring tendency to suck balls . <p> I 've learnt that if I do n't  do research beforehand , fate will typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Working from a laptop instead of a dual screen Mac took some adjusting .

Or risk paying -30 for a few hours of patchy usage at somewhere like Novotel Rim Pae . Screw you , Novotel . <p> 3 . Do n't  stay in flash , rich , luxurious hotels . <p> Wifi is worth investing in if you 're running a business from your laptop . But I 've never understood the craze behind booking hotels for $500/night . Ultimately , a bed is a bed . Unless you plan on doing something other than sleeping in it , why pay through the nose for something that rarely gives you a true taste of the place you 're visiting ? Overpaying is considered by many to be a macho display of ballin . Invariably , traveling with set requirements of the pampered existence you need to get to sleep at night defeats the bloody purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . <p> My biggest regret as I move on from Thailand . Its difficult to truly appreciate a culture if the standard conversation leaves you scratching your head and whipping up Rosetta Stone on the smartphone . Learning a few basic phrases is a must , while learning conversational basics will give you a much better understanding of what 's happening around you . Not to mention , a whole new world of local prices become accessible once you display a better grasp of the native vocab than a regular tourist . <p> 5 . Dropbox . <p> Dropbox is the new rage . Okay , to most people , its yesterdays new rage . I was slow to jump on the bandwagon , but I 'm glad that I did . By using Dropbox , you can afford to pull a Tim Ferriss . Sod off the face of the Earth completely , leave your laptop behind and restrict work to bursts of activity in an Internet Cafe just outside the Angolan Jungle . Dropbox gives you access to your important files anywhere , synchronizing them across devices and affording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use time differences to your advantage . <p> Initially , I was concerned about the time difference when I first moved to Asia . Companies and reps based in the UK , Canada and America would still be asleep while I was busy with work . What if I needed to talk to them ? It did n't  take long for me to figure that this was a great blessing in disguise . Zero distractions and zero interruptions . By the time those in America had woken up and replied to my emails , I would be happily relaxing and unwinding in the sun . <p> 7 . Have back-up support in place . <p> When you 're traveling , even with laptop in tow , it brings peace of mind to have somebody ready and waiting to act on any emergencies . I hired a Virtual Assistant from EasyOutsource.com , which is by far my favourite place to recruit cheap but talented labour . <p> You can have all your mundane tasks handled by a full-time VA for as little as $250/month , although I would recommend you invest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire a combined workforce rather than a single employee . An individual is just as prone to " sick days " at inconvenient times as you were back in the day job . Hiring a team removes this worry . <p> 8 . Reduce any unwanted papermail before leaving . <p> In the UK , I use the Royal Mails redirection service to have my post sent to family while I 'm away . If its important , I 'll have them send it on for me . This costs -8/month for domestic redirection and up to -30/month to have mail routed overseas . Its a good idea to deselect paper statements from your online credit and store card accounts . Who needs to be reminded of yesterdays vanity purchases , anyway ? <p> For tax purposes , I have any important documents from HRMC sent to my Thai based address . This is easy to do by updating your current profile after receiving the Government Gateway I 'd . For everything else , I do n't  stress . If its important , I 'm sure the sender will find a better way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit card issuers where you 're traveling . <p> Very important and the source of much frustration while I 've been attempting to use ATMs overseas . Fraud detectors are sent in to a frenzy if you withdraw -500 from a Cambodian street market . Your bank will routinely cancel payments and refuse to process ATM withdrawals if you do n't  make it clear over the phone that you will be traveling to a particular region on a certain date . <p> For this reason alone , I chose to open an HSBC Advance account before moving to Asia . They have a strong presence abroad and its reassuring to be able to walk in to a branch that knows your name if you have any problems . 114274 @qwx974274 114272 @qwx974272 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 4 Comments <p> I opened my checking account in advance of leaving for the Middle East back in 2006 .

@@106277794 @1677794/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> When you 're building affiliate campaigns , do you consider what affect your message will have on the various demographics of your chosen country ? Or are you a One Size Fits All marketer ? <p> Let 's say you have a " Make Money From Home " bizopp campaign targeting America . Youve spent a lot of time split testing imagery , landing pages and offers , but you can only seem to scrape by on a profitable margin of 20% ROI . <p> Your next thought is to duplicate the campaign and port it over to Canada where the traffic is cheaper . <p> While there 's nothing wrong with this logic , it seems to be avoiding the elephant in the room . Countries , by nature , are incredibly diverse . <p> A single marketing campaign generating 20% ROI from the whole of America could quite possibly disguise one smaller campaign of 100% ROI in New York , and another of -100% in Tennessee . This is the price you pay for assuming that every state in America behaves the same . <p> When advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second thought . You ca n't be picky if you want to have the volume , right ? I think that 's bullshit . <p> Sometimes a large campaign can be hiked from 20% ROI to 40% simply by pinpointing the lowest converting states and removing them , or rebranding your message . In all my sleepless nights of testing , I have yet to find a single campaign that converts at the same % across every single state in America . <p> For verticals like bizopps , a lot of the thinking is just pure common sense . <p> Its widely known that the home bizopp offers perform much better when you design them specifically per ethnic group . Looking at the data , would we run the same campaign in Maine with its 95% white population , as we would in Mississippi which is 37% black ? <p> We could , but then we 'd have no right to complain if we found ourselves forever tied to that 20% ROI . How can you expect to improve it whilst you 're still targeting the whole of America ? Its difficult to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile that converts , and a user profile that digs out your WHOIS , sprays it over the Scam Forums and leaves seven voicemails asking for a refund . <p> The effects are even more noticeable on dating campaigns , which I touched on in this months Premium Posts . You do n't  really think those jpegs of California Girls are going to perform the same across every state in the country , do you ? <p> Quick experiment for you : Find a pic of a girl in a Yankees shirt . Set up two dating campaigns on Facebook . One for New York and one for Boston . The data should speak for itself . States do not behave equally ! <p> My girlfriend , who is half-American and has spent half her life in London and half in Indianapolis , is often telling me of the differences between what she considers the desirable states to live in ( New York City , California ) and the places she hates ( anywhere in the Bible belt ) . <p> Whether you love your state , hate it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact remains , America is an incredibly diverse country . <p> Likewise , England is perceived as a tiny place .

@@106277795 @1677795/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Its not easy to come up with creative ideas . One of the great myths of the innovation gurus suggests that actively brainstorming possible solutions is the best way to stumble across a brilliant idea . <p> The reality is slightly more complicated . Brainstorming can only truly be effective if you give your brain the opportunity to serve up more than the same useless ideas your conscious mind is already familiar with . True creativity stems from the subconscious mind , of which traditional boardroom brainstorming rarely ever seeks the guidance . <p> My favourite explanation for how this process works is to imagine a small room with two men sat by a whiteboard . One of the men is imaginative and sublimely creative and yet hopelessly shy . The other man is extremely passionate and committed to his ideas , but is equally dominant and unwilling to listen to others . <p> If you were to enter the room a pose a question that required the men to work together creatively , there should be no prizes for guessing how the subsequent brainstorming sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pitching his ideas with relentless enthusiasm but failing to tap in to the creative thought patterns of his colleague . <p> So what if we do n't  want to harness the passion and conviction of Mr. Confident ? What if were striving to dig deeper in to the creative mind of his shy colleague ? The popular solution is to distract Mr. Confident . Let him watch TV , give him an iPad , do whatever is necessary to allow his creative colleague to take control of the session and present some truly creative ideas . <p> This drawn out metaphor is actually a very close match for the relationship between our conscious and subconscious mind . <p> The conscious mind is very loud , objective and logical but it crucially lacks the ability to think outside the box . The subconscious mind , although not shy by nature , is a passive and reluctant observer to the thoughts we decide to run wild with . Just like the quiet colleague , it sits and waits for the room to turn silent . <p> Of course , the subconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow those ideas to develop we need our conscious minds to tune out and delegate the job . This is what leads to the moment of inspiration in the middle of the night , or the comical lightbulb effect where brilliance strikes while you 're busy cooking dinner . <p> The subconscious mind never stops working on the questions you present to it , which is why it can be hugely beneficial to pose any questions that require creativity immediately before you distract your conscious mind . <p> If your favourite TV show is about to start in 5 minutes , it can be damn near impossible to get real work done in the interim . So do n't  bother . Instead , turn over your most challenging questions to the subconscious . <p> Its a big help to write down the question , even if you feel like an embarrassment for doing so . <p> As an affiliate marketer , I might find myself reading the following dilemma over and over again : " How can I increase the profit on Campaign X from $100/day to $500/day ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , or worse started to brainstorm the possibilities on my whiteboard I would probably come up with the same ideas and the same problems . <p> But after repeating the question , and then sodding off to watch some TV , I can interrupt my usual line of thoughts and let the subconscious go about finding solutions . Those same solutions would rarely make it on to the whiteboard with the loud guy in the room doing all the talking . <p> You do n't  have to watch TV . Simply keeping a puzzle book by your desk is a brilliant way of short-circuiting the conscious mind . As long as you 're kept busy with crosswords and number games , you 'll be unlikely to interfere with the subconscious genius at work . <p> The next time you 're seeking creative inspiration , do n't  dwell on it . Pose the question , hand it over to your subconscious , distract yourself , and wait for the delivery . Having seen how stuck in its ways the corporate battlefield can be , I would suggest mentioning the process to your boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Most of the inspiration takes shape while I 'm at work .

@@106277796 @1677796/ <p> If you 're landing on this page , I 'm going to assume that you have little to no experience of developing affiliate marketing campaigns . There are obvious requirements before you can start making money . And I say that very carefully , because there 's no guarantee you 'll ever make money . <p> You realize there are hundreds of thousands of fledgling affiliates who know more than you and still do n't  make a penny , right ? Have high hopes and low expectations . <p> Before I break your spirit completely , allow me to explain the purpose of this page . Sooner or later , you 're going to need to have your own website to push traffic to affiliate offers . You can " direct link " people to offers , but it is n't always profitable and as a business model its vapour thin . You 're not adding any value . You 're just a middleman that both sides can live without . <p> So to get your own website , you need hosting and a domain ( MySiteName.com ) . Youre spoilt for choice here . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of a headache . <h> Web Hosting <p> Youve got ta have somewhere to host your site . But the requirements for a web host can range from $5/month for an economy shared hosting plan to dedicated server solutions where you 'll be paying hundreds . Be sensible with your initial investment . <h> Host Gator <p> Everybody on a tight budget loves a slice of Host Gator action . This Australian company offers incredibly cheap web hosting starting at $4.95/month . Its functional with good support and should be more than adequate for an affiliate marketer to get his feet wet . I would recommend the " Baby Plan " on the basis that it allows unlimited domains . That means you can host many different sites on the same package . If you do n't  have a web host , this is where to start . <h> WiredTree <p> WiredTree is a hugely popular choice for affiliate marketers needing to squeeze maximum performance out of their sites .

With WiredTree you get reliability , good support and value for money . <h> Storm On Demand ( Liquid Web ) <p> A company to watch out for in the future , and a hosting provider to consider if you 're looking for a solution that scales and grows to match your needs . Storm On Demand brings " cloud hosting " to the table . Unlike typical web hosting where you 're charged a fix price for fixed bandwidth , disk space and etc Storm On Demand scales to suit your usage of resources . <p> If your website experiences a day of sudden crazy traffic , Storm On Demand will automatically upgrade your hosting on the fly to cater for the demand . Or if you find that you 're not generating enough hits to use your bandwidth allocation , they will automatically downsize you and you will pay less . Its a nice idea and its something you 're going to see a lot more of in the future . <p> Do n't  Sweat ! If this is beginning to sound too confusing and technical , forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web hosting with Host Gator and worry about technology later . <h> Domains <p> If you do n't  have a domain for your website , you can kiss goodbye to any sense of credibility . Domains are cheap to buy so there 's no excuse . Always remember to add private WHOIS protection . This means nosey strangers cant go dicking around your personal details and looking at the owner of the site in various domain registers . It does n't  protect you on every level , but as an affiliate marketer , its a layer of privacy you should welcome with open arms . <p> So where to buy domains ? <h> Namecheap <p> Pretty simple really . Register a domain for as little as $2.99 , although you can expect to pay $10 for a domain worth having ( dotcom ) .

You can be walking aimlessly while stumbling in to celebrities , faces and events that are usually reserved for Hollywood and TMZ . There 's an incredible vibe in the city .

This made me laugh though : <p> " Wait , you 've got a problem with our tipping ? Then get the f- out , you limey prick ! " <p> My problem with tipping in New York City is simple . Its a massive pain in the balls . Should I tip 18% ? 20% ? 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus for going beyond the call of duty . At the risk of sounding like Mr. Pink reborn , I should point out that I 'm more than happy to tip in line with a foreign culture , even if I do n't  agree with it . It seems that many employers in New York City adopt a policy of underpaying service staff ( often below minimum wage ) on the assumption that those workers will make the money back in tips . <p> That 's not really a problem when you go out to dinner . You can just add the tip to your bill and have it whacked on the credit card . But Jesus mothershagging Christ , how many people require tips out here ? <p> There 's the guy who carries your bags , the guy who calls you a cab , the maid who tidies your room , the delivery guy who brings your pizza . endless hoards of servicemen and women waiting to be tipped a fixed percentage , or a few dollar bills , for something that is nailed down in their job description . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough dollar bills in my wallet to tip every last act of service like its some kind of noble gesture I have n't already paid for .

Add a fixed 20% to every bill if need be . Pass that money on to your workers and allow me to reward them with a tip if and when they go beyond the call of duty . Do n't  expect me to be reaching in to my pocket for dollar bills that do n't  exist .

You can get in to a lift and somebody will say " Good morning " . In England , that somebody is more likely to unravel a broadsheet copy of the Financial Times , smack you in the chops , and mutter something in to his coffee about getting in the way . <p> Americans are generally quite friendly to approach . I admire how you guys get on a plane and treat it as an opportunity to recite your life story to the guy in the next seat . It makes me feel pretty unsocial for wanting to plug in my headphones and go to sleep . <p> Walking from the World Trade Center to 50th Street is not sensible tourism . I 'm not sure why I thought a 4 mile stroll across Manhattan would be smarter than catching the subway , but 2 hours later , after shoving and barging my way through Times Square , I knew better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup on penalties kept me going , but my shirt was soaked through with nervous sweat and titty-chaffing regret . Not a good look . <p> Why do the toilets in American restrooms have a gap of about a foot at the bottom of each cubicle ? What kind of privacy is that ? You can see twisting , contorting feet and gray sweat-stained undies in the cubicle next to you . The thing is already half-built , right ? Surely one more square foot of material ca n't be too much to ask ? I resent intimacy when it comes to restroom design . Or is America so paranoid about terrorism that bombs are expected to be found in restaurants and bars ? <p> " Downtown " Indianapolis reminds me of " Downtown " Des Moines .

Its too bad London was designed for horse and cart or wed be on that shit too . <p> Mad Men has to be the greatest show on television today . How awesome has Season 5 been so far ? Its nice to watch it live . <p> America does a much better job of selling through the television than we do in the UK . Ads seem to be catered for direct response .

But a pretty damning depiction of the debt culture that is shagging America as we speak . <p> Indianapolis has some of the most relaxed dress sense Ive ever seen . I went to a wedding and was stunned to see a few of the guests turning up in plain t-shirts and shorts . Admittedly , it was hot as hell . But still . Is that normal ? <p> Indianapolis also has one of the weirder pieces of art on display in a city center . Its called Ann Dancing , and it features a woman ( Ann ? ! ) gyrating in an LED display . <p> Its amusing to hear tales of drunken Indy guys hitting on Ann for her shapes , especially the kick back down to earth from their friends . " Dude , she 's electronic . You 're not getting any . " <p> Indy , like most places in America , does breakfast well . Stacks of pancakes , waffles and mega-omelettes plus seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crap out of my local Masterchef . <p> Starbucks really does seem to have a monopoly on the coffee shop business in America . Here we have Costa , Caffe Nero and many other competing chains . In America , the closest competition to Starbucks is the Starbucks on the next block . I fell in love with the Iced Caramel Macchiato on this trip . <p> Mass Avenue ( where I was staying in Downtown Indy ) has a bakery for dogs . I found it pretty mesmerizing . Freshly baked doggy treats that look just like the real human thing . I bought some for my pups , but theyll be lucky if they receive them . The chances of me traveling 3000 miles without ripping in to a pack of strawberry kisses are slim . <p> Everybody speaks about America having a problem with obesity and over-eating . Maybe that 's true , but there 's no shortage of healthy options in the supermarkets if you go searching for them . The choice is amazing . And excellent value too . <p> Healthy options aside , Taco Bell is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in NYC ? I asked for a ride to JFK ( in rush hour admittedly ) , and his response was , " You better pay some good money . You do n't  have cash ? Yeah , you can pay by card but you 're pretty dumb for not carrying cash . Always carry cash . You better leave a real nice tip . This is rush hour . Its busy . You 'll see . You leave some good money , alright ? " <p> It furthers my point about tipping . Why should anybody receive extra for an agreed service when their attitude stinks of entitlement ? I found myself longing for South East Asia where tips are seen as unexpected and generous rewards . One of the first things you notice about the service industry in Thailand is that people take great honour and enjoyment from serving their customers . Its par for the service . And that makes it rewarding to tip somebody . <p> In New York City , the sense of entitlement made me feel pretty uncomfortable at times . Its intimidating for a tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can only imagine how confusing it must be for those from foreign cultures where tipping is actually frowned upon . <p> The New York Public Library is pretty damn impressive . The sort of place where you hide your Kindle for fear of disgruntling the Book Deities . <p> My girlfriend took a fencing lesson outside the library . She was praised for being particularly aggressive . " Its good . Its how you win , " said the instructor . <p> I was mighty chuffed to finally meet a polar bear at Central Park zoo . I guess its not the same as seeing one in the wild , but I did manage to leave the scene with my balls in tact . Beggars ca n't be choosers , right ? <p> I also made it to the kids zoo for no other reason but to feed some goats . There are a million and one things to do in Manhattan , and I chose to spend $2 on the activity you can do for free in Wales every day . That either says a lot about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller things in life . <p> But , obviously , not my appreciation for the 3 small kids I booted out of the way to get to the goats . They were expendable . <p> I find it amazing that so many people in the Midwest opt to build their own houses , often as a first step on to the property ladder . How lucky are they ? ! Designing and building your own home is a distant dream in London . I would love to be able to design a home from scratch . Unfortunately , the UKs massive overpopulation makes that a rather expensive proposition . Were lucky to design our own kitchens . <p> All in all , America is definitely one of my favourite places to visit . It has everything that I 'm used to in London , but on such huge and often ridiculous scale . Besides a few skirmishes with taxi drivers , I found it surprising how friendly and welcoming most people were . In London , you sense people are mutually delighted to avoid eye contact .

An extremely inspirational and motivational aura is all around . Something everyone should experience . You cant accurately be " told " about it , but it truly does feel like you 're in the presence of anybody who 's anybody . <p> I 'm from the US and I share your thoughts exactly on tipping . I cant stand it . Just as you said , if they want more money , then charge more money . It really gets me when people want tips for a service I 'm ALREADY paying for like a haircut ( or a taxi ride in your story ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for food and paying for the service could be seen as separate . But come on , just increase your prices if you want more money or else quit acting to entitled to &gt;20% tips ! Haha . <p> And the biggest argument I always hear is " you 've never worked in the service industry bla bla bla " yeah , because I choose not to . <p> ( Disclaimer : even with my strong thoughts against tipping , I do still tip 20-25% . Damn social conditioning . ) <p> Exactly , its difficult for a tourist to draw the line under a service that he s already paid for , and one that he s expected to tip for . <p> Halfway through my stay , I read this article LONG ... and it freaked me out . I thought I 'd been giving some pretty generous tips by my own definition of what tipping should be . But it turns out , for example , that a tip is expected for every single drink ordered , or that when somebody brings bags to your door , you tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion when you 're paying several hundred dollars per night for your room , you do n't  expect to be pocket pinched for a dollar here , or a dollar there . Youd expect a hotel demanding such rates to be paying its employees a good wage and taking care of shit like that as a prerequisite for the luxury they 're promoting . <p> If those small tips for bag delivery are really such a vital part of the ecosystem , just charge me however much extra and pay your staff more ! I do n't  get it . <p> On a personal level , I feel much more comfortable paying the full amount of whatever they expect to receive upfront . Otherwise I end up adopting a cynical attitude towards every last act of generosity that comes my way , knowing that its probably being done for a tip . <p> The slightest sign of a friendly conversation oh , great , better add a few more dollar bills to that tip , right ? <p> Good writeup . You 're right on with all your points , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will always target tourists , because they have nothing to lose and most tourists pay up . Make your own decision you do n't  pay until they do their job anyways . <p> As for Vegas ( Ngo mentioned ) : I 've never had any problems with them over the many many times Ive driven . Once again , pay what you think is worth it , do n't  let them beg for more . Try to keep the rides short though , because they wo n't say a word and the prices will rack up . <p> Other places in the US you need to visit that are 100% different than NYC : Grand Canyon , Vegas , San Diego , San Francisco , Denver ( if you like skiing or mountain biking ) , and Boston . Chicago is similar to NYC , but is also a fun place . <p> I have n't been in USA yet but its in the plans for the next year . Good thing you left that article . I knew about the 15-20% tip in the restaurants , but a tip for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi ride , especially if drivers are that rude That is just weird . <p> I 'm from Belgrade , Serbia and here it is a custom to leave around 5% tip in the restaurant or bar , or 10% if you are really satisfied with the service . Now as far as London goes , I was there last summer , and I got a feeling people rarely tip . My bill in the pub was like 9.7 pounds , I gave 10 and started leaving , and the bartender tried to give me back the change . But I 'll take that any day vs paying $1 after each drink , even if the drink prices in London are maybe a little higher . Speaking of which , how did you find the prices in NY compared to London ? <p> Yeah , nobody tips in pubs or bars in London . Even if you let him keep the change , he would have just placed it in the till for the company . <p> We do tip in restaurants , and we occasionally throw change to the buckets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's about it . There 's a very different attitude over here . The price pays for the product AND the service , which in my opinion , is the easiest way to avoid confusion , offense and poverty for all concerned . <p> As for the prices between NYC and London its tough to say . I spent a lot of time in downtown Manhattan where they are equal . But if you go slightly away from the tourist spots in each city , New York is quite a lot cheaper . The taxi rides are a stealeven if the drivers cant drive for shit . <p> I assumed that they were pushy towards tourists because many tourists do n't  get their tipping expectations . Its like holding a knife at the throat and saying " Youre gon na give me what I think Im entitled to , I 'm not gon na have you pretending you did n't  know what to do " <p> Its pretty ridiculous that the three options when you pay by card are to tip 20% , 25% or 30% . <p> A 30% tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and massaging my balls lovingly with the other . <p> I mean , seriously , the guy just sits there , does n't  say a word ( not that I 'd want him to ) , weaves like a fucking madman between lanes , and honks at practically every intersection . Then I 'm supposed to rate him good , great or life-changingly awesome . Does n't  add up to me . <p> NYC has always had strict controls on the amount of licenses given to taxis ( they now go for well into the six figures on the open market ) . <p> The vast majority of licenses are now owned by companies and theyll broker out the taxis usually to fresh immigrants . However the compensation structure works so that the tips end up making up the majority of what the drivers make ( which is still , at best , a barely liveable wage ) . <p> So when they hear foreign accents they usually will tell you about the need to tip due to it being so integral to their income . Last summer I was in NYC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French and the driver says , " You parisians have to tip me , okay ? " . From his tone he clearly was n't a fan of parisians , lol . <p> Nice to see you fed well abroad . The portions always seem infinite below the border . Perhaps allegiance to the bigger is better motto , but still sad to see the family of 4 lining up for fried chicken with a combined mass of well over 1000 lbs . Often I wonder how they do it themselves while I whine and moan over 5 lbs overweight . <p> Did you get to check out Ellis island ? I was able to track some of my ancestors early passage to North America on the walls of that once rat trap herding station . NYC definitely has its history . <p> I agree with your infuriating tipping observations . However I think its simply Capitalism in its finest , take take take . Its helped America reach the pinnacle of the global economy , but at what cost ? <p> Great read interesting to read from the perspective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My favorite tip scam is the guy sitting in the restroom that wants $1 for handing me a paper towel . WTF is that about ? Maybe if I take a mint or something from your tray I might give you a dollar but sorry , I do n't  need help getting a paper towel to dry my hands . Most of the time I just resort to not washing them to avoid the situation altogether 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

There are larger affiliate events held around the world . But you 'll find a conspicuously small percentage of actual affiliate marketers at most of them . <p> ( And an abundance of hot air . ) <p> One of the things I appreciate about STM gatherings is their ability to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clued in crowd ; some might say cynical . <p> That 's good . <p> Anyway , the first night was a blast . It was a pleasure to meet so many new and old faces . <p> As for the rest of the week , that was a different kind of chaos . <p> While the rest of the affiliasphere was gallivanting merrily around old London town , I was playing a furious game of Sell , Chuck or Donate with my entire belongings . <p> Its not easy condensing a house full of clutter in to one 20kg suitcase to be exported to your new home on the other side of the world . <p> Its even more problematic with two very live dogs who are coming along for the ride . <p> Alas , we have made it to Bangkok , and we have spent the last month settling in to our new home . <p> Even the pups have adjusted to the searing heat : <p> Before moving , people would ask me , " Why Thailand ? What 's the appeal of Asia ? Wait you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would try to answer , " For the beaches ! The food ! The weather ! The way of life ! " <p> I did n't  know what the fuss was about until I ventured to an affiliate meet up organised by Nickycakes and a group of Internet Marketers in BKK . <p> Seriously <p> I 'm no food blogger , but I 'll tell you this much for free : <p> If the opportunity arises , grab a fucking Thaiger burger and stick it in your face . <p> You will not regret it . <p> They are sold every day at the Game Over Lounge , which is a sort of restaurant slash bar slash ultimate nerd station with pool tables , a pile of board games , giant screens of Fifa , and lots of western expats . <p> Very good fun . <h> Fixing My Eyes <p> It was over a particularly strong 8.7% IPA at Craft last Sunday that I decided to book an appointment for laser eye surgery . <p> Its not the first time I 've tried to have my eyes repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a London clinic in 2010 . <p> Back then , I could n't have the surgery because my eye pressure was too high . <p> Ironically , I ended up spending the money that was supposed to go towards LASIK on moving to Thailand the first time . <p> Anyway , why laser eye surgery ? <p> I 'm not against wearing glasses , but they have always been an inconvenience . <p> If you want to play any kind of sport , say snooker or golf , they are a big burden . Likewise , if you want to swim in the seayou better pitch a flag where you left your towel . <p> Many people settle for contact lenses , but I have never been able to insert them properly . Mainly because I am the ultimate pansy when it comes to things touching my eye . <p> Its not that it physically hurts . I just instinctively blink , or twitch , or refrain . <p> All of my attempts to wear contact lenses failed miserably , so last Sunday I decided to go for the jugular , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One week later and here I am , three days after surgery , with the crispest long distance vision I 've ever had in my life . <p> Its an amazing feeling . <p> I 've had a few people ask me about the surgery itself , so here 's what happened . <h> LASIK in Bangkok : Consultation to Operation <p> My initial consultation was on Thursday at Bumrungrad Hospital . <p> I had my vital signs taken , plus a basic vision test and an eye pressure measurement ( it was fine this time ) . <p> After meeting the doctor and discussing the risks ( " In thousands of operations , we have never lost an eye " " I should fucking hope not ! ) , it was off for more tests aimed at measuring peripheral vision , the strength of my cornea and the composition of my tears . <p> I then had my pupils dilated whilst the doctor disappeared for lunch . <p> Its funny , but Thais do n't  often differentiate between breakfast , lunch or dinner . They call all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do not fuck with Eat . <p> Woe betide the poor bastard on life support as the clock strikes feeding hour . <p> This break gave me about 45 minutes to stumble downstairs in to Au Bon Pain for a motivational Whoopie Pie . <p> After one more eye examination " the most awkward of them all , where the doctor inserts a weird lid on to each eyeball " he gave me the sweet music to my ears . <p> " You are a good candidate for surgery . " <p> Followed by a strange Thai hard-sell , " You want it yes or no ? " <p> I was delighted just to have passed the tests , " Whens the earliest I can have it ? " <p> " Tomorrow , 4pm . " <p> Well fuck a rubber duck , OK then . <p> I was relieved to get a slot in the next 24 hours . <p> It gave me no time to worry about it . <p> I went home with sore eyes , ate at Au Bon Pain for the third time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai lesson . <h> Surgery Day <p> My girlfriend had work so I went in for the surgery alone , marginally bricking it . <p> My vital signs were taken again " blood pressure through the roof . <p> No surprise . <p> The doctor gave me one last examination then sent me outside with a cup of water and some Valium . <p> A gift from the Gods . <p> A few sips later and I was being hauled out of the building in a wheelchair and whizzed over to the 5th floor of the adjacent hospital . <p> This was news to me . <p> I thought the surgery took place in the clinic . <p> I was n't expecting to be wheeled past intensive care , asked to change in to full hospital garb ( with an ill-fitting pair of pyjama bottoms that I had to hold up ) and then parked in a busy ward . <p> The valium definitely took the edge off the experience . <p> I was transferred on to the trolley , and then rolled in to the operating room . <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpen to the point where its now as close to perfect as I could wish for . <p> The downside ? <p> My near-distance vision is blurry , and will remain so while my muscles heal . <p> I have to wear sunglasses almost constantly for the next month . <p> I ca n't wash my hair for 4 days ( its a bit like Glastonbury , except I ca n't get rat-arsed either ) . <p> I cant use my pool for a month . <p> I have to apply eye drops , four times per day , for ten days . <p> I have to limit my time at the computer for the next two weeks . <p> Oh , and I have to wear these fucking things to bed for the next two weeks : <p> A great look ! <p> All in all though , zero regrets . <p> One of the best decisions I 've ever made . <p> If you 're considering LASIK , I 'd say go for it . <p> There are a few hairy moments along the way , but nothing too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what I 've been up to . <p> Loving life in Thailand so far . <p> Ill be back posting affiliate marketing bollocks in May . 114274 @qwx974274 <p> In case you missed it , my brand new 2015 edition of Premium Posts is available now .

Or to give it a lick of paint ? That is the problem with renting in London , and it is the straw that broke this camels back . <p> For such a vast monthly spunkage of money , you would expect a home in return . What you actually get is a roof over your head and a pain in the arse . Several of them if your estate agent is Haart . <p> I want to own what I live in , but I do n't  want to pay hundreds of thousands for a shoe box in Fulham .

Why are women like that ? <p> Alas , America is the best choice . Its also the most exciting choice . <p> You guys have a lot of cornfields . But you also have a lot of exciting , vibrant cities .

Its how content you feel with your day-to-day living . That means embracing wherever you are , not trying to crawl home to the nest , just because it feels familiar when your current surroundings do not . <p> The NHS is a brilliant institution and part of what makes Britain great . It is a lifesaver for people with pre-existing medical conditions . <h> The infuriating but begrudgingly effective transport network <p> No TFL is going to suck . <p> I 'm sure I 'll feel guilty for mocking the Picadilly Line within about 3 weeks of our separation . Even for those occasions where it really , really deserved the scorn . <p> It also means I 'll have to buy a car when I land in America . <p> For all the hate that gets directed at Transport For London , very few cities can claim to be as well connected .

" I wont catch your eye even though I 'm the breadth of a nose hair away from your face if you wont catch mine . " <p> To tourists , we must come across as the least social animals on earth . But to a Londoner , that moment of sweet purposeful avoidance tells us that were home . <h> The glorious tropical climate <p> Yeah , about that <p> Show me the plane , already . <p> I 'm hoping to make the jump across the pond on March 25th , as long as I get through the visa process in time . <p> It can be quite stressful to hop continents .

According to the CDC , all the following neurotoxic metals and chemicals are intentionally added to vaccines : Mercury , MSG ( monosodium glutamate ) , Formaldehyde and Aluminum . <p> These toxic elements should never be INJECTED into any human being ! Their toxicity explains the deadly side effects of vaccines , including : <p> * Comas * Seizures * High fevers * Spontaneous abortions * Death <p> So why does n't  the vaccine industry make " clean " vaccines without these additives ? The answer is because the whole point of vaccines is not to medically help people , but rather to intentionally POISON them . <p> I&amp;W Were not sure where were going to settle yet .

Not a lot , just enough so that you could make a break for it if things turned sour and start a new life elsewhere . I love my wife more than anything in the world , but I have $30k in the Bahamas she has no idea about and I would start adding to it at the first sign of trouble . Call it an insurance policy . Things are sweet right now but people can change . There 's nothing as plastic as the human brain . <p> A buddy of mine , he found out his wife was fucking another dude after 7 years of marriage . Messy fucking divorce , his nerves would have been shot to shit and his life would have been ruined if he did n't  have his cash stash . After it was all done with he looked at the little scraps hed been left with after the divorce and thought " Man , thank god I have the stash ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> Now I am not saying that will happen to you , and I certainly fucking hope it does n't  happen to me , but a wise man hopes for the best but prepares for the worst , you know what I 'm saying ? <p> Quick Political rant ( you suckered me in ) : Chances are Obamas victory will cost you much more in taxes than you wouldve paid for individual healthcare . On a side note , every lazy person in America strongly agrees with the Obama presidency . They are also very angry about a blog about working hard and making ones life better without the government paying for it . <p> Love your blog , but you 're making two huge fucking mistakes : moving to the imploding U.S. and getting MARRIED there . Check out the website Zero Hedgethe U.S. economy is tanking and its not going to get better . The country is not free anymore and its getting less free by the day . <p> I 'm an American and my feelings about my home are complex , but I can say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man with options . No , its probably not the worst place you could go , but you 'd be better off in many , many other places . <p> Marriage in the U.S. puts all the power and control in the hands of the woman . It gives her every benefit and you nothing but liabilities . For any reason ( or no reason at all ) she can takes the kids , half your money , probably the house , and then the real fun begins with alimony and child support for the better part of the next two decades . There may never be a problem , but you have to know that the sword of Damocles is forever hanging right above your head and all she has to do is give it a little nudge . <p> Seriously , before you " tie the knot ( noose ) " ask yourself this question : what are you gaining by getting married that you do n't  already have ? In modern day America , the answer is absolutely nothing . Quite the opposite is true for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Then , on some level , she absolutely knows this . <p> You are in an incredible situation right now : you are young , rich , and free . The world is your oyster . <p> Maybe your whole plan will go well . I hope it does . One thing is for sure , though : you will , in very significant part , no longer be in control of your own life . Whether you are rich or poor , miserable or happy , will mostly be in the hands of your wife and the U.S. government . Nobody can really appreciate freedom until they do n't  have it . You have a whole lot right now but , if you go through with your plans , you will soon have a HELL OF A LOT less . <p> I vote for San Francisco , it can be cold here but if you live away from ocean it is not that cold , like in SOMA . That 's what Angry Russian should have done and move to my hood and maybe he would have stayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cant find a better city business wise either . <p> OhEmGee could it be Dear Finchy is becoming a Yankee ? Woop woop ! Do n't  let biz setup scare you from living in Cali . I 'm going to agree to disagree with my beloved Russky , but Florida is humid balls and parts can be quite redneck . Let 's chat Cali and/or Chitownia ! <p> @Jim That cash stash idea is genius . I 'm not getting married but will be working out the best way/place for doing that when I do . <p> Why Bahamas ? <p> @The people saying shove socialised healthcare up your you know what . You 're weird You like being sick and getting no healthcare ? You like the prospect of bankruptcy for health costs ? <p> NHS is inefficient in parts but overall a lot better than handing massive profits to insurance corporations who want to fuck you over . The US military is inefficient in parts and funded by tax you do n't  moan about " Socialised Military wasting mah dang tax dollahs ! " <p> Finch , long time reader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump in as an American here <p> First , Jim gives you some absolutely horrible advice . Maybe he is too young or too immature to know better , but I hope you think twice about giving it much credence . Stashing any amount of money w/o your spouses knowledge is no way to start a marriage . Do you really want to start your marriage living a lie ? If you feel the need to hide money that then you should take it as a sign that you shouldnt be getting married because either ; 1 ) you are n't  ready , or 2 ) she is the wrong girl . If you are concerned about your assets than you should have enough of a nut sack to get a prenup done in proper fashion . <p> As far as becoming and American as some have mentioned its not what it used to be and if I were you I would consider all my options at this point in time . I think there will always be space for those who hustle here to build their own American Dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and risk taking like it once did . In short , many think we are on track to become France-lite . Any objective observer should be scared of the debt levels in the US right now . What actions the US government might take to put a band aid on the situation and how that could affect you ? It will probably take years to play out , but I guarantee whatever actions the US government takes WILL NOT involve more freedom for you as an individual . The masses will go along with anything especially if they are being subsidized in some form or fashion , especially if they do n't  have the personal resources to sustain their lifestyle on their own accord ( 98% cant or wont ) . You should look into Simon Blacks Sovereign Man stuff . He s a smart dude that has some interesting ideas on how to limit your exposure and maximize the freedom and flexibility in how you and where you live your life . <p> True , it does n't  matter what state you live in vs. what state you form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows to where you live and you 'll have to pay state taxes on that . It is what it is , but if that 's an issue for you make sure you look into it . CA has some scenery and weather . We lived in San Francisco for 2 years and loved it . Just know going in that you 'll be taxed more there and of course you know the cost of living issues having lived in London . Take your cost of living in SF for a run of the mill place and spend that much somewhere like Indianapolis and you can get some pretty swanky digs . <p> I also traveled to Indianapolis 2x per month for 5 years solid for a prior job . Its really a GREAT place to live , so if that 's on your list of potential I would give it serious consideration . Especially if you are settling down and becoming a family man . Zionsville , Carmel , and Fishers on the north side are all great places to raise a family and you will get a lot for your money when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate ) and the public schools in that part of town are some of the best in the country . <p> As far as city vs. suburb It depends on your stage of life . Do n't  listen to suburb bashers . It can be a great life . It all depends on the people in the area . Look , living in the city is a lot of fun , and if its just you and the Mrs. by all means give it a go . But with a family , I the combination of increased costs and conveniences of shopping , parking , transportation flexibility , and schooling UGH . Since you mentioned Chicago now that 's a fun town . Lots of good places downtown or you should check out the Lincoln Park neighborhood ( $$$ ) on the north side of the city ( Go Cubs ! ) . My one issue with Chicago is many locals have a " Chicago is the greatest place in the world and I 'm better than you because I 'm from Chicago " attitude that I find quite annoying . Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> As for people I 'm going to stereotype here , but this is based on my experience living on both coasts , throughout the midwest , and the south . Take it for what its worth , which is probably squat . But I 've LIVED in a lot of spots in the country , not just visited . <p> West Coast . Some of the best geography available if you are into that . People seem to be more concerned about their own lives there , less of a " community " type of feel . Socially more organized around " causes " as opposed to where you live if that makes sense . <p> East Coast . Faster paced , expensive . People are friendly enough but certainly more of a hard edge . Its a dog eat dog world and you should be prepared to get yours or get left behind . <p> Midwest . I prefer the people in the Midwest . Funny how those on both coasts consider those in the midwest rubes , but in my experience its the midwesterner that ends up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company out of college that has a large presence in the states and the HR department told me they like to hire out of the midwest because they are the most flexible and can live anywhere an make it work . The odds are less so when taking someone from say the Northeast and putting them in Texas for a job . I found those in the midwest friendly enough and also direct but without the hard edge of easterners . The big drawback to the midwest is the geography . A lot of it is pretty flat and boring and frankly not much to look at . <p> South . Very friendly people , but sometimes just a surface level of fake friendliness . Can be difficult to break into social circles some places in south if you are not from there . Overall work ethic seems to be lower than what you might see in East or Midwest try to find a reliable contractor sometime . Depending on your make up you may not want to sweat your nutz off for 9 months a year in some parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would never live in Florida for that reason . I know some people enjoy that though ! Personally , I 'm a 4 seasons type of guy . Texas well , its in the south but it kind of stands alone . People are friendly and confident there , but you have to stomach a lot of Texas pride from those born and bred there . Geography in most parts of the state leaves something to be desired . No state taxes though ! <p> I live in North Carolina now . Really like it . Weather-wise its tough to beat depending on where in the state you are . Four season long fall , long spring and short winters are nice . Mountains and ocean . <p> If I were in your shoes and and free choice of where to live here are some places I 'd consider in no particular order . Any of these would offer a great quality of life . <p> If you are truly city at heart , these are the only ways to go . New York City go big or go home Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could go back in time and live the 3 years we did there without kids I would . I would n't raise a family there though . <p> I did n't  include LA on the list because anyone that 's been to downtown LA knows its not really a city . Its more of a sprawling megaplex of self absorption . Fun to visit for a while . Maybe if I could had the cash to live in a place on the beach in Malibu I might think differently . <p> Nice post The city of Miami is really one of the best destinations in the United States Miami , FL has a lot to offer when it comes to entertainment . Another thing to mention is the great nightlife this city has to offer I would no doubt recommend Miami Florida to any tourist that wants to have fun in a interesting city . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

I want to steer affiliates away from the idea that they can only be successful on Facebook and Plentyoffish . In reality , its much easier to be successful away from these traffic sources . Volume 4 will be about not only diversifying your traffic sources , but designing landing pages and ad creatives that break the mould . <p> I 've spent a lot of time researching concepts and profiting from them , which is always a moral relief ! so I 'm excited to condense what Ive found in to one diatribe of expletives , balls and occasional marketing advice . <p> I 'm also going to be rolling out an affiliate program . Its been a pleasant surprise that so many bloggers have been happy to write reviews for a free copy and no monetary gain . Which is why I 'm all the more excited to throw in a commission and broaden my reach through word of mouth exposure . <p> If you run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be more than happy to send a copy in exchange for an honest review . Hit me up if that sounds interesting ! <p> Ive been thinking a lot about the future of the Premium Posts . Where can I take them ? How many volumes can I justify before the value begins to diminish ? Well , I 'm sure readers will be quick to tell me when the quality hits the skids , but I think I 'd like to release 7 volumes and then focus my efforts on product creation elsewhere . <p> CPA affiliate marketing is a small pond . There is a very apparent shoreline where the sales numbers are fixed , no matter if I 'm publishing a masterpiece or a stinking shipwreck . I 'd like to move in to more scaleable markets , not just to make more money , but to deliver my writing to people that might be affected by it in a different way . There must be more to this world than motherfucking arbitrage and CPVLab columns . Please tell me if I 'm wrong . <p> The whole process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future away from affiliate marketing . I 'm already envisioning in my mind the final product on FinchSells.com to be a roadmap of why I got started in affiliate marketing , and why I decided to leave it . <p> That product is still many months away .

Honestly , I still have to find out about premium posts and of course also find out about your products . Itll be interesting to see you launching your new product . Good luck ! <p> @Party Girl I feel like there 's some kind of literary monster lurking under the surface . I just need to pluck up the inspiration to get to it ! Flattered to hear the blog inspired you to take up CPA though .

Its a shame the Penguin had to munch my old bag of tricks . What can I do now ? " <p> Stage 2 : " Gee , every blogger and his dog seems to be guest posting . Maybe I should write a few dross articles and ask command the owners of better sites to publish my links . " <p> Stage 3 : <p> Stage 4 : One week later . " why u no reply ?

But the new breed of Content Marketer leaves me in no doubt that the era of the complete and utter moron is still in full swing . <p> My girlfriend just received an invitation to place a link in her sidebar , for free . The incentive ? " If you link to us , well seriously consider buying a sponsored post on your site in the future . " <p> My biggest problem with the guest posting outreach process is that it has become so popularised , so tutorialised , that every self-righteous urchin with a WordPress has begun to consider his brainfarts welcome on other bloggers property . <p> Do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Its just so painfully obvious what your intentions are ! <p> Readers are not stupid and good bloggers are rightly protective of their assets . <p> If you think you can march in with a blatantly SEOd article and then wait to cash the cheques , you are wrong , my friend . It does n't  work like that . It shouldnt work like that . How can you possibly be so arrogant to think it would ever work like that ? <p> Okay , rant over . <p> Let this be a message for content marketers : the web is not your playground .

Why not simply use MyBlogGuest , Guestr , or one of the other forums dedicated to guest blogging ? <p> Stop bothering those who work hard and contribute to people who want the content . <p> Just be happy that Google should not be to far from extinguishing the guest post all together . Most guest posts are a paid for in one way or another and we all know what " THE WEB SPAM TEAM " , sorry is that what they are called now ? thinks of paid links . So I see the day in the not to distant future , when Mr Cutts brings down his gavel and declares " Guest Posts are bad Mkay ! " Followed in a very rushed statment of " **25;164;TOOLONG Mkay ! ! " Which then will be followed by " Crickets . Cheeerp " <p> @Alan , The way guest posts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If used correctly , you do n't  really need to rely on G$$gle ; for example , you could you use it for targeted traffic from a blogger mate in the same niche . <p> I decided to let someone buy a link on a site a couple of months ago . The site had been hit by both a penguin and a panda and it is n't obvious to me if or when I 'll do the work on it to revive things , so I figured why not ? It is another test <p> The site is in the investment world and has a few pages about forex , so I get occasional emails asking to arrange a guest post . What I learned very quickly was the scale of budgets out there for buying links and boosting rankings . Truthfully , it has made me feel rather inadequate with my remaining sites that I am competing with such large amounts of money . <p> Even though I have been involved with SEO for a number of years , I feel like this is a new level and another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online in the future . <p> Great post ! Out of the litany of guest post requests that I have received over the years I have only had one ( 1 ) , yes " 1 " individual whom I chose to submit a couple of articles . She wrote concise , articulate and 100% original content that is right on point to the subject matter of the site in question . I consider this a very rare opportunity that will likely not be seen again for a while . Nevertheless , the poorly written and often unintelligible requests keep pouring in every week I feel your pain = <p> @Stuart Do you think there 's any potential to game the big budgets by setting up simple web properties that are monetized through those sponsored links ? <p> You need only rank for " forex write for us " and associated terms , rather than " forex " ! <p> @Jeffrey I 'm not there ! In sunny London at the moment . <p> @Jonathan I 've checked out sites like MyBlogGuest in the past and while I do think they 're useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker through those services . <p> For the SEO robot like the one highlighted in this post , I agree . They should definitely use those services . <p> I have a guest post going live on ProBlogger this month that took several hours to write and edit . Its a lot of work for one piece . But the size of the readership and the platform makes it a great opportunity to showcase my writing . Its nothing to do with SEO . Its everything to do with getting people to my blog and hoping they stick around . Thats guest posting done properly , in my opinion . It takes a lot of time . <p> I just love these emails and replying to them . Its like playing with the unsolicited phone calls I get here in Blighty about home surveys from India .

There are larger affiliate events held around the world . But you 'll find a conspicuously small percentage of actual affiliate marketers at most of them . <p> ( And an abundance of hot air . ) <p> One of the things I appreciate about STM gatherings is their ability to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clued in crowd ; some might say cynical . <p> That 's good . <p> Anyway , the first night was a blast . It was a pleasure to meet so many new and old faces . <p> As for the rest of the week , that was a different kind of chaos . <p> While the rest of the affiliasphere was gallivanting merrily around old London town , I was playing a furious game of Sell , Chuck or Donate with my entire belongings . <p> Its not easy condensing a house full of clutter in to one 20kg suitcase to be exported to your new home on the other side of the world . <p> Its even more problematic with two very live dogs who are coming along for the ride . <p> Alas , we have made it to Bangkok , and we have spent the last month settling in to our new home . <p> Even the pups have adjusted to the searing heat : <p> Before moving , people would ask me , " Why Thailand ?

And how long would it take ? <p> I see this dilemma often . <p> " I have XXXX in the bank . My skills are A , B and C. Please tell me how to turn the above in to an affiliate machine that prints money . " <p> The obvious answer is that there is no obvious answer . But I do n't  think many people are satisfied with that , so let 's try and piece together some rough strategies you could follow . <p> $5,000 is a pretty decent budget . <p> First of all , some key assumptions : <p> #1 . The $5,000 has to be completely disposable . <p> If you are intending to draw down the $5,000 to cover living expenses , or to rely on as savings , then it is n't a genuine budget . Its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start with a $1,000 budget that you can afford to lose , rather than $5,000 that you 've mentally invested elsewhere . <p> #2 . Your living expenses are paid for until the affiliate business has succeeded . <p> $5,000 is a nice amount for testing campaigns , but its not enough cash to run a successful long-term affiliate business . <p> Wed have to assume that your living expenses are covered by a secondary income and that you wont be drawing down any profits until you have a successful business in place . <h> Where to Start ? <p> Let 's run through some of the popular affiliate verticals , as well as some other well known money-making strategies . <p> The question here being , " Which strategies are suitable for newbie affiliates with $5,000 to burn ? " <h> Go Mobile ? <p> When newbies ask for guidance , what 's the recurring piece of advice you hear ? <p> " Its 2015 , buddy . Time to go mobile " <p> Mobile offers are all the rage these days . <p> That 's nice , but its pretty bloody useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you heard an affiliate say , " Theres money in Desktop " ? <p> The thing is , there is money in traditional web-based desktop offers but nobody phrases it like that because to do so would be to completely miss the point . <p> Going mobile is a term used by many affiliates seeking the next big trend , but until you can actually pinpoint what market you plan to serve , its the equivalent of a Walmart Wannabe deciding to go retail . <p> There are four main models we can attack in mobile marketing : <p> App installs <p> Pin submits <p> Mobile lead gen <p> Pay-per-call <p> For somebody with a $5,000 budget , this is how I would rank them : <p> 1 . App installs These have low payouts ( cheaper testing ) , with simple conversion flows , and they are available in many different markets including some that are unsaturated . You can test these offers cost-effectively . A good choice . <p> 2 . Pay-per-call Second best bet . As I explained in Premium Posts 2015 , its difficult to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The metrics are simple . You can cut your losses fast . Theres much more signal in the data with these offers . <p> 3 . Mobile lead gen Mobile lead gen offers pose the same challenge as those on the web , although quality issues can be difficult to predict . This is n't a bad starting point , but its probably not the best while advertisers are still coming to terms with monetising mobile users . <p> 4 . Pin submits By far the toughest nut to crack on a $5,000 budget . Pin submits generally have higher payouts and higher testing costs . Finding a winning formula can be obtuse , to say the very least . You are tied to mobile carriers , and they are notoriously up-and-down . I recommend you avoid them on this budget . <p> Once you decide to go mobile and focus your efforts on one of these four models , there 's still more work to do . <p> Ideally you should be narrowing your search to a single market or region ( preferably one that is n't saturated ) , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , you could choose to focus on : <p> App installs &gt; Utility apps &gt; South East Asia . <p> App installs &gt; Gaming apps &gt; DACH <p> Mobile lead gen &gt; Dating offers &gt; AU/NZ . <p> In short , one does not simply decide to go mobile on a $5,000 budget and live to refresh his stats happily . <p> You need a strategy that cuts much deeper than simply : " Hey , you know what ? I 'm sick of desktops . All these bastards using their mobiles ? I shall convert them starting Monday . " <p> CONVERT THEM TO WHAT ? <h> Facebook <p> To succeed on Facebook in 2015 , most affiliates rely on three structural advantages : <h> Adult Dating <p> Its a popular starting point for newbie affiliates , probably because so much of the vertical is , err , graspable at first sight . <p> In truth , adult dating traffic has become so fragmented that you 'd do well to blow through $5,000 without learning a lot along the way . <p> That 's unless you were to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . <p> The problem most affiliates have is n't losing money , its not making money . There 's a huge plateau of adult affiliates stuck perennially at break even . <p> If you want to grow your $5,000 , you 'll have to focus on out-working the competition by scalping pockets of profit that are ignored by larger advertisers . <p> Or you can tackle Tier 3 countries where low volume still trades for a decent ROI . <p> Avoid advertising to Tier 1 countries with a $5,000 budget . <p> That 's not to say you ca n't strike success , but the ROI will be much lower than if you execute the same strategy on a less saturated market . <h> PPV <p> Pay-per-view networks ( PPV ) exploded back in 2009 and 2010 . <p> They have declined in popularity since then . <p> HOW IT WORKS : PPV networks serve ads to users who have installed third party software ( usually a toolbar ) on their computers . The advertiser can target users based on their current browsing activity . For example if you were browsing Pets.com , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETS LOVER , PLEASE LIKE &amp; SHARE MY DOG . " In reality I probably would n't do this . <p> Even TrafficVance , the cr+me de la cr+me of PPV sources , just recently ditched its long standing requirement that new members must have a referral in to the network . Its a pretty open playing field these days . <p> PPV networks may offer a shrinking audience , but that audience is large enough to make good money from . <p> Some of my highest ROI campaigns in 2014 came from combining PPV traffic with pay-per-call offers , often under dubious circumstances ( See Premium Posts 2015 ) . <p> The precise nature of the targeting means you can easily find small volume campaigns with high ROI that are perfect for growing capital and cutting your teeth in the business . <p> On a budget of $5,000 , PPV is a good choice . <h> Plentyoffish ( POF ) <p> Another traffic source that was massively popular 2-3 years ago . <p> It 's unlikely you 'll stumble in to the same $1000/day campaigns that were bread and butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ROI , low risk profiteering . <p> The amount of targeting available means that you are unlikely to miss the mark so badly that you 'd blow through a $5,000 budget . <p> I just read a success story on STM of a guy who only started on POF in October 2014 , with no formal experience in web stuff . <p> He s now making a comfortable $500/day profit , whilst building out a team of employees to help him scale . <p> His budget getting started ? $4,000 . <p> Whilst these success stories are reasonably common in affiliate marketing , that does not mean that anybody can do it . <p> When you read through the actual follow along , its clear that his success = application , hard work and the ability to think like an affiliate . <p> In short , the guy earned his success . <p> As for POF ? <p> There 's always money in the " <h> Pops and Redirects <p> If you have success with broadly targeted PPV campaigns , the natural progression is to move on to pop and redirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more volume because the ad is triggered by JavaScript ( or a redirect ) rather than third party software . <p> One thing to note is that while every other traffic source mentioned here ( except PPV ) can be targeted on shared hosting , you would be a bloody fool to try your luck with pops or redirects whilst HostGatoring on your technology . <p> Your server has to be lightning fast and able to deal with hundreds of page loads per minute . This will eat up some of your initial $5,000 budget . <p> Pop traffic comes with a big learning curve , but redirect networks like ZeroPark are easy for newbies to master and they have good targeting options . <p> Again , a good choice for the mid-range budget . <h> Invest in Web Assets <p> The guy who sent me this $5,000 question already had a rough idea of how he wanted to invest the money . <p> He wanted to buy a site that he saw on Flippa , in an industry that he was familiar with . <p> The site was producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $4500+ . <p> There are n't  many businesses you can buy that pay for themselves within 10 months ( and a suspiciously high percentage of them find their way on to Flippa ) . <p> That is always my concern with sites that are put up for sale . <p> The most important thing you can find out is why sell ? <p> If you are looking to invest $5,000 in to an existing website or app , the golden rule is to know your market better than the existing owner . <p> I think many wannabe site flippers overestimate growth potential whilst dramatically underestimating the work that would be required to break the plateau and flip at a profit . <p> If you want to do this well , you have to almost reverse the equation and greet every site-for-sale with cynicism . <p> In this case , I told the guy to go right ahead . <p> He said he knew the industry and saw an opportunity . <p> Well , that is a simple recipe for success that has no comeback from a crusty old affiliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Launch Own Product <p> Can you design , create , launch and market your own product one that turns in to a sustainable long-term business for $5,000 ? <p> Yes , you can . <p> If you understand an industry and spot an opportunity . <p> A lot of affiliates try to execute this strategy and get it tits-up , for one of four reasons : <p> They do n't  actually understand their chosen industry . <p> The opportunity that exists does n't  translate in to paying customers . ( They misinterpret the non-committal " Sounds like a good idea " ) <p> The market simply does n't  scale in to a big money business , either in the size of the transaction , or the number of paying customers . <p> The product never reaches the market . <p> My advice , before you spend $5,000 on a product or website that is n't proven to work : <p> Design just the sales page , then run a PPC campaign to test that people are willing to buy . <p> You do n't  need to have an actual product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers are willing to read your pitch , and then click the buy button at the end of it . <p> Once they click to buy , you can announce COMING XXX 2015 and place them in to a mailing list . <p> And then build your product . <p> You can do this several times on a $5,000 budget until you find a product that people are actually willing to pay for . <h> Managing Cashflow and Scaling <p> If you decide to focus on arbitrage buying traffic , sending it to affiliate offers then its important to manage your cash carefully . <p> A budget of $5,000 offers some slack , but the reality is that industry margins are shrinking . <p> $5,000 wont go as far as it used to . <p> Your first objective must be to increase the amount of capital you have at your disposal . <p> Back in the days where 100% ROI was second nature , you could turn $5,000 in to $10,000 in the space of a week . <p> It only took 3-4 weeks of concentrated scaling and suddenly affiliates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These days , if a newbie does very well and secures a 20-30% profit margin , on weekly payments , whilst utilising his entire $5,000 budget , he can expect to add $1,000 to it each week . <p> One of the reasons why its so important that you have a secondary income outside affiliate marketing is that you want to keep any profits inside your business . <p> Turn $5,000 in to $6,000 . Turn $6,000 in to $7,200 . Turn $7,200 in to $8,640 . <p> Money in the bank is so important for affiliates . <p> Not least because you will experience down times , but also because a bank balance heading in the right direction is a massive psychological boost when it comes to exploring new traffic sources and investing in data . <p> Two of the big mistakes you can make at this stage are : <p> 1 . Spreading your commission across too many networks . <p> Its better to work with one network that pays you weekly , rather than three networks that pay you monthly . <p> To get paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in commission for that period . <p> Working with multiple networks will spread your money in too many different directions and increase the time it takes you to bank it and reinvest . <p> 2 . Spreading your ad funds across too many traffic sources . <p> Ive lost count of how many traffic sources I have sitting there with unused ad funds . <p> Just last week I stumbled across a PPV network I have n't used since 2011 holding $750 . <p> Needless to say , if you are sitting on a $5,000 budget , you have to make that money work for you . <p> Avoid spraying payments all over the place . <p> Inject those dollars in to the campaigns with the highest ROI . <p> ROI = GROWTH <p> If you get lucky and have Campaign A producing a 30% ROI , vs . Campaign B producing a 50% ROI you should be pausing Campaign A and loading the funds in to Campaign B to maximise your return and capital growth . <p> When I hear stories of affiliates spunking through their monthly budget in 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why the hell were you bidding so high ? " <p> If you know that you have $X to get you through the next 30 days , and you have a profitable campaign that is rapidly guzzling the funds , then your next step should be : <p> 1 . Lower bids to decrease volume ( and raise ROI ) . <p> or <p> 2 . Day-part aggressively to run only at the most profitable hours ( once again , raising ROI ) . <p> What you shouldnt do is treat all profitable campaigns the same . <p> Cash is king . <p> Whatever strategy gets you more of it , banked quickly , is where your attention should lie . <p> ( And yes , for many aspiring affiliates , this may be your existing day jobs ! ) <h> In Conclusion <p> I know most affiliates aspire to run gigantic campaigns that print money by the hour . <p> Hey , its nice to be ambitious . <p> But unless you have the budget to match , you are going to have to get practical and hustle your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pocket , its about learning to walk before you can run . <p> If any of you have managed to turn $5,000 in to a well-oiled money printing machine ( and I know many of you have ) , feel free to explain your strategy below ! 114274 @qwx974274 <p> In case you missed it , my brand new 2015 edition of Premium Posts is available now .

@@106277804 @1677804/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> There seems to be a lot of discussion in the Internet Marketing world over how best to create a lasting business , and particularly where to reinvest your profits if you create one that works . Knowing as many affiliates as I do , this is great to hear . Its nice that people are waking up to the reality that reinvestment is critical for long term business growth . <p> Unfortunately , life is rarely as simple as spend spend spend . Many of us , through starting businesses and throwing balls to the wind , have taken on large amounts of personal debt . So , when is a good time to reinvest , and when is a good time to pay back what you owe ? <p> There 's a reason why I voted Tory in the last UK Election : spending money you do n't  have is the first sign of financial insanity . There 's only so far you can kick the can down the road . I 'm all for reinvesting money to build a business . But to do so at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the faith that it will go away , or that paying it back will be easier at a later date . <p> Everybody who ever went bankrupt once thought their debt would be easier to pay at a later date . <p> So let 's be honest . When you look at your earnings vs your outgoings and find an extra -100 of disposable income , do you immediately piss your pants with unbridled epileptic joy ? Is the opportunity of binge consuming too good to resist ? Maybe you see it as a golden opportunity to invest in a new business idea . Shit , maybe you throw your extra earnings on the stock market . <p> I think this is stupidity of the highest order . <p> Pay back what you owe . The easiest way to relieve stress while running a one man business is to minimize your outgoings , whereas carrying unnecessary debt is the stupidest way of shooting yourself in the balls if it all goes tits up . <p> Let 's say you 've racked up -5000 on your Mr. Plastic Fantastic . Its tempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts . So when your monthly statement arrives , you wince for a moment and then toss it aside . Mmm , the sweet smell of escapism . Instead of doing the sensible thing and paying back as much money as you can afford , you stick to the minimum repayments . Yeah , that -9.57 will go a long way . You feel like the fucking gingerbread man screaming " Argos , you 'll never catch me now ! " But , of course , Argos will catch you . Painfully so . And you 're not even a gingerbread man . You 're just a tosser in the red . <p> Next month , your new statement arrives and lo and behold , youve barely scraped the surface of your original debt . You are a slave to interest . Even the dude printing statements at Argos calls you his little bitch behind your back . Yes , you 've become the picture-perfect sucker that credit companies swear by . <p> Why is it so tempting to turn a blind eye to debts ? Worse yet , when you have money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more appealing than repayment ? Unfortunately , we are hardwired to resist giving up what we think we already have , even when that possession is deluded . We 'd rather receive -50 today than wait for -100 next year . And this attitude contrives to keep us in the pockets of the industries that exist to monetize our greed . <p> Well , if the large majority of us werent such pigeons of consumerism , we 'd learn to spend what we could afford and the crunch would be a term reserved for those living their luxury lifestyles in castles built on sand . <p> Whether you appreciate the implications or not , all of your debts are working against you day by day for as long as you allow them to accumulate interest . If you spend your disposable income on reinvestments rather than repayments , your investments better be pretty badass . Your ROI needs to be discriminately high to not only produce profit , but to pay for the money you are leaking every month through those deceptively flexible minimum repayments . <p> Another issue I struggle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the sales devices used to satisfy our weakness for instant gratification , the same trait that encourages us to accept -50 today instead of -100 in a year . Generally , they are used as distractions ; woven in to contracts that aim to milk every last pound of that reward back , and so much more . <p> It seems that many people have yet to catch on that you can have the best points scheme under the sun , but if you fail to make the full repayments on your debts , the accumulated interest will annihilate any hope you had of a freebie . The same for airmiles . Fucking hell , do n't  even get me started on airmiles . I will happily take whichever card attempts to blinds me with the least bullshit . And if I hear airmiles , I instantly know that I 'm swimming in it . <p> The people who run up gigantic debts on credit cards , then fail to repay them under the pretense that its okay " cause I 'm earning airmiles , in n it bruv " should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply shot behind the bike shed . I have n't decided yet . Its the same irrational logic that inspires a mildly psychotic Bible-Belt housewife to spend her days extreme couponing in the name of good value . <p> To put it simply before I spiral further in to the extreme couponing rabbit hole clearing debts as soon as possible is nearly always the best way to spend your money .

@@106277805 @1677805/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> White noise is something I rely on enormously as a way of channeling my focus and getting work done at home . You could probably guess this by my last post , or by the endless endorsements on Twitter . Its something I genuinely believe in . Some of you are now fans of SimplyNoise.com , while others I 'm sure will remain skeptical . <p> When I discovered the benefits of white noise , it got me extremely interested in how the brain could respond differently to various audio signals . I inevitably found myself researching the controversial subject of binaural beats . Before you judge that I 've disappeared up my own arsehole in to a world of mystical hyperbole , allow me to explain . <p> So what the Scooby are binaural beats ? <p> Binaural beats have divided mainstream and scientific opinion for a long time . They were discovered in 1839 by a dude called Heinrich Wilhelm Dove , who was clearly meant to be a scientist from the second he was named . <p> Heinrich determined that by playing two audio tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to any number of artificial states by what 's known as the entrainment of brainwaves . If I sound like I 'm speaking with a Wikipedia tab loaded by my side , its because I am . <p> By tapping in to the right frequencies , its argued that your brain can be induced in to one of many subconscious states . You may feel anything from surges of creativity , supreme focus , states of healing to even telepathic understanding . Now whether you believe this shit or not , it does n't  really matter . As somebody who investigated the effects for himself , I can say that I 've found enough common ground to keep myself intrigued . <p> If you listen to this binaural beats sample , you 'll get an idea for what they actually sound like . Now in terms of raw beauty , Regina Spektor it most certainly ai n't  . I should point out that headphones are a must . You cant expect binaural beats to be effective if you do n't  have a good pair of headphones to funnel the frequencies through each ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered around the Internet . Some are free , some are not . Each beat is crafted to create a shift in consciousness to a desired state . For the self-help freaks reading this , you 'll find a binaural beat for practically every state imaginable . Whether its giving up smoking , losing weight or improving your work ethic , sites like The Unexplainable Store have a beat for the occasion . <p> It would be easy to dismiss these websites as manipulators of unproven science for financial gain . But there truly is a great deal of confusion over just how influential these beats can be . Not too long ago , they were the source of a media backlash dubbing them illegal narcotics . <p> Personally , I do n't  want to oversell what binaural beats may or may not be able to do for you . I believe the effects are psychological and unique to the individual , in such a way that science has no reliable method of classifying them . <p> If you 've ever read The Power of Your Subconscious Mind , you are probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact environment around you . There is very little concrete scientific proof of how binaural beats can produce identifiable changes in your life . But if your state of mind is right , its highly probable that science is still playing catch-up . <p> All I know is that I 've extracted a great deal of productivity since trading Spotify for these looping beats . There are many free binaural beats that you can sample for yourself , and if you liked the white noise post , I suggest you check them out ! 114274 @qwx974274 <p> Check out The Unexplainable Store for the holy motherload of binaural beats and isochronic tones .

If your wife reacts violently to the latest admission that you 'll be spending a night in the office , maybe its not her that 's being unreasonable . <p> Maybe workaholism has you by the balls . <p> These are warning signs and nothing less . Entrepreneurs are often praised with the positive attributes of being passionate , determined and willing to go the extra mile . Our greatest fault is that somewhere in the thick of it , our personal identity becomes so intertwined with the projects were working on that to be separated fuels resentment and a shitty attitude towards those who remember the more care-free caricatures we used to be . <p> It does n't  matter how many times you explain the stressful nature of your work , it will always seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the battle for oxygen on a cramped morning commute , or the constant uncertainty of how a moody boss is going to lash out at them . <p> To see us sitting in our home offices , Spotify blaring to the max , makes it very difficult to understand how we cant afford ourselves a simple Off switch . The ability to snap and morph in to the infinitely cooler husband , father or friend who reaps the rewards of his split personalitys sheer grit , rather than drowns in the magnitude of how much is yet to be achieved . <p> This type of in-fighting can prove more than destructive to a small business . Just because your home office is lacking the small red button marked " Self Destruct Completely " , do n't  assume the same effect ca n't be achieved through negligence and tunnel-vision . <p> It can , and in my case , it almost has . <p> One of the buzz words you will often hear mentioned alongside running a business is accountability .

Not directly , but by allowing the workaholic in you to prosper and grow . It becomes the dominant personality . <p> Its a great balancing act to be able to hold yourself accountable for short term failures , while still appreciating that when you work your bollocks off and the lucky break does n't  materialise , patience is in order . <p> Self-destruction is almost guaranteed if you cant differentiate between those elements of blame . The workaholic will grab any opportunity to dominate your life , but its an attitude that will never subside even in the face of great success .

@@106277807 @1677807/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Carving a career in affiliate marketing is seen by many as the first fingertip on the entrepreneurial ladder . Its high risk work with a suitably high reward . Perhaps it should be no surprise that at a time when stock markets are riddled with fear , and savings accounts are bordering on useless , our industry is the subject of much interest from anybody with money to burn . <p> Ive grown to see affiliate marketing not so much as a long term business , but as a source of easy capital for the company I want to build . It funds my bigger picture . Yet every so often I get to speak to individuals who see the industry from an outsiders perspective . They do n't  view affiliate marketing as the cold blooded arbitrage it usually is . They see it as an investment opportunity . <p> To them , affiliate marketing is the goose that lays the golden egg . It carries the legendary hook of doubling your money , even if those words are rammed home by experts with as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvesting small fortunes from our industry , that much is true . When you hear such a constant barrage of rags to riches tales , there has to be some truth to the idea that affiliate marketing is one of the quickest methods of doubling , trebling and quadrupling your money . <p> One glance at the typical UK savings account and you will find that annual returns greater than 4% are a rarity , especially if you require direct access to your money . By the time inflation is taken in to account , your newfound spending power raises some tough questions . " Should I continue buying Iceland-range cheesy wotsits by the multipack ? Or can I afford to upgrade to Kettles ? " <p> Decisions , decisions . <p> Affiliate marketing , to anybody sick of calculating the scant difference between 3% and 4% returns , is full of bold promises . It teases with countless fables of got rich quick stories , those that defy everything taught in Business Studies class . <p> I 've never hidden my preference for running campaigns that achieve at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started with . To most business minds , immediate 75% returns are the sort of bullshit fantasies peddled by first-time entrepreneurs with their figures in a twist ( forgetting to pay themselves , for example ) . But they do exist . <p> So does the golden carrot of potentially skyrocketing profits make affiliate marketing a suitable investment strategy ? Or is it , to steal a particularly tasty lyric , a siren singing you to shipwreck ? <p> If you found -100,000 to invest and had never touched an affiliate campaign , could you realistically expect to double your money ? Does money buy you a better shot at success ? <p> Well , ROI is deceptive , particularly in a field like affiliate marketing . The juiciest profit margins are a distant third in our importance stakes , trailing both scalability and sustainability . <p> Let 's say you have -100,000 to invest . You despise the typical savings accounts . You 're looking for a much greater return than the 4% which the proletarians live and die by . <p> Many people assume that as long as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk in the park to beat the typical savings rates . If 75% is possible , 4% should be achievable while wearing a blindfold with your balls in the jacuzzi . Right ? No , wrong . You 're assuming : <p> A. You will launch campaigns that actually make a profit . B. You will invest the entire -100,000 . <p> On paper it looks pretty easy for an affiliate marketer to pummel that -100,000 ; to reap massive profits that are beyond the scope of banks , or even the stock market . But the percentages are skewed . <p> 4% return on -100,000 leaves you with -104,000 at the end of the year . That 's a profit of -4,000 . On par with a typical savings account <p> But what if you only get enough campaigns profitable to spend -10,000 ? In that case , youd need to hit a 40% ROI to match the savings account rates . <p> Of course , there 's no reason why you cant use a savings account and work on affiliate campaigns . Except that in most cases , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , the system is flawed . You 're throwing money at arbitrage , which is hardly a value investment . <p> The purpose of a savings account is to make all your money work for you . The mechanics of an affiliate business are completely different . Many would argue that having -10,000 to invest is just as good as having -100,000 . Plenty of networks will pay you weekly so the cashflow is irrelevant . We aim to invest externally , not internally . <p> Every wise investor should make a habit out of reading the market before he shoves his dick in it . And what happens when you read between the lines of our industry ? You hear , over and over again , that affiliate marketers are rushing to invest their money away from affiliate marketing . What does that tell you ? <p> Even though we can sniff the delights of a 75% ROI , or taste the doubling of our money in an afternoons work , we know that like any market experiencing rapid growth the bubble will inevitably burst . <p> Unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliate bubbles are burst every day . <p> It could be a Facebook account getting banned , the collapse of a top offer , or the bankruptcy of a once-great network . Our business plans collectively resemble a trip through the Chessington Bubbleworks ; fragile and a little bit whimsical , to say the bloody least . <p> My advice to anybody looking to throw their money at affiliate marketing as a means of investment is simple : do n't  do it . Use your capital to build assets that the rest of us are in this very business to fund . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> For information on how to rock those 75% ROIs , and much more , hit up my Premium Posts .

But exactly like you said , the main problem is scale and sustainability . There is a scarcity of resources and the pie is getting bigger at a slower rate . The pie is just being cut up in different ways as time goes on . Its a big pie still , that 's why there 's always opportunity . <p> The people who view this as an investment does n't  understand that this is an intensive OPERATING business for a long time . It takes intelligence , patience , scrappiness , focus , and extreme hard work to sustain an income you will be happy with . It takes that to creative any kind of passive income . Whereas , an investment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROI to measure performance of the ads . But the income generated is just that , not a return , but an income .

Your eyes are sore , your back is creaking and your balls are mash potatoed from the chronic strain . Does this sound like last night to you ? Even worse , does this sound like EVERY night ? <p> I believe I could write an encyclopedia on how to live the most unhealthy life imaginable while working from home . Itd be pretty fucking girthy too , because I 've learnt every trick in the book . <p> This is not my attempt to claim a medal or the dubious honour of " Guaranteed to be Dead Before You " , but rather a wake-up call for any other affiliates who are putting themselves under an unhealthy amount of strain . Its something that applies to everybody , whether you 're making money or not . <p> Blistering tension headaches Last year , I went to get laser eye surgery only to find that my eye pressure had soared to such a level that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyd operated on me . Okay , they werent ready to explode , but I was on the receiving end of some blistering tension headaches . You remember the high school advice about taking a fifteen minute break every hour ? We are the square eyed gremlins that should actually be listening . <p> I 've managed to get rid of my constant headaches . Which is a relief because they can be quite debilitating for anybody who works in front of a screen . Drink lots of water , maintain good posture and take regular breaks . A good backlighting helps too . <p> Days become one Is your 2011 Christmas calendar marked with " same shit , different day " from January to December ? Right from a young age , were given structure in our lives through the regularity of school on Monday to Friday . Most people then find themselves in day jobs that follow the same pattern . For those who wake up one day realizing they do n't  have to go to work anymore , days tend to merge together and it can be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed schedule . <p> Its not a sin to take the weekend off . But if you have no recollection of what day it is , or the date , or even the time , you probably need to introduce greater structure to your day . One thing Ive noticed is that I budget to spend whatever time I have on the same tasks Ive set . Give myself too much time and I 'll simply work twice as slow . So by giving yourself two days off , you can force greater productivity out of the remaining work days . <p> Checking your phone constantly How often do you find yourself having your ear chewed off in a really boring pub conversation , quietly wishing the bastard across the table would just drink up so his bladder bursts and you can check your Gmail ? Just because technology is at your fingertips 24/7 , that does n't  mean you 're constantly on the job . <p> I have n't used a mobile phone in over 7 months since I moved to Thailand . That 's partly down to a desire to be disconnected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual is in Thai . Either way , your emails are n't  going to disappear . And you do n't  want to end up acting like this . <p> Volatile mood swings Does your mood correlate with your stats ? Are you a whimsical little treasure on good days and a WickedFire poster on bad days ? Most full time affiliates are passionate about their jobs to such an extent that the pride and engrossment of running their business can cloud all sense of judgment . So if you have a bad day and your ROI plummets , it can be very tempting to let the stats control your mood . <p> Part of overcoming volatile mood swings is your ability to recognize that the good days are closely intertwined with the bad days . None of us are enjoying profitable campaigns without a rich memory of the nights spent bashing our heads at a brick wall . You have to embrace that this is the way it goes .

So much so that my maid is probably convinced I 'm a vampire by now . <p> Its a simple fact that the brain can not and will not function at its optimal level if you 're not getting enough sleep . If you work through the night , take a two hour nap , then get up and go again you 're going to hit a wall sooner rather than later . It might not come directly in the form of passing out at your desk , but the body will find its way to hate on you . Lack of sleep also ties in very closely to volatile mood swings . <p> Sore back , neck , shoulders and abdomen How is your posture ? Most of us spend unhealthy numbers of hours sat at our desks , and this will wear the body down if your posture is all wrong . For me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back straight to avoid stomach and abdomen cramps . And also to have the correct line of vision with my monitor . <p> Those of you with multi-screens are much more likely to suffer from eye strains and pounding headaches because the eyes have to work that much harder . You should be eye-level with the top of your screen . If you 're constantly craning your neck and switching to new screens , its going to increase the tension . Ryan Eagle probably has the headaches of a squashed badger with his 17 screen setup . <p> Social butterfly to Friday Night Hermit A side effect of days becoming one , it can be very easy to lose grip on your social life if it becomes the afterthought of running a business . I 've mentioned in many posts how I used to be much more social before I took on the responsibility of earning my own wages . <p> Back in my day job , Friday felt like Friday should . You 'll often see that entrepreneurs and affiliates find it very difficult to capture that same Friday feeling when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to get done everything theyd sat down and planned on the previous Sunday night . Either way , you cant afford to become a hermit . There 's no point in earning a fortune if you cant muster the freedom to actually enjoy it . <p> Shortened attention span One of the primary reasons why I have become a total sucker for white noise and binaural beats . Ever since high school , my attention span has been nothing short of a pain in the arse . I 've often been left wondering how so many great ideas could slip through my fingertips , only to be distracted by the next . Its a painful cycle and I ca n't stress highly enough how focus and concentration are kingpins to any entrepreneurs chances of success . <p> The good news for me is that binaural beats and white noise have done wonders for my focus . It all depends on the individual , but I recommend them highly if you suffer from a lack of clarity in what you 're trying to achieve when you sit down at your desk . <p> Failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating , to your mood . If you cant recognise a success no matter how tiny it is you will never be successful . Success is n't born out of the look of envy in other peoples eyes at Affiliate Summit . It comes from within . You have to be able to acknowledge your own triumphs as often as you kick yourself in the balls and resent those inevitable failed campaigns . <p> Similarly to appreciating success , you need to be able to say " Enough is enough " on those rare days where you cross off all your tasks and still feel you could do a little more . In the end , you 'll work yourself to the brink . Giving up against your will becomes the only option . Why spoil a good day ? Reward yourself when you achieve your goals ! <p> God awful dieting Hold hands , I have a confession to make . I am currently cleansing my system with raw food .

Exercise and dieting are fundamental cornerstones for not feeling like a lazy slob . My excuse for eating poorly has always been that I do n't  have time to cook .

Me and my girlfriend switched to his slow carb diet about a month ago , and on top of the obvious benefits like losing weight and not feeling like I 'll die if I decide to go for a run in the morning , its also helped a lot with my concentration and mood . Not to mention the decrease in random pains in organs that should n't regularly hurt . <p> Diet and exercise has a much larger impact on you than most people , myself included , realize . Just a simple change in diet to something more nutritious can elevate your mood , help with focus and just make you feel good about yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also stress the value of having a stable mood despite sometimes poor results . When I 'm on the phone pitchin my product its really easy to get on a roll when you get a few sales on the board and after that theyd flow in easier than slacking off . On the flip side you 'd have off days too where the fish just werent biting . Its easy to feel down , but you do n't  know that the next person on the phone wont be an asswipe . Its so important to keep your chin up and focus making the most of every opportunity even when your performance is n't where you 'd like it to be . Focusing on your long term goals is vital when your measure of success is so DIRECTLY tied to your performance . <p> I feel like our whole generation is doomed to have eye problems with all the time we spend in front of brightly lit screens . <p> I went full time last year and now after several months I find myself with a lot of the habits you mentioned . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blurring of my days . <p> For me the best thing I ever did was after moving to a new city I started a new schedule and regiment . <p> Wake up at a semi-decent hour like 9-10 , cook a good breakfast . ( fried eggs and bacon may not be super healthy but hey better than my old coffee and a cigarette then go out to eat for lunch. ) and I 've started working out as many days per week as possible . <p> I usually make my workout a part of my mid day break go to the gym for an hour then eat lunch and get back at it . Its got me feeling better , gets me out of the house , and I can at least feel like I did something other than sit in front of a screen all day . <p> Wow . This makes me realize I am beyond workaholism . The only bullet point that you listed that does n't  apply is " God awful dieting " but only because I used to be heavy and now am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For like ever . <p> Not pussy at all on the raw foods . http : //www.rawist.com The way I see it , natural health is a way to get an edge .

@@106277812 @1677812/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I was speaking to some dude pushing Resveratrol the other night . He seemed paralyzed with fear that somebody had performed a WHOIS lookup on his anti-aging domain . The woman decided to drop him an email about the product , asking whether it really worked , what else she could do to look like shed fallen back in to 1998 , and a bunch of other shit . Well the affiliate ( who 's a decent guy ) , crapped bricks and saw the idea of replying as a marketing sin . <p> First of all , its always a good idea to purchase private registration on any domain that you intend to use for affiliate marketing . I learnt the hard way when my very first domain for a Google bizopp was uncovered . Inevitably , my email was leaked to a bunch of complaint filing dinosaurs whod make the Warrior Forum look appealing in comparison . I still get requests for refunds emailed to me . Its a pain in the ass . Go for private registration there 's normally a coupon floating around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Use it and save yourself the bother of forwarding 500 emails a day to a sketchy advertiser . <p> Anyway , it seems that some affiliates are quite happy to promote a product to the stratosphere on their blogs and flogs . But when it comes to dealing with customer inquiries face-to-face , they freeze up and their hard sell deserts them . I think its probably a guilt issue . This guy is a solid affiliate turning over a lot of revenue , so it came as a bit of a surprise to me that he had n't  dealt with prospects directly . <p> Nobody promoting a rebill wants to personally persuade a customer in to signing up for an offer that 's going to flatter to deceive at the very best . The way I see it , if you 're going to promote a rebill , you might as well be good at doing it . Grow some balls and close the sale before another affiliate does it for you . When a customer innocently mistakes you for an expert in your field , do some Wikipedia research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale . <p> I 'm not actively promoting rebills at the moment , but when I have in the past , I 've always placed a contact form on my site . Some affiliates see this as asking for trouble . I see it as opening as many avenues possible for sealing a sale . <p> More recently , Ive gone one step further and added a phone number to some sites . I realize a lot of affiliates would never agree in a million years to reveal their first names let alone a phone number that works . Its just a recipe for 24/7 distractions and angry misled customers , right ? <p> Well , not exactly . You can snap up a virtual phone number on Skype for something ridiculous like a few bucks per month . Setup an individual account for your site and get yourself on Elance . <p> Hire somebody who sounds remotely professional . Give them a simple script of dialogue . Get them to record a message and use it as your Skype voicemail ( does n't  have to be Skype ) . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a call to action . <p> When somebody stumbles across your site and decides to get in touch over the phone , your voicemail will specifically request that they leave their email address . It might even push them on to a second tier website ( if you 're smart , this website will be the sort of thing that an Adwords intern would slap you for ) . You might not think that such a long-winded tactic is very likely to accumulate a profitable number of leads , but go try it . <p> Most people wo n't bother because there 's too many stages attached . <p> Get a Skype number ? " Ca n't be bothered . " <p> Hire somebody on Elance ? " Too much work . " <p> Chase up leads ? " Who do you think I am ? " <p> Truth be told , you probably do n't  need to bother . But if you start thinking outside the box , you can be more than the one trick pony that most affiliates are when it comes to capturing leads . <p> Offline marketing opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone number can go a long way when you wade in to those waters . <p> Ever found yourself staring at Gumtree or Craigs List thinking " if only I could get my wang in to that " ? Well maybe you could if you stopped thinking linkbait and started thinking individual leads and individual needs . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> One Comment <p> Excellent idea with the voicemail . I think people will definitely call a number if they see it . Back when I was promoting biz-op rebills with a flog , I set up autoresponders to my e-mail contact form .

@@106277815 @1677815/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> One of the most predictable New Years Resolutions for an Affiliate Marketer goes like this : <p> " I will learn how to control my time . I will defeat procrastination . 2012 better watch out cause I 'm coming to kick its arse " <p> The statement of intent is admirable , but far too many of us fail to learn from mistakes of the previous twelve months . Do we expect them to just disappear ? Irrationally , yes we do . We wait for a new dawn , pretend that were all the wiser , and then plunge head-first in to the same mistakes yet again . <p> I would guess that at least half of the people reading this blog woke up on January 1st with the desire to procrastinate less . We see it as the great barrier to achievement . " Well , if I could only bring my mind to focus on all the plans Ive set for myself , I 'd be as rich as my whiteboard says . " <p> Procrastination is a buzz term that bloggers love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to speak about . Its a universal phenomenon . To beat procrastination is to pin jelly to a wall . Just when you think you 've cleared your head of all the distractions and white noise , along comes another unforeseen circumstance to obliterate your carefully laid plans . We end up feeling sorry for ourselves . No matter how hard we search for solutions , we still fall in to the same black hole lapses of productivity . <p> If you do n't  challenge yourself to tackle the problem at its source , you might as well pencil in beating procrastination as your annual challenge for 2013 , 2014 , and every subsequent year for the rest of your life . <p> So what is the source of procrastination ? Ultimately , its the failure to foresee your own weaknesses . Its not a lack of application , or desire , or ambition . Procrastination is simply what happens when you plan a future without addressing the fragility of the decision-making by your future self . <p> We can all assess procrastination logically in moments like these where were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know its bad . Yes , we know its a hindrance . And yes , were all going to make an extra effort to conquer the problem . Its natural to feel vaccinated against procrastination while you 're reading about it . Unfortunately , there is no vaccination . Just sensible planning . <p> To reduce the procrastination struggle , you need to make contingency plans for your future self ; a much weaker feebler-minded self that has long forgotten your ambitions , and wishes only to cave in to short term satisfaction . Pretending that this alter-ego does n't  exist is the fastest way to guarantee failure . <p> A naive New Years Resolution is to vow not to spend hours checking Facebook every day , using the thought of all the extra work you 'd get done as an incentive . <p> A realistic New Years Resolution is to vow not to spend hours checking Facebook every day , and then LeechBlock the motherfucker so that its physically inaccessible between 9am and 8pm . <p> The difference between these resolutions is that one is driven by an idealistic hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser than such hope , is a contingency plan for your weaker future self . Procrastination is just a term we give to the many temptations that control our short term decisions . Temptation is here to stay , and so is our habit of caving in to it like victims of a venus flytrap unless we learn to tackle the temptation in advance . <p> Procrastination is not like smoking . Its not a dirty habit that we can overcome with the right incentive . One day , even the most ardent nicotine fiend may find that cigarettes just do n't  hold the same appeal . Such success stories prove that beating an addiction is painful but possible . Beating procrastination is not . It would require evolutionary re-programming that probably wont be possible in our lifetimes . We are hardwired to cave in to short term temptation much more willingly than we will hold out for long term satisfaction . And that 's why you find yourself balls deep on Facebook when you should be hard at work . <p> If we cant eliminate procrastination , what can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucked us in the past . We cant remove temptation , but we can control behaviour by putting our future selves on a metaphorical leash . <p> Here are some examples of steps an affiliate marketer can take to become more productive : <p> 1 . Pick a new traffic source , any new traffic source , and deposit $1000 immediately . The simple act of committing money to a project will do more for your scaling than any amount of scribbling in a notepad . <p> 2 . Use LeechBlock to physically remove access to time wasting sites . Do n't  just hope that you wo n't waste your time . Physically stop your future self ! There will be moments in the day where your attention is slipping and that future self sees no harm in a quick 5 minute session on Facebook . Make it impossible . <p> 3 . Find a business partner with a superior motive . Once upon a time , I built websites thinking the carrot of money in the future would inspire me to see them through to completion . I soon realised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . Naturally , your future self has a bias towards ideas born in the present . If you want to really nail a big project , take on a business partner who is even more motivated than yourself . ( Hint : Somebody who gives a damn about the niche . ) Use their energy and passion to maintain your spark for projects when the honeymoon period ( aka. the domain registration and WordPress installation ) wears off . Let them know that part of their job is to kick your arse in to action . <p> 4 . Form your own mastermind group and set a daily recap . Sharing knowledge with other affiliates is one of the fastest ways to progress . I recommend kickstarting 2012 by forming a small mastermind group with 2 or 3 other marketers in the same position . Make sure there 's a group discussion at the end of each day . Use it to share your progress . Nobody wants to be the worst performer in the group , so use that competitive pride as inspiration to get a bloody move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be launched . If you run a blog , or any kind of community , and still havent ticked off that 2012 must-do of releasing your own product , why not create a sense of urgency ? Announce it in advance , tell everybody the launch date , and let your followers hold you accountable . Even better , promise 50% off if you fail to deliver it on time . <p> I hope everybody is optimistic and determined to make 2012 their best year yet , no matter how depressing my contrarian approach may seem . Never be afraid of making a fresh start and setting tough targets . Just do n't  be so foolish as to make the same mistakes again . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Make sure you grab a copy of Premium Posts Volume 3 .

I only really care about affiliate ads . I could not not give a rats left bollock what Betfair , William Hill or Sky are promoting . Ads promoted by companies that do n't  follow my direct response principles are redundant . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They encourage lazy affiliate marketing . Its so easy to take a peek at what other affiliate marketers are doing and attempt to steal the profit from under their door mats . But as most of us who have ever tried it can testify , it rarely ever works . Copying campaigns word-for-word , image-for-image , targeting-for-targeting is just not good cricket . <p> That said , if you were ever looking for a tool that would make campaign replication an absolute breeze , Lots of Ads would be your man . <p> It has a couple of newly released features that give it a huge advantage for sifting through the crap , removing the brand ads , and sneakily delving in to the day-to-day operations of other affiliates . <p> The first feature is the Redirect URL search . <p> If you want to search Facebook for every single ad that includes a redirect to your favourite networks tracking link , you can . If you want to search Facebook for every single ad that references your favourite dating offer , you can . If you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can . <p> Lots of Ads allows you to search by demographic ( gender , marital status , age ) for ads in any of the following countries : <p> For all the countries where the ads are written in languages that are total gobbledegook to your native tongue , fear not . There is a built-in translation feature that may or may not massacre the intended message . It depends on how ambitious the ad creator has been with his vocabulary . <p> Tip for creating foreign ads : Keep it simple , for gods sake . Local slang is incredibly powerful , but plucking pretentious wordy adverbs out of your arse and hoping they translate well in to Chinese is not . It will be a bloodbath . <h> Modelling and Reverse Engineering Campaigns <p> As much as I admire the affiliate-friendly features that have been caressed and noodled ( Hello , my confused Chinese friends ) in to Lots of Ads , it goes without saying that you can only go so far by browsing the work of others . <p> The advertisers who will benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and particularly the most successful images to model similar but innovative campaigns of their own . Study intensively what is working for others , and isolate the determining factors . <p> A lot of the time , from my experience , you will find that the intangible success variable is a willingness to cloak . I found many examples of ads that have clearly been manipulated post-approval to make money from the platform . Lots of it , I 'd imagine . <p> That 's fair enough , but I do n't  like to cloak . <p> By looking deeper and burrowing further through the rabbit hole of data at my disposal , I 've managed to find several awesome images as well as headlines that I would never have thought of in a million years . Probably because they 're written in Spanish . <p> What price does a great marketer pay for a few great images and a winning headline ? They are priceless if you use them correctly . But the paradox of this software is that you will need to have your marketing brain tuned in to get maximum value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If striking it lucky was as simple as signing up and automating the process , I would never dare to post this review . It would n't be worth it . <p> Look at what other marketers are doing well and compare it to what you know you can do better . Somewhere in the middle , profitability collides . <h> My Thoughts <p> The software is relatively expensive , priced at $399/month for the All Countries package . I can only recommend the investment if you have a budget to play with and a decent track record of getting profitable on the platform . That may sound counter productive . Surely its the newbies without a prior taste of success that would benefit most ? <p> Well , probably not . <p> I always recommend that spending money on data is better than spending money on tools when you 're just getting started . <p> If you have $399 burning a hole in your pocket and want to explore affiliate marketing , I recommend plugging in your imagination over any tool that is currently on the market . Invest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you fail to break even . <p> However , for Facebook advertisers who work on the platform daily and seek a comprehensive competitor analysis solution Lots of Ads ticks all the right boxes . You can use this bad boy to model the success ( and many mistakes ) of your peers . <p> The multitude of countries and demographics , as well as the option to sniff out tracking links by Redirect URLs , make this a very powerful and timely tool for the affiliate marketer who wants to know everything about his competition . <p> Landing pages , ad copies , images , networks , warts and all .

The sense of confusion is growing , and incredibly mixed results are being reported . <p> I 've had affiliates telling me their sites have surged to the top of Google for ultra competitive terms . Others seem to be drowning their sorrows at the prospect of a long-term stay in the dreaded Sandbox . <p> Google wants to place the responsibility in the users hands to determine whether a website deserves to rank well . <p> Google has always publicly encouraged engaging content , but the algorithm has struggled to match the stated objectives . Panda seems to be changing the game , or at the very least , taking a sincere hack at it . <p> Naturally this is going to rip a new one for many affiliates , especially those who use SEO as their primary means of driving traffic . <p> SEOMoz has an excellent article explaining the likely repercussions of Panda . The overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to game the system is to actually play along with the system . <p> If ranking well becomes a question of designing engaging websites where the user is left with a positive feeling , a sense that he has n't  been shafted by Johnny Rogue Affiliate on a commission crusade , then surely the SEO professionals of the future will be forced to prioritise their work around the shit that truly matters satisfaction in the eye of the end user , rather than an algorithm and its thousand loopholes . <p> I have long seen SEO as an inefficient middleman between excellent content and the interested readers who would want to find it . My own sites have generally responded well to the Panda updates , which is encouraging given that I spend about 2.4% of my working day giving a damn about SEO . <p> If the most important factors for high rankings finally shift towards user-engagement measurements , then is n't it time SEOs changed their job titles ? Wouldnt it be ironic if after optimising for local SEO terms , they had to rebuild from scratch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engagement Optimisersget the domains ordered , guys ! <p> Likewise , if Google wants to reward brand-driven websites where little thought is given to keyword phrase density and second tier backlinks , then I 'd happily invite the Panda in to my home for tea and biscuits . Fuck it , I 'd even scrub up nice for the occasion . <p> I am as clueless on the next move as everybody else , but I would guess that Google will be using engagement metrics such as bounce rate , time on site , return visits and a whole host of social sharing monitors to weigh up relevance . It would n't surprise me in the future if Google took one look at your Analytics , smelt the bullshit , and did n't  even bother to count the backlinks . <p> Ultimately , nobody can say for sure what the true scale of the Panda changes are . Its too early to measure the ranking fluctuations with any conviction . But what matters is the intention .

That role is losing its relevance , while the other skills are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be more effective to outsource 10 shitty articles with the right keyword density than it would be to hire a skilled writer to create 1 article worth reading . <p> Panda is basically SEOMOZ / Google propaganda . Google will always be a link based algorithm , the links from one source may be devalued but there are always new link building methods which for most keywords is the lions share of what SEO is . <p> Enjoy your posts Finch , both here and at blogs another one that hit some nails on the head today . <p> The concept of a SEO professional as we know it stands out for me this has morphed over just a few years SEO changed from optimizing quality content and getting a few trusted links into a mass numbers game of largely spammy backlinks . I welcome Googles updates and focus on brands and quality content , and hope that they continue along this line ( and with human reviewers ) . <p> IMO Real SEO pros like Aaron Wall and Rand Fishkin et al are not out of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of business are the outsourced setups who do the Mechanical-Turk jobs and *call* themselves SEO professionals I 'm not blaming these people , their SEO arms-race was a rational business decision based on demand from the West wonder if they can still compete in a web based on value , trust and quality ? <p> Thanks for articulating it well . We have been educating our clients on these coming changes for awhile . SEO techniques are old school and SEO specialist better start adding more value than op-page optimization and link building . These traditional techniques are a thing of the past . Our advice , build a good SEO foundation and BE SOCIAL . Gregg WSI Quality Solutions <p> Unless Google can crack the social space , or somehow get its paws on major social data , then their search engine will be as fucked as Altavista . And SEO should be renamed SSEO for Social Search Engine Optimization . Why would you search for anything on Google and get a billion well-SEOd sites , when you could do it on Facebook and get what your friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> It does n't  make SEO extinct , it makes it even more important . I think your understanding of SEO is jaded : the term search engine optimization is just thatoptimizing for search engines . This by definition encompasses all aspects of that process . Copywriting , now a solid social media strategy , along side linkbuilding , and on-page too . <p> What Panda did is make a single strategy obsolete ( content farming ) . Nothing more , nothing less . <p> I 'm not arguing what Panda did , because nobody has the full evidence yet . But the intention from Google is clear . Its obvious what type of content they 're looking to reward , and sooner or later , theyll roll out an update that takes a significant step towards it . <p> When that update arrives , it will be much more important to hire excellent copywriters and web designers , than SEO consultants to oversee a transparent process . After all , most SEO consultants make their bread as long as the current algorithms for ranking well are so convoluted that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know what Panda did and who was impacted , the traffic charts from the 20 most affected brands can attest to that . A couple of my content farm style sites were also negatively impacted in a major way . <p> If Google goes where I think its going , which is making it more difficult for small guys to compete with major brands , then yes it will be more important . <p> SEO will never go away but it could transform into more than it is now which is 90% content + links . When that happens its adapt or die for SEO consultanting . <p> Well Ive been banging on about it for years to anyone who will listen ( not that many people actually ! ) . Google ( etc ) have never made a secret of their goal to rank the best most relevant sites for users at the top of the results . <p> Sure , the algorithms have n't always done that , and they probably still do n't  , but in time theyll suss it out . If you are playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ( and Google ) can be proud of . <p> I also believe that " SEO " is n't something you need to actively do . My community blog gets around 100k hits a month and I certainly do n't  " work " at SEO . Of course I try to set my pages up properly , but using headers and titles etc is as much to do with conforming to web standards as SEO . I let my users build links for me naturally . The 1000s of links theyve made far out weight the 10s of links I could have artificially built . <p> Just build a good site , that 's all you need to do . Its as simple and as hard as that ! <p> LOL @ good copywriting helping you rank better . Just as many people will be turned off by the longform sales bullshit as will stick around to read it , negating any positive user interaction metrics , IMO . <p> I welcome the alleged changes personally . Raises the barrier of entry for morons , of which the SEO " profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viagra " and " viagra " SERPs before you tell me the game has really changed . <p> @grind What makes you assume good copywriting can only take the form of a long sales pitch ? <p> The Internet is plagued with bad writing . Publishing content in a charismatic user-friendly tone inspires other people to link to it . So yes , good copywriting is absolutely fundamental to the vision of website that Google is publicly looking to reward . I do n't  see how you can question that . <p> As for the game changing , no single update is ever going to remove every last bad apple from the basket . Panda means very little in real terms . But what IS a game changer , is the fact that Google is actively looking to stamp out what it , and its users , deem to be poor content . That is n't going to happen overnight . But if Google puts the wheels in to motion , its sensible to assume that theyll get there eventually . <p> @Jason I agree , particularly with your point about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this is the heart of the matter for me . SEO will exist as a practice , but the methods behind it will no longer play in to the hands of todays modern SEO professional . <p> I 'm still not sure how most SEO professionals work and always kind of believed ( or maybe it was hoped ) that the majority of real SEO guys werent charging clients to Xrumer spam for the equivalent of a $1 per crappy link . The real guys that legitimately utilize syndication networks and article marketing and blog commenting should n't be affected at all . <p> One of the more interesting things about SEO updates and Google that I 'm surprised is never really brought up in these times is that Google really CANT do major changes to the search algorithm . At least not all at once . While their users are in the forefront of their mind , their business plan also hinges substantially on satisfying publishers , of which I 'm sure some 90% would be pissed off if their website lost search traffic . There 's no question Google could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishing content , because they probably pull in a substantial amount from the big name corporations alone , but it would cut their profit margin by a great deal I suspect . If they made a monumental step towards eradicating current search practices theyd alienate a large majority of publishers , and without publishers , there 's no content , which in turn means there 's no place to put advertisements , so there 's no advertisers , and thus no money from a lot of niches ( or very particular sub niches ) . <p> I know , slippery slope argument , but its less specious than it seems considering most people would probably stop SEO altogether instead of adhering to more stringent guidelines . <p> ( Un ) fortunately , search is only partially dependent on users . Content has to actually exist to be interacted with , after all . But I digress , point being SEO is n't headed towards extinction any time soon . Maybe in 20 years when Google buys Facebook and Twitter ( or vice-versa ) and whatever you publish on your wall or tweet is literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hot you are ( all guys and fat chicks are permanently unranked ) things will be way different . But even then youd just be trading one form of spam for another . <p> Automatically determining whether a website is of " high quality " with the levels of AI we 've had for the past decade ( and will have long into the future ) is impossible . Maybe links wo n't always be the voting medium , but if anything this " game changer " is just what happened to meta keywords 4-5 years ago- you used to be able to plug in the meta keyword " hairy midget thongs " 500 times and rank overnight ( okay , so maybe you can still easily rank for that keyword considering the topic , but you get my point ) , now those are important but not enough to get you a high rank on their own . <p> But I do think Googles going to learn to be even more mysterious with their ranking algo so itll take longer for SEOers to learn how to game the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after " Panda " . Powerful , high authority sites will continue to rank well because Google can not make drastic algo changes without fundamentally affecting the quality of their rankings . <p> The bottom line is that as long as there are search engines , there will be search engine optimization . The rules might change , but the process will always remain . <p> @ Finch , good call regarding my assumption that copywriting = long form sales copy . I get it , you 're publishing useful information in an engaging manner and your readers respond well to it , thereby pushing your analytics metrics through the roof and panda proofing your site . <p> I think basically its gone full circle back to " build good sites that people can derive value from " and youll rank wellas long as your off site SEO factors measure up . The google algo has never handled links well , still does n't  post panda , its just harder to find the cracks to exploit . And the holes get patched quicker now as well . <p> Unless Google suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can keep up with billions of websites . Its literally impossible , Google will always be a step behind . <p> That 's why they have to rule with confusion and mind tricks ; because in all honesty , there 's no algorithm that can stop SEOers , and this is coming from a guy who does both SeO and PPC ; so if SEO fails i still have paid traffic <p> So it means the new google update that backlinks strategy is not effective anymore ? , recently i rank numerous site in backlinking. but now i noticed its been a week that i optimize my site but there is no result . can anyone give me idea about this ? thanks . <p> me to move my efforts from SEO to paid traffic campaigns was the time that it took to see results . SEO is a messy business , full of relative variables , and a lot of donkey work .

@@106277819 @1677819/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Advertising on Plentyoffish is some of the easiest money you 'll make in affiliate marketing . I 've used the platform for over 2 years with varying degrees of success . Some days it seems so easy , other days I could n't grasp profitability if it slapped me in the face with a briefcase full of Benjamins . <p> As with any traffic source , or any advertising campaign , good things come to those who show patience and especially those who are n't  afraid of losing money in the pursuit of much more . <p> Ive traded tips and techniques with many Plentyoffish advertisers , and one of the recurring questions that pops up is how to combat unpredictable conversion rates . <p> Have you been there before ? One day your ROI is impressive enough to book a spontaneous vacation , and the next you 're struggling to break even . You spend your morning coffee praying the marketing deities have woken up on your side ; afternoon is spent with fingers crossed , legs crossed , and eventually eyes crossed having obtained a miserable headache . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will do someday . It happens to all of us . <p> So how can we get some consistency in our conversion rates ? How can we find the sweet spot where our ROI trajectory does n't  resemble the Big Dipper ? <p> NOTE : Before continuing , I have to ram this piece of advice down your throat : split test your offer across multiple affiliate networks . And even split test the offer . I could n't possibly overstate the importance of doing this it can reverse a negative ROI overnight . The lack of loyalty will not endear you to your affiliate managers , but you 're in this to make money , right ? Do n't  become a network martyr . <p> An easy way to stabilize conversion rates is to tighten up your campaigns message . Many Plentyoffish advertisers have an obsession with abstract marketing . They try gaming user attributes to attract a high clickthrough rate , often at the expense of a solid advertising message . <p> For example , let 's say an advertiser is promoting a typical CPA dating offer . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may read something like " More Single Smokers Needed , Join Site X ! " , with the ad being targeted to single smokers . <p> These ads are rolled out as frequently as rat meat at a McDonalds drive-thru , but they lack a real message . Does Site X really appeal to single smokers ? Is there actually a resemblance of a connection between the ad and the service being promoted ? When there is n't , conversion rates are likely to be erratic . <p> But why is that so ? If the ad was competent enough to convert yesterday , it should work today , right ? <p> The reality is you could advertise a dating service using just about any headline under the sun and it WILL score some conversions . Why ? Because its appearing on a dating website ! There 's no science to poor marketing . It is naturally erratic . The handful of conversions are a by-product , not an endorsement of your advertising work . <p> To achieve stable conversion rates over a sustained period of time , you need a stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than simply monopolizing user attributes . You need to pinpoint what the unique value of your offer is , create a meaningful message , and then rely on the powers of persuasion to convince your audience that the offer is right for them . This is only possible if you engage in real-world marketing , using hooks of genuine value . Attempting to lure smokers to a dating site under the illusion that they are needed to meet the demand for more smokers is a shoddy hook fitting of the erratic conversion rates it will likely produce . <p> Creating consistency and value in your message is one way to troubleshoot a wobbly conversion rate . What other steps can we take ? <p> The high CPM does n't  convert . Low login counts suck . Your new landing page is hideous . Ads that have been showing for 3 days in a row stop converting . If the user does n't  click in the first 3 views , he wont convert . Day 3 was Christmas . <p> The actual reason ? Who the hell knows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you do n't  have a structured approach to your campaign . So instead of fiddling with targeting parameters every 5 minutes , duplicate any campaign you wish to modify and then compare the results to your original campaign ( which should still be running ) . Without controlling your variables , any data you collect is meaningless and thus very expensive . <p> A final tip for stabilizing conversions is to limit the range of users you 're advertising to . <p> Ben has previously revealed on the POF company blog that 28% of the sites inventory has a login count of less than 100 . These users are the fresh eyeballs . Another 30% of the traffic has a login count of over 550 . These are the users who have seen pretty much every trick in the book . Its going to take an innovative campaign to light a firework up their asses , but fear not , it can be done . <p> Between 100-550 logins you have the middle ground . Its difficult to predict the behaviour of these users as the effects of banner blindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick one or the other . Either target the first 100 login counts , or exclude them . Some advertisers take the middle ground and attempt to advertise to all users with a login count of less than , say , 300 . <p> The problem with doing so is that it muddles your message by targeting two slightly different demographics those who are new to Plentyoffish , and those who are n't  . Sometimes you can get away with it , other times you cant . A better tactic , if you 're intent on targeting logins &lt;300 would be to break the users in to two groups . A smart strategy would include two campaigns : <p> Campaign A : Targets login count of 0-100 ( Strictly new users ) Campaign B : Targets login count of 101-300 ( Users who have been around a while ) <p> A more unstable approach is to lump those users together , so let 's have a Campaign C. <p> Campaign C : Targets login count of 0-300 ( A melting pot of new and old users ) <p> The difference in performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidding on the platform . <p> Perhaps a swarm of new advertisers drives up the prices for the best quality traffic , so the volume in Campaign A drops dramatically but the conversions are still stable . Youre left with an excellent conversion rate but not much traffic . Not a particularly alarming problem on its own , right ? <p> Now consider what happens to Campaign B during this surge . The new advertisers may be rushing to grab the best quality traffic ( perhaps yet another blogger recommended low logins FTW ) , but they do n't  seem to care for inventory with a login count over 100 . What then ? Campaign B remains exactly the same . The conversion rate is stable like it always was . Its a decent conversion rate , but not as good as Campaign A. The volume has n't  changed though . <p> But let 's say you were to advertise using the Campaign C approach . You now find that you 're barely breaking even and the conversion rate has dropped alarmingly in the last 24 hours . How are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversion rate on a seemingly terminal decline ? <p> Of course you do n't  notice that behind the scenes , you 're receiving less of the alleged best quality clicks because of the increase in competition on 0-100 logins . Instead , your high CPM is now paying for the next tier of traffic , which does n't  convert as well but is costing you the same money . All you see is an unstable conversion rate , keeping you blind to the source of the problem a problem that is very simple to fix . <p> This is just one of many problems that are notorious on self-serve advertising platforms . Different advertisers may swarm a demographic at any given time , which raises the prices , meaning that without knowing it , you 're suddenly bidding on completely different traffic . The only way to avoid the problem is to make sure that you 're bidding on just one demographic at a time , and that you 're setting the bid accordingly . <p> By doing so , your volume may vary dramatically , but the conversion rate should remain stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Self-serve platforms by their very nature have hundreds of scenarios that may affect your ROI . But the bottom line remains the same . There 's big money on Plentyoffish , and its perfectly within your reach but you must use your data as an advantage , rather than a deep pool to drown in. 114273 @qwx974273 <p> A much more detailed assault on monetizing Plentyoffish is covered in Volumes 1 and 3 of Premium Posts , which have both received widespread praise .

Really need to test higher login counts more often .

@@106277822 @1677822/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Its not easy establishing a website when your name counts for nothing . You can have the best content , the swankiest WordPress theme and even the biggest marketing budget . But without gatecrashing your niches network of influential people , its all going to feel like shoving crap up a hill . A constant struggle for little reward . <p> This meandering post is going to give you a few pointers for how to attract influential people to your site . <h> One Follower = One Backlink ? <p> In many ways , I consider people to be the new backlinks . Its very easy to buy a thousand Facebook " Likes " , just as its easy to blast a thousand forum profiles with xrumer . Most people are agreed that where link marketing is concerned , quality beats quantity . And that is also the case with acquiring fans or followers . <p> Look no further than the self-proclaimed social media experts on Twitter to discover just how irrelevant numbers can be . So you 've got 15,000 followers , a shiny custom background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close friends . It does n't  mean shit if you 're a nobody in the eyes of the people that matter . <p> Every niche market has a select group of influential people that exert power over the rest of the marketplace . I would suggest that instead of spending your days preaching to the dumbfounded choir ( Hello , WSOs on Warrior Forum ) , you go after these trend-setters and attempt to get in bed with them . <p> In the same way that one authoritative backlink is much more valuable than a thousand directory submissions , one influential fan holds considerably more power than a small battalion of " Who The Fuck Are You Again ? " Followers . <p> So how can you gatecrash the party of influential trendsetters in your niche ? How can you get behind those closed doors where opportunity awaits ? Much has to do with building a brand , as I spoke about in my last post . But you also need to be relentless in your pursuit of the people that matter . <h> Understanding Who Controls Your Niche <p> Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers likely to be found on the web ? <p> When you know where your audience is hiding , you can begin to draw rings around the people you need to be reaching if you want to crack that network of influence . Let 's say your market is heavily populated by messageboards and forum communities . <p> Stop Whoring Yourself On Messageboards <p> The first step , as recommended in every shitty How To guide under the Digital Point sun , would be to register a profile and start posting in the hope that people click your lame signature link . This sucks . Its not going to do much for your readership . Especially if all you have to your name is seven posts and an introductory thread . <p> A much more effective method is to hang back and look for the forums most popular posters . Find out who has the adoring affections of the community , and approach them with a private message asking how much theyd charge to endorse your site in their signature . Not many posters will turn down the chance to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to compromise the value of your time by posting on messageboards , at least make sure you have something valuable to add to the argument . Playing Devils Advocate is often a good ploy . <p> Breaking The Bloggers Ego <p> What if the most influential people in your niche consist mainly of other bloggers ? It can be very difficult for a blogger to gain status with other bloggers . Especially if his shit is actually good , and deemed threatening by the others . <p> The best way to breach a circle of influential bloggers is to deceive them with flattery . Comment on their posts , retweet their statuses and do your best to engage them in conversation . If you can squeeze in a guest post or two , all the better . The sooner they begin to associate you as a fan of their work , rather than a direct competitor , the easier you 're going to find it to get them engaging in your site . <p> Flattery will get you on the good side of your blogging peers , but to really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has to be better than theirs , period . This is the only way you 'll earn their respect . Bloggers are much more willing to help others who have already stroked their egos . <p> An easy way to get an influential blogger to share your work is to namedrop them in a post , lace it with a sweet compliment , and then make sure they find it close to a retweet button . Or you could hand out your own blogger awards voted by the people , of course giving the target every incentive to repost it on his own blog in a bid for votes . <p> There are many ways to skin the cat , but you cant go too linkbait crazy . Your site has to earn their respect before theyll see you as anything other than a permanent oral fixture on their balls . Which , at this stage , let 's face it , you probably are . <p> If You Ca n't Assert Authority , Be Happy With Mediocrity <p> Once upon a time , I ran a pro wrestling news site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news " journalism , you 'll be aware that about a hundred different journalists rely on the same one source for their news . One single whisper in the wind controls what all the websites are able to publish . <p> Readers would gravitate towards the sites where news broke first . If you could n't get the news before your competition , the best case scenario was hiring an overly keen sixteen year old to copy and paste like a whippet on coke . In this niche , the network of influence was restricted to a bunch of undisclosed sources ( eg. Hulk Hogans makeup girl selling a hearsay backstage rumour for fifty bucks ) and established journalists whod been reporting from the same behind-the-scenes pedestal since the 80s . <p> As soon as I understood this , I moved on . I was n't passionate enough to immerse myself in breaching these sources and getting to the news first . Where would I even start ? The Yellow Pages and a wiretap on Vince McMahons cellphone ? Give me a break , I 'm no real journalist . Without the exclusives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you cant beat them , join them . If you cant join them , why are you wasting your time ? <p> Some projects are just too ambitious for one man in his basement . But I learnt something very important that I try to remember before I embark on any new project . You have to understand what your readers want , and be capable of delivering it . <h> How To Become Mr. Authority <p> Not every person of influence in your industry is going to have a website or blog . You shouldnt be drawn in to thinking that you have to befriend every blogger or every high profile Twitter user . Sometimes , it pays to look further afield than rival sites for gaining authority . <p> I know one successful music blogger who has never given the time of day to linkbuilding or competing with rival sites . She does n't  bother with SEO , commenting on other blogs or leaving crappy forum replies . She simply sends email after email to new and upcoming artists , introducing herself and letting them know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gets sent a ton of free shit . Passes to a bunch of shows , free festival tickets , signed albumsjust about anything she wants . But most importantly , its allowed her to establish a reputation as a trend-setter on the music blogging scene . <p> How ? <p> By understanding where she can add the most value to her blog . The value is in the relationships . <p> When was the last time you took the effort to introduce yourself to the companies you spend so long writing about ? The best bloggers are n't  merely respected by their readers and rival webmasters , but by the very companies they 're writing about too . <p> The easiest way for you to gain influence is n't to jostle for supremacy with the guy ranking above you on Google , but to instead chase down the owner of the product you 're trying to rank for . It never ceases to amaze me how much easier it is to build influence in a market , when you have an ear pinned to the ground of the companies that matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top five companies , then contacting their PR departments , introducing yourself and stating what you can offer with your website . Nothing has to materialize straight away . But good things come to those who put themselves in the right places . <p> And I can guarantee , most bloggers are too busy worrying about yesterdays stats to be actively engaging with the companies they write about . The only relationships they bother chasing come hand in hand with affiliate commission , which is perfectly fine , but selling yourself very short if you want to be a true authority in your niche . <p> There is n't a business in the world that does n't  like a slice of friendly publicity . Get the exclusives that your rivals were too busy waiting to read about in their Google Alerts , and you will quickly discover its actually quite easy to gain influence . <p> Most of us who own websites or blogs are simply middlemen , wrestling with other middlemen for backlinks , search engine rankings and god knows what else . The quicker you turn your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write about , the sooner you 'll be able to forget about the other middlemen formerly known as your competition . <p> If you 're feeling generous , you can also do me a favour by simply retweeting this post or recommending it on whatever hellhole of a social networking joint you use . Every little help is appreciated ! 114272 @qwx974272 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> While I agree ass-kissing is a vital tool in getting your foot in the door with peer bloggers , who the fuck wants to kiss ass all day ? <p> A good way to minimize your time spent ass-kissing , while still gaining ground with your peer bloggers , is by capitalizing on the bandwagon effect . Figure out who your peer bloggers are , but put your ass-kissing efforts into only the top 2 or 3 more influential . <p> After you 've gotten your foot in the door with those 2 or 3 bloggers , go for a guest post or ask if you can interview them ( everyone likes talking about themselves ) sans a link back to your blog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of your peer bloggers and angle the fuck out of your relationship with those 2 or 3 influential bloggers . Be like , " These guys like me enough to have me guest blog/interview them . They 're the shit . Youd be the shit to if you let me guest blog/interview you ! " <p> Theyll see your guest blogs and interviews on those blogs maintained by those influential bloggers , and because people tend to emulate those they look up to , your ability to secure guest blogs , interviews , circle jerks , or what the fuck have you , increases ten-fold. 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

@@106277824 @1677824/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Article marketing is for my reckoning , the most boring chore on the planet . Every time my to-do list springs up an item that requires me to visit Ezine , I shed tears of sorrow , snap a kitten in half , and beg for it all to go away . <p> Just who was the smart arse to decide that such monotonous crap should ever be rewarded by Google ? <p> The benefits , or pointlessness , of article marketing can be argued over all day long . I do n't  like to ruffle feathers when it comes to SEO . Everybody has a different opinion over what works , what does n't  , and what classifies as a gigantic waste of time . If I had my way , I would confine the entire art of SEO to the latter . <p> Its pointless shit , is n't it ? <p> Its like trying to beat your competitor by jumping on the fastest escalator to the top of the pile of riches . Only , you do n't  control the escalator . Google can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Google has a bad day , he can choose to remove the escalator from under your feet . <p> Nobody can deny that great money is there for the taking by ranking first for your key phrase here . But in my opinion , getting search traffic is the just tip of the iceberg . The real challenge is n't to produce optimized content , but to produce memorable content . <p> And for that reason , I 've always believed sites like Ezine to be about as valuable to the end user as a third nipple on my face . So imagine the explosion in my pants then when I read just recently that the so-called Google Farmer update could bring an end to this madness . <p> The death of article marketing , you reckon ? I 'd say its no more than a shifting of the goalposts at this point . If there 's one thing SEO professionals can be praised for , its their ability to try a lot of pointless crap with no true relevance to the people that actually matter . A string of wild experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial ripple and crowbars their website a place or three up the rankings . <p> But no matter how influential you gauge these latest Google updates to be , the warning signs are there . <p> Its time to stop being such a lobotomized prat in how you market your websites . Blasting hundreds of shitty 400 word articles may be effective now , and even tomorrow , but as long as Google is *trying* to castrate you at the source , you 're always going to be struggling to keep up with the pace . <p> I think its about time people woke up from their Digital Point induced comas and realised the importance of providing genuine content that offers real value to the world . No matter how many search engine changes lay ahead , you can always rest assured that there WILL be a way of marketing genuine content . But only if you actually have it . <p> So how can you take a step towards that ? A little method Ive been playing around with involves simply re-distributing my budget . <p> Instead of outsourcing 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can outsource just one high quality article and get it used as a guest post on other high profile sites in my niches . <p> While its early days and requires a lot more creative thinking , not to mention a guest post friendly niche you 're not going to find a blog about the cheapest office chairs the first signs are definitely promising . <p> I find this a much more rewarding method of generating traffic to my sites . But also importantly , it gets subscribers and the highly sought after " return visits " . Search traffic is great for generating leads and sales , but you 'll rarely see those users again unless its to complain about the bullshit you just sold them in your fake review . <p> Guest posting is often seen as an even greater chore than article marketing . At least with article marketing you 're guaranteed a backlink if you put your commas in the right places . <p> Most SEOs prefer to spend their time completing utterly brainless tasks with the surgical precision that warrants their job titles . Whereas high quality content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nigeria and most importantly , the development of a rapport with the end user . <p> But in the long run , is n't that exactly the content Google is striving to reward ? <p> It does n't  really matter . Screw Google . Its possible to run high traffic websites without a shred or sniff of a first page on the Big G. You just need to be able to market your message in the right places to the right audience . The idea of abandoning search traffic altogether is , I would imagine , too much of a leap for most . So try looking at things in a different way . <p> Someday , Google will succeed in getting its algorithm up to speed with its vision . I know a lot of SEOs will argue how they 're smart enough to keep finding loopholes and keep gaming the system . But when that day comes , the smartest and most cost efficient way of gaming the system will be to actually oblige the god damn system . <p> Produce the great content , regardless of any search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on your side . Not against it . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 9 Comments <p> Thing is , GOOG makes a shit-ton of monies off of low-quality content sites . Maybe some algorithm updates will drop Ezine a few positions . But as long as farms keeping generating Adsense clicks , they ai n't  going nowhere . <p> That 's true but a lot of people said the same thing about affiliate ads on Facebook . <p> I think Google makes more than enough money across the board to be able to make that call if it needs to . Either from the threat of unlikely competition delivering a " better search experience " , or in simply wanting to stay ahead of the pack . <p> I think the reason the farms continue to rank is more to do with the ability of their webmasters to seize loopholes , than it is to do with Google leaving an open door so to speak . <p> Google had to act . Quality of search results are their core business . They face ever increasing competition from social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue might decline as a result of reduced traffic to content farms , but if they do n't  people will stop using google search . <p> It was just getting to easy to game google and get top rankings . Its like the good old adsense days . Google had to act at that time and they did . <p> They will this time around if they are serious about not turning into altavista in 4 years time ! <p> And I agree 200% with the basic point of this post quality content is where its at . I have only got a small blog , and probably do n't  get a 10th of the traffic that you do but <p> the 3 guest posts I have done in the last year in themselves still drive more and better quality traffic than google . The spiders will follow soon = <p> Google is eventually going to marry the social streams and personalized search to the current way to rank in organic search in the future . When that happens , search will be changed and it will be a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search engine which uses social graphs is a lot harder than hurling anchor link text en masse at a page ) . <p> That 's my view on it at least . It may not happen next week or next year , but it is leaning in that direction already . <p> Hi Finch , I found myself nodding and occasionally grinning as I read that . I think its fair to say " in the long run " article marketing will need to evolve to keep up with Google et . al . While there is still any value to it , people will rightly or wrongly continue to use it to market their sites . As for the sites themselves , this is a rude awakening which we can only hope will prompt them to improve the quality of their offerings RTd . <p> Awesome post , I agree with how pointless almost all SEO work feels , even though it is effective . If you do n't  provide real value it is like pushing shit uphill , return visitors and direct traffic is were the real gold is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all SEO work feels , even though it is effective . If you do n't provide real value it is like pushing shit uphill , return visitors and direct traffic is were the real gold is <p> Personally speaking I hope off page SEO does die I live in hope that the only thing that drives the internet is high quality content on quality sites and social interaction links should take a lower value I can write great stuff , but link building is contrived and pointless unless it happens naturally until then on and on we go with EzineArticles , blog posts , bookmarks etc etc and death by article boredom . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277825 @1677825/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> There 's something very Christmassy about the first few days in November , do n't  you think ? <p> Its that time of the year when Tesco wheels out the chocolate selection boxes , and Boots starts charging -3 extra to cram the most disappointing products in to the most appealing shaped packaging . You know , the kind that looks appropriate under a Christmas tree ? <p> We both realise you could have saved money buying your victims Lynx and shower gel from the Pound Shop . But no , in the spirit of Christmas , you chose to fuck yourself in the wallet by spending more for the same shit in a gift box . <p> Maybe its because there is n't a productive human being on the planet who enjoys wrapping awkwardly shaped presents . <p> Its obvious that squares and rectangles are the way forward , guys . Anything too circular , or too pointy , and I end up celotaping myself to the mantlepiece , or punching holes in the wrapping like some kind of angry bull . <p> Selection boxes are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any shadow of a doubt , the perfect present for that distant fourth cousin you only see once a year . The selection box says " Hey , I did n't  have to buy you this shit . I could have picked up four Curly Wurlies for the price of two on Tesco Special Offer and given them to you in a tramps paper bag . But no , I bought you a present . Do you know how you can tell that its a present ? Because its in a fucking box . Take it . " <p> When I cool down to assess the situation logically , I ca n't help but tip my hat to the effectiveness of it all . Selection boxes and gift sets are the perfect way to boost sales during a time where consumers are extremely conscious of their purchases . <p> In that moment of shopfloor gift hunting madness , I would never dream of picking out a can of deodorant and then some shower gel from a different aisle , with the intention of wrapping them together and passing it off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lynx is actually bordering on the offensive . <p> But package them together in a festive boxset and its as if by magic , Boots has made the can and bottle infinitely more appealing . How does that work ? When you strip away the cardboard , what you have left is a tour de force in product re-positioning . <p> Desperation breeds opportunity for scumbags like us <p> I know lots of people start their festive shopping early ( I believe they 're called females ) , but I am personally the kind of guy who can be found sweating his tits off at 8.59am on Christmas Eve , desperately mapping his way around the town center and preparing to pillage whatevers left for goods that can be passed off as gifts . <p> Its a habit of mine that plays in to the hands of retailers and their tendency to box the living crap out of everything . The high pressure environment there 's no escaping the hoards of other husbands , fathers and boyfriends suffering last minute meltdown makes us highly suggestible to marketing that appears to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how and why consumers will pay more and will hand over their money faster when you solve a legitimate problem for them . <p> Desperation is an interesting force for marketers to exploit . But what really should be taken from the gift packaging craze is that , sometimes , its not the product you 're selling , but the solution you 're offering that counts . <p> If you 're wondering how to boost sales and leads in the run up to December 25th , here 's a simple tip . Take whatever you 're selling , charge a little extra , and offer a re-packaged version that is suitable to be given away as a gift . Whack it on your homepage , drop shadow it with tinsel and scream to anybody who will listen " The Perfect Festive Gift , now comes in a square box " <p> You 'll often find that your price is totally irrelevant at this point . You could charge a thousand bullions of gold and some red-faced panting husband will still take you up on the offer . Such is the power that Christmas exerts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own concerns and start shopping earlier in 2011 ? Of course I fucking wo n't . <p> I make the same mistake every year . <p> In the same way that I 'll regret paying -69.95 plus -10 delivery for a sheet of plastic that works as a Halloween outfit , you will find me scouring Westfields on December 24th wishing I 'd listened to these words . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> For those of you who advertise on Facebook , Premium Posts Volume 2 is the perfect Christmas gift to give yourself .

It seems as if some networks are quick to pronounce me dead if I stop running traffic for more than 24 hours . <p> Unfortunately I 'm not dead . But I am severely tanned with sun kissed balls , and ready to get back to the grind again . Glastonbury Festival , for those of you who have n't been , is the sugardaddy of all musical events . You need to go . I still feel pretty partied out but I 'm going to do my best to address something I 've noticed that affiliates seem to get wrong . All the time . <p> If you 're a full time affiliate working from home , what 's the one thing you have that a part-timer does n't  ? Its time . Complete control of your hours , and the ability to be as productive or as unproductive as the day is long . Nobody chomps your balls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs . Holland tickles your fancy , the to-do list can always wait a couple of hours , right ? <p> How many marketers actually take the time to nurture a talent or to learn something new ? It sounds pretty irrelevant . Youve got all that split testing to do , those new offers to rig up to fresh campaigns . Christ , I 've got a thousand tweets in my face telling me that snoozing is losing . <p> An affiliate marketer is more often than not a middleman . You can be a complete retard and still make good money if an advertiser has a good product and an audience has a strong need . But it does n't  give you any kind of asset . You have no market value . That 's unless you develop websites that stand on their own two feet . <p> We basically seize the loopholes of traffic brokerage and exist in a state of limbo where our main talent is to capitalize on opportunity . That 's rosy and sweet , but its pretty fucking moronic to not have a Plan B. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talent , you 're wasting the one freedom you always dreamed of when you jacked in your day job . <p> Real businesses exist to be the best at something . They provide real solutions . All the truly great businessmen of our time have a talent that puts them above their peers . The problem with affiliate marketing is that you do n't  have to be the best at anything . You can be merely competent and still pay the bills . <p> But that should n't be your attitude . In the worst case scenario that affiliate marketing gets nuked in the morning , we should all have been busy developing our assets to a point where we can say that were the best at somethinganything . Being an expert at affiliate marketing is n't enough . How many real life human beings give a shit if you 're the smartest handler of EPCs ? It adds no value for anybody . <p> If , however , you decide today that you 're going to focus on improving your copywriting , for example , that 's an investment worth so much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an expert who writes the best damn copy in the business , you 're going to be in demand . <p> We have so many hours on our hands and if were not striving to improve , we might as well go back to the 9-5 . <p> For me personally , my main passion is writing . You might accuse me of being just another marketing blogger with his dick up his own arse and willing to push any second tier referral he can throw your way . But actually , this site is like my CV . I could devote all my hours to painstaking research of new offers , but it does n't  add any long-term value to my business . Whereas this blog will remain here long after my bizopp campaign of the week has faded . <p> More affiliates are soon going to appreciate the need to develop websites that provide genuine quality content . Because there are enough passionate people out there to drive you out of business . Soon we will need to put the quality of our content first and THEN worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for proof ? Just look at the search engines . Google is backhanding websites it deems to be " bridge pages " from the sponsored listings . I can only imagine that if this is their outlook , it will soon translate more heavily in to the organic listings too . If you do n't  offer your own unique commodity , you 're dispensable . <p> This blog is an example of how I like to monetize . I 've never offered sponsored content and Ive never accepted payments to endorse networks or products in my posts . The main appeal is the writing style and the trust that I 've managed to forge with readers . Its a site that I 'm happy to put next to my business name because I trust in what Ive published here . <p> Too many affiliate websites are built on flimsy foundations . With $10/articles outsourced to so-called experts who know jack shit about the subject matter despite what they state in their Elance proposals . <p> The next time you focus on a micro-niche , do n't  make your first question " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy the needs of the target audience . Be an expert in your field . How can you produce something outstanding that shows more than your ability to rank in Google ? <p> Quality content will always stand the test of time . And so will your business if you drive it forward and become the best in a particular field . <p> Its not easy , but you know what is easy ? Its easy to set aside one hour in your working day and learn something new . Ask yourself what you can be the best at , then go out and be it . <h> Need a larger slice of Finch ? <p> I have n't been posting much recently , that 's pretty obvious .

If so , it tells you where to find them , and what payouts you can expect . This is a really handy feature . All those times you 've stumbled across a cool service and thought , " Holy shit , this product looks half decent . If I was n't such a CPA scumbag , I 'd promote it !

If you want to do it right , you have to test all 2n combinations ( or however many variations you have ) . Problem is , its usually pretty expensive to do that . <p> Good point . I agree , youd want to test every combination in a unique campaign if you had the time/money . But in practical terms , very few affiliates actually wait for statistical significance before dropping an ad/LP/offer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited data , I 've always had more success isolating the most important variables ( offer and appeal ) and testing these before moving on to the rest . I do n't  think it makes sense to split your budget every which way before you 've nailed the variables that will define whether you 're in the red or black . When I see affiliates testing 5 , 6 , 7 different variables on $200 ad spend , I think that leads to much more guesswork than a systematic approach that focuses on finding 1 ) the best offer and 2 ) the best appeal . I would n't want an awful banner to mess with my chances of isolating those factors , which its much more likely to do on lower spend from my experience . <p> I prefer testing the angle and ad text first . The reason for this is because the angle is what determines if profit is even possible . After that , I then test the ads to see what gets the highest CTR so that from there on out , I am getting much more traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start out getting the most clicks possible , I can then test the other variables more quickly . Waiting until the end to test the ads means you 're going to spend twice as much testing every variable that 's in line before it . <p> Yeah I should point out that while I test the ads last , that 's in reference to things like colours/wording/imagery . The ad text goes towards the angle , which is obviously very important . Your familiarity with the market is a factor too . If I 'm moving in to a volatile foreign market , I want to know that there 's an offer I can make money with first , which is why I test it before working my way through a bunch of angles . <p> Generally speaking , if you can find the hottest offer + the hottest angle , you 're going to make money . <p> Time and Money consuming .

( Which makes it all the more baffling why so many choose to be bags of dicks . ) <p> Knowing your own characteristics will do much for increasing your chances of happiness along the way . <p> My tips for extroverts : <p> Bear in mind , I 'm not one . I could be very wrong . Please offer your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space with like-minded professionals . There are plenty of these springing up in major cities . At the very least , get a laptop and hit the road . <p> Use your social wings and network , network , network . Many affiliates struggle at this , so cash in the advantage and use it to get ahead of us . <p> Leverage the many online communities at your disposal , become a connector and embed yourself in the industry . <p> Work shorter hours and join local clubs ( sports or otherwise ) with scheduled meets every week . <p> My tips for introverts : <p> Make sure your friends , family et all respect the boundaries of your work space and work hours . Lest you go insane . <p> Build a small circle of masterminds and use it as your eyes and ears . Focus on the quality of your contacts instead of quantity . A Skype group is a good start . <p> Work out exactly what form of social interaction wears you out the least , then arrange a lot of it . For me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fight , fight , fight the urge to get lazy , which is so much more of a danger to introverts . <p> Get a dog . Like me , you probably believe they 're better than humans . <p> Separate your work space from your living space . If you spend a lot of time at home , you need to disconnect part of the house from your work activities . That 's why I 've bought a LazySpa and created a reading room with beanbags . <p> I highly recommend the LazySpa : <p> My tips for those who are n't  sure if they want to work from home : <p> Try it for three weekends in a row .

I can relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working online on my own suited my lifestyle . I travelled on and off for several years and when I was in the UK , it allowed me to train martial arts during the day three or four times a week . <p> I used to hang out with friends a lot during the week too . Working online allowed me to work my hours around my lifestyle , rather than the other way around . <p> Things have been very different over the last few years . I got a neck injury so could n't train as much . Additionally , most of my friends are now settled down with kids . This effectively means that I am best sticking to regular working hours so that I can socialise at nights and at weekends . That makes me wonder sometimes why I do n't  just do a regular job . <p> But the grass is not always greener . I loathe commuting and in every job I have worked in , I have inevitably been frustrated by the way that good workers are not rewarded , whilst people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially true in the contracting game when your rate depends on your initial bargaining skills ) . <p> I still love the freedom of working online too . And I hope to travel some more over the next year o so something I could n't do with a nine to five . <p> I do however feel that I would enjoy returning to work if only for a few months . I am sure that would be enough time for me to remember why I wanted to work for myself = <p> Yep , the ironic part of escaping the 9-5 is that your friends and family are still in it . They tend to stick to their own routines , which means you 're going to be sticking to them too . I know a lot of affiliates mingle with other affiliates ( who share their lifestyle ) , but its pretty rare in the UK . <p> You also lose the external reward system when you work from home . <p> Whos going to congratulate you for work well done ? Your bank manager , maybe . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good work . And sharing in success with colleagues . Those needs are difficult to replicate . <p> I agree . My situation has been made even worse as my girlfriend has been helping me on my projects over the last year or so . It was ideal when we were travelling South America as I still had to take time off and update my websites . But its been a pain since . <p> Partners should not see each other that frequently . There is a reason why people do their own thing during the day . <p> And its never fun having an argument about work and then hoping that everything will be ok when you switch back to boyfriend and girlfriend mode . I created my own hell = <p> On a side note , I recommend adding a comment link to the end of your posts on the home page . I found myself reading the post and then having to scroll back to the top of the post in order to click on a link to leave a comment = <p> On another side note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs . So I 'm using your blog as an example of how to make money by selling premium posts . Enjoy the single link goodness = <p> Absolutely spot on Finch . I am in the extrovert bunch generally speaking , but the caveat is that I have to get the quite time you talk about . I have to isolate myself to a degree so I can focus . ADD is a blessing and a curse in this matter . I have joined groups and I love to mastermind . I hear people say they are afraid someone will steal their ideas if they share them but I share my ideas with those around me to make them better . So that I can improve the ideas . I digress . Bottom line extrovert or introvert surround yourself with people who will challenge you and make you a better person and you will find success ! <p> Nice post . Makes me realize that I probably chose the right industry , being and introverted myself ( the " work in my boxers with only empty packets of Popchips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is , despite having trouble communicating and relating to others , I pushed myself all my life through customer service , and business management . Where had to deal day to day with loads of stressful human interactions . Climbing the corporate ladder where very functional extroverts , backstabbed each other in a highly competitive enviroment ( ok that part of the gig was kinda fun I reckon , heh ) . Is actually pretty odd how close to the sociopath spectrum you got ta be after the interviews and tests to land a corporate job lol . <p> So I 'm actually glad I did , and a bit proud of what I got to achieve besides my many shortcomings , in the " work actually wearing pants " industry . And I probably wont be looking back , cause I like it here , and I say this maybe cause I got out of the 9-5 enviroment , less than a year ago , but you guys have it pretty fucking sweet , heh . Except maybe Kevin since he works with his girlfriend nowlike everyday I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing , havent spent that much time with a girlfriend , and now I kinda hope yours is not reading this lol . <p> I still wonder if the most successful affiliates tend to be introverts , since a lot of super ones , live abroad over periods of time , in countries with a very different language and culture . Which will end up isolating them in a way , but that 's probably what they want , which is part the mystique of being an " international man of marketing " . <p> So I 'm thankful for successful affiliates feeling a bit isolated and having to reach out and express themselves through kickass posts on their blogs , with knowledge newbes like me can actually benefit from . And I 'm also very thankful for foamy water blocking our vision in that pic lol .

As a native Londoner with a short fuse for standing in transit , the chance to quit morning train-surfing was one of my great calls to action in life . <p> Its our motives to make self-employment a success that sometimes lose their shine once the honeymoon period of surrealism wears off . We forget what drove us to pursue the extra responsibility . We forget why we do what we do . And that 's a shame . <p> What would you pay to relive the nostalgia of making your first dollar online , of logging in to Clickbank and seeing a sale that demanded no boss , no commute , and just one moment of individual brilliance ? <p> Our early success is often the most vivid to remember .

I get nostalgic over how captivated I used to be . The amazement that Internet Marketing works has been replaced by serious unease at the thought that it might someday not . <p> If you are new to this industry , and particularly if you have just left a traditional job to pursue success , the honeymoon period is one to savour . <h> Enjoy the First Taste of Self-Sufficiency <p> Any soul brave enough to exchange the rat race for self-employment , uncertainty and a royally shagged economy deserves a honeymoon period . The initial freedom of working from home provides just that . Its the perfect opportunity to take one step back , appreciate how lucky you are , before plunging multiple steps forward and busting a ball or three to make the arrangements work . <p> Nobody wants to suffer the ignomy of returning to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept via Facebook . But its healthy to take a moment of reflection . Especially if , like many , your precursor to self-employment has been moonlighting with two jobs . You will want to celebrate and enjoy that first taste of running your own ship . A few months down the line and such luxury is likely to cause inner turmoil . <p> " I want to take a break but I 've got seven projects , four affiliate managers and an inbox full of hot offers to deal with . Maybe next month . " <p> Inner voice : " Or how about never ? " <p> In the weeks after my jump to full-time affiliate marketing , I carefully balanced my time between rolling around semi-naked in home comforts and bragging about the hour my alarm clock was set for . Ive since learnt that there 's a special look of disgust reserved especially for those who need a wake-up call after 11am . <p> Two dogs and a loud postman has put an end to my 1-Hour Work Mornings . I now rise with my own time zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can probably tell a lot about my first taste of self-sufficiency by this photographic evidence of my office from 2009 : <p> A lot of Changing the World going on here <p> Archaic laptop barely capable of updating weight loss ads without chugging up fumes , rough unkempt looking bastard at the wheel , blanket making do as a curtain , and animals in the workplace ( sitting on wireframes for extra productivity points ) . <p> Its no wonder my very first week as a full-time Affiliate Marketer ended in spectacular confusion with an entire business collapsing around me in piles of Google Suspension notices . But you bet it was exciting . <p> Nothing beats the adrenaline rush of defining your career destination and then galloping after it like a mad man . <p> Once you have started that pursuit , its very difficult to slow down . At various points along the way , you will reflect nostalgically on the start of your journey and how easier it used to be .

If your wife has to push a cold dinner plate under the crack in your office door , its probably a sign that you 've lost touch with your family man aspirations . <p> Did you quit your job to pursue the ultimate financial freedom of earning money while you sleep ? <p> Then why do you never sleep ? Do you expect to hit a magic financial figure that suddenly allows you to unwind and enjoy life ? What is it ? <p> Did you quit your job in awe of that classic quote : " Entrepreneurship is living a few years of your life like most people wo n't , so that you can spend the rest of your life like most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still struggle to find happiness in the top dollar hotel suites that no mortal man would pay for ? Why do all of your friends pay less for their thrills ? <p> I believe many of us are guilty of losing touch with our original motives for why we do what we do . Stacking money in a bank vault , like economic growth , is tied to an illusion of grandeur . Neither can go on forever . Your current balance will mean nothing when you hit the grave . <p> To regain the nostalgia of working from home , we must remind ourselves of what we left behind . And why we left it . For some Internet Marketers , this may even lead to the realisation that your overall happiness was greater when you worked for the man . <p> There 's no shame in admitting that .

If I ever needed a reminder of the life I 'm glad to have escaped , its the feeling of being packed in to a tube carriage at 8.49am by Kings Cross St Pancras . <p> Note : I do n't  recommend brooding in the shadows outside your former workplace if you are an ex school teacher . Two words : criminal record . <p> Another good idea is to disconnect completely from technology for 24 hours . <p> We live in a world where instant notifications are pushed under our noses by multiple sources , on multiple devices at every hour of the day . Its mission impossible for an Internet Marketer to ignore the noise when his profession has a voice in it . <p> By disabling your iPad , silencing the phone , and stepping away from the computer , you can begin to come to terms with what you 're left with . <p> If you find yourself standing lamely , scratching your balls for entertainment , there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new meaning . The nostalgia we associate with our first taste of self-employment has nothing to do with the work .

@@106277833 @1677833/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> When I chose my apartment in Bangkok , I unwittingly engaged in a sales process that has been tried and tested through the annals of time to produce enormous results . <p> Estate agents are masters of the art and will spare no blushes in the execution , even if you 're smart enough to know exactly what 's going on around you . <p> here 's the situation . Its 9am in the morning and the estate agent has arrived at your hotel . She tells you she has a few properties to view , and you eagerly jump in the back of her car to get started . <p> The first property is an absolute dump . Situated in the middle of no mans land , no aircon , no transport connections and for the estate agent , no hope of a conversion . Of course , I play along nicely and express that itd make a great homefor the right Thai family . Did she really think she could get me to a sign a contract for the exact property I was n't looking for ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter me up for what was to follow . <p> I vividly remember cruising from property to property , the specifications marginally improving to match my needs with each visit . By the end of the day , my girlfriend and I were exhausted and ready to retreat to our hotel room to mull over the options . <p> " But wait ! There 's one more place I 'd like you to see I think it might suit what you 're looking for . " <p> Lo and behold , she hits us with the single best matching property of the day so far , and were both convinced that its right for our needs . The perfect size , all the aircon we could guzzle , fantastic sweeping views of Bangkok and a snooker table . A motherfucking snooker table . How did she know I 'd fall in love at first sight with my own snooker table ? <p> Maybe it had something to do with the email I 'd sent a week ago casually stating what I 'd really love in a dream apartment . <p> This leaves you to ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of crappy or " good , but just not quite there " properties ? Or was it a fantastically executed tour-de-force of how to setup and nail a conversion ? <p> No prizes for the right answer . Estate agents deal with people like me every day , and get many more opportunities to study the human behaviour than I do to prepare for the exploitation of it . I would tip my hat to her if I had one . Its simply one of the most effective sales techniques in the book . <p> Use the power of contrast to create indecision and uncertainty based on the information you already have , before unleashing the ultimate solution that goes above and beyond all that came before . As long as your subject is suitably torn up to that point , there really is little he can do to fight the tactic . Besides , he s getting what he wanted . Why put up a fight ? <p> Okay , so how can we apply this art of contrasting to boost our affiliate campaigns ? <p> The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets to exploit is time . While I was being driven around a city I had lived in for just 3 days in the back of somebody elses car , an affiliate marketer has little " holding rights " over the subject . We have so many options to not listen to a sales pitch ( exit the page , browse another tab , get distracted by our balls ) that retaining attention becomes the most important stage of the process . <p> If we go back in time 18 months , you will recall a sweeping craze that involved dual-selling affiliate offers on the same page . Hey , if the reader is happy to buy an acai supplement for $39.95/month , why not hit them with an additional colon cleanse kit for $19.95/month ? The upsell seems artificially cheaper after the customer has already invested in a more expensive item .

It butters up the reader for a more attractive proposition . <p> So when you hit them further down the page with a largely unknown , new and exciting dating offer , that offers a niche angle relevant to their needs ( targeting a Divorced demographic with a Divorce niche offer , for example ) , you leverage the power of contrast to create a much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but super effective when executed well . <p> Dating is just one vertical of many that can be exploited in this way .

It basically says that humans have no idea how much something is worth when presented with the thing on its own . We have to have something to compare it to ; Do I like A more or less than B ? ; Is A worth more to me than B ? . Giving people something to compare to is a very powerful psychological selling method , as long as what you want them to buy is obviously better or better-priced than the other .

But I find many marketers get caught up in the theory that long sales pitches must translate in to high prices . There are many lead gen offers out there in the $3-$6 payout region , where the long sales pitch , followed by a free offer , can kick some serious ass . <p> Not to mention , most advertisers will absolutely love the quality of your traffic . <p> I also thought that I 'd lose too many clicks .

But hackers will be hackers . <p> I cant help but wonder how many people will read this and actually act on it .

@@106277835 @1677835/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Last year I wrote what turned out to be one of my most popular blog posts when I announced why I was trading London for Thailand . Its time for Part 2 , the part where I explain why I 'm heading back home in July . <p> Now , there are many reasons why I could be looking to leave Thailand , are n't  there ? I know what you want me to say . The supply of ladyboys could never last forever . Shockingly enough , it goes deeper than that . <p> The last seven months have been a hugely fun and unforgettable learning experience for me . I 've had to embrace a culture that I have about as much in common with as a fish out of water . For anybody who has dabbled with the idea of visiting Thailand , I say do it . Its a friendly and vibrant country , with some of the best damn beaches you 're ever going to see in your lifetime . <p> One of the reasons I left London was to chase full value for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greater London suburbs , its not difficult to put a high price on a tropical climate and a diet of fresh coconuts . These were things that appealed to me immensely , and they still do . But in leaving London , I 'm sure I underestimated all the comforts and relationships I 'd be leaving behind . <p> When I ask myself whether I could spend six months holidaying in Thailand every year , the answer is a resounding " show me the booking form " . But its difficult to settle here , and it feels like a temporary home . <p> Traveling alone is much different to traveling as a couple . My girlfriend works in fashion and if you know anything about the fashion world , you 'll be aware that it revolves around the major cities of New York , London , Paris and Milan . Her work almost demands that she be in the thick of her industry , and as much as we both love Thailand , Bangkok Fashion Week left a little to be desired in the prestige stakes . <p> We also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody who gets suckered in to the cute fluffy pet markets of Bangkok . Do not buy pets unless you 've researched the quarantine regulations in your country . I would n't give up my dogs for the world , but getting stiffed with a quarantine import bill for -5000 ( $8000 ) was a major shock when I made their travel arrangements back to England . <p> There 's a misconception that Thailand is cheap . I guess it is , for certain commodities . But you have to understand that the tourist economy is vastly different to the local economy . And unless you know more than Hello and Goodbye in Thai , you 're going to find it pretty difficult to escape the tourist traps . My outgoings in London were roughly -1000/month ( $1600 ) . After noting down my expenses last week , I worked out that I 'm spending on average -4200/month ( $6700 ) in Thailand . <p> Those costs are inflated by living on the cusp of Downtown Bangkok , in one of the citys prime locations , with an expansive 4 bedroom apartment . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 60 days . I 've already ticked off trips to Malaysia , Singapore and Cambodia with other adventures planned for my last two months here . <p> So in response to those who say Thailand is a cheap recluse for oddballs who ca n't survive in the west , I would have to say try it for yourself . Going by the prices Ive experienced on my travels , America is one of the cheapest places I 've ever visited . And Singapore is definitely the most expensive , although luxurious from coast to coast . <p> It could be as luxurious as my balls , I 'm still going to refuse to pay $5 for a small pack of Oreos . <p> The weather here is hot and humid all year round . I do n't  recommend heading to Thailand in April or May , unless you 're prepared to get down and dirty in your own sweat . I would also advice you not to make the schoolboy error of venturing in to a Bangkok thunderstorm under the assumption of " Eh , fuck it , I 'm used to London showers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could happen is a monsoon in your face . <p> I 'm definitely going to miss having a wardrobe full of shorts and summer shirts when I head back to London . Yet there are changes I 'm looking forward to that have made the move a necessity . Seeing friends and family is obviously uplifting . Just being able to communicate freely , in my own language , is something I 've learnt to appreciate . I find it quite difficult to express myself in broken Thai , and expression is a fundamental quality in all of our lives . <p> Looking further ahead , I 've definitely caught the travel bug . I could never be one of the single state gremlins who knows little about what 's outside his city , let alone what goes on in a different country . By the end of 2012 , I aim to have visited every continent ( including Antarctica ! ) . Until then , I think I 'm going to enjoy the sun for a little while longer . <p> Seven months in Thailand and Ive almost turned a shade of " slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 7 Comments <p> -4200 a month ! Holy shit . That must have been quite a lifestyle ( either that or a fucking huge flat ! ) There 's no way in hell you 'll be able to go back to an austere , grand a month lifestyle in London , haha . Still , I totally feel you . There 's no way I 'd be able to life in Bangkok permanently either . Although I know plenty of people who do , and love it , they are people who have been brought there by work rather than total freedom of choice . For six months though , fuck yes , and I 'm planning to do just that . Its one of my favourite cities in the world , you must have had a blast . However , my other favourite city is London , so I totally know where you are coming from . <p> Would be great to have a few drinks when you are back in town , not looking for a free consulting session , more like a social and networking type thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you have a super authentic ( and dirt cheap ) thai meal at Chote Chitr before you come back . Pretty grotty hole in the wall type place but the food is astounding. = <p> As a 22 year old from London currently living in Bali , Indonesia , I can only say : <p> DO NT DO IT ! Come to Bali instead ; -D <p> A month out here and I 'm already in love ! There 's a strong fashion community in Bali , with a lot of trendy boutique shops . <p> The thing I like most is the perfect mix of western comforts ( a lot of Australians take a cheap holiday here and never leave ) and local culture when you want to remind yourself you 're on a tropical island in the middle of a far away country . <p> You can also skate the line between the white linen crowd and the backpackers , making expenses here extremely cheap , allot less then what you 're spending in Thailand ( if you want ) . <p> Convinced ? Drop me an email if you 're genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Obviously its a lot more expensive when you 're with your girlfriend , rather than budgeting on your own ! <p> In London , I 'm still expecting the costs to be high . But I think itll probably be closer to -3000/month rather than what I 'm paying now . The money is n't the main problem . I 'm just not fully settled , and it makes sense for my girlfriend to be where she can get work easily . <p> @Lewis I would love to go to Bali , but I cant move there for the same reasons I cant stay in Thailand . Looks like a beautiful country . <p> Visa runs are not necessary . You can easily and quickly set up a structure that allows you to stay for a year in Thailand , or more , at little or no cost . One of the free methods is a bit greyhat . Find me online and I 'll tell you how . <p> Hey Finch , just curious , what 's wrong with Tenerife , Andalucia or even Algarve ?

You have n't found the best LP yet , you 're still testing for the best converting offer page , you havent had a pay bump . <p> So even if you let a banner run for 3x offer you will likely not have any real performers . <p> Cull by CTR too abitrary as the banners may not be backing out to leads . <p> Cull by leads you might keep half your banners if they garnered a lead , but they may well have a -ve ROI <p> Cull by profit and loss most likely will leave you with no banners . <p> Any pointers to help out ? It seems like a mix of art and science to me at the moment <p> A lot of it is intuition . You can usually tell if there 's life in a campaign by the early stats . <p> #1 thing to look out for is a converting offer . Your offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoving shit up a mountain . If the offer does n't  show a strong , consistent conversion rate , the chances of your angle , banner or LP making a difference are slim to none . <p> I disagree that you are n't  likely to have a top performer after 3x the offer payout . That would suggest no conversions at all . I usually find at least 1 or 2 combinations that take me close to break even . If I do n't  , its not a good sign . <p> Another tactic you can try is to scale sideways in to a cheaper market ( geo or traffic source ) . If the CPC is lower and your relative conversion rate holds strong , that instantly hacks out a lot of the work you need to do . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

It melds together practical advice covering the creation of your business plan , attracting investors , outsourcing vs. employing and some key tips for using social media . <p> The pages are littered with perspective from entrepreneurs that you will likely be familiar with . Guys like Mike Michalowicz , the famous Toilet Paper Entrepreneur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gary Vaynerchuk who is present just about bloody everywhere . <p> As a guy who makes his living solely online , the book resonates with me . I get the sense the authors are fighting back the temptation to scream that entrepreneurs have never had it so easy . And its true , we have n't . <p> Since the rise of the Internet , the economy has shifted towards the web in such a way that there are opportunities for everyone . Forming a small business used to be about racking up the courage to go public with a bold idea , often in your local town or bravely on a national level . The web has made it possible to hide behind a screen and still reel in the dollar bills . There 's less risk of personal embarrassment , and much less start-up cost attached . <p> The book slants heavily towards this modern breed of online entrepreneur .

Most of the spotlighted entrepreneurs have stumbled across their success using the web as their main medium , rather than an optional market for growth . <p> Small Business , Big Vision is extremely well written and cuts like a knife through subjects that are notorious minefields to even think about it . The process of obtaining investment is very well addressed and you will likely exit the chapter with a greater deal of clarity than you started . <p> It also swiftly addresses the pros and cons of outsourcing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to send my expectations , hopes and dreams to a polite sounding chap in the Phillipines ? Its a tough one , but again , the Toren brothers have laid out both sides of the argument very objectively . They repeat this throughout the book across a variety of common issues for entrepreneurs , including the dreaded realisation that you need to make changes for your business to survive . <p> If I could advocate one feeling that you 're likely to take from the book , it would have to be clarity . <p> Clarity plus the jealous motivation of hearing what so many other successful entrepreneurs have done to grow their millions .

I knew that it was time to look myself in the mirror , face up to the truth and ask " Finch , you unhealthy bastard , do you want to be a stud muffin or just a slob who ate all the muffins ? " <p> By saying adios to junk food , crappy eating and lack of sleep , I theorized I could create a lifestyle change that would snowball in to something resembling vitality and full health . This , in turn , would allow me to thrive in the workplace with optimal levels of concentration and focus . <p> The ultimate goal was an improvement in mind , body and spirit . It was time to say " kiss my balls " to the unhealthy bastard in the mirror , Michael Jackson-style , minus the unhealthy interest in kids . <h> The Challenge <p> I spent days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best possible diet to give my body a healing rest from its regular abuse . Detoxing is a controversial subject . Its very hard to strike a balance between listening to the raw food psychopaths wholl give you dirty scowls for even glancing at a cow in the wrong way , and the All-American Americans who believe eating an entire livestock of chickens is n't just a delicious choice , but what the chickens wanted . <p> I decided on a 4 day fruit detox , followed by a slightly more lenient diet that would be more sustainable for my non-commital ass in the long run . Minimal processed foods , minimal caffeine , no added salts and sugars . <p> I have n't tasted alcohol for over 6 weeks now , so that was never a problem . No doubt my tolerance will be tested when I return to London , however . <h> Surviving The Detox <p> For those of you who have n't tried a fruit detox , the first effects are typically a raging headache and the growing despair that life is not worth living . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitten to kill soon ? " <p> Detox symptoms vary from person to person . The heavier the symptoms , the more toxins you 've accumulated in your body that are struggling to come out . <p> What follows is a detoxing process known as " retracing " . This is where your body undergoes the strange sensation of re-experiencing recent illnesses and weaknesses . If you did n't  know any better , youd assume that the detox is adding to your woes rather than working for the greater good . But its all part of the recovery so do n't  go quitting while the going is tough . <p> Your body is actually flushing harmful toxins in to your bloodstream at a rapid rate , much faster than the body can dispose of . The toxin-filled blood rushes to the brain and creates a surreal sensation where you experience many different pains and illness symptoms in short bursts . <p> The symptoms were always there . But its only when your body is in " recovery mode " that the organs can actually deal with them . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started . Somebody get me a burger . Cheeseburger . Shit , its getting worse . Get me some extra cheese with that " <p> This period of headaches , fatigue , volatile stomach reactions and irritability lasted for a couple of days on my detox . Caffeine withdrawals can lead to massive headaches , and if you like your sugar which I do n't  youre also going to suffer . My longing for food with meaty texture almost lead to the butchering of a gecko outside my hotel room . Its not easy to fight your cravings under a barrage of physical aches and pains . <p> But when the symptoms begin to pass , and here 's the big incentive , you truly do feel a million times better than you did before . Your body begins to accept and use the nutrients of the fruit to your advantage , unleashing enormous swirls of energy and a sense of clarity the likes of which I 'm still wondering how I ever did without before . <p> It probably helped that my detox was aided by an endless supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renowned superfruits in the world . I have since re-introduced lean meats in to my diet , but never at the expense of leafy greens and an overcompensation of fruits . Ive replaced alcohol with smoothies , diet coke with water , and coffee with green tea . The effects are here for me to see , and I 'm very happy with them . <h> 33% Diet , 33% Exercise , 33% Rest <p> No healthy lifestyle can be sustained by simply eating the right foods . Its just as important to exercise and get a sufficient amount of sleep . Even though I have a gym and swimming pool downstairs , I 've often found my work " too pressing " to find time to exercise as much as I should have . That is changing by simply forcing a work-out in to my daily schedule , no matter how many servers are crashing and burning around me at the time . <p> My sleeping habits , ironically , were fixed when I started my detox . The overwhelming fatigue that I felt after a few days of eating only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track . The sensation of waking up naturally at 8am , fresh , energised and blessed with clarity is a million miles from how I felt just two months ago . Then I would slip out of the bedroom at 1pm , feeling just as lethargic as I had when my body finally passed out the night before . <p> A good sleeping pattern makes such a huge difference to what I feel capable of achieving in a day , and certainly to my attention span while I 'm trying to achieve it . <p> Many entrepreneurs argue that they 're " not morning people " and work most efficiently at night . While this may be true for some , I would bet that the majority are simply closet insomniacs making the best out of a bad situation . <h> Finchs Sickly Generic Final Thoughts <p> Striving for a healthy lifestyle is n't something that should be born out of wanting to make more money . There 's no point in stacking towers of dollar bills if you do n't  have the health and peace of mind to enjoy them . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I see it as a common trait of young entrepreneurs . We have so much money , and such little sense of value . If your work ethic is harming your health , the only future you 're contributing to is your own self-destruction . <p> While I can say that the changes definitely did improve my focus , concentration and work productivity , these are secondary to the satisfaction that came from looking after myself and actually feeling a sense of working with my body , rather than dragging it kicking and screaming through the night against its will . <p> Western society , particularly America , is riddled with quick fix cures for conditions that cant possibly heal with the popping of a pill . Papering over cracks is the term that springs to mind . But that does n't  stop people from trying . Many of us will find any excuse , or quick fix , to continue living unhealthily , until it becomes impossible through the damage we 've already inflicted to ourselves . <p> If you 're going to try a detox followed by a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utter Hell . It gets a lot worse before it starts to get better . <p> Be truthful with yourself , get educated , and find ways to cut out the crap that 's holding you back . Your mind and body will reward you by working at their full potential . And if you 've been operating " half-arsed " for as long as I had , this can feel like an incredible burden lifted . 114274 @qwx974274 <p> Check out Filthy Rich Mind , a brand new project I 'm collaborating on with a couple of other writers in the self-improvement market .

The second you let the money go to your head and sap away your desire to become better at your craft , you 're flirting with disaster . <p> There is always somebody better than you , always somebody earning more . If you forget to carry yourself with a humble willingness to learn and to listen to what other people are doing , you will completely toast your long term prospects of surviving . Or certainly achieving what you might have done in this industry . <p> There 's times where I browse WickedFire and it completely blows my mind that such a collective bag of dicks could ever have the social or diplomatic know-how to sustain good relations with a single network let alone the far reaching contacts necessary to run a proper business . <p> I know there 's a lot of " front " , and many people will talk shit simply because they 've established a net vBulletin post count of 10,000 in the noughties where faceless web bashing has become the norm . But sometimes , people will judge you by the only face they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying yourself with respect and actually giving something back to the community rather than shitting on it . <p> I often get asked what its like to be working for myself so young . I always answer the same : incredibly stressful but always worthwhile . I 've had to sacrifice a lot of the boozy shipwrecked Friday nights on the lash that I used to enjoy week in week out . Not because I feel financially restricted , but because I 'm carrying the weight of my own expectations on my shoulders . And I expect a lot from myself . If I 'd allowed my ego to dictate my life , I would have crashed and burned long before now . <p> One of the drawbacks of being part of this younger generation of web entrepreneurs is that some of us simply are n't  ready for it . Teaching yourself discipline , motivation and the ability to plan ahead is not always easy when your first taste of success is as simple as refreshing stats . So many of us enter the industry full-time starstruck on the back of initial success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , and how your success can be as fleeting as the time it takes you to fall . Do n't  let your bank balance go to your head and do n't  book a worldwide cruise on the back of a good months work . <p> Networking with other marketers and sharing your knowledge is probably the single most effective way of gaining experience as an affiliate . We all have our own successes and failures to talk about . I can always tell when I 'm talking to a young egomaniac with his head up his own arse . And I never share anything useful with these people . If you act like a lone riding dick with a chip on your shoulder , people will treat you like one . <p> There are n't  many industries where you can be so successful in such a short space of time . I hate to say it , but just because you 're making money , that does n't  mean you 're great at what you do . I think many young affiliates will drop out of the business as competition becomes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those still standing will probably be the ones who have n't spent all day living the jet-set affiliate lifestyle they took for granted and thought theyd always have . <p> So you 're young and rich . That 's a notorious recipe for ending up old and lazy . Working hard through the good times , staying humble around your peers , and helping others to succeed . These are all qualities that are likely to work in your favour at some point . The riches for young affiliates are mind boggling . But you 've got ta grow up fast to enjoy them . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Nice post . Glad there are some people like me . Except that you 've hit it big time and your bank account is filling itself up ( I 'm still working on that one ) = but if I read your prev comments , you only suceeded because of CPA rebill offers When did you then start promoting them ? 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277843 @1677843/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> In any other industry , Affbuzz founder Justin Barr would be eating lawsuits for his sexist discrimination and Victorian principles . He s saved by the evidence that affiliate marketing is a raging sausagefest that shows no sign of abating anytime soon . <p> I 'm using an ambiguous example . Just because there are so few female bloggers , does n't  mean there are no female affiliates . Maybe they prefer to keep busy in the trenches ? Maybe they do n't  want to be terrorized by their WickedFire peers ? <p> Have you seen how affiliate marketers flirt with the fairer sex ? I do n't  want to spoil the surprise for you , but the phenomenon is best described as a bull in a china shop ; or a teaspoon of honey in a beehive . <p> I do know a few female affiliates , and they are certainly capable . But they are exceptions to the rule . If you go to a trade show , the large majority of women are working on the corporate side . <p> I doubt therell ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the male counterparts , their competence ranges from awful to excellent . You can shoot me for slander if I 'm wrong , but it seems pretty obvious that some networks hire their account managers not only for their technical skills , but for their ability to inspire the loins of the young , testosterone-driven males they 're obliged to serve . <p> If I ever had to translate my dating fantasy ads to the affiliate demographic , I 've no doubt that " Would You Like to Date an Affiliate Manager ? " would trigger a monster CTR . <p> We are working in a male-dominated industry . That much is clear . But why do men have such a stranglehold on the business ? The qualities necessary to succeed are available just as readily to women as they are to men . <p> I have to confess that the gap in the market for an excellent female CPA blogger often keeps me awake at night . I wish I 'd called this blog Charlotte Sells , or that I had the arse of Kim Kardashian , or that my tits werent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gasbagging machine-gun of expletives like myself would struggle as a feminine brand . But it still hurts . <p> When you look away from CPA , and turn your attention to Internet Marketing as a whole , you 'll find lots of female bloggers . I mean , Christ , the work at home mom gimmick is one cow that keeps on giving milk . Its a monster niche with huge scope for profit , but it rarely seems to push the envelope . <p> WAHM blogs will typically focus on low-risk , low-reward enterprise . I 'm not knocking them . Such ventures make perfect sense when you have kids biting your ankles , and less time to spend in your basement . I find work hard enough with two puppies . I do n't  even want to think about fathering an ankle biter that does n't  have four legs . <p> In fact , many of the newbies reading this blog , those with no budget , would perhaps gain more from copying the tricks of the stay at home moms . They may not promise the same rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of reality . <p> I sometimes wonder if affiliate networks could one day level the gender playing field . So much of our industry is branded around fast cars , a testosterone-driven grind , and strip clubs in Vegas . You cant knock the networks for appealing to the majority of their clients . But is there an opportunity being missed ? <p> How many more networks do we need with essentially the same brand in a different skin ? And how many more male blogs will jostle for position on Affbuzz before a female presence bucks the trend ? <p> Its tough to say if affiliate marketing is dominated by males because of some natural gravitation in the male mindset , or whether its because 99% of the networks and blogs are conforming to the status quo . <p> Would more women get in to affiliate marketing if there were more female personalities blazing the trail ? What if a network came along with feminine branding rather than the usual hoes and dough ? <p> I think the appeal of affiliate marketing as a business has no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a scale of 70:0 . But it could change very easily . As is so often the case , whoever acts first will stand to profit the most . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Dating affiliates should grab a copy of Premium Posts Volume 3 .

If you look at any engineering program at any university , its the same thing : no females . While you do find a fair share of female software engineers in tech industries , its still in the mainstream companies . This industry of ours , like you said suffers from one-dimensional branding that caters to the male-dominated status quo . From the point of view of a woman , she has to work alone and then come to events that reek of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfits . Its hard as it is to break into the industry as an affiliate , but you now add to the fact that there 's very little commaderie for them . It makes sense to start as an affiliate manager to learn the business . <p> A number of my sites have been built using SBI/SiteSell and having attended a couple of user conferences and hosted one of my own , a significant percentage of the audience is female . In fact , I 'll go further , a significant percentage is female and aged 45 or over . <p> I think that every one of them that I have met has been kind , generous and friendly . Certainly a long way from the secretive yet boastful ( I know ) young studs in the affiliate space . <p> Many of these ladies have a business model that is mostly based on free search traffic from Google , using AdSense and one or two other monetisation methods , including things like cj and clickbank . As you mentioned above , they are n't  trying to own a sports car or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression in their methods . But they seem to be surviving just fine . <p> Perhaps they are not so typical , but at least the fairer sex are involved in this world , even if they do n't  blog about it . <p> I think iPyxel hit the nail on the head . It is a technical field , at least from a general public view . People are blown away by what we do , even though it is really pretty simple . Same goes with engineering , math , or any type of programming . I studied engineering in uni and males have dominated the field since its existence really , and still do . I 'd love to see more female programmers , or affiliate marketers , but I do n't  see it happening . Their general way of thought and society keeps them away from the technical side , in general . <p> I think a lot of the lack of blogging stems from the fact that women do n't  necessarily crave the same recognition men do . Add that to the fact that affiliate marketers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with women in their industry ( I have had people try to flirt with me via wickedfire PMs ) and that the conferences , etc are giant sausage fests leads to the women keeping their heads down and working without drawing attention to themselves with things like blogs . <p> Anyone who thinks women do n't  have the same technical skills as men and that 's the reason there are n't  as many in AM is an idiot . <p> Most women would rather work for someone else , and do n't  have the want to be an entrepreneur , which affiliate marketing in its essence really is Argue with me all you want , but women simply like to be told what to do , in a general sense . <p> I know several female affiliates who earn more than most male affiliates ever will . The reason you do n't  hear about them is the exact reason they 're making so much they are n't  messing around on blogs , forums , Facebook groups , etctheyre actually doing what needs to be done to make that kind of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there . <p> Dinos point was that women do n't  like being entrepreneurs because they like working for other people . <p> Of course when you look at actual facts , like the fact that there are more women who own small businesses than men his argument completely falls apart , but well just ignore that and continue to insult women why do n't  we ? <p> For the most part our industry does n't  exactly have the maturity for a chick to feel comfortable to run a blog . I 'm sure in the back of the heads they are thinking of the potential abuse , sexist comments , and stalking they might attract being in the lime light . <p> I forgot 5star ! I should n't have though . I remember guest blogging there a couple years back . <p> Of course , not denying that there are female affiliate bloggers out there . The headline was strictly linkbait . But there 's no doubt that most blogs seem to be male-run , and the trade shows reveal a hugely skewed demographic . <p> I disagree that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even consider affiliate marketing to be that technical . I think the industry is branded heavily from a male perspective , and that seems to be who it attracts . <p> @Ian I havent read those blogs personally , but having taken a quick look , they seem to be more of a general Internet Marketing vibe rather than CPA affiliate marketing , which is what I 'm referring to . <p> Been to one lately ? Not only is the LARGEST affiliate trade show half owned by a woman ( Missy Ward ) , but there are a large amount of female attendees . Is it more male ? Yes . 0% ? Come on dude . Such a BS headline . <p> " I think it comes down to technical skills " <p> Anytime you have to insult the other gender with a false and ignorant stereotype to make an argument , youve already lost . <p> There are plenty of us that are female in this industry . And successful as shit while were at it too . <p> Every trade show Ive been to has been very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  females . But in CPA particularly , the gender divide seems obvious . How else do networks get away with holding their meet-ups in strip clubs ? You cant tell me its anywhere close to 50/50 . <p> Again , I have to make it clear that corporate affiliate marketing and general Internet Marketing are completely detached from the CPA side of the business that I 'm referring to . <p> Females in this comment thread : stop getting mad at facts . There are WAY fewer females than males as affiliates . I 'd be willing to guess its around 1:50 . Just like the article states , there are tons on the corporate side . Listing people like missy ward and people who work at affiliate networks , merchants , forum owners or bloggers who do n't  actually really do much as affiliates does n't  count toward the tally , sorry . <p> I wont make any speculations as to why , but all it takes is 10 minutes at the ASW exhibit hall or 10 minutes in ANY affiliate party or meetup . <p> Nicky : Not arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But more and more women are showing up . I cant say the ratio I see is 1:50 at affiliate shows or anywhere close to that , but I also do n't  talk to every female there to know if they work for a network or are actual affiliate marketers . <p> However , I am an actual affiliate marketer ( and I 'm pretty sure you know that and werent referring to me in that statement ) . And I know tons of other women that are too . Just saying that 0% is sensation and no where near fact . <p> You know what would have been nice , starting that you are offended by all the sexist disgusting things in the industry , the message boards full of naked ladies , the parties that call to women as " HOs " <p> No , but its an example of what I 'm suggesting in the post : the male-centered branding . <p> I 'm sure there must be some female affiliates out there , or would-be affiliates , who are slightly turned off from the CPA industry by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clad girls plastered across the templates . Just as Mr. Green mentioned above . <p> How much of that culture is turning away females who could potentially be very good CPA marketers ? It seems that for a woman to succeed in CPA , she has to learn to deal with the male-centered branding , unless she ventures in to more general Internet Marketing fields where this is a much stronger presence of female bloggers and the like . I think personally a CPA network branded for females might have an opportunity to get some real traction . But as far as I can see , there are none . And that seems to be the case with CPA bloggers too . Very few of them are female , as shown by the Affbuzz stat . <p> I think its probably unrealistic to stop guys on WickedFire posting naked ladies over affiliate chat . A guys got ta have his porn . But wheres the alternative ? If a woman wants to get involved with CPA , that 's generally where she has to start , because there are so few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college and life experience . <p> It could be because 1 . Women think its boring as hell . 2 . They 're better at other things . 3 . Combination of both . <p> That 's all that 's being discussed here-facts . No one is trying to say women are worse than men at anything by nature . This industry is great because it rewards you purely based on merit . There 's no need to prove anything . So what if there 's more men in any industry ? <p> Let 's stop being so sensitive and hostile and be happy that we absolutely dominate animals at survival . <p> I agree that the stats show that men tend to be in more technical type careers , like engineering , software and IT . This could be for the simple fact that ( in general and I 'm not stereotyping ! ) women tend to be more social creatures and sitting in front of a computer for long periods does not involve interaction with real people ( not virtual people , so not Facebook/Twitter ) . <p> Wow , I 'm surprised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started off a little debate lol . There are many female affiliates around online , it is just a huge case that we do n't waste our time on forums or networking .. I use that **31;191;TOOLONG female only affiliate network and have done for ages now and they have a large base of female affiliates and we all sometimes gather for meetings/conventions ! Males are not the only underground networking marketers , us females also have our own place of meeting = x <p> @Leylah i also use http : //FemaleAffiliates.com &amp; http : //MomCPA.com too : D , i might have seen you around haha lol ! When i first started working from home online i did n't  have a clue where to start ! I used to do Avon selling which is basically affiliate sales but door to door selling and i wanted it a little less hard on myself to be honest and i wanted to work just from home with no products .. I think as time goes by more and more female affiliates will get to grips online and start to show as things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less experienced ! <p> There are a lot more men in the industry , but there 's definitely ladies repping in the IM/CPA/AM world . I 'm one of them . I 'm not sure what would gauge as successful , but I consider myself to do pretty damn good in CPA . I do know , however , that I 'm in a predominantly male situation though . I kind of like being a diamond in the rough . = <p> Well it is definitely not true , there are female affiliate marketers , in fact I am one myself . I saw that someone posted a comment that women would rather work for someone else , well I 'm a woman and Ive always wanted my own business since I was a child and could never stand to work for someone else coming to work when they wanted me to come or not being able to take days off to go on vacation because my boss tells me they need me there to put money in their pocket . I love being in business for myself . I work online and offline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do want to be in business for themselves and there are females who are affiliate marketers , Ive seen some . <p> I work for a very big affiliate in the sports betting sector and I must admit that its a very male dominated industry . However I know plenty of females who run affiliate businesses and they tend to be in softer sectors ( not competition-wise but in the kind of products and services they deal with ) . All the affiliate conferences I 've been to are appalling in terms of how I 've been treated as a women ( even the female staff showing us to the conference room looked through me to the men behind me and asked how she could help them ) . I 'm building my own affiliate biz and want it to stay male-dominated so I can use my female business instincts to quietly overtake the boys = <p> Seriously ? ! I am an affiliate for PeerFly and several other CPA programs . I run several niche websites . Have you guys noticed that many " coupon blogs " are run by women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you never heard of BlogHer ? Do you think women just blog about kids ? When I attended NAMS which is an affiliate marketing conference I believe it was VERY mixed . Not only gender but cultures . Yall need to do some research . The comment about technical skills is annoying because although there are more engineers I promise using WordPress is not the freaking same thing . <p> As for the comment about there being more men in technical roles did you ever think its because women do n't  have the opportunities to enter these fields that men do ? From the time they 're little , they 're encouraged to enter more humanities and service-based industries . And the women who do go into technical fields find it hard to advance because its a boys party . The same thing goes for CPA . Luckily things are ( slowly ) changing for the better . <p> On average , women desire more flexibility and meaning in their lives than men . This is why many women who enter such " technical roles " eventually end up reducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or meaningful job with less pay . It is also why on average women are more likely to turn down promotions . <p> In Susan Pinkers book The Sexual Paradox , she explains how the politically correct view that there are fewer women in powerful positions due to sexism is completely at odds with the evidence . <p> As one small example , there are examples of big law firms and universities that offered women incentives to take promotions or study in certain fields incentives that were not offered to men , making them sexist AGAINST men , incidentally and still women turned them down . <p> If you still doubt me , read The Sexual Paradox . Its a rare ray of clarity on the subject of sex differences . <p> So many comments here make me outraged ! ! There are many smart women in affiliate marketing . <p> I have been one of the largest publishers for many affiliate networks and I own my own business . <p> However I do n't  waste my time networking online , I do n't  have a website , the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay private . I do n't  brag about my success because I do not want people to get competitive with me and copy my marketing practices . <p> PS . When I go to conventions all you drunk boys sit there and disclose your secrets to me all night long because you do n't  realize who I am and what I am up to = <p> This will probably make the poster above me even more outraged . The first comment implied that affiliate marketing is essentially a technical field , and like other technical fields , ( engineering , IT ) it is male-dominated . However , affiliate marketing is more than that it encompasses marketing and design skills as well , which are n't  typically male-dominated endeavors . <p> Someone else touched upon the fact that men are more likely to be risk-takers , and I think this plays into it too . But the primary ingredient to affiliate success is brains and main reason why there are no affiliate blogs run by females could be the fact that at certain intelligence thresholds , men vastly outnumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , men outnumber women by about 7-1 . Now to be fair , average intelligences between the genders seem to be about equal ; men having the broader distribution means you have more outliers at the extremes and therefore more geniuses or near-geniuses . <p> Combine these three attributes ( technical ability , risk-taking , high intelligence ) together , and there is your answer . <p> Honestly , I have to tell you that I am a female and do have an IQ of over 140 . You are just implying that men are smarter than women , and that is why women find it hard to be in the open because of all the sexist and prejudiced assumptions . <p> Oh , and sorry for double posting , but a quick search " Are men smarter than women " on Google shows a whole page of titles saying " Women are smarter than men " , " Women overtake men in IQ tests .. " , etc . <p> I am NOT saying we are smarter than men . To be honest I believe that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know lots and lots of guys ( and gals ) that are smarter than me , but this is just to point out that we should make assumptions . <p> That 's a sad statistic , particularly since women have so much spending power and influence in social media . This statistic must be a little biased , particularly since there are even networks dedicated for women ; For Example : http : //www.momsaffiliate.com/ <p> Granted that this is an old post , but its interesting to note that since this was written Ive certainly noticed a lot more women in affiliate marketing on the publisher not corporate side . <p> Like many have mentioned , the cliquey male-dominated networks are sometimes off-putting for women . It is interesting though , that most gurus love to promote how dumb they were in school and how its far more efficient to outsource your technical tasks to the nerds ( which it is ) , yet some commentators in this particular string seem to think that a high IQ and technical skill is the X factor . Let 's be honest , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business model and most folks can learn the ropes with dedication . <p> The fact is , there are a lot of female affiliates even more nowadays who want to get into it but they do n't  spend as much time in the male-dominated forums ; they develop their own circles preferring to stay underground and overpaid . I can see why lol. 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277844 @1677844/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Maybe , but there 's something else . I do n't  think you 'll find a single successful affiliate who has n't  shown a good knack for understanding his traffic sources . It may be one traffic source , it may be many . But without that working knowledge , you 'll find it painstakingly difficult to generate profit . <p> Self-serve advertising platforms like Facebook , Plentyoffish and AdWords are enduringly popular with affiliates . I mark this down to two reasons . The ease of launching a campaign , and the abundance of case studies readily available for digestion . <p> However , these platforms are only a small segment of the online advertising space . A few affiliates have commented on my Facebook related posts saying that , actually , its not even worth bothering with Facebook these days . The big money is in advertising on display networks and nailing down media buys . <p> While I would disagree that Facebook is no longer worth the bother , there 's definitely truth to the argument that display advertising is a lucrative and sustainable replacement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incentive is that affiliates find it much harder to launch profitable campaigns off the bat . They become disheartened when the inventory shrinks at closer inspection , many of the featured sites refusing to run ads in popular affiliate verticals . They see CPMs of $3.50 that set the alarm bells ringing . <p> In many cases , the control panel itself is a sprawling mass of more options than a " no bells and whistles " Facebook advertiser could shake a stick at . <p> So the affiliate does what could be expected of him . He runs back to Facebooks loving arms , willing to sacrifice the great unknown for super tight margins and bitching interns . Whatever makes you feel at home , right ? <p> There are hundreds of traffic sources that can be called upon . Why do so many affiliates choose the same two or three ? In fact , let 's elaborate on that . Why do so many affiliates settle for being mediocre on the same two or three ? <p> I 've linked to this article countless times , but its value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of traffic sources that could keep you busy for the rest of the week . <p> Now , back to the question of what do successful affiliates have in common ? <p> The answer is patience , determination and perseverance to cancel out distractions , take one of those ad platforms , and sponge up every last piece of information about it . <p> You can do this by signing up and hacking together a campaign to test the waters . I do n't  recommend it though . <p> Have you seen what happens when you try to port a Facebook campaign to Plentyoffish ? It does n't  work . No two traffic sources are the same , so porting a campaign to another in the hope that it will become profitable straight away is very optimistic thinking . <p> Before advertising on a new traffic source , I like to contact my account manager and interrogate him for some perspective on what other affiliates are doing . This shows that I need direct results and that I do n't  have budget to piss my message in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a good idea of how suitable the platform is for direct response marketing , I 'll make a decision on whether I want to go ahead and inject whatever holding balance is required . This is a small step , but it saves me the bother of 2009 revisited . <p> 2009 revisited ? Yeah , having a leftover balance of $982.94 in seven different traffic sources after losing my Google account and depositing a grand in to every alternative I could find . Binge depositing is bad , kids . <p> If you 're going to try a new traffic source , its only logical that you extend it the same level of patience as you would with Facebook . If the first campaign bombs , you probably had a shitty campaign . Do n't  blame the foreign traffic source for your own ineptitude or one size fits all marketing . <p> Gather some test data and then drop your account manager another email . Ask for some advice on how you 've configured the campaign . Does it look right ? Are you missing any obvious tricks that other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its necessary to measure campaign variables in a strategic manner . You can only do this with a clean slate . Ive been working with an adult traffic source lately , and even though I 'm dealing in the same vertical ( dating offers ) , I 've had to assume the identity of somebody who knows nothing . I split test variables that I neednt even worry about on Plentyoffish because I 've had time to key in those campaigns already . <p> Small details cause massive ripples of change . Imagine if you 'd never played with the browser targeting on Plentyoffish , or the geographic filtering on Facebook . Christ , just imagine the carnage if you showed Facebook the same disdain that these new traffic sources receive when you cant get your first campaign profitable . <p> Successful affiliates know this , whether they 're advertising on Facebook , AdWords or some shitty display network based out of the Angolan jungle .

@@106277845 @1677845/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> The following is a guest post by Jesse Freund of LandingPower.com . Jesse has been active in the affiliate marketing world since 2008 and has had plenty of experience catering to the needs of affiliate marketers . LandingPower.com is a great option for high quality design needs . <p> For the past few years , I 've worked as a designer catering specifically to the needs of affiliates . Youd think the process would be very straight forward , but in reality , there are practices one should use to ensure the end result is a success and that money is n't wasted . Today , I 'll give you some pointers when you work with a designer . <h> Do n't  Be Vague <p> First things first : you 're the affiliate , not the designer . If I had a nickel for every time I was told , " I need a high converting landing page " or " I need a banner that has a high CTR " , I 'd be rich enough to sit around all day on a yacht surrounded by Brazilian models . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a banner that gets a high CTR . Before you said that , I was n't going into the project thinking , " I 'm going to design a landing page with a moderate conversion rate so this guy will never come back " . Now granted , there are certainly practices that help increase conversions and CTR . However , that does n't  mean you do n't  have to be specific . You 're still the affiliate , so its important to use your expertise based on the traffic you 're targeting and other factors to offer the designer a clear idea of how to maximize conversions and CTR . <p> So , here 's an example of being vague : <p> " I 'd like to promote this dating offer , here 's the offer URL . Please create a high converting landing page that matches the offer . " <p> Finch : Have you hacked in to my sent messages ? This is uncanny . <p> While this would n't result in a complete travesty , it would result in a very generalized result since you failed to offer any specific taglines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area for geo-targeting , I 'd like to target ages 40 and older , etc . ) <p> Now , let 's look at an example of how to properly convey an idea . Well stick with a dating niche : <p> " I 'd like to promote this dating offer to black males , and I 'm targeting ages 30+ . After researching , I 've noticed images with older women seem to convert better , so Ive attached the images I 'd like to use . I also have included the code for a geo-tracking script I 'd like to use , which should be easy for me to adjust . The color scheme should be light and should match the offer page with blue as the base color . All text should be editable in HTML so I can test different terms . " <p> See the difference ? This was only a generalized example of how specifics can really change the outcome of a page . Depending on the designer , had age range or specifics not been mentioned , you may have received a layout with stock photos that end up looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geotracking script up front , you may have received a layout where adding it as an afterthought would offset the whole design . <p> There are ways to even go further beyond , such as offering a wireframe , specific examples , etc . Designers should be thought partially as an extension of yourself , to be used to bring your idea to fruition . <h> Come Prepared <p> Now that we 've been through how important it is to be specific about what you want , well go through the steps you shouldve taken before ordering . <p> 1 . First , do some research . Try to figure out which pages are converting . If you see ads for a long time for a specific offer or page , you can assume its doing ok , otherwise money would n't be wasted on testing it any longer . Make a list of pages you think are doing well , and/or build your own wireframe from certain elements of each page for the designer . <p> 2 . Decide on the specifics , from color scheme , to taglines and copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to think up those winning taglines that ensure the offer or product is going to sell . <p> Now , depending on the designer , there will be a varying level of affiliate marketing knowledge , so it does n't  hurt to ask for advice , but it would be foolish to rely completely on a designer because you have then forfeited control over your potential success or failure . Even when starting out , you need to trust yourself with thinking up ways of selling your offer or else you 'll never learn what works and what does n't  . <p> 3 . Provide as much as you can . Design is based partially on personal taste . What you think is a good image to use , may vary from what the hired designer thinks is good . With that said , you should certainly include as much as you can in terms of logos , stock photos , etc . This will ensure that your design uses as many elements to your liking as possible . <p> 4 . Be positive about your offer . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting offer . When it comes time to order a landing page , for example , you 'll want to ensure you get the most bang for your buck . That means if you hire a designer to make a design that is tailored specifically for an offer that does n't  end up converting , youve just lost not only the funding spent on testing but also the cost of the design . Sometimes you 'll have a landing page with a great CTR but if the actual offer does n't  convert , it means nothing , so be sure . <h> Finally , its time to order ! <p> Once you 've gotten all your info together , its time to get the ball rolling . I 'd say its pretty much down hill from here ( we hope ) , but let 's go over a few things to keep in mind during the actual process of having a design put together . <p> Have a good attitude . If the roles were reversed , how would you feel having to deal with someone that easily gets frustrated and offers rude responses instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the job done as fast as possible with little to no consideration for detail or going that extra mile to please someone that was respectful and well mannered . <p> Sometimes coming up with a winning design can be a frustrating process , but there are worse things in life , so take a deep breath and keep your composure so you can focus on success , rather than risking arguing that will ultimately only result in a waste of time . <p> Offer constructive criticism . Sometimes I 'll get a response that 's simply , " No , sorry , I do n't  like this . " That does nothing to help either one of us . An example of what DOES help , would be something like , " I 'd like the blue header to be red , the text to be a little smaller , and I 'd like you to use this image instead . " Basically , be specific about what you do n't  like , rather than lazily responding under the assumption that the next revision will miraculously be the design of your dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the designer is even capable of doing something close to what you have in mind . In the case of them possessing the skills but not having a solid understanding of your specific idea , take a time out and draw up a wire frame or find an example that 's 80-90% of what you have in mind . We designers are visual people , so a picture is worth a thousand words whereas an attempt at articulating your idea in an email may end up being worth only a misunderstanding . <p> Work towards functionality , not eye candy . I 'm not saying you want a design that was sloppily thrown together , but its important to always keep your eye on the prize , which is conversions . <p> As a designer I 'll come across an affiliate that 's more interested in having something that " looks nice " rather than something that " performs nice " . New affiliates would be surprised to see some of the pages that actually convert amazingly . If those pages were judged by their design , they would be among the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The reason behind this is the fact that the average consumer has absolutely no concept of what good design looks like and only looks at a landing page in the most simplistic of ways . Keep yourself inside of your targeted consumers mind while working with a designer . A 50 year old consumer is going to interpret a design in a much different way than an 18 year old . <p> So there you have it . Before you risk wasting money on hiring a designer , work on making sure you 'll get the most out of your money while avoiding a nightmarish experience . I hope this will help you avoid wasting your money and time .

@@106277846 @1677846/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I 'm hoping to build a large enough safety net to do affiliate marketing full-time from October . Are there any steps youd recommend for building good routines ? <h> Managing Campaigns &amp; Time <p> Full-time affiliate marketing is the same as part-time affiliate marketing . <p> You only need an hour to do it well . <p> The biggest difference in going full-time is that you can afford to work on other projects , those in the real world . <p> I think this is good for your hairline . It takes the pressure away from belonging to an industry that is forever being handed the last rites . <p> Even if your one motivation is to become a successful affiliate marketer , I would not recommend creating campaigns from 9 to 5 . You 'll go broke fast . <p> This was drummed in to my head quite recently by a realisation that I 've wasted half my career to date . Thank god Im 25 . <h> Choosing Your Battles <p> A few weeks ago , I 'd wake up , check my stats and one campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dedicated my left ball to this campaign . Crafting the angle , honing the ads and even meddling with JavaScript . It felt like my baby . <p> But it was only breaking even . <p> I was spending $400 on this campaign every day . Some days it would edge to a slight profit , others it would dip to a loss . But every morning I would wake up expecting my most recent changes to have launched it out the ballpark . <p> And they never did . <p> Eventually , I gave it the finger . <p> The irony is that no sooner had I stopped wasting time on this ground zero campaign , my energy shifted to another . <p> This second campaign was in a similar situation ; roughly $300/day spend , but with a profit of $100-$120 . <p> I had ignored it because it was profitable . Worry too much about diversification and you 'll commit this sin too . <p> One late night brainfart inspired me to apply one of the landing pages that I 'd tested on my failed break-even campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have a campaign or a website that is doing well , make it do better before you think about creating something else . <p> I 've stopped spending thousands of dollars on campaigns that are break even or a marginal success . I prefer to bring excellence to the increasingly rare handful that benefit from the optimisation . <p> In short , do n't  run too many campaigns . <p> There are some campaigns that I have documented in my Premium Post series which , while helpful to the reader , will never be on my agenda . I do n't  have the time or resources to focus on $20/day campaigns . <p> So , here 's a simple task . <p> Assume you have one hour today to work on the campaign that 's going to pay your bills for the rest of the year . <p> What will you work on ? <p> There is no difference between part-time and full-time affiliate marketing . This answer should always be the same . <p> I believe in Parkinsons law . Work expands to fill the time you have available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainable with the rest of the day . <h> Establishing Routines <p> My day is split in two halves : <p> The morning spent analysing data and planning . <p> The afternoon spent acting on data and creating . <p> Before I start work , usually around 9am , I will traipse to the local petrol station and fill up on Costa Express . Its a habit my girlfriend has used to draw comparisons with Alan Partridge ; a massive compliment , and a man whose sweaters I would die for . <p> My morning is rarely as creative as the night before . <p> Its tough to be creative when your last great idea is still simmering in flames . <p> I prefer to analyse data without jumping to conclusions , safe in the knowledge that damn near every traffic source I work with is fast asleep and unable to approve my ads until the sun rises across the pond . <p> The rest of the day is a blur of frantic creation , lots of writing , lots of Photoshop , and lots of Skyping . <p> Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that you talk to your affiliate managers before launching a campaign , any campaign . Make it a routine . <p> I 'm quite blunt with a four step assault : <p> 1 . What 's your top performing offer , by EPC in country ? 2 . And its top performing landing page ? 3 . What 's your second top performing offer , by EPC in country ? 4 . And its top performing landing page ? <p> Followed by a thank you , followed by silence , followed by split testing . <p> I do n't  like small talk . <p> I will sometimes regret finishing work if my whiteboard is clean before 9pm . <p> On these rare lonely nights , I 'll read ( at least three books per week ) , watch television , fight the crickets , before eventually slipping back in to my office with an idea that sounds better than it did at lunch . <h> Data Routines <p> For somebody who prefers to work with words , it disappoints me that so much of my day is spent buried in numbers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going bloody insane from them . <p> Launching a successful affiliate campaign is less about creativity ; more about patience with numbers . <p> I know this sounds like a bloodbath , but if you cant calculate where the numbers are likely to work in your favour , you 'll be broke before lunch . <p> So if there 's one routine you 'll do well to adopt , its placing trust in your stats and data . <p> Check out Premium Posts Volume X.

@@106277847 @1677847/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> What 's the difference between a campaign that prospers for months , and a campaign that crashes and burns in 36 hours ? Its normally a source of renewable traffic . <p> A renewable traffic source can be trusted to produce leads and sales consistently on auto-pilot . Its like the wind turbine of affiliate marketing . Slow , ugly , and certainly not glamorous , but future-proof . <p> There are n't  many wind turbines left in affiliate marketing . <p> Google AdWords remains perhaps the greatest renewable traffic source of them all but its out of bounds for most CPA marketers . If we are to drag fresh eyeballs to our affiliate campaigns via Google , we typically have to engage in SEO warfare . <p> AdWords arbitrage was the perfect example of renewable traffic . A campaign could be launched on Day 1 , optimised by Day 2 , and still be profitable on Day 365 . A good days work went a very long way on Google , and it still does , just not for the majority of scumbags like us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Plentyoffish are quite the opposite of future-proof turbines . You can make good money , but in doing so you 'll often feel like Guybrush Threepwood , sprinting from the hounds , having just pillaged a barrel of limited-supply oil . <p> Profit exists , but its usually achieved with smash-and-grab marketing . <p> Facebook and Plentyoffish , in the literal sense , are renewable traffic sources . Each site is growing at a rapid rate , and with that growth comes new users to advertise to . However , reaching them is not always easy . Perhaps more importantly , affiliates do n't  seem to care about finding those fresh eyeballs . <p> They focus on monetizing the traffic source , without factoring in the supply of new traffic , which inevitably leads to questions like <p> " Why do my campaigns fizzle out so quickly ? " " I was profitable for 2 days and then the ROI nose-dived . What happened ? " <p> Sustainability is achievable with careful planning . It just requires that you launch campaigns with a plan for Day 10 , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  fool yourself in to thinking your big break will come when you start making $500/day for all of about 36 hours . <p> Let 's take Plentyoffish as an example . <p> Why do Plentyoffish campaigns crash and burn so rapidly ? <p> Its normally because affiliates sacrifice volume for super targeted campaigns , or because they go broad without having a plan for keeping the campaign fresh . <p> Example : <p> What 's wrong with the long-term potential of a campaign that has 3 banners and targeting like this ? <p> There 's one big problem : inevitable banner blindness . <p> Where is the new supply of traffic ? Targeting all users under 600 logins will only be effective if you introduce a staggered approach to your creatives , which is something that I wrote about extensively in Premium Posts Volume 1 . <p> Run this shit for more than 48 hours and what 's going to happen ? Maybe you 'll score a profit in the first 24 hours ( if you 're lucky ) , but sooner or later , users are going to grow sick of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . Plentyoffish is a big traffic source , but its not that big . The slew of new Jewish females aged 25-35 cant possibly keep up with the rush of new advertisers looking to make money from them . To have any hope of profiting over the long term , you need to have a structured campaign . <p> here 's how you might sustain the example above with minimal ROI degradation : <p> Day 1 : <p> Active Banners : A , B and C. <p> Day 2 : <p> Active Banners : A , B and C. <p> Day 3 : <p> Active Banners : D , E and F. <p> Day 4 : <p> Active Banners : D , E and F. <p> You have four variations of the same campaign , each targeting different mini-demographics , or using new banners to keep the campaign fresh . You will lose volume , but you 'll gain stability and a cycle of profitability that lasts much longer . <p> Alternatively , you can focus your campaigns on targeting only the the newest members , so the ads should always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your login count to below 50 and your ads will be reserved for the new fish . <p> This is how you turn limited reserves of traffic in to renewable traffic . Instead of pillaging a barrel of oil from a limited reservoir , you 're building a boring wind turbine letting it accumulate profit over time and moving on to the next one . <p> Facebook campaigns can be broken in to Group of States A and Group of States B. <p> Instead of targeting by country , you select 25 states in each campaign and rotate them through alternate days . You can then duplicate your 6 best ads so that half show on Day 1 , and the others on Day 2 . Mix and match as you go forward . You should see a dramatic reduction in the wear and tear on your CTR . <p> When advertising via PPV , the frequency cap is similarly important . I set it as low as possible , to the point where a user might only see an advert once every 4 weeks . This can deep-throat the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability . My hairline thanks me , and yours should too . <p> Eh , only kidding . I 'm going bald . <p> Focusing your efforts on renewable traffic sources is the best way to avoid Monday mornings where last weeks work is staring at you from the bottom of the trash can . There 's nothing I find more de-motivating than busting my arse on campaigns that have a shelf life of 2 days . <p> Unless those days are generating floods of traffic and majestic profit , they are days wasted . Its not worth breaking your back to get a campaign profitable if the foundations are likely to be torn up overnight . Its fucking sandcastle economics .

@@106277848 @1677848/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Last week , my girlfriend shared a theory with me that , I have to admit , I was pretty skeptical about at first . She runs a fashion blog so Internet Marketing is something we have in common . Its not simply a topic I inflict on her over the breakfast buffet here in Bangkok . <p> The theory is simple . Any artist or creative person who has 1000 true fans , has the means to make a living . When you first hear that , it sounds like quite a flimsy theory . Then you remember that your judgment is probably misguided by the poor schmuck you saw selling Facebook fan page " likes " the day before . <p> True fans , in the blogging world , are those who will listen to your recommendations whether you get paid for them or not . Those who will praise you when you offer nothing that has n't  been read a thousand times before . Those who give enough of a shit to retweet your " New post ! " and add you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come by . <p> But with an army of 1000 true fans , its quite easy to see how a blogger could make a living from his craft . As this article on the Technium points out , the numbers are stacked in your favour . <p> If you could convince each of those fans to spend just $100 over the course of a year , you 'd have a total annual salary of $100,000 . That 's discounting the influence of your outer network . True fans are likely to recommend your blog to other readers who share mutual interests , if not always in the exact niche market you 're targeting . This dominos effect completely kills the pain and boredom of link building or marketing your site . Why bother when true fans can handle that for you ? <p> More to the point , what good are 1000 search engine hits if you cant retain a single user and find yourself forever optimizing for the next ? The best way to build an online asset is to develop relationships and acquire fans . SEO can bring you traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything you do . <p> Okay , so lots of fans can equal earning opportunities . But how do you actually gain fans ? That 's the problem for most bloggers , nevermind the theory itself . How do you get somebody to read your meandering shit and actually come back for more ? <p> I think most blogs fail because they forget the vital ingredient that distinguishes a voice from the crowd personality . The worst crime you can possibly commit , as a blogger , is to take the center ground . If you do n't  have opinions , you become a news source . And if you compete with news sources , you 're instantly outnumbered and outgunned . <p> Oscar Wildes famous words , " The first duty in life is to assume a pose " should be nailed on the dashboard of any self-respecting blogger who hopes for his ramble to be read . It does n't  matter what pose you assume . You could be an offensive and controversial shit-stirrer in your niche . A deluded but always sweet source of encouragement . Christ , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose of " guru " ( with varying degrees of success ) . <p> But to have no pose , no unique appeal and no committed voiceyoure sacrificing the very essence of any successful blog . It does n't  matter if you 're right or wrong . Most people are too dumb to care . <p> Do you think Pitchfork cares about counter arguments ? I 'm guessing when their editors sat down to create a business plan , they had the worlds most effective brainstorming session on " How can we be the BEST collective of pretentious Indie-hugging snobs on the planet ? " Okay , probably not . That 's just my negative perception . But every negative has a flip-side . And to the Indie-hugging snobs out there , Pitchfork is the be all and end all of latest music news . <p> How about Nickelback ? Nobody loves Nickelback . Never has a band stuck so doggedly to the middle ground and succeeded in sounding so unmistakeably shite . Do you want your blog to be like Nickelback ? <p> Assume a pose , and let people judge you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you polarize opinions along the way , you 're probably doing a good job of avoiding the middle ground . The great freedom of blogging is that we have no obligation to report the truth . Invariably , the truth sucks . If people want the facts , they go to Wikipedia . For everything else , they 're fair game to your creative license . <p> So as you sit at your desk and ponder what to publish next , I would suggest you chuck those imaginary editor guidelines out of the window . You 're probably not qualified enough to merit any . And youre not writing for a magazine . You can afford to be as wild and creative as your WordPress allows . <p> A pussy-footing attitude to blogging defeats the bloody purpose , does it not ? So mark your ground , fly your colours and wait for fans to find you . When they do , theyll either love or hate what you have to say . But its much better than being ignored . Only a complete tool writes to be ignored . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour by simply retweeting this post or recommending it on whatever hellhole of a social networking joint you use . Every little help is appreciated ! 114272 @qwx974272 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Both are worth reading if you are considering adopting 1000 true fans as a metric of anything . I think the problem with " 1000 True Fans , " is that the word " fan " has gotten watered down to a click of a button on facebook . It is a sterile , virtually meaningless action with no feeling behind it . A more accurate name for the theory should probably be " 1000 dedicated customers " people who will show you their " kindness " with their dollars ( or pounds , or yen or ivory tusks , if that 's your cup ) . <p> 1000 dedicated customers , on the other hand , is not just something discussed in airy-fairy hypothetical land , its discussed in very concrete terms by David Heinmer Hanson of 37 Signals ( grand daddy of the web app revolution , for those who do n't  know ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who will pay you $40/month , you 're making $960,000/year ( $1MM ) . I 'm not saying its easy to do , but when you run the numbers that way , its not *that* hard to make a million bucks . <p> Granted , most artists/creatives are n't  going to make anything worth $40/mo ( although I STRONGLY encourage you to try ! ) , but if people really " love " you , maybe theyll become your patrons at $5 a month . Or even $1/mo . Bloggers can run similar numbers based on predicted average adsense/ affiliate commissions per subscriber per year . The only downside of this model vs a subscription model is that there is a ton more volatility , but theoretically potential higher payouts too if you 're really good at getting people click your ads &amp; buy your berries . <p> When you start to break it down this way , building a " distributed salary " is n't so unrealistic , but its tough . One of the things mentioned in the original " Case Against 1000 Fans " is that cultivating a strong relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most devoted artists/creatives do n't  have the time/resources to work on their craft as well as the fan management . This becomes SUBSTANTIALLY easier for business people and people blogging about business related things , because relationship cultivation *is* an inherent part of what you do anyway ( assuming you do market yourself at all ) . <p> Anyway , rant over . Just some things to consider as this theory caught my attention a few years back and its something I think back to from time to time . <p> P.S. SEO most definitely is a long term asset . Just because it does n't  guarantee return visitors , unlike facebook where demographic X is pretty much unchanging and you can reach " saturation , " search does n't  really have saturation . The people searching for " salmon recipes " today are not the same ones a month from now , nor a year from now . So as long as you 're not ranking for passing fads , but for evergreen terms , it is most definitely a long term asset . <p> All good points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na take a peek at that . <p> The reason I do n't  see SEO as a long term asset is simply because it can never be " set and forget " , and you can never guarantee your #1 ranking in somebody elses system . The only thing we know for sure about the search engine algorithms is that they WILL change over time . Google is never more than one switch away from removing a site completely . <p> Yes , I agree that people will always be searching for information . But there 's no guarantee the backlinks you created in 2009 will be good enough to keep your website ranking for them . <p> I totally understand where you 're coming from , but by your same logic , a blog/email list is the furthest thing from " set and forget . " A well known niche blogger in 2009 may become a relatively obscure one in 2011 if he decides to take a break or does n't  keep up with the times . I think an argument can be made that a blog is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the niche . Can you imagine if a mobile blogger ( meaning someone who writes about mobile technology , not someone who writes a blog from a phone ) took a break for 6 months ? Theyd be as relevant as the dark ages upon return . <p> Search engines also are n't  that mystically unpredictable either . Especially if you have a legitimate site and a solid strategy , you should be able to secure rankings for fairly long periods of time . <p> I guess it comes down to that fact that " set it and forget it " marketing is a pipe-dream . Its probably the reason that a lot of arbitrage marketers eventually turn to paid traffic instead of organic they know they 're going to be putting in the hours to see volume one way or another , might as well increase the value of your time and get the money today instead of a year from now . <p> I think social assets ( lists/subscribers ) are valuable , as are search ones . Both require some amount of upkeep at semi-regular intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blog and then abandon it for six months , there 's a good chance your content will no longer be relevant by the time you return . But at least that fate is in your hands . Somebody who is serious about running a business is n't going to abandon it at the drop of a hat . And if they do , they deserved to fail . <p> By " set and forget " , I 'm not suggesting any business can survive without attention and upkeep . What I mean is that its simply not possible to create an article with the intention of ranking 1st for " keyword x " , then forget about it , and expect to still be ranked the same in the future . <p> Competition is going to get fiercer and fiercer and fiercer . But while we can predict the next algorithm changes , we still do n't  have control of the magic button that keeps our website on the first page . So while SEO can provide long term results , I still ca n't look at it as an actual long term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if they can be total bitches to their paying customers on Adwords , I have no doubt they can be just as clinical with their natural search results in the future . <p> The way I see it , only one person can rank #1 for any given term . While there 's a lot of traffic up for grabs in many of the positions below that , I do n't  see much fun in competing with all my rivals . Especially in a game that rarely involves what I do best ( posting random shit without sparing a thought for the big G ) <p> My affiliate marketing blog only draws something like 4% of its traffic from Google . I know that 's an extreme scenario , but I feel much more secure knowing that the traffic is coming , and I only need to worry about how to keep people checking back . <p> Great read as always.I have to side with Finch here and join the ranks of the SEO haters.First I dislike the idea of putting a shit ton of hours on a pointless endeavor.Second and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results to my target audience.All this just so the big G can come back a few months later and stick in the big D up your buttocks . Good useful articles and paid traffic , eff the world . <p> Finch I read this article a few days ago , and your comments about finding your voice really struck with me . You hit the nail on the head , I ****ing hate Nickelback . <p> However , I 've noticed that trying to find your voice takes time . <p> I 've studied a few bloggers and video bloggers that I enjoy ( and who are extremely successful at what they do ) and they have a ton of personality and are n't  afraid to make their sometimes controversial opinions very obvious . Its interesting to watch/read their earlier stuff when they were just starting out because you can see exactly how far they have come in discovering their voice and becoming unique and iconic in their respective niches . Its a message that has n't  fallen on deaf ears ( for me at least ) and it will be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Damn Finch , this is not the first time you blog what I think , but in a much more eloquent way . The thing about having a blogging voice/personality particularly resonates with me , possibly because your writing voice is rather distinct .. witty , sarcastic , easily annoyed at times and recognizably British . <p> Very inspiring post Finch ! Being able to express your opinion and branding yourself on the web is really important . Once you can get 1,000 raving fans spending at least $100 on average each year , so to speak , then you definitely onto to something as a blogger ! I love your style of writing mate and keep at it ! <p> The figure does matter but what is more important is the quality . There is a difference between true fans and followers who show up today and vanishes the next day . 1000 true fans can transform our business to great heights of success . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277849 @1677849/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> The last TV series that had me hooked was The Wire , which is widely regarded as one of the most badass pieces of entertainment ever committed to tape . Its three years since I finished watching that show , and its taken until now for another to come along that would impress me in the same way . <p> That show is Mad Men ; a sickly stylish throwback to the sleaze of Madison Avenue in the 1960s . <p> Mad Men centers around an advertising agency , Sterling &amp; Cooper , in an era where smoking , drinking and public displays of chauvinism come as par for the course . <p> Don Draper is the man at the center of it all . He s a creative genius , father of two and betrayer of many . Draper is the sort of fucked up anti-hero that our generation of young affiliates aspire to become . He bedazzles clients with the perfect blend of smooth talk and marketing intellect . <p> When we announce that were affiliate marketers to the world , he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quiet authority who could sell a man his own moustache . Draper is painted in various shades of grey ; a multi-layered character for the show to orbit around . He s backed by an awesome and versatile supporting cast , including some of the sexiest women on television . I cant deny it , there 's just something about the sixties . <p> Mad Men is a tour de force in persuasion tactics from an era gone-by , but its also much more . Its an excellent cultural reference to the sixties where sexism , racism and prejudice cast a decidedly negative light on the decade we now glorify for its hard partying and pop legacy . <p> The show starts with Draper in a headspin , trying to find a way to re-brand cigarettes . Recent revelations have linked smoking to cancer , and the FTC has its boot on the throat of any tobacco seller who begs to differ . I 'm sure many affiliates will be sympathetic of the predicament , as will anybody who has ever had to deal with a stuck-in-the-old-ways client . <p> here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chord with many in our industry : <p> Every scene is beautifully shot and the storylines are brought to the boil slowly in a manner that rewards attentive viewing . The story is often told through subtle nods rather than blowout cliffhangers . Its certainly no Prison Break in that sense . <p> I loved The Wire for its glorification of the ordinary and the richness of the characters . No good was without fault , and no bad was totally irredeemable . The characters in Mad Men are portrayed in the same light ; the detail hidden in brief flashes of dialogue that most shows simply would n't trust the viewer to digest . <p> Admittedly , the show has a polarizing effect . I 've spoken to people who could n't get in to it , despite working in advertising for much of their careers . I would call it a slow burner , but I think the writing is comfortably strong enough to justify the leisurely pacing . You 'll either love it or you wo n't . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277850 @1677850/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Its now 18 months since I quit my day job . I guess the cliche thing to say would be that it feels like only yesterday . Well it does n't  . All those vivid memories of clearing my office desk , elbowing a small mountain of coffee cups in to the trash , and setting off to live the dream . They 're pretty distant to say the least . <p> Its hard to explain the things that go through your mind when you say goodbye and take your final commute home from the day job you hope you 'll never have to live again . Its a combination of optimism , luxury and in my case , at the time a slightly paralyzing fear of " Oh shit , did I just quit my job in a recession ? " <p> For those of you striving to make that dream a reality , I wont shit on your parade . The first few weeks of rolling out of bed and being your own boss are like a paradise . But if you 've been following this blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been one to hold back from posting about the downsides . <p> But then , I 've been facing several battles with myself that probably neutered any sense of reality . Most people would drop their day jobs in a second to have this luxury . And its something that I 'm slowly starting to appreciate after the post-novelty trauma of adapting to working from home . <p> The most important lesson I 've learnt so far is the importance of establishing relationships in an industry where trust and respectability are hard to come by . There 's always the temptation to become a profit scalping recluse . The kind of bastard who moves from pseudonym to pseudonym just to survive on the traffic sources that want him banned for life , only to pop up on WickedFire every now and then asking " How can I get a new Adwords account ? " <p> This is the kind of bridge burning that can cost an affiliate dearly . And its the type of relationship that I showed no respect for whatsoever in my early days . When I entered the industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine TOS guidelines I broke , or how many people I mislead with morally dubious advertisements . And its through a minor miracle , and some extremely exhaustive processes , that I can sit here and say that I still have access to every ad platform I might need in the future . <p> Other affiliates are n't  so lucky . Many are banned from Google , while a who 's who list of ballers are indefinitely exiled from Facebook . And even though last years profits might suggest it was worth it while it lasted , I would beg to differ . If you continuously exploit your relationships with these traffic sources , you 're inadvertently placing a clenched fist up your own arsehole . I promise you , one morning it will begin to hurt . <p> There is so much more value to coexisting with the Facebooks and Googles of this world , rather than forever ducking from their crosshairs . Are you happy to spend the rest of your days wincing whenever your Gmail shows a ( 1 ) because you know you 've been a naughty boy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument " Hey ! Its easy to get back on traffic sources even if I 'm banned for life ! Theyll never catch me with my mums credit card , right ? Wan na see how Gerard got ripped in 300 ? " <p> Well , yeah , I guess its easy to tell a girl you love her and then screw her over again . Sooner or later she 's gon na tear off your balls for going to the well too many times . You should n't keep fucking with Facebook or Googles little heartstrings . As impetuous as they may seem , your efforts are probably better spent holding hands and taking the next guideline changes with a sour lemon face but a long term vision . Its better to be with than without where traffic sources are concerned . <p> At some point in the last 18 months , I started looking at my work as a business rather than a money making scheme . A different attitude is required to each . And I 'm not saying you should agree with my own decisions , because some people ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes with the average Internet Marketer and it dawns on me how those of us who are actually here to build a business are the grand fucking minority . Its an industry dominated by retards chasing a dream . <p> I 've picked up certain tricks and exploits that could have netted me an absolute fortune in this last year . But they compromise my relationships with networks , traffic sources , advertisers , and the people whod be reading my ads . If I was running a money making scheme , I probably would n't give a shit . But I 'm trying to build a business , so Ive learnt to think differently . Its just not worth getting greedy and burning your bridges . <p> I 'm actually really excited about the next 18 months , thanks to the pursuit of some new projects that I genuinely believe in . In drawing up my business plans , its dawned on me the true value in having traffic sources like Google and Facebook at my disposal . I 'm lucky to still have that luxury , and I 'd be getting my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're going to burn your bridges , make sure you bank a hell of a lot of money to justify the sacrifice .

My work is nice though because its 2k a month and right behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I complete all my work tasks . <p> Anyway I have n't burned any bridges so far not planning on doing any PPC with google as an affiliate . Gon na save that for later when I start a real longterm business . For now its just messing around with social ads and PPV . <p> Appreciate this post , and your candour on the negative sides of being your own boss . I 'm taking the leap this year ( will be handing in my resignation on 1st Nov ) to go full time . Commuting in to Reading each week sucks ( not as bad as Slough , but its still not on my top 10 places to work ) , and the politics of the workplace are a drag . <p> So , come 1st Feb 2011 ( 3 months notice to work , bugger ) I 'll be my own man . Will probably be hitting you up for moral support and general chit chat . <p> So true about not burning bridges same in any industry though . I work in telecoms , and its so incestuous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and call our mums our sisters <p> I do n't  mean to sound like an ass but teach your girlfriend better seo , stuff she does in comments is no good = Great article btw , I had my account banned on AdWords once but I am back on there with my own name and my own credit card . The only thing I cant get back to is AdSense , I was banned from there when I was 16 years old and did n't  know shit , but I guess its good because I would probably never move to more advanced monetization and still had those lousy adsense checks . <p> @Pavel Haha I was the one who told her to start commenting on blogs . From my experience , blog comments are only going to help your SEO efforts . And its important for building a brand , although she 's got high hopes if she wants to develop a fashion brand on a bunch of affiliate scumbags like us = <p> @Ste Good luck chasing that dream . But it does n't  change my opinion that only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hobby in to a full time business . Its not easy . I hope it works out for you one way or another . <p> @Finch irrelevant nofollow links wont help her much , get her scraper and teach how to find relevant and indexed entries . and do n't  put many different anchors to the same destination its also useless . = <p> Enjoyed this article , Finch . Thanks for being honest and realistic about everything . It helps those of us ( like me ) looking to make affiliate marketing a full time gig keep our expectations in check . <p> Like you , Im amazed at how short sighted many affiliate marketers who have had some success early on can be . The girlfriend analogy was spot on . In a year or two I bet there will be a lot of people back at an 8 to 5 with a bunch of regrets because they exacerbated their Big G bans by using the name and credit card of every friend and relative that would trust them trying to squeeze every last conversion out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can definitely be a blessing to long sighted and a curse to the short sighted . I do n't  care what you 're doing , $15/hr wont compare to the 24/7 income they took for granted . <p> Hey Finch You hit on a real key to long-term success in affiliate marketing . Thinking about it as your business , rather than just a way you make money each day . It may not seem like a big deal , but that mindset switch does get you thinking about building long lasting partnerships , creating marketing assets , and other initiatives that will help you grow your business and make even more money down the road . <p> @Pavel Its all about the volume and the linking scheme you have in place . From what Ive seen with my own link-building efforts , a shit load of no-follow links can be extremely effective . Regardless of the principle behind " nofollow " . <p> its great that more affiliates are talking about a sustainable business model instead of the quick buck ; I definitely agree that many currently work in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if you are doing this for the longterm , fulltime . <p> @Ernie if you jump to conclusions after seeing a 1 year old banner on my god forgotten blog is going to give you all the information on me then you certainly have a problem with perception reality . I bet you my sweet ass that your website wont get decent ranking in a few years without consistent high quality links . Really what is you niche ? Rubber ducks ? You wo n't stand a chance with massive no-follow blog comments or forum postings or whatever the fuck you use ( scrapebox , xrumer , own shit ) in self respecting long-term niches like hosting , mortgage or real estate . And until you prove me wrong shut the fuck up . Arguing on the internet is not going to bring anyone to truth especially when it comes to seo , but insulting me because I told that making 4 anchor nofollow links to the same url from irrelevant page is not going to do the girl any good . If I noticed her links on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it looks like this is the only place she will get this kind of link especially if she will leave comments like that . <p> @Pavel Go back and read her comment . Its obviously tongue in cheek . I 'm pretty sure she knows leaving a single jokey comment on my blog is n't going to boost her rankings through the roof . She left that comment because wed had a conversation earlier in the day where I 'd told her about my own experiences of blog commenting being very effective for improving rankings ( and marketing in general ) . <p> Nobodys going to argue that the comment above is unlikely to change much . But if you 're saying that blog commenting in general is n't effective , I 'd have to disagree strongly . <p> There are guys out there spending thousands of dollars on this kind of link building and the fact that they 're still spending the money would tend to suggest that they 're doing okay for themselves <p> @Finch there I go again , I said that irrelevant links like that wont help her much . As for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it also looks like mockery if it was left by suspecting person , but her comment looks like she is over-impressed by the whole concept of anchor text . Also keywords she uses are not that lucrative in the first place and her blog is not even optimized for those . <p> When doing seo you either have to provide shitload of good and unique content to attract long-tail keywords and " word of mouth " links from other webmasters and social media ( what you are doing with this blog ) or you need to take linking matter in your own hands , choose keywords , look where does competition get their links and do the same kind of linking but on a bigger scale . <p> What our ernie the thousand dollar man is doing ( with his irrelevant nofollow links ) works just because other sites in serps are there either by accident or are simply doing the same thing , because no self-respecting person would want to sell rubber ducks , only spammers . <p> Everything depends on what the competition in your niche is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand that , just google some viagra keywords and see how people are getting their rank there . <p> Again I do n't  want to offend anyone here , especially you Finch , because I like to read your entries . But sometimes people just get too cocky ( ernie ) once they start to get more money than they have seen in their life by selling penis enlargement pills and think that something ( nofollow links i.e. spam ) is answers to anything ( rankings on rubber duck seprs i.e. THOUSANDS A MONTH ! ! ! wow ) . <p> I have spent a lot of time looking at serps of highly lucrative keywords ( hosting , real estate , viagra etc. ) which are populated by online , offline businesses and spammers and can say that there is no universal answer on what links you need to climb on top of the results , but you are always better off doing same as competition but in bigger volumes . <p> Interesting discussion going on . Pavel raised some great points here on seo . Have to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in top serps for established competitive keywords . <p> I 'm definitely not going to dispute the importance of " authority links " . If you check the previous post , it was an entire rant about the subject . <p> But I think the guy who focuses only on authority link building is just as likely to be out-ranked as the guy who focuses only on high volume lower quality links . <p> One of Pavels points I did agree with was that its always more effective to do everything your competition is doing and then more . And that speaks for itself . I think the most effective kind of SEO is a blend of both worlds . <p> I enjoyed reading the article and agree that quality is important in the affiliate space . It will definitely pay out in the end and surely working together with the networks , affiliate programs etc. ( instead of working again them ) will get you much further . <p> Quick wins can only get so big Long term positives can grow a lot bigger and repeat for a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark side to learn the line = keep posting man , its good to read reassuring shit in the AM . <p> Great penmanship ! I really enjoyed reading how you quit your dayjob and started living entreprenial lifestyle . I felt pretty much the same when I left my job . One morning I was sitting in one of those LONG ... During the meeting realized its time to resign , and the next day I left the building last time . Man , it felt so good .. = <p> Leaving your job to do afilliate marketing ! I left my job in May 2010 . I was earning 50K with one of the major UK energy companies . I just had enough of my job and decided to give advice on switching suppliers through the internet . Oops , I did n't  do enough research . It was later , that I discovered only 13% of the UK population regularly switched Their supplier through the internet . I ended up having to add other products to my site . I did n't  even know what afilliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement with one of the energy comparison sites . To my great dismay , I struggled for the first so many months , and its only now that I am receiving regular income . I still have a long way to go and a lot to learn . I am ranked highly for energy products , but I suspect most of the queries are coming from People who have already done a comparison and looking for a second opinion . I reckon most of these People just go back to the origin of Their comparison and switch there ! I would n't recommend anyone to pack Their job in to do this , but start on a part time basis . I was lucky that I had some money to start with , but that quickly diminished ! <p> It really takes a lot of patience to succeed in this industry and sometimes you have to take risks such as quitting your job to have more time to work online . I quit my job and there is no guarantee that I can make it in this business but and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will work hard because I wo n't entertain failure . <p> i think the only reason why affiliates get into doing blackhat is that its easy money .. much easier then busting your gut along the straight and narrow path . the dark side is always tempting for those with a high appitite for risk . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277851 @1677851/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> How many affiliates have dared to count the minutes wasted in an average day ? We 've all experienced the hours spent waiting on ad approvals , offer activations , replies from overloaded account managers and the tedious matter of data accumulation . <p> A huge percentage of our working day is spent playing the waiting game . Its one of the reasons the many Internet Marketing forums maintain such active communities , and why blogs such as mine retain a readership . Most of you are waiting for something to happen . <p> Black Hole Days , as I like to call them , are those where our productivity is stamped in to the ground . Where our goals are left at the mercy of somebody on the other side of the world deciding that an email or campaign is important enough to address . Such days are , thankfully , perfectly avoidable . But you 'll need to bagsy a lot of self-discipline along the way . <p> One of the many reasons that convinced me to move my efforts from SEO to paid traffic campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEO is a messy business , full of relative variables , and a lot of donkey work . Its easy to spend your 9-5 staying busy when there are more links to be had , and more articles to be written . <p> However , buying traffic and setting up arbitrage affiliate campaigns is something that can be achieved in the space of a morning . It can be done at a leisurely pace in your local coffee shop , so long as you find the seat where your fucked up dating imagery is shielded from the public eye . <p> Its this lackadaisical approach to work that appealed to me while I was still in full-time employment . Yet , what they do n't  tell you about making the jump from part-time to full-time affiliate is that nothing changes . Absolutely nothing . <p> The tasks simply expand to take up more of your time , and so you spunk more and more bandwidth on the chore of refreshing stats . Most of your work can be ticked off in two hours if you truly buckle down . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blog regularly given the vast number of campaigns I seem to be running . Well , for one , the number of campaigns is probably much smaller than you think . And secondly , what else am I going to do ? It takes 20 minutes to set up a campaign , and 2 minutes to check whether its a resounding success . <p> If we push ourselves , we can burn extra energy sending emails back and forth to various affiliate managers . For shits and giggles , you could always apply to one of these 2012-era offers that requires all ad copy , images and landing pages to be approved . Those are my favourites . They should come with a health warning . <p> The truth is that blogging is one of my preferred methods of filling the Black Hole Days . When my campaigns are in transit , or waiting to accumulate data , I prefer to be proactive rather than bouncing off the walls on AIM . <p> If you do n't  want to blog ( and let 's face it , most people shouldnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books by your desk , ideally on completely unrelated subjects . I set myself the target of writing 10 pages a day , and reading 100 pages . To the uninitiated , that may seem a little extreme , but it feeds me a steady stream of new inspiration and ideas . The writing , additionally , is a profitable side income . <p> Slowly over the months , I 've learnt to embrace the idea of using time spent waiting on campaigns to plunge in to research and papers that I 'm completely unfamiliar with . If you 're not striving to learn out of your comfort zone , you 're never going to match the diversity of knowledge that comes from working in a formal job . <p> Reading and writing are both nice ways of spending time productively , but perhaps the most important step you can take is to commit to a project that involves more than traditional CPA arbitrage . Ever since I took up this job , I 've been looking for ways to establish a legitimate business that places me as more than just a middleman . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regulated industry , I think its only just starting to flourish . Strip away the bullshit stereotypes of how we make our money and you are left with one word that is not going out of fashion anytime soon commission . My balls will perish long before commission . <p> However , if you spend two or three years in full-time affiliate marketing , you will eventually find that the waiting game begins to grate . You turn resentful of those Black Hole Days and gain an increasingly fine appetite for the power of running your own ship . Its lucrative to be a middleman , but with so much time on our hands , its only logical that we take measures to develop a permanent business that is ours . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> I hear Mr. Green has just released a brand new version of his Plentyoffish uploader kit .

What would you do for five dollars ? Given that my blog readership , according to Alexa , is stay-at-home males earning over $100,000/year , my guess is probably not a lot . I could hand you five dollars and youd probably wipe your ass with it , buy a Justin Dupre LP , burn a months worth of traffic on Friendsteror whatever . <p> Five dollars is nothing to an affiliate . But unsurprisingly in the climate we live in , there are a lot of college students out there who will do some crazy ass shit for five bucks . They wo n't even think twice about it . And after spending just five minutes browsing through the weird and wonderful listings on Fiverr , your little affiliate nostrils should be standing on end from the waft of opportunity . <p> Fiverr is a wet dream for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reached the subject , but just last night over dinner , my girlfriend was telling me how shed used Fiverr to send some poor bastard to college with the link to her fashion blog pasted on his head . Literally , scribbled across his forehead . It only cost her $5 for the cranium-based plug , but how many eyeballs would it reach ? There ca n't be too many college kids going to class with a website scribbled across their face . <p> Now upon inspection , you 're going to find that a lot of Fiverr is somewhat retarded . There are freeloaders looking to make a fast buck by selling you things like " A poem for your sweetheart , just $5 ! " . Well , I 'm sorry , but if this is the sort of thing you 'd buy , I pray that you be scammed until the cows come home . <p> Dig a little deeper and you 'll see a few interesting proposals like this : <p> This dude is willing to get off his ass and deliver your fliers across a city in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the average dating lead ? <p> I was linked to a very interesting article by Phillian on Twitter about a company that built an entire empire with lawn signs . If you have n't read the story , you really need to . Its a classic example of how offline marketing can be executed quietly and effectively for insane riches . I have n't delved too deeply in to these possibilities on a personal level , but one look at Fiverr and it gets the mind racing . <p> I see countless opportunities every day to advertise across campus sites and reach hundreds of eyeballs . One particular member is happy to pin your flyer to twenty different noticeboards across a university site . And for just five dollars ? Well , you do n't  need me to do the maths for you . <p> Its not just cheap plugging that Fiverr is good for . Take a look through the category listings and you 'll see plenty of opportunities for grabbing cheap audio soundbytes , professional looking videos and christ knows what else . <p> I was particularly interested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some raspy sounding stud muffin spit out your acai berry transcript with the audio eloquence of Michael Buffer in his youth . Anybody who does PPV should be able to relate to the trend that landing pages with audio tracks are MUCH more effective at capturing the users attention . Unfortunately my accent is far too English to get away with recording homemade soundbytes . I resemble a sort of lobotomized robot from outer space to the average American ears . It would capture their attention for all the wrong reasons . <p> For other affiliates , there are opportunities on Fiverr to snap up legal and customized dating images . Some women are happy to accept $5 to take a picture of themselves holding a sign in front of some low budget webcam . <p> I doubt itll be too long before some poor bitch is forced to smile at her reflection of " Looking For 25-30 Year Old Guys " . <p> I guess all you need to know about Fiverr is that its a mixed bag . You will find money stealing scammers , no doubt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their names who will do some good work for five bucks . And failing that , you 'll find some willing slaves ideal for the donkey work you 'd normally have signed , sealed and delivered straight to a hut in Venezuela . <h> Connect to me , baby <p> Do you have a UK based blog covering similar themes to this site ? I 'm currently looking for guest posting opportunities . If you 'd be interested in letting me post a piece for your site , please get in touch via email . <p> Looking for more affiliate advice ?

I was looking for something like Amazons Mechanical Turk , but for higher-end tasks . Getting something worthwhile for web-design or Photoshop on MTurk is impossible so Ill definitely be using this . <p> Fiverr really does n't  pay $5 . It pays only $3.92 or 2pounds if you live in the UK , after the exchange fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1/4 of the minimum wage in UK . Couple of alternatives " 7 freelance " pays $7 out of $7 paid by customer , 10 bux pays $8 out of 10 paid by customer <p> Its an excellent concept Fiverr , the only problem Ive found is , the pay outs are just to small ( $3.92 ) . So Ive been testing others that payout much higher margins such as http : //www.makeafiver.co.uk and I 'm making a lot more money because there paying out in sterling and the pound is much stronger than the dollar ! 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277853 @1677853/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> This is going to be the first in a series of posts about long term business development for affiliates . One of my biggest regrets of 2009 was that I spent 8 months working for myself and did n't  come close to developing the number of fixed assets that I should have done . Too much of my energy was spent playing with fire on campaigns that were raking in the money one minute and draining my wallet the next . This year is different . I 'm not thinking " how can I make more money than I know how to spend ? " I 'm thinking long term stability . <p> Yeah , if you 're wondering , I 'm wearing slippers and smoking a pipe while I write this . Next stop : feeble retirement . But it reflects how I feel about the business right now . I 'm not interested in banking astronomical profits just so that I can go on WickedFire and be a dick posting about it ( like the majority of members over there , sorry but you 're lame ) . Money is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 2009 , made a lot of cash , and you know what happened ? I never got chance to enjoy any of it . I want to live in comfort , not chained to my dedicated server incase a small wind knocks it offline and motherfucks my media buy . <p> 2010 is going to be all about working smart . <p> Its interesting how when I broke in to affiliate marketing , the niche that set me on the road to riches was the Google bizopp . And yet one year on , the goalposts have shifted so far that I 've returned to where I started in terms of how I value my work . <p> When I quit my day job , it was in disbelief that so much money could be made through such a simple process . Set up a landing page , plug in some keywords , and line your pockets with money . I 'd lost interest in the kinda " small fish " web projects that I 'd spent my previous career undertaking . Instead of developing long term assets that would stand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . info domains than you could fit in your economy shared hosting plan . <p> One year on , Ive grown tired of living on the volatile edge . I gave up rebills a long time ago . But even now , I 'm still shifting my campaigns to more long term geared strategies . <p> You should know how it is . A part time affiliate marketer can afford to tap in to whatevers hot or converting at the time . Those of us doing this shit as a full time career need to move forward with slightly broader mindsets . To live comfortably , we need to develop long term assets . Or face the hair receeding bitch that comes with the pressure of producing profitable CPA campaigns week on end . I 'm not joking . If I had to live 2009 several times over , I 'd be bald by the time of London Olympics . There 's times where I feel myself physically molting at my desk . <p> When I look at the affiliate marketing landscape in 2010 , I see a lot of opportunity . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially for those who deal in short term crash and burn arbritage and nothing else . Not to say the ballers are going to fall by the wayside , because they wo n't . But the time is now to build some long term assets . Something that an Adwords slap or an offer outage cant touch . <p> What are your options ? Well , that 's what I 'm going to bring myself to type shit about over the next few posts . But to give a basic overview : <p> Developing an email list : Youve heard it over and over again . But have you actually bothered to take action ? Building an email list is one of the single most effective methods of adding value to the traffic that you 're purchasing . Instead of popping a lead once , why not keep the prospect and hit them with several offers over time ? Most affiliates shy away from this route because it involves sacrificing some of the immediate ROI . I 'm aware of this so I 'm going to outline a method of building an email list and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny . Its surprisingly easy . <p> Building an authority site : If you spend forever digesting the clusterfuck of information on how to get your site ranked using SEO well , good for you . I personally hate SEO with a passion . The only time I get any kind of thrill out of SEO is when my ninja optimization skills take me to the top of the SERP for terms such as : <p> This blog receives a lowly 3% of its traffic from the search engines . I do n't  like spending any more time than I need to optimizing for Google when The Big G could flick a switch and erase me from the search engines completely . So , I take that attitude in to every affiliate site that I develop . Yes , its nice to reap free traffic . But the intention should always be to establish an authority , an identity . <p> Contrary to popular belief , its not impossible to blend in to a niche as an " expert talker " while pushing your own sordid commission driven agenda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand is worth a lot more than a first page search ranking . But to migrate in to new niches and build long term assets , you 've got to know your market and know your audience . Its why I portray myself as such a cynical bastard on here . <p> Be first on the scene . I cant remember where I heard it , but its definitely true . You do n't  always have to be the best , or the funniest , or the cleverest with your marketing message . Sometimes , just being the first can be the only competitive advantage you need . <p> I guess I 've learned from my year in affiliate marketing having originally made money by recycling campaigns that were everywhere the innovators will always find a way to get paid . If you can seize opportunity and be the first to jump on an offer or a new demand , you will make money . Its as simple as that . <p> The main difference between my mindset now to how it was when I started is that I 'm not looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long term investment in tomorrows new craze . I believe that 's what separates entrepreneurs on the web from those who are always chasing the seeds of what successful affiliates have already built . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Yes , I also know a few Internet " colleagues " who were doing something like you previous 2-3 years , and now all these Google slaps came and they ended up being nowhere and making even less money than I do , and they were making a lot more than my current miserable income : ) . <p> That 's why I do n't  bother catching all those quick money making opportunities that can make you few hundreds or even thousands dollars . Yes , I could eventually make that money , but where does it leave me later . I would have to be constantly chasing shadows and be in touch with all the newest , hottest , exciting-est ( : D ) news and trends , and I would n't have time to develop something that could last a little bit longer . <p> That 's the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would highly recommend " Intelligent Investor " amazon it . Not a thousand percent relative but it is well worth the read , the theory of it all is on a level with this post ! <p> Heh this sounds familiar . Spent a lot of time spinning my wheels ( making good cash , sure ) but never developing a BUSINESS . One day a factor out of my control decided to intervene , and pretty much everything fell off the table . <p> Now ( for last 6 months ) , I 'm building a rapidly growing BUSINESS in a niche that has been around for years , and will be around forever , will never be banned anywhere for any reason , and where I can continue to sell to the same customer for YEARS to come . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277855 @1677855/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Say you are starting affiliate marketing today with a $5,000 budget " what 's the best way to turn this type of budget in to a long-term affiliate business ? And how long would it take ? <p> I see this dilemma often . <p> " I have XXXX in the bank . My skills are A , B and C. Please tell me how to turn the above in to an affiliate machine that prints money . " <p> The obvious answer is that there is no obvious answer . But I do n't  think many people are satisfied with that , so let 's try and piece together some rough strategies you could follow . <p> $5,000 is a pretty decent budget . <p> First of all , some key assumptions : <p> #1 . The $5,000 has to be completely disposable . <p> If you are intending to draw down the $5,000 to cover living expenses , or to rely on as savings , then it is n't a genuine budget . Its a package with emotional strings attached . <p> Its better to start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than $5,000 that you 've mentally invested elsewhere . <p> #2 . Your living expenses are paid for until the affiliate business has succeeded . <p> $5,000 is a nice amount for testing campaigns , but its not enough cash to run a successful long-term affiliate business . <p> Wed have to assume that your living expenses are covered by a secondary income and that you wont be drawing down any profits until you have a successful business in place . <h> Where to Start ? <p> Let 's run through some of the popular affiliate verticals , as well as some other well known money-making strategies . <p> The question here being , " Which strategies are suitable for newbie affiliates with $5,000 to burn ? " <h> Go Mobile ? <p> When newbies ask for guidance , what 's the recurring piece of advice you hear ? <p> " Its 2015 , buddy . Time to go mobile " <p> Mobile offers are all the rage these days . <p> That 's nice , but its pretty bloody useless as career advice . <p> When was the last time you heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> The thing is , there is money in traditional web-based desktop offers but nobody phrases it like that because to do so would be to completely miss the point . <p> Going mobile is a term used by many affiliates seeking the next big trend , but until you can actually pinpoint what market you plan to serve , its the equivalent of a Walmart Wannabe deciding to go retail . <p> There are four main models we can attack in mobile marketing : <p> App installs <p> Pin submits <p> Mobile lead gen <p> Pay-per-call <p> For somebody with a $5,000 budget , this is how I would rank them : <p> 1 . App installs These have low payouts ( cheaper testing ) , with simple conversion flows , and they are available in many different markets including some that are unsaturated . You can test these offers cost-effectively . A good choice . <p> 2 . Pay-per-call Second best bet . As I explained in Premium Posts 2015 , its difficult to make a huge loss promoting pay-per-call on AdWords and Bing . The metrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theres much more signal in the data with these offers . <p> 3 . Mobile lead gen Mobile lead gen offers pose the same challenge as those on the web , although quality issues can be difficult to predict . This is n't a bad starting point , but its probably not the best while advertisers are still coming to terms with monetising mobile users . <p> 4 . Pin submits By far the toughest nut to crack on a $5,000 budget . Pin submits generally have higher payouts and higher testing costs . Finding a winning formula can be obtuse , to say the very least . You are tied to mobile carriers , and they are notoriously up-and-down . I recommend you avoid them on this budget . <p> Once you decide to go mobile and focus your efforts on one of these four models , there 's still more work to do . <p> Ideally you should be narrowing your search to a single market or region ( preferably one that is n't saturated ) , and a single vertical that operates under your chosen model . <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installs &gt; Utility apps &gt; South East Asia . <p> App installs &gt; Gaming apps &gt; DACH <p> Mobile lead gen &gt; Dating offers &gt; AU/NZ . <p> In short , one does not simply decide to go mobile on a $5,000 budget and live to refresh his stats happily . <p> You need a strategy that cuts much deeper than simply : " Hey , you know what ? I 'm sick of desktops . All these bastards using their mobiles ? I shall convert them starting Monday . " <p> CONVERT THEM TO WHAT ? <h> Facebook <p> To succeed on Facebook in 2015 , most affiliates rely on three structural advantages : <h> Adult Dating <p> Its a popular starting point for newbie affiliates , probably because so much of the vertical is , err , graspable at first sight . <p> In truth , adult dating traffic has become so fragmented that you 'd do well to blow through $5,000 without learning a lot along the way . <p> That 's unless you were to do something stupid like place top bids on Xhamster in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its not making money . There 's a huge plateau of adult affiliates stuck perennially at break even . <p> If you want to grow your $5,000 , you 'll have to focus on out-working the competition by scalping pockets of profit that are ignored by larger advertisers . <p> Or you can tackle Tier 3 countries where low volume still trades for a decent ROI . <p> Avoid advertising to Tier 1 countries with a $5,000 budget . <p> That 's not to say you ca n't strike success , but the ROI will be much lower than if you execute the same strategy on a less saturated market . <h> PPV <p> Pay-per-view networks ( PPV ) exploded back in 2009 and 2010 . <p> They have declined in popularity since then . <p> HOW IT WORKS : PPV networks serve ads to users who have installed third party software ( usually a toolbar ) on their computers . The advertiser can target users based on their current browsing activity . For example if you were browsing Pets.com , I could target you with a pop-up saying , " HI PETS LOVER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality I probably would n't do this . <p> Even TrafficVance , the cr+me de la cr+me of PPV sources , just recently ditched its long standing requirement that new members must have a referral in to the network . Its a pretty open playing field these days . <p> PPV networks may offer a shrinking audience , but that audience is large enough to make good money from . <p> Some of my highest ROI campaigns in 2014 came from combining PPV traffic with pay-per-call offers , often under dubious circumstances ( See Premium Posts 2015 ) . <p> The precise nature of the targeting means you can easily find small volume campaigns with high ROI that are perfect for growing capital and cutting your teeth in the business . <p> On a budget of $5,000 , PPV is a good choice . <h> Plentyoffish ( POF ) <p> Another traffic source that was massively popular 2-3 years ago . <p> It 's unlikely you 'll stumble in to the same $1000/day campaigns that were bread and butter back then , but POF remains a good choice for high ROI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available means that you are unlikely to miss the mark so badly that you 'd blow through a $5,000 budget . <p> I just read a success story on STM of a guy who only started on POF in October 2014 , with no formal experience in web stuff . <p> He s now making a comfortable $500/day profit , whilst building out a team of employees to help him scale . <p> His budget getting started ? $4,000 . <p> Whilst these success stories are reasonably common in affiliate marketing , that does not mean that anybody can do it . <p> When you read through the actual follow along , its clear that his success = application , hard work and the ability to think like an affiliate . <p> In short , the guy earned his success . <p> As for POF ? <p> There 's always money in the " <h> Pops and Redirects <p> If you have success with broadly targeted PPV campaigns , the natural progression is to move on to pop and redirect traffic . <p> Here you get access to a lot more volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirect ) rather than third party software . <p> One thing to note is that while every other traffic source mentioned here ( except PPV ) can be targeted on shared hosting , you would be a bloody fool to try your luck with pops or redirects whilst HostGatoring on your technology . <p> Your server has to be lightning fast and able to deal with hundreds of page loads per minute . This will eat up some of your initial $5,000 budget . <p> Pop traffic comes with a big learning curve , but redirect networks like ZeroPark are easy for newbies to master and they have good targeting options . <p> Again , a good choice for the mid-range budget . <h> Invest in Web Assets <p> The guy who sent me this $5,000 question already had a rough idea of how he wanted to invest the money . <p> He wanted to buy a site that he saw on Flippa , in an industry that he was familiar with . <p> The site was producing around $400-$600 revenue per month , and it was selling for $4500+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pay for themselves within 10 months ( and a suspiciously high percentage of them find their way on to Flippa ) . <p> That is always my concern with sites that are put up for sale . <p> The most important thing you can find out is why sell ? <p> If you are looking to invest $5,000 in to an existing website or app , the golden rule is to know your market better than the existing owner . <p> I think many wannabe site flippers overestimate growth potential whilst dramatically underestimating the work that would be required to break the plateau and flip at a profit . <p> If you want to do this well , you have to almost reverse the equation and greet every site-for-sale with cynicism . <p> In this case , I told the guy to go right ahead . <p> He said he knew the industry and saw an opportunity . <p> Well , that is a simple recipe for success that has no comeback from a crusty old affiliate like myself . <p> Good luck to him . <h> Launch Own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market your own product one that turns in to a sustainable long-term business for $5,000 ? <p> Yes , you can . <p> If you understand an industry and spot an opportunity . <p> A lot of affiliates try to execute this strategy and get it tits-up , for one of four reasons : <p> They do n't  actually understand their chosen industry . <p> The opportunity that exists does n't  translate in to paying customers . ( They misinterpret the non-committal " Sounds like a good idea " ) <p> The market simply does n't  scale in to a big money business , either in the size of the transaction , or the number of paying customers . <p> The product never reaches the market . <p> My advice , before you spend $5,000 on a product or website that is n't proven to work : <p> Design just the sales page , then run a PPC campaign to test that people are willing to buy . <p> You do n't  need to have an actual product . <p> Only the sales page . <p> Verify that real-life customers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy button at the end of it . <p> Once they click to buy , you can announce COMING XXX 2015 and place them in to a mailing list . <p> And then build your product . <p> You can do this several times on a $5,000 budget until you find a product that people are actually willing to pay for . <h> Managing Cashflow and Scaling <p> If you decide to focus on arbitrage buying traffic , sending it to affiliate offers then its important to manage your cash carefully . <p> A budget of $5,000 offers some slack , but the reality is that industry margins are shrinking . <p> $5,000 wont go as far as it used to . <p> Your first objective must be to increase the amount of capital you have at your disposal . <p> Back in the days where 100% ROI was second nature , you could turn $5,000 in to $10,000 in the space of a week . <p> It only took 3-4 weeks of concentrated scaling and suddenly affiliates had budgets where previously they only had their parents money . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secures a 20-30% profit margin , on weekly payments , whilst utilising his entire $5,000 budget , he can expect to add $1,000 to it each week . <p> One of the reasons why its so important that you have a secondary income outside affiliate marketing is that you want to keep any profits inside your business . <p> Turn $5,000 in to $6,000 . Turn $6,000 in to $7,200 . Turn $7,200 in to $8,640 . <p> Money in the bank is so important for affiliates . <p> Not least because you will experience down times , but also because a bank balance heading in the right direction is a massive psychological boost when it comes to exploring new traffic sources and investing in data . <p> Two of the big mistakes you can make at this stage are : <p> 1 . Spreading your commission across too many networks . <p> Its better to work with one network that pays you weekly , rather than three networks that pay you monthly . <p> To get paid weekly , you usually need to send at least $1,000 in commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread your money in too many different directions and increase the time it takes you to bank it and reinvest . <p> 2 . Spreading your ad funds across too many traffic sources . <p> Ive lost count of how many traffic sources I have sitting there with unused ad funds . <p> Just last week I stumbled across a PPV network I have n't used since 2011 holding $750 . <p> Needless to say , if you are sitting on a $5,000 budget , you have to make that money work for you . <p> Avoid spraying payments all over the place . <p> Inject those dollars in to the campaigns with the highest ROI . <p> ROI = GROWTH <p> If you get lucky and have Campaign A producing a 30% ROI , vs . Campaign B producing a 50% ROI you should be pausing Campaign A and loading the funds in to Campaign B to maximise your return and capital growth . <p> When I hear stories of affiliates spunking through their monthly budget in 3 days , I ca n't help but think : <p> " Why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that you have $X to get you through the next 30 days , and you have a profitable campaign that is rapidly guzzling the funds , then your next step should be : <p> 1 . Lower bids to decrease volume ( and raise ROI ) . <p> or <p> 2 . Day-part aggressively to run only at the most profitable hours ( once again , raising ROI ) . <p> What you shouldnt do is treat all profitable campaigns the same . <p> Cash is king . <p> Whatever strategy gets you more of it , banked quickly , is where your attention should lie . <p> ( And yes , for many aspiring affiliates , this may be your existing day jobs ! ) <h> In Conclusion <p> I know most affiliates aspire to run gigantic campaigns that print money by the hour . <p> Hey , its nice to be ambitious . <p> But unless you have the budget to match , you are going to have to get practical and hustle your way out of the basement . <p> With $5,000 in your pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If any of you have managed to turn $5,000 in to a well-oiled money printing machine ( and I know many of you have ) , feel free to explain your strategy below ! 114274 @qwx974274 <p> In case you missed it , my brand new 2015 edition of Premium Posts is available now .

I had guys next to me , better and more focused , more connected that are at $xxx.xxx now on mobile but who mostly got a great learning experience from POF . <p> So I truly applaud that guys performance but my advice for the rest of 99% newbies out there that want to try POF and really work on it on a daily basis and are willing to spend 3000$ and more on testing , do so , go there , you wo n't loose as much money as you can on other traffic sources , learn how to build LPs , banners and connect the angle u use all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  trust that it will ever come . <p> In conclusion , I would recommend POF for anyone starting out in combination with STM forum , because you will learn the fundamentals and those are the ones that will lead you towards a sustainable affiliate or online marketing business . <p> Always great to hear from you Finch . <p> PS I 'll be in London for the next 3 days and if not this time , maybe well shake hands in March for the STM meet up if you 'll be there . <p> I think the single biggest problem with POF these days is the lack of fresh offers . When offers like True/Be2 were taking off ( fresh databases , combined with fresh angles ) , it was an easy time to make money . <p> I do n't  really run POF these days , but if I did , I would be promoting my own white label sites on there . <p> Well , interesting to know what 's your thought on this . I still wonder why such a great platform ca n't be monetised easier . <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone spending a few thousands and really putting in the effort for 3-4months to be able to get closer to a steady $100/day or so . <p> Anyway , its thought to be out there today that 's why I emphasise on fundamentals . On the other hand , even if I 'm by far an experienced affiliate , in my opinion the affiliate industry / mobile industry is bigger than ever , so there is a lot of room to do a lot things not a straight answer here though , as you said ! <p> Great post Finch , giving newbies all the tools they need to succeed right here . The one thing most people miss the most in the equation however is WORK . <p> $5000 will get you a minimum buy and wont even get you started on the bigger DSPs out there . Its best to build up an even bigger test budget ( $15-20k ) if you plan on scaling into any competitive markets otherwise you may hit a winner and have no cash flow left to scale . <p> Great post . Nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " BS . Nothing in life comes easy and its even harder to do anything at all , with little or no budget to start with . Thanks for confirming that . <p> Hey Finch , can you please give us more details about the infrastructure of running a lot of sales pages ? Domains , hosting , platforms , etc . Do you buy a lot of domains , put them on a VPS and build a page for each , using what ? Or do you have one of those " landing page " sites with a lot of custom domains . Please explain thank you . <p> I have various servers , each with multiple IPs , and various domains clustered on each . In terms of building out sales page , I usually go for WordPress with a custom LP theme that works well for sales pages and Googles AdWords quality score . <p> I think it all boils down to the offer . If a great new offer comes along and users start migrating naturally , then an affiliate can pedal the trend and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been around forever though . Saturation is a big issue there . <p> As for why the platform ca n't be monetised easier , I think there are big opportunities outside the dating vertical .

Incredibly , some affiliates cant tell them apart . <p> There seems to be a misconception in our industry that optimising = finding banners with the highest clickthrough rate ( CTR ) . Time and time again I see affiliates walloping themselves in the balls with this flawed strategy . <p> It is a stroke of lunacy to cull ads and landing pages based solely on their CTRs . <p> Do you want a large audience or an audience that converts ? <p> The only variable that matters is the conversion rate , and your entire testing strategy must be built around this principle . <p> Before you can rely on conversions , they need to be observable . Fully observable . You cant make decisions if you do n't  have the right data . <p> When you start receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every single banner . Not just the clicks . <p> Its very early doors in this campaign , but already you can see one banner is producing almost half the conversions on 1/9th of the spend . <p> This creative is also drawing the most banner clicks ( 60 vs the lowest performer with 30 ) . A perfect storm for any affiliate . We love it when the banner with the highest conversion rate also delivers the highest CTR . <p> But it does n't  happen very often . <p> So , here 's what you do when your top converting banner is drawing a low CTR : <p> Original Top CTR Banner : <p> Original Top Converting Banner : <p> We want to keep the appeal of the converting ad , while using the aesthetics of the ad that gets the most clicks . So we play a game of Mix n Match : <p> New Banner , to take over the web : <p> I use the call-to-action from the high CTR banner as this is unlikely to affect conversions , but can affect clicks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will flop . <p> But unless you know exactly what converts , you are testing blind . <p> From my experience , a banner that draws plenty of clicks but fails to convert is often guilty of selling an appeal that is n't reflected in the landing page ( or the offer ) . <p> A banner that converts well on a small trickle of clicks has solid foundations , but needs to be presented better or or targeted more effectively . <p> Note : If you find a angle that converts like hot-doggy-on-sauce on only a small number of clicks but no image or colour scheme will increase its CTR try isolating the audience . Establish what type of users you 're appealing to , then work out where they can be found in concentrated numbers . <p> If you are optimising your landing pages , but not your banners , you are leaving money on the table .

If you are involved with any kind of banner buying or advertising on the Google Content Network , What Runs Where is a one stop shop for all the campaign ideas you could ever need . <p> I gave it a positive review last year , but I had a few complaints about the interface . I saw it as unnecessarily complicated and confusing for a media buying newbie . <p> There was no shortage of mesmerizing data , but the software was low on shiny , whimsical bells and whistles . Presentation is n't everything , but it certainly makes life easier when you 're plunging through mountains of data and numbers . <p> Well , it turns out the What Runs Where team has taken that complaint onboard . The software has recently been upgraded with a brand spunking new interface . <p> Its looking really good . <p> What Runs Where now supports an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with the previous collection of America , Canada , Australia and the UK . <p> The new targeting is particularly helpful for offers that dominate in European markets , like the Need For Speed example above . <p> Not only can you spy on prime sources of European traffic , but you can swipe readily translated creatives for your own testing purposes . <p> Of course , in the interest of not being a total dickbag , let me remind you <p> Running the same creatives on the same traffic sources is only ever going to leave you two steps behind somebody much richer than yourself . That said , this is probably the single most effective tool for digging data from right under the fingernails of your competition . <p> Another welcome new addition to What Runs Where is placement suggestions .

@@106277860 @1677860/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Since caving in to the lure of a Kindle , my personal goal has been to read 100 pages of literature every day . Its something I recommend every blogger should consider . <p> If you run a blog , or produce any kind of web content , you should be reading regularly to enhance your own output . In fact , if you have any entrepreneurial instinct whatsoever , you will greatly improve your chances of success by reading regularly . <p> Most people accept that good writing comes from practice and lots of reading . What they often ignore is that bad writing is just as easy to inherit . Unfortunately , bad writing is a central trait of the blogosphere . Its just as epidemic as the lack of actionable information , or the self-obsessed drivel regularly tossed out by writers with no journalistic qualities and not the slightest regard for being held accountable . <p> Blogs have become a staple part of our literary diets . While I 'm a huge advocate of sharing information in this way , I think its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its not just bloggers . Every day , I find websites scourged in bumbling copy that fails to communicate the authors message . <p> So what 's the solution ? <p> Not every blogger has the literary prowess to mug off Shakespeare in the style stakes . But I think we can all benefit from investing in a decent grammar handbook , and particularly by immersing ourselves in books that have been stamped for approval . You know that a book has been stamped for approval when you find it on a bookshelf , not on a Clickbank sales page . <p> Many of us have RSS readers loaded to the hilt with meaningless crap often , horrifically written meaningless crap . Feasting on so much mediocre writing makes us susceptible to inheriting the flaws as our own . <p> In the business world , we say that the fastest way to achieve wealth is to spend your time in wealthy company . Well , let me tell you that the same applies for good writing . <p> We live in an age where tablets and smartphones make books as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you spend commuting to work each day ? How much television do you inflict on your weeping eyeballs ? Cut down the crap . Get some literature in your life ! <p> And not just any literature . Read books that challenge your imagination . <p> I 'm currently indulging in a wide variety of genres from the brilliance of Orwell , to the science of Dawkins , with thousand-page-thick Psychology textbooks thrown in for good measure . Reading is a workout for the brain . If you 're not pushing yourself , you 're standing still . If you do n't  sweat after a workout , it probably has n't  been a great workout . <p> Blogs exist by rehashing the same nuggets of information in bite-size form . Most of that information comes from books , or worse , plucked from the bloggers fat lying arse . Sites in the Internet Marketing space hey , like this ! are notorious for providing reminders of the shit we should have done yesterday . They rarely deliver plans for tomorrow . <p> There 's little harm in that , but for two problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing often sets a bad example . <p> I 'm not suggesting you sacrifice all blogs for a dingy afternoon in the library , although maybe you should . But we need to make an effort to escape our comfort zones and feed the brain some literature of a little more substance . Our brain will thank us duly with new inspiration , new ideas and a much tighter hold over the English language . <p> If you have a blog , or any kind of web presence , you can steal a beat on your rivals by learning to communicate more effectively . The best way to do this is to read , and a read a lot . Writing is a tool that will aid any business . But to master it , you must expose yourself to a variety of literature . Not just the crap like this that piles in to your reader . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 11 Comments <p> Great post Finch .

That way I can learn them better by typing them out , and I can come back to them later when writing a story : http : //i.imgur.com/WkQZm.jpg <p> I cultivated the habit of reading after I started reading blog posts so this post is interesting , just the opposite for me as a reader but I completely agree with you that bloggers should be reading books more often so that they can write more unique posts for the readers . Reading is a very good habit which enriches or thoughts and enlightens us . <p> Got your point . I for one love to read blogs . Yes , this allows me to discover more things and be updated about the trends . However , I can never still compare the learning I get whenever I read books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I wish more bloggers took more pride in their product .

Its not for everybody but its perfect for me . <p> Crunch is an accounting solution , exclusive to the UK , for freelancers and small businesses . Ive been using the software for over a year , and I 've endorsed it to many other Internet Marketers with similar business models . <p> Its a sleek , easy-to-use and very potent weapon in the battle to stay on top of my companys finances , and by that virtue my own sanity . <p> Before Crunch , I was a disorganized slacktopus of number stained notepads , overflowing in-baskets and accounts that only sometimes made sense . The resulting mess had my titties in a twist on more than one occasion . I spent much of my time in Thailand wondering if HMRC would be there to collect me whip in hand when I re-entered the UK . <p> " What have I missed ? What have I done wrong ? " Those thoughts kept me awake at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that keeping track of my accounts the good old fashioned way was n't exactly working out . <p> Crunch got my company accounts in order . And despite the fact they still have n't integrated support for foreign currency transactions , I 'm very satisfied with the service . <p> Its no secret that Crunch has been growing at a rapid rate . The software seems to boast new bells and whistles every time I login , which is either a testament to their proactive reinvestment , or a damning indictment of how often I actually log in . Probably a bit of both . <p> Either way , the latest development is more than just a software upgrade . <p> Crunch is being set free . <p> Well , kinda <p> Crunch has unveiled a stripped down Solo package for those who want to use their software free of charge .

You can join for free , track your companys financial activity , and then upgrade seamlessly when the time comes ( hopefully ! ) that you need a more complete solution . <p> I think its a deadly smart move from Crunch . Their software already boasts the holy grail of a simple interface matched to powerful functionality . Its an impressive package , particularly when you stack it up against the competitors out there many of which are overpriced , not to mention complete bastards in the user-friendliness stakes . <p> By offering an entry-level package , I would expect a lot of trial users to convert in to paid customers from the software advantages alone . Another wave will convert after the first whiff of taxation stress . I include my girlfriend and her newly launched limited company in that bracket . She signed up for a peek this week , much to my relief . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me with them , cant you ?

Priced at -89.50 per month , Max users can support up to four directors and ten employees on the payroll . Its a premium service , designed to satisfy those customers with slightly more complex needs than a rogue Internet Marketing cowboy such as myself . <p> As part of the Max service , you will receive your own dedicated senior accountant , and a much more hands-on Were in this together approach to your dealings .

Unfortunately , that particular home turned out to be harbouring some sinister spirits . <p> Believe it or not , Internet Marketers and Jack Torrance have something in common . No , not haunted mansions . But rather , we have to deal with the psychological effect of isolation . We have to win the battle that goes on inside our heads . <p> Disconnecting from the world and working from home is some peoples idea of paradise .

The days and weeks were laid out for me . You turn up at 9am , leave the office at 6pm , and whatever hours left in the day are yours to spunk however you see fit . There was a beautiful simplicity to life , albeit a restricting schedule that often left me chewing a large Mocha to get through the mornings . <p> I wo n't lie . Working from home will always be my preferred arrangement . But it comes at the price of isolation . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing on by without you ? <p> The effect was magnified during my 8 months living in Thailand . There were periods of mild depression where I felt so isolated from other 24 year olds that I lost complete direction and control over my life .

Working at home is not the answer to anybodys true sense of paradise .

All thoughts of a commission have been banished in the name of a psycho on Line 107 . <p> You see , the only way to play Three effectively is to beat them at their own game . And their game is essentially the mindfuck . Its a tour de force in disorientation , rapid-fire T&amp;Cs and blatant trickery . <p> It was n't long before I was being offered my sparkling new contract . <p> " Yes , Mr. Osborn , I can certainly help you today .

Also , they 're skilled at using one of my favourite sales techniques : they build up momentum by feeding a barrage of questions where the only answer is yes . Get a prospect to say yes to a bunch of smaller questions and his answer to the big one is likely to be influenced . <p> By this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive been cold-called several times by Three in the last few months . They seem absolutely determined to sell me a second handset , or to draw family referrals like blood from a stone . <p> Sure enough , Steve pitched me with a second handset. 300 minutes , 200 texts and 500mb of Internet allowance . But best of all , I could have this handset absolutely free . Now here 's where their shenanigans get somewhat murky . <p> I asked twice , specifically , if the handset was available for -0 and no monthly charges . Both times , Steve confirmed that it was . <p> Reluctantly , but sensing something was amiss , I agree to be sent the second handset . I figured I 'd flog it on eBay , or give it to one of my many friends with cracked iPhone screens . I do love a gesture of irony . <p> Delighted with his coup , Steve then hit me with the small print . The sales process is designed to extract audible sighs while you agree and confirm a merciless list of T&amp;Cs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this <p> " So , Mr. Osborn , today you have agreed to not one but two handsets . Firstly , the Samsung Galaxy S2 for -40/month , your desired handset , and secondly a Samsung Europa Whatever , absolutely free as a special benefit for being a loyal customer to Three " <p> " Now I have to tell you , Mr. Osborn , and its just a minor detail , but we cant process the second phone in our system on a free contract . So what I 'm going to do is set up two direct debits . The first will charge you -30 for the Galaxy S2 , and the second will charge you -10 for the Europa Whatever , which of course , you are receiving free of charge as a special benefit for being a loyal customer . So , all in all , you will be paying -40/month for the Samsung Galaxy S2 and getting a second handset absolutely free of charge . Can I go through and confirm this on the system , Mr. Osborn ? " <p> Hold on , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment Steve offered me a -40/month contract , I 'd been setup for one of the most long-winded upsell tricks in the book . I directed my browser at the Three website and sure enough , there was the Samsung Galaxy S2 on sale for -35/month . Forget the loyal customer bullshit . Hed actually given me a small discount on my intended phone , which I 'm probably entitled to after seven years with the company . And his special benefit ? It was no more than a second contract , lumbering me with a phone that I initially rejected . <p> Marketing note : Upselling can be effective , but even more effective is getting your prospect to agree to an inflated price and then bundling in the upsell . Customers are notoriously bad at valuing products . They rely on contrast and comparison to decipher the good deals from the bad . As soon as I signaled that I was happy with a -40/month price point , I took on the identity of lamb to the slaughter , so easy would it be to get me to approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 months <p> I tip my hat to Three , because by this point , I truly could n't have given a shit . I 'd been on the phone for close to 30 minutes . <p> In the UK , we have a customer protection scheme for online and phone-based sales . Its a statutory cooling off period , where contracts can be cancelled in the first few days ( Incidentally , the same law does not apply in-store so always get your contracted shit online , guys . ) . I decided to wait for the phones to be delivered and then send back the second unwanted handset . By canceling , I would get the Samsung Galaxy for -30/month finally , a good deal that looks , smells and tastes like a good deal ! <p> So , I waited for the delivery and then called Three again pressed 4 to speak to a cancellation assistant , pressed 6 to confirm that I was serious , pressed 9 to answer some algebra , before finally muttering the secret word to reach the help desk : " ARRRGHHHH ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancel contract , I found myself plunged in to a labyrinth of darkness , holding queues and the motherfucking Black Eyed Peas . If you think upgrading your contract is a pain in the arse , just try canceling one . Invariably you 'll find that the most persistent , crafty bastards are placed on these desks . Their mission is to make you think twice . <p> Before long , you 're pleading to speak to Steve again . Except this world resembles the Orwellian dystopia , where Steve is now known as Abraham , and your sanity is questioned for stating otherwise . <p> Note to service providers : If you 're a large company like Three , you can generally get away with making the cancellation procedure a thousand times more agonizing than the sales funnel . If you 're a small business , this is reputation suicide . In fact , I would even suggest that dealing with the customers looking to cancel is more important than wooing new prospects . Prospects are still prospects , theyll come and go . But your customers possess the ammunition to leave your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when their intention is to ditch you . <p> If you 're still following by now , you 're probably wondering : did I manage to cancel the contract ? or did I succumb to the web of lies and tricky ? Well , Im about to find out . <p> After negotiating the Black Eyed Peas , a sore arse , and close to an hour being bounced around on hold , I finally reached the contract cancellation help desk . What did I discover ? My contracts werent even active in the system yet ! And , of course , the Three system is designed in such a way that inactive accounts can not be terminated . I was told to call back today , which I 'm about to do . <p> A final marketing note : If the customer is aware of his cooling off period , insist that he observes another cooling off period before he can make his final decision . If you 're that customer ? Congratulations . The cooling off period within a cooling off period is the very last hurdle guarding the light at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry ! 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Make sure you grab a copy of Premium Posts Volume 3 .

I walked into my local store and asked to upgrade my existing phone . Sounds easy right ? It turns out , having been sold the phone and contract that I wanted , that in store they can only sell to new customers and not help existing ones . I learned that 1 week later Since I live abroad , I then had to switch on the phone for the first time while in the UK ( I was n't ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am paying for , and in the end , in trying to transfer the number across , I was without a phone FOR A MONTH . I 'm still with them , and because I want to keep the same number I shall probably stay with them , but my goodness , their service to me , an existing customer of 3 years , was shocking . The fact that 3 is still in business in the UK is a minor miracle I think . I hope you can sort your phone issues out in under a lifetime . <p> Nice story , but why did you bother to call them to cancel the second contract ? I would never do that because 1 ) of the time it takes and 2 ) the stupid questions and blabla of the call center people , trying to convince you to stay . The easiest and quickest way in my opinion is to just send a fax but I guess even sending a letter will take less time than dealing with a call center . = <p> most companies stopped sending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US i have noticed .

@@106277864 @1677864/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> There 's a huge difference between marketing a service as free and marketing it as premium with a free incentive . Never underestimate the negative connotations that free has on the anticipated quality of service . <p> As marketers , we tend to assume that free is always a good thing . And so our landing pages are plastered in free registrations , free bonuses and free instant access . <p> The worst offending affiliates will explain that something is free before explaining what it actually does . They sell the $0 before the product ! <p> Does that make sense to you ? It does n't  to me . <p> A lot of items are free in this world . <p> I could run outside and steal my neighbours garbage . That 's free . <p> I could spend -20 at Pizza Hut and get some free BBQ wings . But will I ? Probably not . I do n't  like wings . <p> Unless you establish a real desire to attain what is being offered for free , free does not sell . <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X costs $0 , when the user could barely give a shite about free . He does n't  want free . He wants a good deal . <p> Note : Hey , at least they 're selling it as a benefit rather than a feature . Otherwise we really would be shooting basic psychology in the balls . <p> Free only becomes a powerful asset in your sales copy after the user has established " what I think X is worth to me " .

@@106277865 @1677865/ <p> EWA Network is turning in to a popular destination for many top affiliate marketers . With the doors opened and a limited number of spots available , you may want to consider jumping onboard while you still can . The network is run by Ryan Eagle , aka The Birdman , aka Some Kinda Messiah Of The Grind . If you 've ever followed his updates on Twitter , you 'll have read some pretty amusing 140 character pep-talks . The sort of updates I 'd expect to read if Anthony Robbins woke up feeling black with a sudden passion for dough and hoes . <p> Regardless , I 'd heard good things about EWA from a number of well known blogging personalities and a smattering of fellow affiliates that I trust . Having worked with them for a while now , its easy to see where that following was born from . <h> What Makes Them Different ? <p> I 've always felt that the business personality of the average affiliate is informal and much more casual than a typical professional . Were generally a young bunch , and already too disillusioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict business relationships . Many networks out there do n't  quite understand or know how to establish a bond with their affiliates where everybody feels like they 're pulling in the same direction . What immediately strikes me about EWA is the sense that the publisher is valued as highly as the advertiser . And considering the number of advertisers these guys have drafted in , that 's quite an achievement . <p> EWA , just like many of my favourite networks , is run by affiliates who know what its like to face the daily grind . Many people are familiar with Ryan Eagle and have formed their own impressions before actually working with the guy . Whatever you 've read or heard , its hard to think of a network figure that works harder to make sure that haters remain just thathaters . I 've never suffered from missed payments , blanked emails or unanswered questions . The whole team at EWA are dedicated to helping affiliates , whether you 're sending a single lead a day or 1000 . <p> I 'd say EWA is also the most proactive network I 've dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance . Many networks will flood my inbox with campaign suggestions and exclamations that Offer X is converting through the roof . Of course , most of them forget that ROI is more important to an affiliate than the conversion rates on the internal control panel . EWA regularly deliver detailed summaries of how and where you can promote their offers for the maximum ROI . <p> They wo n't give you campaigns off the bat , but Ive seen Eagle shoot himself in the foot by outing his own traffic sources and being quickly swamped in competition . I consider myself pretty well versed in where to find traffic , but even Ive stumbled across some hidden gems in the mass emails that EWA members receive several times a week . Its nice to work with a network that is actually on the beat and willing to share that information internally . <h> Offers &amp; Payouts <p> Well , I realize its the offers and payouts that ultimately sell a networks worth to you guys . EWA is stacked to the rafters with a seemingly never ending list of shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dating and gaming niches . EWA provides great diversity in these areas , including many international offers . They also have a neat " request an offer " feature . I have n't tickled them with it yet but judging by the rapidly expanding list of active campaigns , I 'm guessing other affiliates have seen their requests fulfilled . <p> Payouts are generally super competitive . Some of the offers Ive promoted on EWA have topped the nearest matching payout by up to $0.50 , which is a big jump if you 're working with smaller lead gen type advertisers . They 're quite noisy about the fact that they want your traffic , and they 're willing to run on the skinniest margins to secure it . <p> I 've also noticed a lot of " As Seen On TV " offers . If you 're working in the PPV space , this is definitely an area where EWA can fuel your imagination . <p> Two of my favourite EWA features are available as soon as you 've logged in to the interface . You 'll immediately be greeted by the top three performing offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daily basis which is considerably more helpful than a network-wide EPC , plucked out of thin air , over god knows how long . One of my favourite categories to look out for is the " Top Emerging Offers " section . <p> Knowing that EWA run a lot of their offers internally , it makes sense to stay on top of what 's rising through the charts . If you get there before everybody else , there 's a lot of money on the table . <p> The second feature any affiliate will enjoy is the " Campaign Mini Guides " . They seem to be updated once a week , and its here that you 'll find teasing snippets of how to promote various offers . Not a Dummies Guide , but enough to kick the balls of a creative affiliate in to action . <h> Room For Improvement ? <p> As with any network , there are still areas where EWA could up their game and really kick on in 2010 . I would personally like to see an overhaul of the offer search facility . I realize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand offers at your disposal , it can be a pain in the arse to search through a giant list . <p> I 've had trouble using the search function and the category filtering is about as problematic as the " sort offers by country allowed " option . Offers are prefixed with their accepted country in the title , which is fine , but it makes it difficult for me to filter the list and see only the campaigns from one particular region . <p> I would recommend you check with your affiliate manager on exactly what countries are open to any offer that 's been around for a while . I had one instance where my conversions for a dating offer fell off the cliff face only to find that it was because the offer description had n't  been updated to explain that UK traffic was no longer accepted . These are only minor grievances , and understandable given the sheer volume of campaigns that are available to run , but it would be nice to see a little re-organization to make offer selection less of a headache . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include this section in my network reviews anymore . More often than not , I get accepted on the basis that I run this blog so my insight is about as relevant as a slap in the balls . <p> That said , I applied to EWA before anybody knew about this blog . I received a phone call to go over the application , which I failed to answer . They reached out through email asking for me to return the call within a week . I do n't  know what I was doing but I managed to forget and by the end of that week , the application had been rejected . This was before I 'd heard so many ringing endorsements and I eventually reached out to Ryan directly to get onboard . <p> Moral of the story ? When you apply to join EWA , theyll probably call you . You should probably answer . If that 's not the case and I 'm rambling out of my arse again , speak up or forever hold your peace . <h> Overall Thoughts <p> It may be hard to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dude who calls himself The Birdman . Especially one who has enough questionable photos online to make that time Finch posted his arse on the WickedFire Forums look somewhat respectable . But most who have worked with EWA will happily put the record straight . When it comes to business , these guys are top notch and a pleasure to work with . <p> I look forward to receiving the regular email updates from EWA , and they seem to be one of the few networks that know what their affiliates are looking to hear . They 're not the only network to keep such a close relationship , but if you 're not registered with them , you 're probably missing out on the chance to do some good business . <p> Its a private network . I 'm not sure whether they plan on closing the doors soon to stagger business growth , but its worth taking the time to register on EWA . Even if you 're not going to run any immediate traffic , the creative advice alone is worth the free admission . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

If you 've ever witnessed your parents attempting to navigate The Facebooks for the first time , you 'll be quite aware that too many options can turn in to Next Step Paralysis . The ability to be completely and utterly unpredictable . <p> The best way to remedy this confusion is to build every landing page with the attitude that simple is best . <p> Its important to build landing pages for the lowest common denominator . And by that , I mean sacrificing your creative urges and making your sales pitch as sweepingly digestible as can be . <p> Here in the UK , The Guardian has a reading age of 14 . The Sun is lower at 8 . There are many tools where you can measure the reading age of your copy , with my favourite being the readability test at Juicy Studio . If your reading age is too high , you 'll be losing too many conversions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but where older demographics are concerned , the actual structure of your landing page is even more important . <p> Have you ever stood over the shoulder of a user in your target demographic and watched as they stumbled across your landing page ? Try it , you 'll probably be surprised by the results . <p> This is n't always convenient , and I 'm not suggesting you load up on binoculars and go all fucking Rear Window on your suburban neighbour folk . Thankfully there are services out there that specialise in tracking live footage of users on your site . <p> We all know the importance of split testing , but witnessing the actual screen footage of users on your site is another leap in to the realm of truly getting your target market .

I used to do this all the time . I 'd have about five different anchor links , each trying to capture different sectors of the market . In the end , it was just too confusing . <p> Like your great grandmother staring blankly at The Facebooks , too many options is a bad thing . You will often enjoy much more success by having one simple Call-to-Action clearly defined , with a progressive sales funnel that leads the user on to the next step . <p> Or maybe you wo n't . <p> If you 've ever sat tearing your hair out at where all your ad clicks are disappearing to , the tools above should uncover some handy clues . If you 're still confused , here are those half price binoculars .

@@106277867 @1677867/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> " If you were just entering the affiliate industry now , knowing what you already know , how would you launch a successful business ? Where would you start ? " <p> This is a question I get asked time and time again , particularly by those looking to cross in to affiliate marketing on a shoestring budget . I understand the concerns . Not wanting to waste a single dollar is an admirable show of frugality , if hopelessly unrealistic . <p> However , condensing my hindsight in to a reliable plan for somebody elses future is not particularly practical . <p> There are many things Ive learnt by starting an affiliate business . Most importantly , the need to play to my strengths . <p> When you step back from the industry and forget that affiliate marketing exists , you can find a great deal of clarity by simply asking yourself : " What do I have to offer ? What can I do for other people that would make some kind of difference ? " <p> These are very fundamental questions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many optimists are craving to hear about . <p> But its only by understanding your strengths , by grasping what you have to offer , that you can possibly think about creating a business that will be valuable five or ten years from now . <p> If you fail to recognise your strengths and passions , I can almost guarantee that your success will hinge on chance . You 'll adopt the scattergun approach to Internet Marketing where projects look impressive on paper , but leave you feeling empty on the first day of production . <p> I could advise new affiliates to go and build a website about losing weight with the latest jungle superberry , because obviously there 's plenty of money to be made in that particular niche . But I 'd be doing them a massive injustice . <p> You could expect those excited affiliates to go away , bust out their credit cards , snap up domains and hosting , and maybe even come back two weeks later with a shiny WordPress ready to sell some berries . <p> The problem is that most new affiliates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More to the point , the reason they find to justify such a splurge of berry related research is that it could potentially make them money . They will build websites about random crap because there 's a bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow . But where is the passion ? <p> You ca n't be passionate about money forever . Its a paradox . Eventually you end up with enough of it to be back to square one . <p> The biggest lesson Ive learnt is that even if there is a bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow , even if your berries website does make you a great deal of money , its not going to leave you feeling 100% satisfied . The only work that will leave you feeling 100% satisfied is work that you actually care about . <p> This is a ridiculous argument for many affiliates to understand . Who needs to feel satisfied when the money is in the bank and you 're still in your boxer shorts at 1pm ? <p> Its not a question of failing to appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've always wanted to be a writer , and so I use affiliate marketing as a mechanism to monetize the passion I have for writing . <p> My whiteboards used to be littered with whichever projects were likely to put money in my pocket , even if the thought of getting the work done was enough to make me strangle a kitten in my sleep . <p> Sooner or later , the mindset grows thin . You find yourself naturally gravitating to the ideas that stir an emotion or excitement more sustainable than the appeal of making money . You ultimately realise that easy , profitable and sustainable can never exist . <p> I hope that one day the Internet Marketing bubble bursts , and were all forced to abandon the ridiculous exact match domain projects that came about simply because we saw a micro opportunity , or the thousands of Ezine processed articles , written by experts who are only actually expert in the art of getting to an opportunity first . <p> My number one piece of advice for any affiliate looking to break in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business plan for a brick and mortar store , not a website that can be quietly consigned to history at the first sniff of a challenge . Then ask , " What can I see myself happily working on every day for as long as it takes to succeed ? " <p> Nail down your passion , research the market , and then do a better job of servicing it than the thousands of Internet Marketers wearing expert masks in disguise . <p> It might take a while for the industry to correct itself , but when it does , the affiliates who are truly passionate about their objectives will have a much greater incentive to stay ahead than Mr. Exact Match Domain who could n't give a shit . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Pick up a copy of Premium Posts Volume 1 if you like the content on this blog .

@@106277868 @1677868/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Your bullshit-o-meter is probably looking for one good reason to close the page so Ill cut to the chase . Scaling a successful campaign is the secret to success . And its not even a secret . But you 're here now , so allow me to continue . <p> One of the questions I get asked a lot , normally by non-affiliate friends , is " How much do you spend on advertising in a day ? " . If you have n't trained yourself to fire back with " As much as I can " , then there 's something fatally flawed in your mindset . <p> A key reason why some affiliates fail to take their earnings to the next level is simply a lack of ambition . A willingness to settle for X/day and not re-evaluate targets when they 've reached them . <p> I have to admit , I was guilty of this same flaw when I first started marketing . Back when rebills were as common as the sun rising in the east , I was milking a cash cow for more money than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the instinctive " super affiliate " trait of chasing the maximum profit . You have to think big to win big . <p> I was trapped in the salary mindset . I saw that if I continued to earn X/day , I 'd have made X/month . And that figure , being a mind-blowing leap from my work wages at the time , was enough to kill my ambition . I did n't  look to scale my campaigns any further than I was already happy with . You can probably see where I 'm going with this . <p> A lot of marketers end up frustrated or beating themselves up over their failures to match the success of higher earners and bigger ballers . Maybe this is you . But I can guarantee one difference in their attitude to yours . They never stopped redefining their goals . They never stopped looking to scale their campaigns . <p> Great ideas do not run on tap . A winning concept is n't going to slap you in the face over morning coffee every day of the week . So when you find something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One successfully scaled campaign will pay for months of failed concepts . And this is how many super affiliates operate . I 'm elbowing myself in the balls at every mention of the term " super affiliate " here , because its a fucking joke and a definition invented to keep the Warrior Forum ecosystem alive . <p> How many times have you had a successful campaign producing profit that you 're happy with , looked at your options for scaling , and dismissed an idea because its too much work for too little return ? You 're happy with what you 're currently earning , right ? That satisfaction can kill ambition . And it will kill your ability to grow your business . <p> There are several steps to scaling a campaign , and I 'm going to outline my usual thought process when I 've found an idea that 's making me money . Note that these points are catered more towards social traffic . If you 're a PPC player and you ca n't think of a way to scale your campaign , you 're a retard . <p> 1 What other age demographics can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is producing 200-300% ROI . It all started with one ad targeting American 30-40 year olds . One week on and Ive now adjusted the copy and images to target Americans of all ages from 21-65 . I could have lived quite comfortably off the original campaign . It required research in to different offers but the concept was a winner . <p> 2 Can I develop the same concept for the other gender ? <p> Many of you running dating ads are guilty of this . The majority of affiliate marketers are male . We have this nasty habit of targeting males as an instinctive step towards what we know we can relate to . Are you settling for 50% of what you could be earning if you opened your mind to targeting the fairer sex ? <p> 3 What happens if I raise my bid prices ? <p> Are you one of the many marketers who starts bidding low and slowly raises the price until you 've reached a level of volume you 're happy with ? If you 're producing 100% ROI , you have absolutely no excuse not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't  settle for the lowest bid that hits your magic profit number . If you have the luxury of bidding higher and staying profitable , DO IT . Basement bidding will only work until somebody comes along with an equally good concept and the balls to pay more for the traffic . <p> 4 Can I take the campaign in to English-speaking international markets ? <p> Do I even need to stress this one ? CPA offers do n't  have to be restricted to the United States . I know affiliates who earn crazy money and havent generated so much as a single lead in North America . If you have a winning concept , it should be common sense that scaling in to other English speaking countries is likely to raise your profits . Look for similar offers and bring your campaigns to Canada , UK , Australia , New Zealand , Ireland and South Africa . With the right offer , you may even be able to hit Asian markets with large numbers of English speakers . <p> 5 Can I be bothered to get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you 're going to start shaking a lot of your competition . Only a small percentage of affiliates make the effort to translate their campaigns in to foreign languages . It just so happens that the small percentage usually consists of some of the smartest and most profitable marketers out there . With cheaper traffic and much less competition , I think you already know that you COULD scale internationally if you wanted to . Its whether you can be bothered to take those extra steps . <p> 6 Can I take my successful campaigns to other similar traffic sources ? <p> This is the final step to successful scaling as far as Im concerned . Youve maxed out the age demographics . Youve adjusted your offers and creatives for different international markets . What next ? Its at this point where I take a moment to glance over the test data that Ive accumulated in the time that its taken me to expand a campaign as far as I already have . I 'll take the best performing creatives those with the highest ROI and I 'll use them as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classic example , let 's say you 've got a PPV campaign producing the kind of profit margins that keep your bed wet at night . Youve optimized and developed a list of URL targets that produce consistent results . Where can you go from here ? Ive been in situations like this before where I 've explored the URL target a little further and noticed that it actually has Content Network placements on the same page . <p> Easy money ! <p> Even without content network placements , if you 've found a really obscure URL that drives converting PPV traffic to an offer can you get in touch with the webmaster ? How about paying for a single banner placement on that page ? When you consider that a large number of the visitors do n't  actually have Vomba installed to spring your pop-ups , a banner placement is likely to catch the rest of the traffic . I 've said it over and over again but there are many ways to skin the cat . <p> Once you learn how to successfully port your campaigns across various traffic sources and advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a million great ideas to be a super affiliate . One good idea , developed and scaled as far as it can go , will usually put you ahead of your peers . <p> I 'd recommend you check out this extensive list of traffic sources for ideas of where to scale your campaigns . Scaling is n't just the secret to earning more money . Its the secret to a stable and well diversified affiliate business . If you 're working in this industry without ambition , it wont be long until somebody jacks your good ideas and buys a new yacht with them . Make every winning concept count . <h> Like this post ? <p> Finch Sells is the anti-typical affiliate marketing blog , designed and written for real affiliates .

So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite amusing = One question though about scaling . Say I want to target the German market through PPV and some dating offers . Is there still volume if I use MediaTraffic ? Or are there german companies where you can buy cheap PPV traffic ? Thanks for your time . <p> @PPV Newbie Its a good question , but I have n't heard of too many native foreign PPV platforms . You will be able to generate German traffic using MediaTraffic , although probably not as much as you could for the UK . <p> Best thing to do is contact the main PPV networks and ask for a breakdown of what percentage of users in their inventory are from each country . From my experience , some of the network reps can be pretty retarded when it comes to knowing where their userbase is located . But you should be able to get a rough idea . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

@@106277871 @1677871/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Probably not . But that 's because you speak English like most affiliates . This is what happens when an affiliate tries to scale his campaigns in to a different country without bothering to translate them properly . <p> They end up reading like they 've been crafted by Robert Patrick on a bad day . <p> You may snigger , but these type of creatives are not unusual at all . Many affiliates who dare to venture in to foreign markets are hopelessly aided by Google Translations and a tendency to fuck up even the simplest of sentences . <p> Google Translations is about as trustworthy as my old shortcuts in French class . I hold the proud distinction of passing a French oral exam despite my speech being littered with random outburts of German . How could I screw something up so badly , you ask ? Very bloody easily , with the unreliable assistance of poorly programmed word-for-word translation software . <p> If you want your ad creatives to look genuine , and not thrown together with the style of a madlib machine , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you check in to One Hour Translation for small jobs , or hire yourself a cheap translator on CraigsList if you like your outsourcing to be more personal . <p> Pro Tip : Hire the best translator for the job . This is n't a power trip . Try not to allow your judgment to be clouded by 17 year old Macedonian school girls who claim " Of course , I can speak fluent Japaneseyou look so cute ! " . You think I 'm joking ? Spend 10 minutes recruiting for jobs on CraigsList and you 'll feel distinctly more ordinary for the effort . <p> Its important to translate your creatives correctly , not only to drive a greater CTR , but to keep your aura of professionalism in tact . <p> I 've heard several horror stories of companies refusing to pay for leads and sales that were delivered legitmately , simply because the ad creatives were poorly constructed in a foreign language . It harms the brand , they claim . I 'd be inclined to agree . Though refusing to pay the previous leads strikes me as a little draconian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naughty boy , you " should have been enough . But alas , these situations can be avoided by putting care in to your ad copy . <p> Let 's say you have the best creatives , translated in to pitch perfect lingo that the natives can understand . What is the next step for getting a campaign profitable in a foreign market ? <p> I cant stress highly enough the importance of cultural relevance . <p> Once upon a time , I submitted a Jewish dating ad with the headline " Girlfriend For Christmas ? " . It was n't until about 4 days later that I felt , for the first time in my life , sufficiently more stupid than a Facebook intern that I would quit my bitching over disapprovals . For a few hours , at least . <p> Having run dating ads in almost every continent , I can safely say that the tone , language and imagery of a profitable campaign will vary drastically across the board . But , yes , if you were wondering , boobs are still king . <p> If you 're advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to flood your ad imagery with scantily clad hobags of the American Pie realm . Different countries have different perceptions of beauty . And although dating throws up some of the biggest differences in culture , there are examples to be found in practically every vertical under the sun . <p> Let 's say you 're advertising an e-cigarette offer . The difference in tone between advertising to midwest America and the center of Amsterdam is going to be quite severe . As somebody who has sampled both of those parts of the world , I often wish for the two cultures to share a dinner party together where I could watch as a fly on the wall . <p> The media in each region portrays a vastly different image of smoking . If you approach your Netherlands campaign with the wording of a Midwest state dweller who knows only what he sees on Oprah , your ads are probably going to be met with a lot of confused Dutch stares . Perception , in advertising , is everything ! <p> Its important to approach your international ads with just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If an offer does n't  convert after 6000 impressions , that does n't  mean an entire country has spoken . I only cracked the Singaporean gaming market after learning how to exclude Andrew " The Impression Whore " Wee from my targeting . Patience and perseverance are pretty much par for the course in any kind of Facebook marketing these days . <p> I also have to point out that dating offers designed specifically for the native country regularly outperform those that have simply been opened up to the new market and translated across with haste . I cant pinpoint why , but it probably has something to do with a better understanding of the culture . Be sure to test all your options before confining another campaign to the scrapheap . <p> What ca n't be argued is that there are still TONS of opportunities to launch profitable campaigns outside the popular trifecta of USA/UK/Can . There are times where I cry myself to sleep that I never took French class seriously . If you have the knowledge of a second language up your sleeve , what are you waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have about 47 bilingual Macedonian schoolgirls that you 're welcome to borrow* 114273 @qwx974273 <p> If you 're looking for a network to serve your international campaigns , EWA has an insane selection to choose from . Last time I checked , they had 580+ dating offers from practically every corner of the world . And that 's just dating . I run traffic through EWA daily .

Doing your homework enough will make a successful campaign . You may even find some information , during your research , for a great vertical you wouldn+GGt have known about too . <p> I was in Italy recently and just looking at adverts / billboards etc. aimed at the English speakers among us you can tell they have not been done professionally . E.g. Lidl " Thank you for your shopping " OK so you know what they mean , but they are obviously not written by a native English speaker , and when it comes to any sort of marketing it is essential that your message is clear . <p> I work for a translation company , so I know a bit about this . There are 2 key things you need to do when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because someone speaks more than one language does NOT qualify them to be a translator , and 2/ make sure that the translator is translating INTO their native language , and not from it . Follow those rules and you should be OK . <p> *SHAMELESS PLUG* And of course use a reputable company like R L Translations and you will have no worries = <p> Like you said , social distance and culture are huge It changes the stories people tell themselves to justify their actions Theres quite a bit of real research done around this . Wish I could point at it off the cuff . For one , Robert Cialdini quotes some of it in his books . I remember a huge Excel spreadsheet with social metrics across countries Buried in my MBA junk subdirectory I 'll dig up and share . Laughed my ass off with " planning to copulate " and your Jewish date for Christmas . <p> I did a little non-English dating on facebook awhile back . I made a little money . <p> I used the following trick to " write " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offer you 're promoting , and try to find the English match of it if there is one . If you can find an English match , look for *where* it has certain dating keywords . ( works if you do n't  have an English equivalent , but slower ) <p> Now on the foreign version copy the text from those same parts of the page and plug it into Google translator . If it roughly translates into dating related words in English , keep it . If not , keep trying . <p> Take these dating related words that you cant read and plug them into a Google search for the target country ( search " google countryname " for the right place ) . You will probably see a few AdWords ads for dating . Copy their ad text and titles . <p> Repeat this a few times with different words or phrases . You can use the ad texts you 've found as search terms also . You can probably deduce certain more-targeted words after a bit and search them too . <p> Remember in other languages words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word1 in a phrase " word1 word2 " might have a totally different meaning when alone . <p> Since the ad titles and ad body text are separate , you can treat those as separate sentences to use , so you can mix and match . <p> It takes longer and is less flexible than hiring a good translator , but it works most of the time . Drawback is you might end up copying some other affiliates GOOGLE TRANSLATED ad text and have no idea ! Haha ! <p> Dug and found the data on cultural differences and posted it to my blog . Not quite as funny as Finch and something to keep in mind : No amount of data can replace the common sense of a native of the place you are trying to advertise to . Go make some friends ! <p> Hey Man , Ok so let 's say I 'm new and understand the sea of misinformation that is out there .. Man so much time wasted I 'm asken a sincere question Bro ..

I would rather be Jack , hands down . What if the expansion potential was n't in Germany , but rather in Belgium or Australia ? Guess what , Bill is SOL . Worst case scenario , all Jack has to do is pause the campaigns that are n't  profitable and then focus all his attention in the new market . Pausing a campaign takes a few seconds . You 're giving contradicting advice . On the one hand , you say volume is king and you should always be looking to scale . That 's exactly what Jack is doing by exploring additional geos . Not Bill . Next , why in the #@&amp;$*# would you pause a campaign that is profitable , even if it only nets you $10/day ? If its not worth your time , simply let it run without interference until its no longer profitable . This takes zero effort to maintain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . You might scoff at $10/day , but imagine if you had 10 such campaigns going . Thats now $3k/month for which you have to do no work . <p> Like I said , you do need to explore different geos to find one worth chasing , but running a portfolio of campaigns across multiple countries is always harder to scale than one country keyed in and portable to other sources . Yes , volume is king that only applies if its concentrated in a single market . You get no advantage by fragmenting it across the globe . <p> If I had 10 successful $10/day campaigns running , that 's exactly the type of situation that leads to managing a portfolio of unscalable campaigns . The margins slip with time . There 's no such thing as $3K/month in CPA arbitrage where you do n't  have to do any work . <p> Even if you 've mentally prepared yourself to pause campaigns when they lose profitability , there 's always a temptation to keep the small earners alive by switching an offer , changing a LP , etc etc . Just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little extreme in his example to make a point and teach a lesson , but overall the philosophy is good . <p> here 's the major flaw in your thinking : you believe these small campaigns take no effort . <p> Each campaign in adult means you have to upload creatives every few days ( banner blindness ) , you have to deal with offers pausing or capping , and you have to worry about potential bidding wars . <p> Wasting time and energy on $10 a day campaigns is what prevents from spending time to make that $90 Germany campaign , into a $900 a day campaign . <p> Once a campaign is large enough , it only takes a few tweaks to 2x the campaign . Being the best means you have competitive EDGES . How are you suppose to have the EDGES and ADVANTAGES if you 're worried about $10 a campaigns ? <p> Theres two different mindsets in affiliate marketing . The guys who make millions a year have a DOMINATION mindset , while " Jack " has a " survival " mindset . <p> The money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being the best in them . <p> When you look at mobile offers , there 's a huge array of non-adult stuff and growing fast .

I think its probably the most accessible though . <p> If you 've launched 5 campaigns and one is profitable , then you 're doing better than most . <p> Every traffic source is different , as is every offer you choose to run on it . <p> Before you run a campaign on a new traffic source , you should do an audit of what other advertisers are running on there . Is there affiliate activity ? If so , there 's your proof that the platform works . Next step is to research it heavily . Contact the network and extract as much info as you can on what other performance marketers are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what you see with your own eyes . Access the networks websites using a proxy in different countries . Try to nail down any signal of recurring offers , countries of high affiliate activity , etc etc . Once you have all of this mapped down , then you can go ahead and start spending money on your own campaigns . <p> As for bot traffic depends on what type of bot traffic you mean . If its fake clicks and you 're running CPC , then send a report to the network and demand a refund . If its dud impressions , blacklist as many of the offending targets as you can . Mobile networks still have a long way to go with this problem to be honest . Hence the need for a bigger testing budget vs. web campaigns . <p> There were only one bot for this time , but I am monitoring its activity . Bot publisher that do n't  click on LP . The bad thing with voluum is that you could n't see and maintain raw data . So you could n't do reporting to publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move on it ( in case it has SQL access ) . The thing is that newbei is seeking for optimised server for low price ) <p> Well said . The key takeaway from this post is FOCUS . With laser focus you will be surprised how much you can get a single campaign to go from break even to profitable . The scaling shouldnt happen until you have a rock solid steady base with killer split tested creatives . <p> Thanks Finch , you always deliver quality . I have been struggling a lot with scaling and i am afraid it might run me to the ground . As a noob i was happy to start getting the hang of things and be able to create a campaign and get it to profit but i cat seem to go any further . <p> I mostly run Pop/Redirect and Landing page and interstitial ads . I cant scale to bigger similar traffic sources as they all require $1000 plus commitment which i cant commit to to at the moment . The few that i have tried end up doinglike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies off after a while . <p> ( 1 ) Is it advisable to port campaigns like this to very different traffic sources ( pop to banner ) ?

@@106277874 @1677874/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> The riches are so great in this industry that the virtues of patience are easily forgotten . <p> If you 're a new affiliate , trying to come to terms with the challenges ahead , there are two commodities you 're going to need in abundance patience and vision . In the hope of having one successful campaign , many affiliates test a hundred of them . When they all fail miserably , the " testing " process is typically so sketchy that to find a golden nugget worth chasing would be like running your hands through elephant shit thrown at a wall . <p> Let 's take the newbie dating affiliate who calls this a working day : <p> He knows that a lot of affiliates are making money from dating offers . So he picks out the best dating offer , based on his AMs recommendation , plugs a few ads in to Facebook , targets ages 35-45 , and blows $50 on a handful of conversions that barely break even . <p> In the face of a loss , he realizes he does n't  want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He picks another dating offer , based on a recommendation he sees in one of Nick Throlsons park video blogs , switches his ads over to Plentyoffish , targets ages 45-65 , and blows $50 on zero conversions . <p> No conversions ? Oh shit , it must be the advertiser scrubbing , right ? So he chooses another dating offer and relaunches his Plentyoffish campaign . But not before completely overhauling his landing page , targeting a different country and launching at 6am in the morning when any singleton in said market has already whacked off for the night and signed out of POF . <p> Still no conversions . <p> He then thinks to himselffuck this shit , there 's no money in affiliate marketing . <p> The ability to test variables methodically ranks right at the top of the list for " desired qualities " in an affiliate marketer . Its no good to have the best ads , the best targeting or the best landing pages . They have to function as a system , cogs turning as one , slowly grinding towards the end goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an offer is converting well for other affiliates , stick with it . Hunt out the traffic source where ads appear most regularly for that offer . Now you have your two most important variables nailed down : <p> A good offer , and a profitable traffic source . <p> There are still a ton of variables , and its your responsibility to test them thoroughly and transparently . There is absolutely no point in split testing the performance of two different age brackets if one of those age brackets is being redirected through to a different landing page . Every variable matters . And until you regain control of your variables , you 'll never truly know what is working , what is n't , and what money you 're leaving on the table . <p> I think most affiliates know and readily admit to the importance of split testing . But not many are patient enough to follow through in their execution . Usually because they either a ) find success and have little ambition to improve on it , or b ) start to panic when their daily ROI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expecting miracle results overnight , or even just results , is the classic mistake of many a former affiliate . <p> In terms of why youre most likely to fail , a lack of patience is second only to complete disregard for the challenges ahead . <p> I often use a metaphor that finding success in this industry is like climbing a mountain . Success is there at the peak , but you have to be patient . You have to build your base camps along the way and prove that you can overcome the inevitable challenges . Finding a profitable campaign might be your first step , but sustaining it is another . Surviving through the next FTC crackdown or dealing with a banned Facebook account might scupper your best laid plans along the way . Setting your eyes on the summit and ignoring the beast in front of you is called living in cloud cuckoo land . <p> Reaching the summit , discovering those riches and having your dream business , requires acclimatisation along the way . It ca n't be achieved in one nights work . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about spending $5 , well let 's just say you 're going to be stuck at low altitude until you progress beyond those fears . <p> Most of us are aware of the challenges . But If you think your latest idea makes you Reinhold Messner , capable of scaling any peak without putting in the hard hours of acclimatisation and learning from your falls you 're going to get blown off the mountain . There are many failed routes tough challenges before you ever find a way to the top . <p> Some are self-inflicted the mistakes you will inevitably make along the way , never a bad thing if you learn from them . <p> Some are caused by others everybody in this industry is hoping to use you as a stepping stone to their own summit . <p> Some are caused by fortune fucking with you Suck it up and deal with it . <p> Whatever the reason , if you want to enjoy the riches on that summit , you need to respect what comes before it . There 's no such thing as a success formula in this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodically ruling out what does n't  work . <p> This is what many of us have done over the years . We rarely have the foresight to know when a campaign will become profitable . But its having the patience to learn enough about what NOT to do . This comes with experience , patience and vision . <p> Every mistake you make needs to be another hazard avoided in the future . And every variable you test needs to be another factor eliminated from your monetary equation . Affiliate marketing is very simple if you take a methodical approach . The problem is that most newbie marketers have a love affair with the desired results rather than the consequences of their actual actions . They stare at the summit instead of concentrating on their next step . Most become former affiliates. 114274 @qwx974274 <p> If you 're working in the dating market , check out Adsimilis .

The viagra spammer is simply an example of pushing the envelope too far . We can laugh at the poor conversion rates , but high traffic at a tiny cost is just another way of playing arbitrage .

The race to the bottom of bargain basement prices for skilled workers has shifted in a different direction , a little further east to be exact . <p> If you 're constantly on the hunt for cheap labour , youve probably already heard that Filipinos are doing it cheaper , and doing it better . Well , certainly if you 've spoken to enough Filipinos . <p> I am a firm believer in outsource arbitrage . If somebody abroad is willing to do work cheaply and to a high standard , I have no problems in taking business away from my own country . This has become widespread not just on a small business level , but in worldwide corporations that are desperate to maximise profits . <p> In an economic sense , its a disaster . How can America and the UK continue to thrive if jobs are being sent off-shore ? We hear a lot of media scaremongering about jobs not being created but everybody knows , this is bullshit . Jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour from a warmer climate . Its tough to envision a situation where that trend will be reversed . <p> So its on that basis that I recommend EasyOutsource as a good stomping ground for those looking to hire labour without paying the premium . <p> EasyOutsource was recommended to me by a friend when I asked him who had been responsible for the swish custom coding job behind one of his sites . I was pretty stunned when he told me the wages he was paying his staff , and it was much more competitive than the rates you typically see on Elance and oDesk . <p> EasyOutsource is free to use , and is essentially no more than a portal bringing buyers and service providers together . There are zero hoops to jump through . Just register a profile and post a job , or cruise through the profiles of workers and message them directly if you so wish . <p> Its very easy , though I can understand why serious project managers would have apprehension about dealing with workers in such an uncontrolled marketplace . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses relevance . Outsourcing is an art . You can not expect to simply bagsy a foreign worker , throw them a brief and expect it delivered to spec without any hiccups along the way . This applies to EasyOutsource and every other freelancing site on the planet . <p> You really need to spend time weeding out the pretenders from the legitimate workers who can add to your business . Get them on Skype and ask to speak directly to the individuals who will be responsible for the work . <p> I once took on a highly skilled University graduate who wrote like a fluent subcontinental Shakespeare in her briefing . I was impressed , almost shamed by her writing . But that means very little if she delegates the actual work to her bumbling school children and their shaky grasp of Indlish .

Ive been looking into outsourcing to the Philippines for some time , but have n't taken the plunge yet . I 'm still dealing primarily with Indian workers . This is mostly due to not knowing how to deal with the Filipino culture and already having connections in India . I 've heard dealing with Filipinos is very different than working with Indians , but that they are awesome once you learn the ropes .. <p> For reference there is another job board for Filipinos called onlinejobs.ph .

Eventually , you can achieve the leverage you need , but it takes a bit of investment . <p> very bad outsourcing site the freelancers there try to rip you off .

@@106277880 @1677880/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> One of the things those gurus love to preach is the usefulness of targeting your Facebook ads with keyword sets . If I hear one more promise that " yeah its easy , you just like add some keywords , and then you get a crazy high CTR " , I 'm going to stab my eyeballs out with the half-eaten chicken dippers on my desk . Its only easy if you know where to start . And most people do n't  . So let 's start with the basics . <p> I 'm going to show you an example of how keyword targeting worked quite nicely for me last year . The clue for why Im willing to part with this information is hidden at the end of the last sentence . It worked last year . It might work now , it might not . One thing you 'll learn quickly about keyword targeting is that it has a much smaller scope for scaling . Keyword targeting can make you money , but clever demographic targeting can make you rich . Great marketers have mastered both . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bidding CPM , were paying every time our ad is displayed no matter who views it , and no matter how relevant they are to the offer . Simple logic dictates that we want to reduce the number of stray eyeballs catching our message to only those who are likely to qualify as potential customers . We can do this by using keywords to search for users whove added certain information to their profile . <p> A fine example was Many Body Theorys post last month , showing how to create a dating ad on Facebook for insane ROI . The gist of the post was that in order to find people whod potentially be interested in joining a dating site , we could add " zoosk " to our keyword set and target only users whove mentioned or liked Zoosk on their profile . <p> Suddenly , your target market is reduced from a few million to 30,000 users . The CTR will improve with a great leap but the problem is obvious . How do we scale beyond 30,000 users ? Even if every single user popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is where you have to get creative with your keyword sets and learn what I like to call persuasion via association . <p> here 's an example of persuasion via association : <p> Youll noticed I 've blurred her face out . This is a standard trick I use at the end of the night , after a few too many pints , when I 've failed to get lucky and instead dragged home a London ghetto rat . Blurring helps , kids . Especially in the morning . <p> On a serious note , I 've been working recently to ensure that I only use images if I own the creative license to them . Its a massively ignored problem in the affiliate world . And although I 'm not perfect some of my creatives still need replacing you should think twice before sourcing directly from Bing . Youve got shit in your pants and if the owner of the original image catches a whiff , you 'll probably hear all about it . <p> Anyway , why is the example above effective ? Put simply , it is n't . Not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me show you how it comes together <p> See where were going ? All of the keywords are closely related to Manchester United Football Club . Facebook has made a big song and dance about approving ads that sell " unrelated features " in a product . You could argue that Manchester United has absolutely nothing to do with Cupid , Zoosk or whatever dating site you want to promote . But there 's no mention in the ad copy . The only reference we have comes from the girl in our image . Shes wearing a United jersey with that familiar MySpace camera angle that works so well on dating ads . <p> I 've experimented a lot with this on Facebook , and it still proves to be successful even after the latest blitzing round of guidelines changes . <p> The eyes of single , male , Manchester United fans are much more likely to light up when they see an attractive girl flaunting the jersey of their favourite team . Its a double attention grabber . And if you 're subtle about it , you should be able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your destination landing page . And that 's where the money is made with this kind of technique . <p> When I talk about using persuasion via association , there 's a thin line to be obeyed . Capturing the attention of the user with a little association is one thing . Obliterating your quality score by sending a bunch of leads that think they 're going to a dating website with thousands of sexy female Manchester United fansthats a different business altogether . <p> The key is to design a landing page that references your original message you might find other female United fans when you join us and build a greater more powerful urge in the readers mind . A more powerful urge could be well Ive been looking around for a girl that shares my interests and I cant find one , maybe I should give this site a shot ? <p> Its a lot easier to execute your sales pitch once you 've grabbed the users attention . And you would be amazed how something as simple as an attractive girl wearing the jersey of a guys favourite football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Suddenly the service being advertised is cool and compatible . It feels like something where his kind belong . Unfortunately the entire concept will fall apart if you do n't  get the landing page pieced together correctly . I 'm not going to share my tips for sealing the deal so to speak , so you 'll just have to get testing for yourself . <p> While this is a very small and niche example , I hope you can appreciate how marketing with keyword sets does n't  have to be so linear . You do n't  have to stick to a favourite football team that your campaign is based around . It could be a favourite band , a certain hobbythe possibilities are pretty endless . As long as this retarded craze for people to " like " shit on Facebook continues , there are always going to be opportunities for marketers to herd individuals in to groups . <p> If you can find a mutual interest in a large demographic , you can write the kind of laser targeted ad copies that will demand and receive your readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest service to offer spying capabilities over Facebooks most profitable ads .

You said you tend to use images that you own the licensing on does that mean you take them yourself or you use stock images ? All the stock images I have seen look too professional , but maybe I 'm looking in the wrong places . <p> Thanks for being one of the few bloggers who provide actual good info that is explained well . <p> Could you go into more detail on where we can buy or how you go about getting images you own the creative license too ? The example of the man united chick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Istockphoto is a choice but they do n't  have the amateur female pic look and your going pay $20+ for an image . So doing a small test on FB for dating is going cost you a few $100 just for the images if you want a small test . Now multiple that by many campaigns and you are spending thousands each week on images in addition to ppc spend . <p> What is the concern with using images you do n't  have the license to ? It obv seems wrong but what can they really do ? I was thinking they could sue for damages and maybe go after any profits you made by using their images . But if that really was the case , lawyers would be having a field day going after the millions of people using images they do n't  own rights too . But I 've not read of this , only thing I heard is people had to take images down . <p> Could you provide some insight into why you are worried about the images ? I agree its good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences and by using them you put yourself at a disadvantage to your competitors and cost your self lots of money ; what 's the reason to do it ? <p> When I grow up , I hope to be as famous as one of those e-celebs in the IM world . There are many out there with their blogs sucking the dick off all the other e-celebs . You suck my dick and I 'll suck yours later kinda thing . It feels good on the ego you know ? <p> Really clever and sophisticated approach , although I made bad experiences with Facebook Ads , too , especially when it comes to selling tangible goods . Prices are much higher than with Adwords and conversions lower . So , its a great place to advertise , but not for every niche . <p> @Karl My main concern with jacking random images is n't so much from being on the end of legal threats personally , but because I know dating sites are starting to take it more seriously . <p> Match are starting to crack the whip and stating that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could say that I 'm paranoid , but I do n't  like giving an advertiser a reason to refuse to pay my leads . <p> Regarding the inflated prices , my advice and again its not very politically correct would be to stick to using stock photo sites but simply use the images without buying them . Its much less likely that you 're going to get called out on using images that have been taken from an actual stock photo site . And on many of these stock sites , the watermarks are positioned in a way that is n't going to affect you hacking a 110+80 out of them . <p> " The key is to design a landing page that references your original message .. " I 'd also point out that a custom lp that references your original message not only increases your CTR% and conversions but is essential for getting the ad approved in the first place .

@@106277881 @1677881/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> CPA marketers like to divide the affiliate world in to six continents : dating , health , careers , gaming , mobile and zip submits . <p> These are the verticals that get talked about almost constantly . If you log in to an affiliate networks control panel , its likely that the hottest offers those pushed above the fold will fall in to these categories . <p> If you 're launching CPA campaigns , it makes sense to stick to the tried and tested , because you 're likely to get better support from your networks most of whom are very familiar with the six continents of markets above . <p> Networks are better at providing support for offers they know , the offers they see a million other publishers promoting . Naturally , there 's a downside . Saturated offers are also seen as past their peak . By the time Average Joe is throwing his money at Offer X , the initial conversion rates are likely to have tapered to compensate for the demand . The best time to promote an offer is nearly always before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look at the state of the CPA world and draw the conclusion that its a shrinking pond with an overflow of hungry fish . That 's my view , and its why I 'm spending most of my time diversifying away from CPA . Product creation is my number one focus right now , shortly followed by the development of websites that cash in on trends ahead of time . <p> Stop asking " What 's Hot ? " <p> In the last round of Premium Posts , I included a section on tax season offers . Tax offers are the perfect example of a money machine that materialises as surely as the sun rises . It solves a real-world demand every single year . <p> Everybody hates taxes , nobody likes filing them , and many will shit bricks at the thought of making a mistake and somehow ending up in the slammer on fraud charges . A resource that takes the pain out of filing taxes is a nailed down success , year in year out , for as long as taxes remain a pain in the arse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real-world demand that passes them by . They 're far too slow to react . And what they 're doing wrong is precisely that : reacting . <p> The affiliates who pocket the most are those who are planning ahead . While the rest of the world is busy scrummaging for festive tinsel borders to drape on its dating creatives , the long-term planner is already working on tax season creatives . And not just creatives , but entire websites . <p> I 'm not normally the greatest advocate of search engine traffic , but what would you give to have a site at the top of Google for a tax-related keyword right now ? Unfortunately , ranking on Google takes time , patience and a painful self-awareness of your small man syndrome . <p> Most high volume tax keywords have been swept up already by publishers on far greater budgets than your own . Its one thing to spot and prepare for a future trend , its another to launch a website that gets the traction necessary to capitalise on it . <p> Target the trends within seasonal booms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction was to register a domain that welded his name with Halloween . I knew right away that Jacko themed Halloween costumes were going to be all the rage in 4 months time , so I acted as fast as I could to lay the groundwork before most other affiliates even turned their attention to the season . <p> It sounds like a slightly disturbed mindset to adopt . The greatest pop icon of all time dies , and I 'm already pillaging his legacy for commission . But if you do n't  look forward , you will constantly find yourself reacting to What 's Hot . And when you react to what 's hot , its too late . <p> Sure enough , I was able to pocket a lot of money from my Jacko costume groundwork . By the time Halloween rolled around , I was in sucking up traffic mode , while anybody reacting to the trend would have been dawdling in the planning and execution phase . <p> Even when planning in advance , you have to be realistic . Had I focused my efforts on targeting Halloween 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other companies with bigger budgets and the same foresight . So I focused all my efforts on one angle instead a dead Michael Jackson . <p> Competition decreases as your focus increases . <p> The same concept applies to tax season , Valentines Day , Mothers Day , Fathers Day , Christmas and virtually any seasonal trend . If you do n't  have a planning cycle that runs several months ahead of the average consumer , good luck reacting fast enough to make money from him . <p> You will make life a lot easier by specialising on a trend within the trend . Its unrealistic to think that even 4 months of preparation is going to be enough to dominate tax-related search engine traffic , which is why you need to segregate keywords and target the low hanging fruit . <p> Get a whiteboard and list every conceivable concern related to tax season , from every possible angle . You need only target one angle effectively to make a lot of money , and you will reduce the competition by doing so . <p> Use the AdWords Keyword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition . These are your low hanging fruit . <p> Once you have your trend within a trend , its time to make a commitment to work that is n't going to produce an immediate return , but hopefully will produce a steady passive income in the future . <p> Register a domain closely tied to your chosen angle ( exact match if possible ) , and get your sales funnel in place either by building your own product , or promoting a stable offer that is n't going to cap out when the season arrives . Then inundate the site with fresh quality content and a constant barrage of quality backlinks . <p> If this sounds like donkey work , its because that 's precisely what it is . <p> Your goal should be to have a legitimate presence on the web , somewhere close to the top of Google , for a high volume keyword that brings in money on autopilot . With this animal of free traffic at your disposal , you can be much more flexible than the average CPA affiliate when it comes to payouts and margins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2012s tax season . But you can certainly build one for 2013 . In fact , there 's no harm in reacting to seasonal trends in 2012 , so long as you 're expecting to make a profit next year rather than next week . <p> Seasonal trends are sometimes a turn-off for affiliates . Not everybody likes the idea of making their money in one small boom period . So cover more than one trend . Build a website for a trend in each quarter . With good execution , you 'll never be more than 2 months away from your next money tap , and the cruel satisfaction that comes from watching everybody else rush to build what you have in a fraction of the time . <p> Most importantly of all , learn to stop reacting to What 's Hot . Focus on getting to market before the crowd reacts. 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Behold 98 pages of Outside The Box Marketing , conversion boosting strategies and tips that can actually make you money .

@@106277882 @1677882/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> The Affiliate Marketing business thrives around the belief that three qualities easy , profitable and sustainable are just waiting to be uncovered . Look at the average bizopp sales letter and you 'll see it summed up in a nutshell . <p> " How I Earn $6904/Week On My Laptop With One Simple Secret Trick ! " <p> Such a title ticks the three boxes that matter most to a sucker on the verge of quitting his day job to chase said dream . <p> Is it easy ? Have you not seen how well I mine on Runescape ? All Internet be easy to me . Is it profitable ? $6904/weekfuck , tell the kids were moving to Hawaii . Is it sustainable ? The guys Clickbank stats just keep rising . This time next year , well be trillionaires Rodders ! <p> Sarcasm may be dripping off this page , but make no mistake , this is the naive attitude that drives many an ebook launch . <p> In my opinion , only two of those qualities can ever exist in tandem . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it wont be very profitable . Or you can be driving huge profits for the long-term future , but it wont be particularly easy . <p> Then you have the most dangerous combination in our industry . <p> Easy and profitablebut absolutely not sustainable . <p> This could be applied to a Plentyoffish campaign that peaks and perishes in the space of a weekend , but there 's nothing spectacularly dangerous about that . More importantly , it could be applied to a number of darker marketing practices that many of us are now familiar with . <p> The fake blog is a great example of easy and profitable , because it pinpoints the reason why sustainability can never follow . <p> Our challenge , as affiliates , is to come up with new and inventive ways to reach the skeptic mind . The flog was mighty successful in blurring the lines between advertising and believable testimonial . Many would argue , myself included , that it was far too successful . If an advertising practice becomes so commonplace that any half arsed marketer can spin a profit from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until that practice becomes the most detested in the industry . <p> Did anybody expect such a profitable marketing trap to stay viable after affiliate marketers rushed to abandon conventional landing pages in favour of it ? Every legitimate business with a weight loss product to sell was going to react unfavourably to a bunch of cowboy affiliates stealing their market share . That 's your first problem . The second problem is the customer . <p> When one customer feels ripped off , not many people are going to pay attention . When thousands of customers feel ripped off , reputations start to suffer . In the space of a few months , the snowball effect of broken trust amplified by relentless affiliate campaigns had driven a successful marketing ploy to the precipice where it had to fail . <p> The flog itself , controversial as it was , neednt have crashed and burned as emphatically as it did . The marketing logic behind it was sound but ultimately too easy to execute , and too open to abuse from the affiliates who based their businesses around it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = definitely NOT sustainable . Anybody with a grasp of basic economics should be able to work that much out . <p> I 'm not trying to provide an obituary of the flog here , but rather a simple explanation of why " get rich quick " tactics will never be sustainable . They may exist , but they typically involve the bending of rules in such a way that the associated risk is never going to lead to the stress-free life in a hammock that you were promised in the stock photos . <p> If an easy moneymaking ploy becomes too profitable , it will draw attention from a ) The customers and b ) The competition . At this point , the ethics of the ploy will be called in to question . This is where they normally disintegrate . But even if your ethics are sound , the competition will soon catch on and copy . With increased competition comes less profitability or simply a much tougher time making money . <p> Easy , profitable and sustainable affiliate marketing campaigns are never going to be published in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pursuit of the same knowledge . It would be foolish to believe they even exist . <p> So you have to ask yourself : " What am I going to focus my business on ? " <p> Easy and sustainable without the lucrative rewards of more ambitious projects ? Sustainable and profitable with a receding hairline from the stress of finding the magic formula ? Easy and profitable and I 'll worry about the future when my luck runs out . <p> Its pretty obvious which category most affiliates fall in to . But is that through choice or a complete disregard to the sustainability of the marketing they practice ? Who knows , who cares . <p> For the rest of us , the challenge is n't simply to be profitable . But to be so profitable that we can afford Wayne Rooneys hair surgeon after finding that magic formula . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Lots of Ads is the latest service to offer spying capabilities over Facebooks most profitable ads .

Silicon-valley style web products focus on sustainable and profitable . With that said , I know someone who has a $7mm/year lead-gen empire covering all the major affiliate verticals , so I suppose it can be done in AM as well . <p> Regardless there is a similarity between all business models that go down the sustainable and profitable route <p> #1 . They require serious investment . Most likely you will not hit " sustainable and profitable " paydirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to do it without at least $50K of capital within your first year . I know there is a serious media buyer that just laughed at that number , but he does n't  represent the majority of affiliates . For most affiliates , $50k is still a lot of fucking money . Also , depending on how far you 're trying to go and how quickly you intend to get there , you 'll likely need a LOT more money than that . <p> #2 . They require a serious product . Whether your product is your site ( in the lead gen empire model ) or some kind of SaaS , it ca n't suck and you have to have a team of people working to improve it . In the direct response world , Billy Mays was very good at putting his name behind products that would n't be total shit &amp; could actually develop bonafide , respected brands . That 's why his name sold nearly everything he touched . <p> #3 . Profitable and sustainable requires some serious marketing knowhow . It is not the land of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that others are running on FB . As a matter of fact , you wo n't get there if you think that 's a good thing to spend your time on , period . True marketers , worthy of $XXX , XXX jobs at large companies/agencies ( keyword : worthy , personality differences aside ) are the ones capable of achieving this . Unlike certain aspects of internet marketing where you can " hack it , " there is no " hacking it " in achieving sustainable profitability it requires a person while a 360 degree understanding of what it means to market a product . <p> In short , I think " Profitable and Sustainable " is the realm of bonafide entrepreneurs . Thank you for helping me finally wrap my head around this . I shit you not , this is something that I think about every 1-2 days . <p> And I 'd also agree that it is possible to develop a profitable and sustainable business solely around affiliate marketing . Many networks are a tribute to that . But it certainly does n't  meet the criteria of being easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For affiliate marketing to be profitable and sustainable , it all comes back to developing valuable assets that stand on their own two feet . Either in your affiliate sites , or if you 're a network , by developing the kind of service that affiliates and advertisers are both going to enjoy . <p> Agreed . I remember diorex ( not sure if this guy is still alive or what ) writing that he has 100 people working for him that just test test test ads all the time . This is a sustainable business model . I 'm not sure I understand why these people would n't just steal his campaigns and go work for themselves , but apparently it can be done . If you have a fleet of fisherman , your bounty no longer depends on you personally fishing . <p> I know a guy who started out in affiliate marketing in 2006 or so , he hired 20 guys to just join affiliate networks and do 95% brand bidding all day . He paid them a small bonus based on what they made and gave them great benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made -1 million profit in year one . I would never in a million years imagine that hiring 10 guys to do that kind of thing would have resulted in them staying put and making millions for their employer rather than just doing it for themselves . But they did . Now he runs a web company with 150+ employees doing 100 million+ in revenue a year , all started from hiring a few guys to join networks and buy brand terms on Adwords . <p> Great post man . It all comes down to money . People put out products to make it and people put out money to buy the products to make it . One big cycle . <p> In my eyes , I would go with sustainable and profitable . Having a sustainable and profitable business is the ultimate goal and once you put in your time and hard work , you 'll figure out how to make it easier . <p> You know what would be really good content Finch ? Focusing specifically on how to take AM skills , relationships , and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lot of people become CPA advertisers or start networks , but not everyone does ( you for example ) and your thoughts on what you have done to diversify and create other kinds of value would be really enjoyable to read . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

Useless , time-consuming and mind numbing red tape , traffic and pollution , bone-headed visa policies , bone-headed Thai non-logic and paranoia in general , language barrier and rip-offs , crime , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate Farang but love your cashthis schizo-paranoia is very unpleasant to say the least . The easiest way to find that out is bumping into the local femaledom ! Which brings us to nightlife , which sucks ! A kindergarten attitude to drinks and closing times , but hey , if you from US or somewhere like that , then you must feel right at home ! There may or may not be extenuating circumstances like the cuisine , although I do n't  like chillis or insects in my diet which kinda cut out 90% of your choice right there . I already mentioned the paranoid attitude to drinking , and I do n't  do drugs , that leaves the women Well , I can only advise you to stay clear of the women , and no , not just for example because I was drugged on my very first nite in BKK , waaaaay back , and had 50K B ripped right off me , there are many other reasons to steer clear of the ladies there , too many to mention but my sole advice is to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I have met several hot Foreign girls there though and that is one goody . In short and summing up , Thailand is HELL , that is WHY I recommended Philippines , which I do again . Everything is exactly the opposite of Thailand . People are REALLY friendly and smiling and welcoming . You can really life the life you choose Yea , I know , you are young , dumb , fulla cum kinda guyso do n't  take my words for itone day you will arrive and kick yourself <p> I 'm struggling to jive with the " healthy " thing ( admittedly I 'm not currently in BKK ) , but from what I am experiencing , everything is sugar-laden , most carb-laden . I 'm struggling to find any healthy drink in 7/11 other than water . I 'm struggling to get lots of greens ( spinach , kale and broccoli is abundant and cheap on every corner in London , here morning glory is OK , but broccoli ai n't  liking the heat ) . Some stuff is cheap , but I question its quality . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they would be battery crap . I 'm not sure what I 'm eating here . So any tips /a post / something on healthy options would be great ( but at Thai prices , I can get anything I want paying London prices ) . Thoughts ? <p> Its the best co-working space in Bangkok and I 've tried them all . Fast , reliable Internet , plenty of outlets and all the water you can drink . They have a nice rooftop as well with a bar , cafe and comfy seating . Its a real pleasant work environment . <p> Oh yea , they also have 200 baht foot massages on site . They give you an outlet and a pillow for your laptop . <p> I use FourSquare and have done for years , it does n't  help with the things Ive talked about . Thai food is based on sweetness as a key element so everything has a lot of sugar in it . Most dishes come with rice etc .

I 'm talking about real education , the kind handed out by meticulous professors with sagging beards and white coats . <p> Thanks to the Internet , learning new skills and advancing your expertise has never been easier . Its as simple as point , Google , click and digest . <h> How I Became an Internet Scumbag <p> Before I evolved in to an affiliate marketer , I was a sloth-like web developer . <p> Admission : I say evolved , in reality it was more like a Big Bang . A collision between entrepreneurial dreams and the revelation that money truly did grow on trees . Google Money Trees , to be precise . <p> Before I was a web developer , I was a high school drop-out with too much time on my hands . <p> I would n't exactly say that I 've trailblazed my way in to self-employment . A better description would be that I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes , but ultimately managed to teach myself just enough to make a good living online . <p> As a drop out with a handful of GCSEs and no further education , I relied solely on VTC to teach me the basics of coding ; from PHP to JavaScript and basic HTML . I used the site to get an understanding of tools like Photoshop . And it was through that limited binge of squirreled self-teaching that I managed to land a job as a web developer . <p> I watched video after video after video for a period of at least six months . It was the almost-free alternative to a fortune spent attending physical classes . <p> Looking back , the site has probably shaped why I 'm so dismissive of the academic route in to any career that involves a computer . You can find the information online for a lot cheaper than what it costs to attend University . <p> Sites like VTC and Lynda gave me the platform and the vital skill-set to move seamlessly in to affiliate marketing . I was lucky enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry was booming , and I merely had to hold on to the gravy train to steal my first break . <p> The point I 'm rather ambiguously trying to make here is that education is always on your doorstep , and it does n't  have to cost a fortune . While I used sites like VTC and Lynda to inadvertently guide my career towards Internet Marketing , there are now even greater courses available . And those courses are the reason for this post . They are too fucking awesome to miss out on , so you need to hear about them . <h> The Rise of Open Courses <p> A few weeks ago on StackThatMoney , my attention was drawn to a selection of online modules that mark the next great advance in distance learning . These are high quality courses , taught by world-class professors with full integration of the modern digital web . <p> Its clear that high quality distance learning now extends far beyond the grainy PHP tutorials I used to watch . You can get an introduction to just about anything if you shop around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The closest I ever thought I 'd get to a Harvard brainfart was in those two hours I spent living vicariously through Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network . <p> Another site that offers a great interactive learning experience is Udacity . While Coursera takes the traditional route of heavy lecturing , Udacity places the priority on getting you to build workable solutions . <p> One course walks you through the building of a search engine from scratch , while another covers the complete development of a web browser . Udacity is rightly praised for turning the learning experience in to a practical examination of your skills . It forces you to build and develop . So if you ca n't handle endless theory and lecture , it may be worth a look . <h> Apple Smells the Opportunity <p> If you needed any further evidence that distance learning is about to evolve spectacularly , look no further than Apples showcasing of iTunes U. <p> Having such a wealth of information on a phone or tablet in your pocket should be great reason for excitement . It certainly is for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although this is the sort of technology that could make me sell out ) . <p> The age old excuse of " I do n't  have the skills to move my career forward " is finally being tarred as the bullshit it always was . There 's truly no excuse for accepting defeat and spending a lifetime in a career that you 're unhappy with . <p> Admittedly , there are some career choices that are always going to require the traditional road through Academia . A surgeon should never qualify to tamper with somebodys guts by virtue of watching a few video streams . Even if they 're in HD . <p> But for most people reading this blog , all the information you could ever need to increase your expertise and broaden your prospects is sitting in the cloud , waiting to be tapped .

Partially to learn and partially for the thrill of seeing if he can get away with it . I 'd go so far as to say he is a little addicted to it . <p> He says he even managed to get himself on a register for one class because he turned up so often that the lecturer thought there must be a mistake that he was n't included . = <p> Anyway , that was a vaguely related comment but I liked this post , interesting stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . <p> James I 'd never heard of coursecrashing before . I admire his dedication to the craft though ! He just needs to find a way to get the full accreditation at the end of it and he s sorted . <p> Ryan I 'm not sure of their exact motives for making it all available , but its definitely a good thing . And I 'm sure the publicity is excellent for them . <p> I 'm not sure why anybody would choose to put themselves so badly out of pocket when , like you say , the prices are extortionate to study in person these days . Unless you 're studying a course where the full degree is truly necessary for the career , I do n't  see the point . Its more of a exercise in drinking a lot and having a great time socially otherwise <p> Great post Finch , matches to some extent the way I think about education as well but somehow I am still going to study Software Engineering next year in the UK o.O ( by the way , tuition fees are -9000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal education is still important , mainly because it teaches you good practices and foundations , not like some courses on the internet . At the same time , I have to say that Coursera is amazing and all the courses are structured coherently and in a way that everyone can understand and keep up . But do n't  dismiss the importance of formal education only because there are courses available on the internet because then you could say that children do n't  need to go to primary school either because its all on Wikipedia . Anyway , I will join the university this September and see how it goes , maybe it is indeed a waste of money . <p> Yeah , I 've heard that MIT also gives a lot of courses online . Some people are freaking out it will further monopolize the excellent education to just Harvard , ect Realistically I think that 's not really the case .

" <p> Its the inquisition that follows my brief and ambiguous description of what I do for a living . <p> " Youre making money from other peoples misery and false expectations " goes the moral line of questioning . <p> Yep , that 's about the size of it . <p> I sit at my desk wearing horns as a dual-screen flickers with fire and brimstone . Somewhere in a distant land , my digital lambs are being lined up for the slaughter . And for what ? Another $5 in my pocket ? Do n't  I ever feel guilty about that ? <p> Guilty , no . <p> I feel about as guilty as a fish for shitting in the sea . <p> Dirty always . <p> Why I do n't  contribute to share your office posts . <p> As long as advertising guidelines are being followed , there 's no reason to feel guilty that consumers are doing what consumers have always done . <p> People love investing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realising their own naivety for believing in another magic button . <p> While I would never advocate products that scam and steal money , there 's a huge misconception of what constitutes a scam in this business . In the majority of cases , users scam themselves . <p> They buy in to bullshit because they want to . Its easier than facing reality . Nobody wants to be sold reality . And that 's okay . <p> Its the way its always been . <p> Advertising provides an endless stream of placebos to cure emptiness and unease . <p> Affiliate marketers driven by arbitrage and the waft of desperation chase the same ends with less finesse . <p> Its this unfortunate lack of judgment that cops a media firestorm ; the bad press and FTC booty lashings soon follow . The actions of a few cast the entire industry in a negative light . <p> What irks me most is the idea that some affiliate marketers are above the business of advertising . <p> There are a lot of hypocritical voices in this industry who will speak down on anything remotely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites about products and services they have n't touched in their lifetimes . I would feel guilty if I was that full of shit . <p> All affiliate marketers are created equal , but some are clearly more equal than others . <p> I said that I do n't  feel guilty , but I do feel dirty . <p> So , how is it possible to have a clear yet dirty conscience ? <p> Well , there are two forms of guilt . There is the kind that arises from scamming and ripping people off , which affiliate marketers are often mistakenly diagnosed with . <p> And then there is the self-inflicted guilt that our time could be spent more productively on helping individuals rather than guiding them further in to delusion . <p> I do n't  feel guilty that I make a lot of money from affiliate marketing , because its a legitimate industry and I need to put dinner on the table . That much is fact . <p> But I do feel dirty that my own talents are n't  going to a greater use . Its psychologically unsustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my career in an industry that breeds such contempt . <p> Just one hour lost to lucrative campaigns is one hour that could have been spent on objectives I personally believe in those that excite me .

Those , I stay away from . Even the " more " legitimate , less debasing offers still ring of something slick and oily sometimes . <p> The bottom line though , as you said , is that a ) humans will buy this shit anyway and b ) we have to put food on the table . As long as I 'm able to steer clear of the truly low , I think I 'll be alright . <p> Thanks for writing this . Going beyond affiliate marketing , I think sales in general makes people cringe . I 've felt that way in the past . We 'd like to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier about needing to put dinner on the table , a worthy point . Expanding on that further , one mental re-frame is you could see sales as the engine of the economy . If a business ca n't sell , they cant create jobs , fulfill customer needs and pay taxes that cover everything else society needs . Without sales , nothing else happens . <p> As for assuaging our conscience , it might pay to compartmentalize . Do what sells to make money . Do what helps people to make the world better . <p> For example , run your campaigns to earn money . Then on the side you could teach affiliate marketing to needy people who have tech skills in countries where there are no jobs . These articles spring to mind : <p> So much wasted potential . Kids that would otherwise be start-up entrepreneurs resort to crime . As bad as affiliate marketing can seem , it has n't  got a patch on stealing credit card numbers . I imagine people like that would could crush it in affiliate marketing . <p> If you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They specialize in micro-tasks ( like Amazon Mechanical Turk ) and provide computer-based work to those in poverty . I 've wanted to outsource things like transcribing videos and podcasts to them . Gets business done and help others at the same time . <p> Your post actually spoke my mind . I never felt great about the work I had to do as an affiliate . Not being able to share what I was up to to near and dear ones was hurting . Frankly , no ones girlfriend would be thrilled to know that he makes money helping guys find f**k buddies . I could n't think of doing this for the rest of my life . <p> Later , I understood feeling bad wont help me or any of the people that say goodbye to their email trying to score walmart gift card . I had to accept the fact that this is just a quick and dirty way to make money . Now , I 'm making money and building a demo for a startup that I 've been planing . After all , as you 've said , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table . <p> You can look at it this way , if you 're doing EDU lead gen the right way and driving students to enroll into higher education then you just helped a few people , that may have not seen the opportunities ahead of them for themselves , do something that could possibly empower them to do greater things in life . This is where our business really makes a difference in the world and benefits our pockets at the same time . There should be no shame in that ! = <p> Great article . Yea I understand the dirty feeling . Sure there are a lot of shady things in this business , but that 's the same in any industry . Affiliate marketing can be used to promote good products and services that help people . In the end its up to the individual to choose what they want to do . <p> Excellent post . You are a beast ! Bottom line is affiliate marketing is a means to an end . If that end is simply cash for cars while gaming a user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliate marketers are not that far removed from their own zip submit victims . <p> Short-sighted people usually take advantage of themselves while they seek to prey on others , often resulting in dramatic undoings <p> Years from now many an affiliate marketer will say to himself ( or herself ) " Man , if I wouldve just listened to that Finch guy a little closer , instead of taking only the things I wanted to hear and making a mess of my life . " <p> @John That 's what it comes down to for me too . I do n't  promote the lowest of the lows . But where the lines are blurred , there 's money to be made . <p> @Marcus Thanks for those links . Some very interesting reads . <p> @Chinmoy Good luck with the startup ! I 'm working on one too . Exciting to be involved with . <p> @ArrJay This is true , and I have actually been involved with promoting EDU offers before . There used to be a lot more of them around than I see today . If you know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd love to hear about them . <p> @Phil Yeah , there are definitely clean options in the industry . Less so in the CPA world , admittedly . Its usually the scammiest offers that produce the most lucrative rewards which is a shame , but predictable . <p> @Ally Youd be a perfect match for those crazy New Years Resolution CPA campaigns . If you have n't seen them before , it involves creating a fake blog and listing everything from " How I quit my job in February " to " How I lost 34 lbs in March " to " How I learnt the entire Chinese language before summer " . Truly , the pinnacle of affiliate squalor ! <p> Its worth noting that there are quite a few ways to do affiliate marketing that are genuinely helping people . <p> Personally , I make money from one webhost whom I 'd cheerfully promote for free and indeed have and do . Its a very pleasant feeling to look at a sale statement and think " excellent , another fifteen people Ive helped avoid crappy webhosting . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least appears to be , a big proponent of this sort of actively helpful affiliation . And I believe even you , Finch , have on occasion recommended things you thought would improve your readers lives = <p> There are good products out there in virtually all affiliate fields good free games ( LoTRO ) , good Make Money Online products , even good dating sites . <p> To me it seems like humans are inherently drawn to the " quick buck " or " easy fix " in every situation . While I do n't  promote anything personally that would cause any guilt I do n't  have issue with folks who promote biz opps , and other methods because let 's face it we as a species want things to be easy . Failing after being given a 1-2-3 process on how to succeed is how we operate . If everyone was always driven to succeed a billionaire would be the AVERAGE . <p> here 's the thing that seals it for me : <p> Instead of people eating right and exercising , they take a cocktail of pills to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because its easier and they do n't  have to do any work . They are shelling out thousands of dollars a year for this stuff . So when they spend $25 on a product online to try to open their own business , why do they get mad when THEY fail ? They fail all of the time in other aspects of their lives , too . And I do n't  see them raging on pharmaceutical companies . <p> Again I do n't  promote any money-making offers myself but I do n't  see what the problem is on either side of the fence . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277886 @1677886/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> April marks the two year anniversary of my luminous full-time career as an affiliate marketer . I could use this occasion to celebrate the arduous hours spent scratching my balls , surfing for dating pics , or munching reheated pizza over my inbox . But where would be the sense in that ? <p> Two years is a long time in an industry that does n't  know how to stand still . I quit my day job at the height of the rebill boom back in 2009 . And I mustve pissed off Lady Luck somewhere along the line because my last day at work happened to coincide with the death of all my profitable campaigns . What do they call that in the corporate world ? Something like " a difficult period of transition " ? <p> You have n't felt a " difficult period of transition " until you 've been sat in your new home office , on the first day , wondering how to make a living for the rest of your life . <p> The answer , as I eventually came to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been the most graceful jump in to running my own business , but I just about managed to keep my shit in tact . The first year was an eye-opener in every sense . I moved slowly from promoting rebills towards more sustainable offers that did n't  require a WHOIS registration just to sleep at night . <p> For all the success I enjoyed pushing shameless rebills , my business was in no way equipped to deal with any serious growth . That 's the price you pay for being obsessed with dollar signs but blind to the supporting acts that lay the foundations of any successful business . If you do n't  have an accountant , you 're shooting yourself in the foot . If you do n't  have somebody you can go to for expert business advice , bam , there goes your kneecap too . <p> Christ knows how much money I surrendered in 2009 through taxes alone thanks to my stupid tunnel vision . The attitude I adopted was paramount to poison . <p> " Taxes ? What do you think I am ? A banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  bother taking on an accountant and I sure as hell did n't  treat my work like a real job . <p> I had to learn that it was n't all about me . And no individual is smart enough to make the correct decision every time in all aspects of his work . So if my first year as a full-time affiliate marketer gave me a reality check , I suppose the last year has been spent acclimatizing to that reality . <p> I 'm still no closer to being able to explain what exactly I do for a living ( " Err , I build websites and market products Ahh , forget it . I 'm just a web programmer " ) , but at least I feel like my business is not about to be swept from underneath me . <p> One thing I can say for sure , if you 're making those first tentative steps in to affiliate marketing with a very limited budget , it gets easier . It might not feel like the shit is even possible when you 're still turning up negative ROIs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two whole years of doing what I do , the actual success formula has changed very little . Sure , the traffic sources come and go . The offers are swings and roundabouts . But making profitable campaigns is very easy once you 've locked down the method in the madness . So much of affiliate marketing is about finding that one sweet spot , and then running with it until it stretches no further . <p> One of my most successful dating landing pages is something I threw together back in 2009 and have barely changed since . While I 've learned a lot since then , and keep pushing myself to learn more , you 're never more than one small break away from making it in this industry . One moment of genius , one great ideaand so much can snowball from so very little . <p> The basic mechanics of affiliate marketing are as simple as they ever were . But moulding everything around it in to a successful business takes a lot more thought , a lot more work and a lot more time . Something tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're based in the UK and worried about your affiliate taxes , now is the time to sort them out . Before the new tax year ! I highly recommend Crunch for their flat-rate -60/month service . It takes a few days to get setup , but its worth it for peace of mind if you do n't  already have an accountant or fancy shafting your old one . 114272 @qwx974272 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> i tell people that i am in advertising but i use the internet to do so . I find this better than " i work from home on my computer building websites in niches and promote business from all over the world using the net " . The latter would probably get me more attention , respect and women but i do not like unnecessary attention <p> The idea of the so-called Internet guru has become very popular as of late . If you just follow the Internet Guru , he will lead you to richestrue or untrue ? Well , its true . But make no mistakemost gurus want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . The other thing to consider is , are you the type of person who is going to be able to follow somebody ? Or , are you the kind of person who can use what you have and form your own way of making money online . I realized pretty early on that , while I wanted to learn things from people , the reality was , I was going to have to find my own way of making money onlinea collage of all the ideas I had come to . <p> Its not everybody that can do thisbut that 's how my mind worked . Never ever get it into your head that you have to " follow the rules " in order to make money on the web . It simply is n't true . You can do things your own way and have lots of success . Its just a matter of wanting it and making it a part of your life in order to find your own way through the Internet marketing maze . <p> It is a fact that affiliate marketing is among the simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will have to make an effort right until you can generate income from your affiliate business . You must work hard if you want to achieve success and you will also have to apply certain tools in order to earn money . <p> 1 . Commitment : The very first thing you have to do is to commit to yourself that you are serious with your choice , you 're serious with building your own business , serious about taking 100% responsibility with whatever you do . You might think that this sounds ridiculous , but itll guide you rightly on your journey . Once you can think , and are responsible like a real business owner , you 'll stand out from people . <p> 2 . Education : The next important part that can make or break your business is your education , or your knowledge about this online business . Most people failed because they did not know exactly what Internet Affiliate Marketing is , how it works , and how they can do things correctly . If you want to see results in the long run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  let something that you do n't  know holds you back . <p> 3 . Focus : The laser beam can break through even the thickest plate of metal because it focuses its energy . You can break even everything if you stay focus too . Fact is , people have no advantages over you , everyone starts at the same level , the reason why some have success , some do n't  lies in the word " focus " . Focus on what you can do best , on what you know the most , and go with them , you 'll join the 5% group soon . <p> 4 . Taking actions : Isnt it true that only taking actions can bring you closer to your goals ? You cant achieve results just by sitting there , making a wish ! Its time to put what you 've learned so far to real actions . I know this is the hardest part , but believe me that when you can do the very first action toward your goals , the next steps will come naturally . Whatever you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 .

Justin Bieber encapsulates the affiliate marketers wettest dream , and that 's a dangerous sentence if ever I wrote one . <p> There are tons of affiliate offers that can be spun and peddled using Biebers bandwagon of fans some that directly use his name , and others that need only be implied . Its not the most reputable marketing tactic in the book , to monetize a brand that 's not your own , but were not the most reputable marketers in the first place . Its going to happen . <p> Besides , the landing page H1s just roll off the tongue . <p> " How much do you know about the Biebs ?

Facebook and Google are n't  the best places to parade Justin Bieber as your CPAs fake celebrity ambassador . Indeed , its not sensible to portray a relationship to any degree . <p> But for PPV , this kind of marketing bait and switch has become the norm for drawing eyeballs to offers that are hyper targeted to a certain demographic . One of the things that makes Bieber such a marketing hero is the immense loyalty he receives from a never ending pool of fangirls and floppy haired pretenders . <p> Its the loyalty that should hold your attention . This is what we should be pursuing . <p> Click prices are rising across most demographics on most traffic sources , but there will always be opportunities for the marketers who are skilled at monetizing the Under 16 demographic .

How can it be ?

It just takes a little creativity , where affiliate offers do n't  already exist , to match them to suitable campaigns . <p> I hate to use the phrase , but " like taking candy from a baby " springs to mind . <p> A regular pet project of mine is to snatch up domains for fansites of these young stars , turn them in to very basic blogs , then to simply splash the shit out of them with gaming ads and quiz offers . You may think the competition level from crazy eyed fans is too high to make a decent return , but in reality , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market is so huge . And if you 're smart , you can convince the hardcore fans to work for you by seeding these projects with their own devoted content . <p> Sinister , right ? I 'm going to Hell ? As long as the Devil crosses Baby off his playlist , that 's perfectly fine by me . <p> I remember when Michael Jackson died , there was a similar explosion of MJ themed offers . For the dirty scumbag affiliates of the world , it was easy pickings . Lock and load , and help yourself to some commission . I did just that , and I 'm sure many other affiliates did too . <p> Where will the next craze emerge from ? He or she is out there now , slowly accumulating an army of fans that will one day reach a tipping point when Ca-Ching the money rush begins . Better get your ears to the ground ! <p> These opportunities to reach huge demographics of highly concentrated users do n't  appear every day , but when they do , you 've got ta cash in. 114273 @qwx974273 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justin Bieber offers , look no further than EWA Network .

@@106277889 @1677889/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> I think we 'd all agree that its a great luxury to be able to work from home . As much as I enjoyed the social side of being in an office and having a laugh , there 's no place I 'd rather be at 9am than tangled in my own bedsheets . Living in your comfort zone can provide the acid test for how committed you are to what you do . <p> Staying productive is something I talk about a lot because I believe self-discipline to be the single greatest asset to any entrepreneur , or anybody who controls their own working environment . Without it , we could spunk entire afternoons on YouTube or away from the office altogether . <p> I think we all know that its important to stay productive , but not many of us have reached the stage where we feel like were in total control of our environment . <p> So here are four tips for improving your productivity if you work from home : 1 . Separate your work space from your living arrangements . <p> This is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I worked in a claustrophobic bedroom where I also drank , ate , slept and let the magic happen . The problem with having your office in your bedroom is that as affiliate marketers , were chained to a 24/7 industry that never sleeps . There 's always one more email to answer , some stats to refresh or a brainfart to research . <p> One of my priorities when I moved to Bangkok was to find a three bedroom apartment that had plenty of space . My girlfriend also works from home , so we opted for a 350 sq/m sprawling mass of rooms . We both have a home office , our puppies have their own bedroom and there 's more than enough space to be able to differentiate between " This is where I work " , " This is where I sleep " , and " This is where I shit " . <p> 2 . Have a schedule . <p> Many people consider the 9-5 to be a mental prison . The same hours , on the same days of the week for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that routine adds order and momentum to your working day . <p> Nobody can tell you the best routine . Some people work better in the morning , while others can only think straight at night . Your location in the world also makes a difference . <p> When I have breakfast , America is going to bed and the UK is already fast asleep . This gives me a perfect opportunity to fire off my emails and work out . I can go for a swim , eat some lunch and really think about what I want to achieve before the morning has already passed me by . <p> If you 're going to have a schedule , you need to stick to it . So you need to plan ahead and leave time for that familiar experience of life screwing you over , or people having other ideas about how you should spend your time . Its easy for those working at home to fall in to the trap of becoming everybody elses bitch . Maybe your housemates want you to run errands because you have " all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to watch out for a parcel delivery because it was too convenient to expect you to do them a favour than organize to pick the damn thing up themselves . <p> These are all familiar stories of how working from home can turn you in to a Samaritan at the beck and call of everybody else . So take back control and get some self-discipline . Even if its a flimsy whiteboard with your working hours scrawled in the kitchen for your wife to see . <p> You can always bust out my favourite tetchy complaint : " I did n't  get where I am today by taking care of other peoples shit . " You might be seen as unreasonable , but you 're in the right . Many of us have worked 16 hour days for months on end to be in the position that we are , so having a schedule that other people respect is n't too much to ask . <p> 3 . Understand the difference between staying busy and getting work done . <p> Sometimes I have days where I only work for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step towards a long term goal . Other days , I work for 12 hours and cross off dozens of tasks only to find that I have n't actually achieved much because I 've been " keeping busy " rather than making any measurable progress . <p> What is " keeping busy " ? <p> Optimizing campaigns without analyzing the data . <p> God , I hate myself when I do this . Ill mark down a task for the day to optimize campaign X , and then I 'll go in and introduce some new ads or tweak my landing pages but I wont look at the data and make any logical assessments . If you 're forever split testing and never coming to conclusions that affect your future campaigns , you 're the perfect example of somebody who keeps busy for the sake of being busy rather than achieving goals . <p> Managing people . <p> I 'm not a project manager . So whenever I add a task like " communicate with Freelancer X and ensure project is running fine " , I know that I 'm being lazy . These are things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated project manager . Its not a step forward for your business if you 're spending the day waiting for emails and feeling satisfied that you 've got everything under control . <p> Research tasks . <p> I find that if I include any item resembling " Research this " on my to-do list , I will revert to my lazy high school trait of promoting the easiest task to the one most worthy of my time . I never add research tasks to my to-do list for one reason . They 're not measurable . I cant hold myself accountable at the end of the day . Its easy to flick through a couple of forum posts in the space of five hours and then by the end of the day miraculously forget that those hours were actually wasted . <p> To put it simply , if you 're going to set yourself tasks , you should know exactly what you 're looking to achieve . Otherwise the goalposts will move as fatigue sets in at the end of the day . <p> 4 . Cancel out the noise . <p> Yes literally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canceling out the distractions all around you . I like to listen to music every now and then , but having a TV blaring in the background makes it damn near impossible for me to work productively . <p> My girlfriend manages to stay focused on her tasks while watching Americas Next Top Model with a laptop balanced on the sofa . Shes obviously a freak . I could n't bring myself to remember my CPCs from my CPVs if I had such calamity unfolding before my eyes on-screen . Whether you think it affects you or not , your brain is tuned in to what is going on around you . I find white noise to be the best way of weeding out those distractions and keeping my focus where it needs to be . Scamming the nation needs mind meditation , right ? <p> If you 're falling in to patterns of laziness , maybe its time to start adjusting your home environment . You know divorce the wife , move in to the attic , ask the cat to start feeding himself . Small tweaks . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good thing for all parties concerned . Show the world that you do n't  mess with a man and his berries . 114274 @qwx974274 <p> Ironically , given the nature of this post , I would like to recommend you join a forum .

I definitely agree with #3 . It is so easy to " stay busy " and not really get anything important accomplished . <p> There is a great productivity tactic that sales guru Brian Tracy recommends . ( I 'm not normally a big fan of gurus , but this guy does have some great advice . ) Basically the idea is that often-times the most important things on your to-do list are also the least enjoyable . People will naturally de-prioritize the those tasks and fill their days doing things that are n't  as important , but are easier or more enjoyable . They feel like they were busy the whole day , so they must have been productive . But , they are n't  really accomplishing what is most important for their business . <p> Tracy recommends putting the most important things at the top of your list and doing them first . He calls it " eating the frog " since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you focus on what is important and always make it a priority , then you will be much more productive . <p> Finch , really well put . Ive been working from home for about three years now and you 've hit them all on the money . Why does everyone think you 're just goofing off if you work from home is beyond me . <p> The best way I 've found to do research tasks without pissing off an entire week is to research with the goal of creating a " deliverable " , or SOMETHING . For example you want to research the Acai berry market , set the goal to be " Create a PowerPoin presentation that explains and documents the Acai craze . " .. Paste landing page examples , paste keyword lists , ads , comments from friends Mind-map it ! <p> Great article !

@@106277893 @1677893/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Internet Marketing was plain sailing in the early 2000s . There was a time where simply buying the right domain would put you in the money . In these harder times , we have a buzz word called " niche marketing " . The art of finding topics most people do n't  give a crap about and setting up shop for the small handful who do . <p> It can be very profitable . Building a website to satisfy a small demand is much easier than battling in a network full of bigger , better and richer competition . <p> here 's the thing . Just because a niche is nowhere close to being saturated , that does n't  mean you should be rushing to stick your dick in it with a sparkling new WordPress installation . Some niches are untapped for a reason . That reason being they suck donkey chode when it comes to making money . <p> The argument , one I 've heard many times before , is that traffic is traffic . Who cares if my website reviews antique deck chairs from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me traffic , my site must be worth something . If its already drawing some Adsense clicks , all the more power to my " thinking outside the box " . <p> Building niche websites is the sort of game that anybody can play . Hands up if you can pinpoint an interest obscure enough to have no other presence on the web ? Christ , its not hard . Here , let me string several niche markets together . <p> How about a site for divorced Jewish transvestites ? <p> By the laws of human insanity , there 's probably at least 14 people searching for this every month . Six of them being me about 30 seconds ago . And yet I 'm guessing there is n't a niche site for it yet ? <p> So are you going to sit down and build onejust because you can ? <p> Unless you have some seriously hot product catering directly for the market were talking about , I 'd take a step back and think about what you 're doing . If you see zero potential beyond Adsense and a rare Amazon book referral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far . <p> My point is that we can dig so deep for opportunity that we sometimes forget the actual principal of what were trying to do ; make lots of money . <p> When you 're running the rule over which new niches to branch in to , ask yourself a few questions : <p> 1 . Is this a buying market ? <p> Forget Adsense . Websites built around Adsense are clusterfuck monstrosities that have no place on the Internet . Do you have something legitimate that you can sell to the people interested in this niche ? Are there web-savvy local businesses with actual budgets that would value your content ? <p> 2 . If I do n't  have a buying market , do I have a LOT of traffic ? <p> Its okay to not have anything obvious to sell , if you have the necessary weight of traffic to rely on numbers instead . Celebrity fan sites , current trends and big upcoming local events can often merit a website . Why ? Because if you do them correctly , you can produce enormous surges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracting highly targeted users to a niche website is one method of making money , the reverse is to take the " niche " out of niche marketing and simply drive a ton of traffic . <p> Think of all those sports streaming websites out there . Many people do n't  want to pay for the PPV package to watch UFC live . So if you stick a live stream up with some pretty basic gateway advertising , you can fill such a huge demand that the numbers make you money not the concept itself . <p> 3 . What is the absolute best case scenario ? <p> Because if your answer is " I sell 3 deck chairs in March and make enough money to pay for my dedicated server " , this is probably just a mid-life crisis you 're going through . Carefully select the Back button and filter back in to whatever pipe dream you came from . <p> I know its easy to aim too high . I mean , shit , my career is built around making people believe in that high . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be switched on , forget about it and go back to the drawing board . Its hard enough to make money online WITH a vision of where the moneys going to come from , let alone without one . <p> 4 . What is the work vs rewards ratio for my competitors ? <p> If you 're looking at moving in to a niche full of psychopath groupies who whittle away their every hour posting content for the reward of jack diddily , you might want to have a rethink . How serious are your competitors ? If they 're working hard for no money , you 're probably going to have to work even harder just to get the show off the ground . <p> Do not try to beat Justin Bieber fans at building Justin Bieber niche websites , unless you plan on outsourcing to within a community . <p> What 's wrong with you ? There 's a line Internet Marketers should know not to cross . <p> 5 . Can I commit to this niche ? <p> Most important of all ! If you do n't  feel capable of getting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a winner . That does n't  mean you have to be the poor guy sat at his desk and churning out article after article on the topic . But if you know you cant get the quality content published , you 're only ever going to be a bum search engine traffic gamer . <p> People forget that simply rolling out a niche website is n't going to be enough to dominate a market . You have to become an authority in that niche . Doing this requires actual knowledge and expertise . You 're going to have to outsource your content to an expert in the field , or a damn good researcher . <p> There 's a lot more to consider when launching a niche website than the sheer weight of traffic numbers on Google keyword sandbox . Focus on the potential of making money . Because without that , you 're just another pillock with a fansite. 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

Google Money Trees , to be precise . <p> Before I was a web developer , I was a high school drop-out with too much time on my hands . <p> I would n't exactly say that I 've trailblazed my way in to self-employment . A better description would be that I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes , but ultimately managed to teach myself just enough to make a good living online . <p> As a drop out with a handful of GCSEs and no further education , I relied solely on VTC to teach me the basics of coding ; from PHP to JavaScript and basic HTML . I used the site to get an understanding of tools like Photoshop . And it was through that limited binge of squirreled self-teaching that I managed to land a job as a web developer . <p> I watched video after video after video for a period of at least six months . It was the almost-free alternative to a fortune spent attending physical classes . <p> Looking back , the site has probably shaped why I 'm so dismissive of the academic route in to any career that involves a computer . You can find the information online for a lot cheaper than what it costs to attend University . <p> Sites like VTC and Lynda gave me the platform and the vital skill-set to move seamlessly in to affiliate marketing . I was lucky enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry was booming , and I merely had to hold on to the gravy train to steal my first break . <p> The point I 'm rather ambiguously trying to make here is that education is always on your doorstep , and it does n't  have to cost a fortune . While I used sites like VTC and Lynda to inadvertently guide my career towards Internet Marketing , there are now even greater courses available . And those courses are the reason for this post . They are too fucking awesome to miss out on , so you need to hear about them . <h> The Rise of Open Courses <p> A few weeks ago on StackThatMoney , my attention was drawn to a selection of online modules that mark the next great advance in distance learning . These are high quality courses , taught by world-class professors with full integration of the modern digital web . <p> Its clear that high quality distance learning now extends far beyond the grainy PHP tutorials I used to watch . You can get an introduction to just about anything if you shop around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The closest I ever thought I 'd get to a Harvard brainfart was in those two hours I spent living vicariously through Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network . <p> Another site that offers a great interactive learning experience is Udacity . While Coursera takes the traditional route of heavy lecturing , Udacity places the priority on getting you to build workable solutions . <p> One course walks you through the building of a search engine from scratch , while another covers the complete development of a web browser . Udacity is rightly praised for turning the learning experience in to a practical examination of your skills . It forces you to build and develop . So if you ca n't handle endless theory and lecture , it may be worth a look . <h> Apple Smells the Opportunity <p> If you needed any further evidence that distance learning is about to evolve spectacularly , look no further than Apples showcasing of iTunes U. <p> Having such a wealth of information on a phone or tablet in your pocket should be great reason for excitement . It certainly is for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although this is the sort of technology that could make me sell out ) . <p> The age old excuse of " I do n't  have the skills to move my career forward " is finally being tarred as the bullshit it always was . There 's truly no excuse for accepting defeat and spending a lifetime in a career that you 're unhappy with . <p> Admittedly , there are some career choices that are always going to require the traditional road through Academia . A surgeon should never qualify to tamper with somebodys guts by virtue of watching a few video streams . Even if they 're in HD . <p> But for most people reading this blog , all the information you could ever need to increase your expertise and broaden your prospects is sitting in the cloud , waiting to be tapped .

Partially to learn and partially for the thrill of seeing if he can get away with it . I 'd go so far as to say he is a little addicted to it . <p> He says he even managed to get himself on a register for one class because he turned up so often that the lecturer thought there must be a mistake that he was n't included . = <p> Anyway , that was a vaguely related comment but I liked this post , interesting stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . <p> James I 'd never heard of coursecrashing before . I admire his dedication to the craft though ! He just needs to find a way to get the full accreditation at the end of it and he s sorted . <p> Ryan I 'm not sure of their exact motives for making it all available , but its definitely a good thing . And I 'm sure the publicity is excellent for them . <p> I 'm not sure why anybody would choose to put themselves so badly out of pocket when , like you say , the prices are extortionate to study in person these days . Unless you 're studying a course where the full degree is truly necessary for the career , I do n't  see the point . Its more of a exercise in drinking a lot and having a great time socially otherwise <p> Great post Finch , matches to some extent the way I think about education as well but somehow I am still going to study Software Engineering next year in the UK o.O ( by the way , tuition fees are -9000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal education is still important , mainly because it teaches you good practices and foundations , not like some courses on the internet . At the same time , I have to say that Coursera is amazing and all the courses are structured coherently and in a way that everyone can understand and keep up . But do n't  dismiss the importance of formal education only because there are courses available on the internet because then you could say that children do n't  need to go to primary school either because its all on Wikipedia . Anyway , I will join the university this September and see how it goes , maybe it is indeed a waste of money . <p> Yeah , I 've heard that MIT also gives a lot of courses online . Some people are freaking out it will further monopolize the excellent education to just Harvard , ect Realistically I think that 's not really the case . Regardless , Its kinda cool you can get top tier quality educational courses for free . <p> A surgeon should never qualify to tamper with somebody 's guts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're in HD. <p> To be fair a lot of keyhole surgery these days is done via a monitor and is probably not a great deal different from being skilled at gaming .

@@106277914 @1677914/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> If you 're a reader of my affiliate marketing blog , Finch Sells , you will probably be aware that I 've introduced paid content over the last 6 weeks . <p> I thought itd be interesting to see how many of my regular readers converted in to paying customers , especially given how fellow marketers can be notoriously hard to sell to . <p> The results from the first 6 weeks have been promising . I 've taken just under $15,000 in sales , which I 'm hoping will double in the next couple of weeks ( Volume 2 was released yesterday ) . <p> While $15,000 is certainly a nice side-income to go with my usual marketing projects , I think the most exciting development is simply discovering that the premium content angle can work . <p> I 've spoken about the concept on Twitter and a few people have quite rightfully pointed out that paid content can only be successful as long as the standard of the posts is kept high . I could n't agree more with the need to deliver quality content , but this is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently popular subscription model . <p> Subscription based Internet Marketing forums are all the rage right now , and I 've had the pleasure of checking out most of them . Sites like Aff Playbook , Stack That Money and IMGrind all do a fantastic job of delivering valuable content and I 'm sure they make a lot more money out of it than the $15000/month my Premium Posts have delivered so far . <p> The issue for me is commitment . I could potentially roll out a subscription based service , but it would create an enormous burden of pressure to keep delivering excellent content month after month . There really is little margin for error with a crowd that is so tough to please . <p> Its the type of model that is much more sustainable on a forum where you have dozens of different personalities offering their own useful advice . <p> I 've gone with the Premium Posts on a themed basis , so users with particular interests can buy information that should hopefully be directly relevant to them . With no subscription deadline , I can take full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content that I 'm proud of , and that I think my readers are going to enjoy . <p> I hope that by adding products slowly , and keeping the quality high , I can build up a sizeable passive income . I 'm also hoping that readers who have been converted in to paying customers will become more loyal to the brand . <p> Ironically enough , after releasing Premium Posts Volume 1 , my blog received 6 of its 10 highest traffic days in the history of the site . Far from driving readers away , it seemed to generate extra visitors . <p> Releasing the products has also allowed me to seize a lot of traffic from forums and blogs linking to the announcement , which will presumably help my SEO . Not that I give two shits about SEO , but its a nice bonus . <p> Perhaps the opportunity that excites me most is the idea of exporting the Premium Posts concept and implementing it on other blogs . <p> Its constantly preached that creating products is the best way to produce a long-term stable income , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will definitely be a challenge to provide the same incentive for purchasing paid content as affiliate marketing brings ( who would n't want to make more money ? ) , I believe the concept has legs on it . <p> It should be interesting to see the results over the next couple of months . I 'm definitely looking forward to making blogging a more profitable cornerstone of my business . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 16 Comments <p> $15000 is a amazing amount of extra income Especially if it is per/ month , I guess it depends how much work that goes in to making the content , but I would be more than happy with that as a starting point , congrats ! <p> I do n't  believe it will be an extra 15k income every month for just one ebook , its about to be more like a longtail. 15k in the first month ( release ) , then its about to decrease but over the time the first ebook will be sold again and again .

And I know I 'll never allow myself to publish anything that might . Affiliate marketing blogging for me has always been a delicate art of giving away just enough inspiration to make you feel that you 've spent five minutes wisely , while providing enough cheap one liners to make sure you realize I 'm not John Chow . <p> The reality of course is that I 'm a waste of your time . And this is one of the surreal businesses where I can say something like that and not worry about losing readership because I know I 'll always be supplied with an endless line of lost spirits chasing the same dream . <p> " I can has money from the Internets ? " <p> I believe a lot of people buy in to Internet Marketing blogs as a form of escapism from the real working world . Everybody likes to believe they can go from rags to riches without leaving their driveway . If the flog has taught us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mouth is to chase something that 's too good to be true . <p> Its tough to think of another industry that promises so much , delivers so little and looks so pathetic to the non-believers . Its like were the Sons of Scientology . I half expect Tom Cruises shining mugshot to pop up on a Bizopp lander anytime now . <p> There are very few genuine success stories of affiliates who have made this gig work without having a dollar to spend , and yet that 's what so many bloggers would plead with you to believe . You might hear tales of guys who scraped by on $50 and the bare essentials of shared hosting or . info domains , but they all spent money . Maybe not much , but they still spent money . <p> And for every high profile blogger who creates the illusion that making money online is a springboard of simple steps to success , there are a thousand Johnny No Pockets who you never read about because they never made a dollar and left the biz with their tails trailing between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the business completely . <p> So they write about their experience and pass it off as success . <p> If you try and do n't  succeed , pretend you did and write a fucking book about it . That 's pretty much affiliate marketing blogging in a nutshell . Nobody gives any true insight to influence your bottom line , myself included , because its just not worth it . <p> The true value of knowing what works in this industry is worth more than popping $7 per ebook to announce information that subsequently becomes useless thanks to copycats , and even more damagingly , those who are already competent marketers . <p> I look back at the blogging craze that surrounded the arrival of Plentyoffish as an advertising platform . A prime example of a lucrative market for affiliates that was rapidly swamped after a bunch of " experts " decided to unveil it as a secret traffic source capable of making you millions . <p> Well listen , if something is capable of making you millions , you 're obviously full of shit because you would n't be selling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I know most of you are savvy enough to have figured this out for yourselves . Im blessed with one of the smartest readerships of any affiliate blog out there . And I put that down partly to the fact that we both know I 'm only going to reveal so much , allowing me to promise very little , and spend more quality time talking about my balls . <p> But if you 're new to affiliate marketing , or bemused by the bold promises you keep reading , let me be the first to admit it . Bloggers like myself are a waste of your time . None of us are generous enough to share our businesses with you , and anybody who is , wont have a business for long . <p> Happy New Year , Affiliasphere ! 114274 @qwx974274 <p> If you 're working in the dating market , check out Adsimilis .

At the time their usefulness boiled down to their vocabulary- if they wrote about a topic or used a word I did n't  know , it gave me a rabbit hole to go mine to figure it out . <p> That being said , I shot myself in the foot by far overstaying my welcome on these blogs ( like most noobs , I 'm sure ) and wasting precious time during rebill mania in reading paralysis mode . <p> Once you reach a certain threshold of understanding and knowledge- which , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to do it .

( Lucky begger ) , its just something that inspires myself to stick to it . <p> I rarely spend enough time on affiliate marketing , in the start i was fresh and my motivation was massive , without having to read the blogs i relied on self drive . <p> Then it got to the point where i started looking around for some inspiration and i found shoemoney . <p> But i have to be honest , his blog has gone down hill big time with all the guest posts pluggin their own ebooks . And then shoemoney himself pluggin the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blog has become more of a money making scheme , which i felt it never used to be . <p> However reading your blog is refreshing , your down to earth and no nonsense writing will keep me reading , as soon as you realise you can monetise your readership , ill be off to the next blog heh ! <p> I also read kirstys affiliatestuff for the same reason . If others want a blog of similar writing styles . <p> Be nice for others to make some other suggestions for myself as well . <p> You 're NOT wasting anyones time . The people who read these blogs are wasting their own time ! Its not you . <p> But seriously , you actually give us more than you think . You constantly talk about how you promote the dating niche . As someone who does n't  do a lot of affiliate marketing I actually would have guessed that this niche is beat to death and dead .

I have no doubt that the exact niche he s talking about is n't worth doing , but seeing how he goes about things is useful and was worth while . <p> And actually Shoemoney did write a post that changed my life . It was about two years ago he wrote about local marketing . About 6 months ago I really started diving into the local marketing scene and I now have 6 clients . I 'm building a nice business and I really never would have if I had n't  read that one post by Shoemoney . <p> The only ones out there sharing " secrets " are those saying " Learn how I made $100 billion on FB back in 2007 .

Or maybe its the fact that Christmas ushers monetary pressure on to seemingly everybody except your fat cat self . <p> I guess you realize how lucky you are to be working at home , and you want the world to know about it , right ?

Its so easy that you need to be cashing a new villa every month or you 're just not doing it right . Bah humbug to any fool who has n't  carved a fortune from the Internet ! <p> The reality is that nobody cares how much money you make . Bragging about it is one thing . Dismissing the efforts of those who only earn a small income online is bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks ago and I thoughtwhaaaaat ? <p> Of course , it does n't  matter who you ridicule as long as they stack less money than you . You could be mocking a hard working doctor who spends a lifetime helping others and just wants to find a side income to boost his paltry salary . Or maybe a father of many who works bone to the ground and knows more about the value of a dollar bill than you 'll ever appreciate in your lifetime . Anybody and everybody is fair game for the demeaning prick who thinks his ability to make money online puts him in the elite tier of high society . <p> I received a snotty email from an affiliate this week suggesting I go in to a partnership with him because hed earned X here , and another X there . In fact , hed earned so much that I was left wondering why hed want to venture in to a niche where the absolute best results would act as no more than loose change compared to his bounty campaigning elsewhere . My blog was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his big plans . His pitch was proof to me that his greatest asset was an ability not to feel stupid when he reads back what he types and pushes " Send " . <p> By the time I finished reading the email , I was so turned off from the sheer arrogance of telling me how rich he had become in the last year , that I did n't  even bother to reply telling him that his idea sucked . So if you 're reading this now , there you go . Nobody cares how much money you make . People only care what value you can give to them . <p> There are a lot of posers and pretenders in this industry . Affiliates inflate their earnings in the same way that a sixteen year old inflates his profile of sexual partners . We 'd hate to fall for inadequacy , right ? Let 's be realistic .

And in fact , nearly every successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multimillionaire arbitrage marketer . <p> Most successful marketers are using affiliate campaigns as the launch pad to bigger and better projects . As they should be . Any other attitude is bordering on the retarded . <p> But let me tell you , its not always in your best interests to parade yourself as the guy with the deep pockets . I make an effort not to brag , or even talk about what I earn . Partly because in the grand scheme of things , its not that impressive there 's always somebody earning more . And partly because it attracts freeloaders . <p> I can often tell when somebody is bullshitting about the money they 've made . Simply because most people whove been in such lucrative positions are aware that bragging attracts only the kind of people who are interested in taking you for a ride .

I want to know that shit . That 's my motivation , my friend , chasing the scaled affiliate earnings . I dislike people that flaunt wealth to make others feel inferior , but I love the bloggers that feed the fires of desire for the noobs .

Like any respectable Brit , it does n't  take an extradition to lure me over to Spain . You can expect my sunburnt balls to be encroaching on the proceedings with great interest . <p> If you like to boast about your conference travels over Facebook , you should probably hold fire on this one . An Online Dating Summit sounds borderline desperate to the uninformed friend or relative ; like some kind of speed-dating epic for the morbidly single . Rest assured , its not . <p> Its actually the leading B2B and affiliate conference for the online dating industry . <p> You 'll find many recognisable names and brands at the show , assuming you keep your dating clean . It remains to be seen whether the likes of LocalSlags.co.uk put in an appearance . I suspect the dirtier realm of the CPA world could be tough to find on the expo floor . <p> Be2 and Mate1 will be fun to talk to . As will the many white-label dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The venue is Hotel Miramar , which means absolutely nothing to me . Sean Mulkeen seems to specialise in prostituting himself to the various corners of Europe , so maybe you could tweet him for an opinion . <p> I 've made it clear in the past that I 'm not a huge conference junkie . I do n't  see the point in crossing continents for some free pens , a branded T-shirt and enough corporate slang to induce a migraine . But business is business , right ? For serious dating affiliates , this looks like a good trip . <p> Of course , there 's the issue of location too . Ahh , Barcelona . <p> Its been seven years since I last visited this great city , and although I only caught a fleeting glimpse before marveling at the Camp Nou , I know enough to say that its exactly my cup of tea . <p> You can tell a lot about a city simply by tallying its average pedestrian footsteps per minute . If London is a stampede to catch the tube , Barcelona is a dawdle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Whether you like affiliate marketing , online dating , or tanking up your expense account with cheap holidays before April , the Online Dating Summit should be worth checking out . Hit me up if you 're going to be there . 114273 @qwx974273 <p> Dating affiliates should also grab a copy of Premium Posts Volume 3 .

@@106277918 @1677918/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> There seems to be a sub-culture in affiliate marketing these days . Its the by-product of a super competitive crowd , all working hard to stay one step ahead of their rivals . Youve probably seen it splashed across your Twitter feed . <p> " Hey Joe , I cant come out tonight . I 'm busy grindin " <p> " I just dumped my girlfriend . She did n't  like my grind . " <p> " Forced to choose between the grind and playing with my balls , I choose the grind . " <p> Affiliates seem to fail or succeed by virtue of " the grind " . The ability to work like a slave through the night , through the morning deaf to distractions and entirely committed to the art of getting shit done . <p> Everybody needs to be working at least 22 hour days or they 're just not working hard enough , right ? Ive been sucked in to this competitive mindset in the past , and I 'm doing my best to wriggle my way free . The grind is only cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting downstairs in my lounge the other day , vegetating like some kind of unshaven grizzly bear . Its very rarely that I allow mindless police chases on budget Bravo TV to distract me from work , but I truly miss the days where I knew how to lounge around and do absolutely nothing . <p> That sounds like a step backwards . If you 're successful , why would you want to waste your energy on television while the opportunity of time passes you by ? For me , its become an issue of retaining my health and limiting my insanity . <p> Its very easy , as an affiliate marketer working from home , to get sucked in to working these grueling 16 hour days . And if like me , you enjoy what you do , the lure can be even harder to resist . During the earliest days , I built some kind of elitist dream where putting in those hours somehow made me more likely to be satisfied with my progress . It made me better than everybody else because I was somehow more committed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  know when to stop , you 're not really in control , are you ? You 're more of a prisoner than you ever were in your 9-5 when there was a clear beginning and end to your day . <p> One of the things Ive discovered is that no matter how much money you earn , there will always be somebody earning more . If you fall in to the trap of pursuing this relentless grind , unable to dictate when your work day ends , its only going to be you that suffers . And I know personally because I 've already suffered . My health has suffered , my moods have suffered . My ability to appreciate rare moments , simply festering on the couch with absolutely nothing to worry about those have also suffered . <p> I went for a laser eye surgery consultation last week and somehow ended up referred to the hospital instead with skyrocketing eye pressure , pounding headaches and an overwhelming feeling of fatigue . <p> Ironically , I 've always figured that my problems could be solved by money . My bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could afford to throw +-5500 at surgery to correct my eyes , it would easily justify all those hours on the grind . But there are some things money cant fix , so grinding for 16 hours straight is n't always the answer . Even if affiliates are being systematically brainwashed to believe that 's the case . <p> Over the last week or so , I 've been working to reverse the trend . Ive been slowly lowering the number of hours I allow myself to spend in front of a computer screen and trying to work in productive surges . I took some advice from lenstrom on Twitter and have been trying to integrate these health measures in to my day . <p> The biggest challenge for me is to learn that whatever lands on my desk , whatever lands in my inboxit does n't  always have to be acted on now . I 've already caught some fire and some contrasting opinions on the matter . <p> Just two days ago I posted on Twitter : " Tomorrowtomorrow is the day where I get back on track . " <p> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently it came across as a sign of weakness . Why wait til tomorrow ? Why not act today ? <p> Well , that 's the attitude I 'm trying to overcome . Its not always in my best interest to act today . Everybody has to have an off switch , and the ability to resist the temptation to grind or work hard at every waking hour . Its just not healthy . That I 'm only 22 years old , and feel like I have the mental wear and tear of a 42 year oldsurely ca n't be healthy . <p> Yet everywhere you look across the affiliate marketing landscape , grinding hard is the cool thing to do . I read a forum topic a few weeks ago with the title line " How much do you earn in a day ? " <p> A guy , admittedly with his head somewhere up his own arse , had wandered in bragging about his $1000/days . He promptly received a bunch of criticism that he was small-time , a little fish in a big ocean . He had no right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would I rather be the " big time " affiliate who 's torturing himself to add the next zero on his pay cheque ? Or simply the smug dude who 's perfectly content with his $365,000/year ? As far as Im concerned , that 's not small time . Look at the average annual earnings in the United States and its anything but small time . <p> This industry seems to judge affiliates by the flash cars , the fancy mansions and the number of Americans theyve convinced to she 'd the pounds with acai . It all boils down to money , and yet money is only a gateway to opportunities . Its not happiness in itself . <p> I 've always preached the need to work hard and harder than most . But the importance of appreciating what I already have is only just dawning on me . The next time somebody tells me to get back to the grind at 2am , or to stop thinking about tomorrow rather than today , I 'll probably tell them with all due respect to go fuck themselves . <h> Need a larger slice of Finch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty obvious . I did take the time to do an interview over on Jonathan Volks blog though . You can check it out below . 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> As a Brit Ive never understood all these guys saying they work 20+ hr days and being proud of it . I 'm only a part time affiliate but if I ever quit my job to do it full time my aim would be to do less work than I was doing at a full time job , I mean what is the point of working for yourself if you are n't  going to enjoy the perks that it brings . <p> What part of doing massive hours makes you better than anyone else ? I really admire those people who do n't  do those crazy hours , not those who do . <p> Ninety-nine percent of the people in the online marketing industry are doing it wrong . Affiliates are the worst . They are killing themselves slowly , and they will never know it until its too late . The mental changes are the worst , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in my last post , when you work these type of hours , you are robbing not only yourself , but your family and friends of the important things in life . <p> I guess this has come with age , but I have less and less patience for the mouthy pricks who talk down anyone who who does n't  put on like they work 25 of 24 hours a day . The loudest of those likely are n't  making even as much money as the guys they 're ripping on who at least make a respectable income . <p> People who put all their focus on work and money are usually compensating for something . I make my money . I also know how to enjoy it . <p> When you talk to any real business owner and explain affiliate marketing and explain how hard you work for cash money- no equity , they literally LOLZ at you . <p> Affiliates are the bottom of the totem of entrepreneurs whether some of you want to admit it or not . I like that some are finally being honest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real businessman and they will tell you about delayed gratification . How you cant really build an asset in less than four years . How your goal should be to be making over 7 figures without being involved in the daily operation at all . How some of them moved back into cheapo two bedroom apartments and sold everything to get the cash to start some new investment . <p> Real businessmen get it . Cash does n't  matter . Today does n't  matter . Its all about the equity . Its all about tommorrow . <p> Agreed . I am always surprised when people seem to think its cool to work alot . For me , i started AM for the complete opposite reason , to free up my time , and spend it on things that matter to me , which is not working . <p> Awesome post manand I totally agree with cash37 , I only see affiliate marketing as something that will help me build a " future proof " business if you can call it like that , much much faster . Like I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na bail one day and just enjoy life , can you sell your business ? How many people will buy a list of PPC keywords or a set of banners and sht ? <p> But what if you had a list of 100k people in the weight loss niche , made your own training program , then decided to bailhow many people would buy that from you ? <p> Nothing wrong with working hard when its a MUST , 1 week , 2 weeks a month maybe , but for me making more money and not having the time to properly enjoy it does n't  equal success . Maybe some people live for thatas they make more money they feel more successful <p> Besides the eye break I took while reading this post , I thought this was a good point you made . As I get older , I do n't  want to regret all the long hours in front of the comp and not outnboot living up the world . In college , ok , it was almost necessary but now , I want to enjoy life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You 're mixing with the wrong crowd . Sounds like you 've been hanging around Wicked Fire for too long and have soaked up their " Im a baller " attitude . Maybe its an American thing . Take a visit to A4U forum you wo n't see anyone there bragging about money , cars or working long hours . <p> One of your best posts so far . Life is too short to spend grinding away in front of a computer screen 26 hours a day . It does n't  matter if you 're young and single , or settled down with wife and kids . <p> Every day is an opportunity for so many things . Some for business , some for pleasure . It is up to us to choose where we want to focus . But since our days on this earth are numbered , we better make the best out of each one . <p> I personally feel like the past 14 years have gone by in a flash . In my head , I 'm still that 23 year old guy ready to conquer the world . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my last birthday card had the number " 37 " on it undeniably reminding me that the clock is ticking no matter if I work my ass off or turn into a lazy bum . Soon another flash goes by , and my birthday cards will read " 51 " on them before I know it . <p> So I make an effort now to work LESS hours in the day , but to make those hours *ultra-efficient* . When Ive done what I need to for the day I shift my focus onto family and relaxation entirely . Because I would rather look back at it all when I 'm 51 and have assets giving me an OK passive income than be a multi-millionaire and looking back knowing I wasted the best years of my life in front of a screen , neglecting fun , family , and friends around me . <p> " I would rather look back at it all when I+GGm 51 and have assets giving me an OK passive income +G than be a multi-millionaire and looking back knowing I wasted the best years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun , family , and friends around me . " <p> @Cash37 I agree , to an extent . But I do n't  think its fair to group all affiliates in the same basket . I know many affiliates out there who are actively looking to develop their assets and add more " permanence " to their business . <p> I 've certainly been exploring my options . If you 're referring to the typical CPA arbitrage traffic brokering affiliatethen yes , those guys are putting in a lot of work to stay afloat in the moment . <p> " Theres a big cocktail party at Marthas Vineyard . Someone comes up to the writer Joseph Heller ( writer of Catch 22 ) and says , Joe , see that guy over there ? He s a hedge fund manager and he made more money yesterday than you made on all the books you have ever published. Joe Heller pauses , then says Yeah , but ya know , I have something hell never have enough . ' " <p> I think its important for us young entrepreneurs to learn what " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-something year-old entrepreneurs , not only are we light-years ahead of most of our friends financially but weve also got two things that any older billionaire would give up all his money foryouth and health . <p> It would be a shame to waste away ones youth and health in front of a monitor " on the grind " , only to become an extremely rich 40 year-old who wishes he could give it all away to be 25 and healthy again . Its not too uncommon ! Unfortunately , I see too many young entrepreneurs doing just that . <p> finch- keeping a balance in life is possibly the most important thing . the person that can not only bust his ass working ( smart ) and making good money ( $300k is decent money ) but also gets to spend a good majority of their time doing whatever they enjoy ( whether that be hiking , biking , time spent with family/friends , traveling , etc ) is truly winning in the success game of life . <p> After working from home for the last 8 years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( travel , spend time doing what I enjoy , etc ) I can thoroughly say that getting away from work and your computer is seriously hyper-important part of the equation . <p> computers are not everything , work is not everything . good luck with continuing down the path you are traveling you will probably end up happy in the long run . = //g <p> I think this is true with anything . For instance , I had a 9-5 job but I could work as much as I wanted . I had a kid coming and a family to support so I thought I had to work all the hours I could . Now , it is two years later and I regret it . Dumbest thing I have ever done . I missed a lot and there is no way of getting it back . <p> These are lessons some of us ( like me ) learn the hard way , when we lose things that money cant buy or replace like kids , spouses , parents or health . <p> One of the best quotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished they had spent one more day at the office " . <p> Steven Covey from Seven Habits of Highly Effective People fame put it as " Schedule your priorities , instead of prioritizing your schedule " Meaning to look at what your priorities are and put THOSE in the schedule , instead of looking at your current schedule and prioritizing the order of tasks . <p> Wealth and affluence is no longer measured by money it is now measured by freedom . <p> Honestly , if you 're working more than 8 hours a day , I do n't  know what the f*ck you 're doing . If you 're " on the grind " then you must be spending your time very unefficiently . What most affiliate marketers lack is time management . Manage your goddamn time ! <p> Also to the guy who talked about affiliate marketing has no assets , affiliate marketing &gt; 9-5 job . <p> Who gives a f*ck about assets ? If we as affiliate marketers are making more money and having a better " job " than 95% of the population , well , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort ( medical , science , technology , etc. ) is just like affiliate marketing . No assets , just cash money you receive . Only in affiliate marketing , you work for yousrelf and decide how much $$ YOU want to make . <p> My tip to affiliate marketers , work your ass off and hit $1 million . I 'm only half way there and it took me a few months . Once you hit $1 million , just work your affiliate marketing 8 hours a day . Spend your time efficiently . Enjoy life a bit ! <p> Affiliate marketing even on the grind &gt; 9-5 job . 9-5 jobs are a waste of time of course . 8 hours a day for sh ! t income and you hate your job . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275

@@106277920 @1677920/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> There 's a character called Stringer Bell who fronts a Baltimore drugs gang ( Ask Cakes for details ) , and slowly becomes disillusioned with the shady shit he has to deal with on a day to day basis . In a bid to escape the wrong side of the law , he uses the gangs drug money to invest in property and real estate . Ultimately it all goes wrong and he gets shotgunned down for his sins . <p> If you 're wondering what the hell I 'm talking about or why its because I 'm feeling the strong urge to pull a Stringer Bell , leap out of this shady industry and throw my money at something that does n't  make me blush when I explain the mechanics of how it produces profit . <p> Affiliate marketing is full of so much bullshit and unnecessary drama . You can do everything in your power to avoid the drama , but when networking is such an integral part of your business , the drama becomes a lurking fixture of your day . Staring in awe at a cyber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management tools in the world can fully isolate you from an industry which regurgitates endless shit like no other . <p> Ive been thinking about how I can limit the negative aspects of affiliate marketing . How can I cut down on the bullshit and learn to see through the lies without wasting any more of my time than I need to ? <p> Its a very shady space to work in . Some of the things I see affiliates doing some of the things I engage in myself would certainly rank low on the list of " topics to discuss with the grandparents over Sunday roast " . You can say that its a dog eat dog world . But one look at WickedFire and I 'd change that to " dog eats dog while cheered on by pack of starving wolves " . <p> You people love drama . And as a guy who blogs to the exact crowd that love it most , I would be a colossal hypocrite to sit here raising a white flag and begging for mercy . <p> Instead I 'm thinking about how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier at night . Most of us whove been doing this for any length of time appreciate that there 's a system in place . I have n't promoted rebills for so long that I 've convinced myself theyve gone out of fashion . But even working with dating , gaming and a bunch of other CPA offers I 'm still riddled with the guilt that making money should n't be this easy . So much of marketing is about creating false positives and selling a user what deep down you know they do n't  really need . <p> I 've made a personal effort to promote reputable offers and steer well clear of the continuity market . But it still bothers me that my working day involves tapping in to consumer weaknesses and surrounding myself in these negative energies . Negative energies ? Yeah , I had a curry for dinner . I 'm pretty fucking full of negative energies right now . <p> At the moment , its fine . <p> Affiliate marketing is an addictive circle to be working in . It can be so incredibly lucrative . I speak to guys who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an industry that anybody can excel in if they have their fucking nuts screwed on . <p> But are you planning on doing this forever ? Or do you have an exit strategy ? <p> This is such bullshit , I can barely believe I 'm even writing about it . I 'm not leaping to Cakes defense by any means . I 've never met the guy and Ive never tried his product . But are all affiliate marketers expected to live and die by the arbitrage game for the rest of their careers ? <p> Whether Nicks product blows or not , its pretty irrelevant . Escaping the " buy traffic to sell traffic " trap is something that I think any affiliate would be a mug to ignore . I do n't  see how all of us can possibly get away with exploiting something that is this lucrative forever . Especially if affiliate marketing continues to grow at the same rapid rate . <p> Ive been mulling over my own options and thinking about what I want to do . How can I use affiliate marketing as a launch pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPA arbitrage ? Well , I 've been posting recently about building long term assets , and there 's a lot more to come there . <p> For me personally , I do n't  plan on sticking in this industry for long . I 've seen enough of affiliate marketing to know that while I 'm enjoying it now as a 22 year old with no family of my own to support I do n't  want to be riding this horse for any longer than I need to be . I have my eye on property investment as an exit plan . <p> Make enough money as an affiliate to finance the kind of investments that would go beyond what the average 22 year old is capable of laying down . Every day is a constant drive to increase profits and give myself that flexibility sooner rather than later . <p> Do you have your own exit plan ? You might be making money now , but how are you going to keep making money if the tap ever runs dry ? 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <h> 26 Comments <p> i mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make your own products . they do n't  have to necessarily be about affiliate marketing or internet marketing , even , but you could partner up with people who have something legitimate to offer to the world and get eyeballs to them/their business/their product . <p> i think the biggest issue w/ the drama in the affiliate industry is that its such a young crowd . without getting on a high horse or anything the demographic is one that carries a lot of insecurities with it . if you 've ever played diablo 2 , or warcraft , etc. you know the type of crowd that plays those games . affiliates are those people except with the added confidence of the fact that they make good money . <p> knowing traffic = money . there 's pretty much no end to what you can do with that knowledge and experience . <p> I totally agree with you man Affiliate marketing can really mess with your conscience a lot especially with shady rebill offers . <p> Launching your own product/products is definitely a good long term strategy , but I believe the hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that with confidence ! Its a hard thing .. to commit to a project not 100% sure that it will be something that people will want to pay for and use . <p> But as a wise man once said the only risk not worth taking is not taking a risk . <p> I totally agree with moving out of the paid traffic/lead gen business . Its pretty much an absolute must for me . <p> As far as Cakes product , I think the price is what pissed so many people off . $50 a month is too much when Cakes himself openly released a free version with many of the same features . LPLockdown could have ROCKED as a $37 Clickbank product , and he could have built a big ass list on the backend of buyers , but he blew it going for the continuity model . Rebilling experienced affiliates is hard to do , and you better bring a shitload of value to this crowd as well . Just my $0.02 on cakesgate . <p> Great post dude . Its true affiliates are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame/shit/problems are pushed over to affiliates . Ad networks and affiliate networks sandwich affiliates both ways . <p> Exit plan for me is to get hold of a traffic source or get some products . <p> My exit strategy has been real estate for the last 5 years . I own 8 properties now , all because of affiliate marketing and I plan on buying more . I will ride the affiliate train as long as I can then live of rental income and real estate investing , whenever I give up on affiliate marketing . <p> You are smart to think about real estate as a stable source of income , its way more stable than affiliate marketing offers . <p> Affiliate marketing is great though because you can make soo much money , soo damn fast . Its one of the best businesses for super fast income , and then buy real estate with that affiliate money . <p> Its the best plan I thought of and it looks like I 'm not the only one who thinks that , consider you 're posting about it . Keep up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affiliate marketing world , I would n't use it as a barometer for the affiliate industry as a whole . <p> There is plenty money to be made outside of the ubiquitous dubious offers , but its just a bit tougher to crack . For example at ASW I met a guy making a KILLING with CPS selling consumer appliances . <p> I felt many of your sentiments and I switched over the EDU space last year , while I do n't  have the six figure days I still enjoy being legit , stable and not getting hung up on by ad networks once they figure out I want push Acai . <p> Holy shit Finch , you want to get out of AM due to its shadiness , fair enough , but to then move into the property market ? ! I guarantee that you will find it just as shady and drama-filled , if not massively more so , than AM . <p> The reason why ? The only barrier to entry is cash . At least with AM you need some level of intelligence to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With property you do n't  if you got cash , and you do n't  know what to do with it , ultimately you end up running a property business . This means that the majority of the people you will meet in property are not particularly clever or ethical at all , and the amount of shit that goes on is ridiculous . <p> Even if you 're just running a tiny buy-to-let portfolio its a massive headache dealing with crap agencies and tenants and you working as a landlord most of your time , fixing toilets , driving radiators around , etc . Think about hiring an agency to do that ? Kiss your rental margins and income goodbye , and hedge all your bets on capital growth , which as we 've seen recently does n't  always pan out . <p> Stay calm and avoid any aggressive growth and you will make very little money for lots of work . Leverage up your cash ( which is the major benefit of property , the banks will allow you to leverage your deposit substantially , you cant do that in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come another bump in house prices and risk losing everything . <p> Try to start developing when you realize you can turn your +-30k worth of back garden into +-300k once you have planning , and then +-1.2m once you 've built out and sold , and you will then be dealing with architects , council planners , tradesman , etc , etc and it is such a nightmare mate , I ca n't stress . <p> I recommend property only as a last resort and certainly not as your core day-to-day business . And enjoy the easy ( and ethical ) money in AM , you will miss it once its gone . = <p> I do n't  care about the drama , as long as you 're making your dough , Ive seen people do way worse things in order to survive , this is a business like any other . Shady ? Hell yeah , but if you do n't  sell them the stuff they are probably going to buy it from someone else . <p> Youve kept away from continuity products and so have I , I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your peace of mind , drink a little more and keep the money stacking sky high . <p> Since you 've got the hang of this kind of business , keep on it man , its being harder and harder nowadays to make a living , so what you cant tell your grandparents what you do , its not like you 're killing , selling drugs or anything that would give someone cancer ( acai pills wont do that I believe .. lol ) . <p> If there are human beings involved , there will be drama , if you want to run away from drama , better work with robots or something <p> Nicely done bro , at least you are an affiliate marketer with a heart This business is " screw or get screwed " . But I believe affiliate marketers are screwed all the time , by merchants , networks that does n't  pay , and so forth .. Try promoting amazon products for a honest living , they give you a 4% commission , who live like this ? <p> You 're reading my mindz once again Finch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is such a thing as a value added Affiliate . There 's a whole nother world of non-shady extra dorky genuine AffMarketers out there on the pay per sale side of things . <p> But I know what you 're saying . You want to get on the other side of the affiliate equation . And that 's where you should be . You want affiliates pushing your products not vice-versa . Check out the latest addition of Wired " The New Industrial Revolution " . The world is flat Finch . Start dreaming and stop scheming . <p> Oh and if you want a different business model that 's less shady you can invest in my movie . Kidding about the less shady part , but not about the movie . <p> You hit it right on the head . The industry moves so fast who knows what tomorrow can bring . Promoting rebills is NOT a long term business model , however if you do happen to make a bit of money off it , take advantage and invest it into something with greater longevity . <p> If you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get more involved in real estate . Its littered with scumbags , morons , and others who are some combination of both . <p> I get where you 're coming from , though . It always seems the bottom could fall out from you at any time . I think that 's a better reason to look outside of AM than on moral grounds . <p> Your argument about morals falls flat when you compare the sketchy nature of AM to pretty much anything else . Want to get into retail and scam the shit out of dumb people like Best Buy , selling them overpriced services that do n't  actually do anything ( " optimized " windows machines ? ) or maybe HDMI wires at 1,333% markup ? Or maybe you 've got your finance degree and want to get a legitimate job at a bank where you can think of clever ways to screw the poorest 1% of the country out of their last pennies with ridiculous , unjustifiable overdraft fees . The list goes on and on . <p> If your goal is to make money , and want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take advantage of people in some way . <p> Its simple for a successful guy like you . Pay down your bills or as many as you can such that you are either debt-free or only owe on your home . Then , turn around and become an angel investor ( or owner ) of new websites and web apps . Start with a designer , get stuff drawn , and then get some decent devs to build it . If a site does well but the sales start to taper off , or you 've lost passion in it , then flip it for as much cash as possible and move on . And if you do n't  like where you 're living , you would be the kind of wealthy individual who could get a home in Costa Rica , Nicaragua , Panama , Brazil , or Belize . I 'm not there , myself , but these are things I think about for my future . I love the fact that one can relocate to these Central and South American countries and live like a king , taking advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some shady people to avoid in real estate hence the direct reference to Stringer Bell for those whove seen The Wire . I 'm not necessarily talking about property development , but investing money in to brick and mortar assets that do n't  exist in cyber space and are n't  going to disappear without a trace . <p> Where I come from , there 's only one way for the working class to get on the property ladder : wait for a parent to die . <p> I want to avoid this and own a property with enough leverage to be able to cover my own back and forget about mortgage hell . With the prices in London , you can make an absolute mint by getting your paws on the right property . <p> I 'm not saying the real estate space is n't full of assholes , because I 've already dealt with some . But if you have property , you will always have an anchor . The value is always relative to the times . <p> To put it simply , if the Internet crumbled overnight , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to diversify offline , but because I need these kind of challenges to keep my work rate high . <p> @ Volomike Definitely . The idea of swanning it up in Panama with a laptop and a cocktail is something that catches my fancy too . <p> @ Cullen I never said it did . I hardly even post there . As for comments being posted by noobswho knows ? I only see a comment from a dude on his high horse . <p> I agree with the Realtor . I have been up to 23 units and about 90% of the tenants , no matter how many you are on good terms with , fuck you in the end . There 's a lot more to real estate investing than the investment books tell you . Believe me . <p> to deal with as a new affiliate . Some people may see it as selling out , some people may see it as an escape , however I see it as something I really enjoy . Ive been a student-teacher , a writing-aid , <p> I 'm 22 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits to purchase rental propertys since I was 20 . I tried managing them myself which was a shitstorm . Ive since moved onto just buying em if they are cash flow positive , and tossing them to a local property management firm . I initially started doing this due to those Rich Dad , Poor Dad books and some post I read on Wes Mahler ( sp ? ) blog a long time ago . I do n't  think he focuses on real estate investments anymore but I think this is a great way to move from a market a lot of us feel is shady to something a bit more respectable . <p> Also I agree with Corey , the majority of tenants will take advantage of you in a heartbeat if they can . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275 @qwx974275 
@@106277923 @1677923/ 114270 @qwx974270 <p> Its easy to dismiss blogs as a colossal waste of time . They can be wild ego trips , or pointless attempts to feel more understood by your peers . Guilty as charged , that 's probably how it started for me . But when I say that blogging is the smartest career move I ever made , I 'm not exaggerating . <p> One of the great appeals of working on the web has always been the level playing field . I love that it does n't  matter who you are , where you are , or what your story is . You can be as relevant as you want to be in almost any field or industry , just by having the knowledge and putting it out there in the right way . <p> As we see on a daily basis in the " make money online " niche , it rarely even matters if you have the knowledge . Blogging is all about perception . It does n't  matter how smart or dumb you are , just that your readers are buying in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless subscriber stats . Have you heard the saying , If you 're the smartest person in the room , you 're in the wrong room ? <p> How true is that for bloggers ? <p> If you 're the smartest marketer in affiliate marketing , why the hell would you be blogging about it ? Exactly , you would n't . But by blogging about a topic you 're involved with , you instantly make yourself relevant to the field . And when you become relevant , you get leverage with people that simply would n't be approachable to Average Joe with no web presence . I 've never seen blogging as talking down to a crowd . Its a two way relationship , and a great way to establish a reputation . <p> A couple of years ago , I saw friends leaving university with degrees and qualification to their names . But for many of them , it was n't enough to secure a job in the area they studied . How ridiculous is that ? 16 years in education only to join the same rat race as the rest of us . Does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree ? <p> Admittedly , its a lot easier to use a blog as a platform to a career in marketing than it is for , say , structural engineering . But if you have expertise , you should make every attempt to show it ! <p> A blog does n't  have to be a profitable moneymaking machine . It can simply be a professional stamp of what you have to offer in your line of work . We all like to make fun of the stay-at-home-mum bloggers who write piles of sweet nothing to a circle of fans that eat it up anyway . But if you 're sitting on your degree and expecting qualifications to carry you up the ladder , I think its time for a reality check . <p> Its not about the talent you have , but what you do with it that counts . Perception is everything to so many careers . And a successful blog can make you relevant in whatever industry you 're trying to crack . 114274 @qwx974274 <p> On the subject of putting value in yourself , I highly recommend Awaken The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way with words that can light a candle up even the pluckiest of arseholes. 114266 @qwx974266 <p> Finch 114270 @qwx974270 <p> This is very true.A lot of my buddies Ive graduated with are still looking for work even after a few months , some even more than a year.A blog is a sure way to expose yourself to the right crowd , its like having a personal job recruiter . <p> Blogging is great to showcase your knowledge , especially if you are looking to expand your business offline . It gives your clients a great reference point to see that you have knowledge and that you have somewhat of an online brand already . Great insight . 114268 @qwx974268 114270 @qwx974270 114267 @qwx974267 114269 @qwx974269 114271 @qwx974271 114275
