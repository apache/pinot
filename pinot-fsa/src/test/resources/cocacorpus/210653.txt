But before we can even think about products , routines and how to care for it , we need to know what we 're dealing with . That 's where skin type comes in . There are five general skin type categories that can help us define our skin and get to know it better . Of course , our skin is complicated and it wo n't always fit neatly into one category . <p> There are many factors that can influence and change it , but the guide below should help you get a better idea of your skin 's overall behavior .

For example , you may want to use a mild cleanser and moisturizer on your cheeks and a more stringent product on your T-zone to cut through the oil . <h> Sensitive Skin Type <p> Many people wrongly assume they have sensitive skin after one or two bad reactions to a product . However , it could be that the product just was n't a good mix with your skin or contained irritating ingredients . Truly sensitive skin is easily aggravated by most products and cleansers and usually experiences a low-level of irritation and discomfort at all times .

Hydroquinone is a skin lightening cream that can slow down the production of melanin ( the pigment that gives our skin color ) in the skin .

IPL , also known as flashlamp therapy , is a non-invasive treatment that targets the lower levels of the skin ( dermis ) using high-intensity pulses of visible light . This causes micro-injuries to the skin which helps encourage new collagen production in the affected area , resulting in a more even complexion . IPL is similar to laser treatments in the fact that they both use light waves , but laser treatments use a single wavelength of light while IPL uses a broad spectrum in combination with filters . <p> In addition , laser treatments can either be ablative or non-ablative . Ablative laser treatments cause injury to the top layers of the skin which are then removed while non-ablative treatments target the lower layers of the skin through heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dermatologist to see which option is right for your specific skin concern . A popular non-ablative laser treatment is the Fraxel laser treatment . <h> AHA or BHA Exfoliants <p> Another way to get rid of redness on the skin is to encourage the turnover of skin cells so that the skin heals faster . This can be done through exfoliation . Exfoliation sloughs off dead skin cells , revealing new skin underneath . When you typically think of exfoliation you may imagine a salt or sugar scrub . While these manual exfoliants can be good for everyday skin care , chemical exfoliants are usually more effective in penetrating the skin deeply . <p> BHA or beta hydroxyl acid is able to go deep into the pores , removing oil and getting rid of dead skin cells and buildup that can create redness and breakouts .

Two common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural remedy to get rid of red spots <p> While they are often not as potent as over the counter treatments , sometimes a natural remedy can help reduce redness with the added bonus that you probably already have the ingredients for it in your kitchen .

Cucumbers contain vitamin C that acts as an anti-inflammatory and the cold temperature helps bring down any swelling in the red area . Green tea is another anti-inflammatory ingredient . <p> To unlock its benefits , simply steep several tea bags in a pot of boiling water . Then , soak a washcloth in the tea and use it to cleanse your face . If your red spots are from dryness and irritation and not acne or a breakout , you can try putting coconut oil on the red spot .

With so much skin care advice out there and multitudes of products to choose from , it can be difficult to know where to focus your energy . But underlining most skin care philosophies and theories are five basic steps that form the foundation of a good and smart skin care routine . Read on for the five basic steps you can take towards a clear and healthy complexion . <h> Daily skin care routine - Step 1 : Cleanse <p> Cleansing the skin removes sweat , oil , dirt and other pollutants that your skin naturally collects throughout the day and night . It 's the first step in your new simple skin care routine . <p> How to do it : <p> Cleanse your skin in the morning and in the evening to keep your pores clear and your face fresh . Your cleanser may vary based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general consensus is to apply them using an upward , circular motion so as to prevent wrinkles from forming . Make sure your hands are clean in order to prevent excess dirt from entering your pores . If you have very sensitive skin , using only water would also do the trick ! <h> Word of advice : <p> It 's best to steer clear of harsh bar soaps when cleansing your face , as they tend to dry out your skin and cause it to overproduce sebum , the natural oils your skin produces for protection which also contribute to clogged pores and breakouts . <h> Daily skin care routine - Step 2 : Tone <p> What it does : <p> There is a lot of confusion around toner , and when you 're first establishing a daily skin care routine , it may even seem unnecessary . But most experts agree that toning is an important addition to your skin care routine with beneficial effects for your skin . After you cleanse your skin of impurities , toner removes any residue left behind by the cleanser as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The added cleansing effects help prepare your skin to absorb moisturizer and minimize the appearance of pores . Some toners may have PH balancing and antiseptic effects as well . <p> How to do it : <p> Apply toner right after you have cleansed your skin , while it is still damp . The best way to apply it is with a cotton pad or cotton ball , simply soaking the pads in the toner and wiping upwards , starting at your neck . <h> Word of advice : <p> Most experts advise against using harsh alcohol or citrus-based toners as they can damage and irritate your skin . See if a toner works for you , and if not , take this step out of your routine . <h> Daily skin care routine - Step 3 : Exfoliate <p> What it does : <p> Our skin is constantly shedding millions of skin cells everyday , but sometimes those cells can build up on the surface of our skin and need some extra help to be removed . Exfoliating removes these dead skin cells that have accumulated in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakouts , you 're not going to want to miss this step . <p> How to do it : <p> It 's best to exfoliate after toning and before moisturizing . Most dermatologists agree that you should exfoliate one to three times a week , but this depends on your skin type and how it reacts to exfoliation . Experiment and find what works best for you . There are chemical exfoliators and granule exfoliators such as your traditional sugar or salt scrub . Both can be effective tools for removing dead skin cells , but chemical exfoliating ingredients like AHA and BHA are often more effective in getting deep into your pores and removing buildup . <h> Word of advice : <p> If you struggle with blackhead and acne or sun damage , opt for chemical exfoliators that contain AHA and BHA over your traditional granule scrub . For acne and blackhead plagued skin , look for an exfoliator containing BHA as it penetrates deeply into your pores . If you struggle with sun damage , AHA is your preferred option as it mainly exfoliates the upper layers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Moisturize <p> What it does : <p> Moisturizing provides a protective layer to the skin that locks in moisture and keeps skin hydrated . This hydration is what gives your skin a smooth , luminous appearance . Needless to say , this is a step in your skin care routine you do n't want to skip . <p> How to do it : <p> Choose a moisturizer based on your skin type " it can be a cream , lotion , gel or oil " and gently rub it into your skin in an upward motion , being careful not to tug on the delicate skin around your eyes . Once the moisturizer is applied , give it time to sink in so you receive its full benefits . <h> Word of advice : <p> Look for a moisturizer with a SPF of at least 15 for the daytime , an important factor in preventing skin cancer symptoms and keeping your skin healthy as you age . Find a moisturizer that works for your skin type . People with oily skin should opt for lighter moisturizers while people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daily skin care routine - Step 5 : Apply SPF <p> What it does : <p> The sun is the most damaging factor for skin and the leading cause of skin cancer .

These are the skin cells that lie at the bottom layer of the epidermis and surround the hair follicles . <h> Which areas are affected ? <p> Basal cell carcinoma develops in skin that is most frequently exposed to the sun , because of this it is commonly found on the nose , forehead and cheeks . Though it sometimes develops on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basal cell carcinoma ? <p> Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) can affect people of all ages , but it most commonly affects people who are middle aged or elderly . <h> Are there any other names for basal cell carcinoma ? <p> As well as being known as basal cell carcinoma or BCC , this type of cancer is often referred to as basal cell skin cancer . The lesion that develops is also known as a rodent ulcer . <h> What are the signs and symptoms of this type of cancer ? <p> Basal cell carcinomas usually start as small lumps that gradually get bigger over time . The edges are often shiny or pearly and the middle tends to be rather sunken in or depressed . After some time the middle will start to become crusty and develop into an ulcer . Basal cell carcinomas do not usually cause any pain or discomfort , however they can be rather itchy . If they are scratched they will tend to bleed , but otherwise they are known to be pain free . <h> What happens to a BCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will grow in size , getting deeper as well as bigger . The tissue around the area may get infected too , bone tissue and cartilage are often affected if a BCC is not treated . In Australia and Europe it is unlikely that a rodent ulcer will develop to the stage where it is affecting the tissue around it . This form of skin cancer is usually caught early on in these countries and treatment has a very high success rate . <h> Are there a number of different types of BCC ? <p> There are several different types of BCC , but the most common is the nodular type with around half of diagnosed BCCs being classed as nodular . You can also get superficial , morphoeic and pigmented BCCs . <p> Nodular " single , shiny , red nodules . Often on the face . <p> Superficial " Often multiple , common on back and shoulders .

This means you can start treatment as soon as possible . Because basal cell carcinomas occur in the deep layers of the skin , it can take some time for the lesions to present themselves . As they are also painless , it is only when the lesions are visible that we know to seek medical help . By performing regular skin checks and familiarising yourself with the symptoms of skin cancer , you will be able to act quickly . <h> Can basal cell skin cancer develop into secondary cancer ? <p> It is incredibly rare for basal cell skin cancer to develop into secondary cancer , but it is possible to have a number of BCCs at any given time .

During a biopsy the whole growth or part of it will be removed . <h> How is BCC treated ? <p> If the biopsy shows that you have skin cancer , then you will need to have the growth or lesion removed as a matter of urgency . The most common method for treating BCC is with excision . During this procedure the area is numbed and then the affected area is cut away , along with some of the normal looking skin around it .

Mohs surgery is used for difficult-to-treat basal cell skin cancer . It involves the surgeon examining skin cells under the microscope to establish what is healthy skin tissue and what has been infected by cancer cells . <h> Prognosis <p> Basal cell carcinoma is very easy to treat and survival rates are high .

@@43152292 @3152292/ <h> What is melanoma ? The Complete Story . 27156 @qwx437156 <p> Melanoma is the least common type of skin cancer , but it is the most deadly . According to the World Health Organization , there are about 132,000 new cases of melanoma worldwide each year , and although it only accounts for approximately 1% of skin cancer cases , melanoma is responsible for a large majority of skin cancer deaths . So what is melanoma exactly ? <p> There can be a lot to know when it comes to understanding melanoma . From diagnosing it to the different forms it takes , we look at the disease from all angles and explain the fundamentals to recognizing and protecting yourself from this deadly form of skin cancer . <h> First things first : what is melanoma ? <p> Melanoma begins in melanocyte cells found in the innermost layer of the epidermis ( the top layer of our skin ) . It occurs when those cells behave abnormally , growing excessively and taking over surrounding tissues . Melanomas can develop from existing moles or skin growths , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Melanoma is considered the most dangerous form of skin cancer as it typically will spread to other areas of the body , including organs , if left untreated . Non-melanoma skin cancers , such assquamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma , are generally considered less dangerous as they are less likely to spread and can usually be treated with a simple surgery . Melanoma can occur anywhere on the body , including areas not exposed to the sun , like inside the mouth or the palms of the hands . Men are more likely to get melanomas on their back while women are more likely to experience them on their legs . <h> What causes it ? <p> Melanomas are caused by gene mutations . And while there are things that increase the risk factor for developing the gene mutations that cause melanoma , doctors are still unclear on how these factors trigger melanoma to form . <p> According to the American Cancer Society , most of the gene changes commonly seen in melanoma cells are not inherited . In fact , most cases of melanoma are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put incidences of skin cancer caused by sun exposure at around 95% . The UV ( ultraviolet ) rays from the sun damage skin cells ' ability to repair DNA . When this happens , risk of cancer increases . <p> Some melanomas , especially those formed in areas that are n't regularly exposed to sunlight , exhibit different gene changes . And it 's important to note that risk of melanoma increases if someone in the family has had melanoma , with gene mutations being passed from one generation to the next . <p> If melanoma is found early , it can often be cured through relatively simple surgery . But if it is caught at a later stage , it can spread to other areas of the body and be more difficult to cure . <h> What are the symptoms of melanoma ? <p> Melanoma appears on the skin as a new spot or growth or a change in an already existing mole . <p> A normal mole will be even in color , quite small and will have appeared during the early part of your life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . It wo n't change and it wo n't evolve . That is what really makes it normal . <h> Know your ABCDEs <p> Dermatologists identify melanoma symptoms using the ABCDE method . This method shows you which signs to look out for when examining suspicious moles , spots or growths on your skin . <p> Melanoma lesions are often irregular , or not symmetrical , in shape . Benign moles are usually symmetrical . <p> B - Border <p> Typically , non-cancerous moles have smooth , even borders . Melanoma lesions usually have irregular borders that are difficult to define . <p> C - Color <p> The presence of more than one color ( blue , black , brown , tan , etc. ) or the uneven distribution of color can sometimes be a warning sign of melanoma . Benign moles are usually a single shade of brown or tan . <p> D - Diameter <p> Melanoma lesions are often greater than 6 millimeters in diameter ( approximately the size of a pencil eraser ) . <p> E - Evolution <p> The evolution of your mole(s) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diagnosing a melanoma . Knowing what is normal for YOU could save your life . If a mole has gone through recent changes in color and/or size , bring it to the attention of a dermatologist immediately . <p> If you notice one or more of these symptoms , contact a dermatologist immediately . <h> Pay attention to changes <p> Your skin is always changing " in fact your skin replaces itself all the time . So if you see something on your skin that does n't go away over the course of a month or so that means it sits in the lower layers of skin . These weird skin abnormalities should be checked out " they could be melanoma symptoms . <p> It is even better if you can keep track of the size and shape of your moles and spots so that you will be able to show your doctor a timeline to help with diagnosis . <h> More mole symptoms : when your mole , spot or growth is acting strange <p> We all have moles and marks on our skin , and in almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure and are not dangerous . But if your mole is taking on some strange characteristics , the time has come for a second opinion . To recap and cover some additional warning signs , see your doctor if a mole or skin growth : <p> -+develops a crust or a scab-+sometimes bleeds-+is itchy-+feels tender-+is getting bigger or swelling-+is strangely shaped ( ie. not round ) -+has borders that are irregular-+includes lots of different colors or shades-+is bigger than the size of a pencil eraser in diameter-+has appeared recently ( ie. when you are an adult ) <h> Melanoma Types <p> There are four common types of melanoma . Most forms are classified as in situ , meaning they only occur on the top layers of skin . The more rare forms that arise within deeper layers of our skin are considered invasive and dangerous as they are more likely to spread to other organs . <h> Superficial Spreading Melanoma <p> This type of melanoma is the most common . As the name suggests , it forms on the top layers of skin and usually presents itself as a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase . This patch often begins from an irregular mole ( or dysplastic nevus ) . This type of melanoma almost always occurs in light-skinned individuals as a result of sun exposure , commonly appearing on the trunks of men and legs of women . If left untreated , it can eventually spread to lower layers of skin and become more dangerous . <h> Nodular Melanoma <p> This is the second most common type of melanoma and more invasive than superficial spreading melanoma . Nodular melanoma is characterized by the way it grows vertically . Starting as a bump on the skin 's surface , this type of melanoma roots downwards into the fat , blood and tissue of the body . This makes it more dangerous as it increases the cancer 's chance of surviving and spreading to other areas . Nodular melanoma is also different from normal types of melanoma because it is harder to identify with the ABCDE method of skin cancer detection . This form of melanoma can be any color and feels firmer than normal moles or growths . Its growth is n't always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any mole or growth , even if it does n't fit within the ABCDE symptoms , insist to have it biopsied by a doctor . <h> Lentigo Maligna Melanoma <p> This type of melanoma is most common in elderly people . It is similar to superficial spreading melanoma in that it usually begins as a group of malignant cells that spread on the surface of the skin . Over time , the lentigo maligna can worsen and move to lower layers of the skin . Once it invades deeper layers , it is considered a melanoma . It normally is seen on the head and neck and looks like brown , mottled patches or bumps . <h> Acral Lentiginous Melanoma <p> This type of melanoma also spreads along the top layers of skin before penetrating deeply ; however , it is unique as it is usually found on the palms , soles and under the nails , occurring in areas of the body that do n't grow hair and may or may not be exposed to sunlight . This is the least common type of melanoma in Caucasian people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is observed as long tan , black or brown streaks under the fingernails or as dark spots or patches on the palms or soles of the feet . This type of melanoma is slow growing at first and can often look like harmless discolored patches . Once nodules begin to form , it 's a sign that the cancer has spread deeper and is more deadly . <h> Melanoma treatment <p> Treatments for melanoma can range from a simple mole removal to radiation therapy for more serious cases . There are four stages of skin cancer , which increase in severity . <p> Depending on which stage a melanoma is in and how deep it has spread throughout the skin , treatments vary accordingly . Based on the type and stage of the cancer , best treatment options should be discussed thoroughly with your doctor . <h> Melanoma prevention <p> The best way to prevent melanoma is to limit your sun exposure and apply sunscreen frequently .

Spot the difference ? The twin on the left has had significantly more sun exposure than her sister on the right . <p> Up to 90% of the skin damage attributed to aging is , in fact , caused by UVA and UVB , the evil twins of ultraviolet ( UV ) light . Sunlight contains several types of UV , most of which is absorbed by the earth 's atmosphere . The majority of the UV radiation which reaches the earth 's surface , up to 95% , is UVA , with the remainder being made up by UVB . <p> UVB light causes tanning and sunburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . Any change in skin colour , including a golden tan , is due to skin damage . A sunburn peels due to a form of skin cell suicide which prevents the damaged cells from becoming cancerous . UVB rays are also responsible for freckles , age spots , moles and ultimately skin cancers such as deadly melanomas . UVB is most intense in summer and varies depending on the time of day , level of cloud cover , and the presence of sand , snow , water and other reflective surfaces . <p> UVA is the less obvious but more insidious member of the ultraviolet duo . The level of UVA in sunlight remains constant , it passes through glass and penetrates the deeper dermis layer of the skin , which provides structural support via collagen and elastin . Prolonged UVA exposure damages the collagen fibres in the dermis resulting in drooping , wrinkles , bags and other signs of aging . It also causes broken veins and increases skin bruising by thinning the walls of the blood vessels in the dermis . <p> Recent studies also implicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin cells called keratinocytes found in the basal layer of the epidermis where the most common skin cancers , basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma occur . Up to 90 percent of these skin cancers are associated with UV exposure . <p> Sunbeds emit UVA doses up to 12 times greater than the sun , leading to much higher levels of skin cancers in sunbed users . <p> In summary , prolonged exposure to UV in sunlight can result in the following changes to skin : Wrinkles , loss of skin elasticity , thinner and more translucent skin , broken capillaries , liver or age spots , dry , rough and leathery skin and skin cancers . <p> SkinVision helps you to preserve the beauty of your skin by providing personalised tracking of local UVB exposure .

Lighter skinned populations are more likely to develop melanoma as darker skinned people generally have more UV-protective melanin in their skin .

This means that at least some of the rise is due to a real increase in incidence . <h> Tanning beds are a no-go <p> Another reason for the rising melanoma rates is an increase in tanning bed usage over the years .

Another analysis of nine SEER registry databases ( 1975-2006 ) also showed that age-specific melanoma incidence rates were greater among women than men prior to age 40 . <h> An aging population contributes <p> Another driving factor for the increase in melanoma incidence is simply an aging population as cancer risk increases with age .

The World Health Organization estimates that a 10 per cent decrease in ozone levels will result in an additional 300,000 non-melanoma and 4,500 melanoma skin cancer cases . The ozone layer protects us from the sun 's harmful UV radiation and makes life on earth possible for humans . The release of ozone depleting substances into our atmosphere is breaking down this layer and increasing the strength of UV radiation . This can be seen in Australia especially as it is close to the Antarctic ozone hole , and , as a result , experiences higher rates of UV radiation .

Your skin usually has an even tone and a soft texture with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of oil or dryness on your face , but when you do , it is easily resolved and not a major issue . Your skin is generally blemish free , save the occasional outbreak , and does n't feel too dry or too shiny at the end of the day . <p> How to care for it : Lighter lotions and serums are ideal for your skin type because you do n't need much to keep your skin in balance and hydrated . Use gentle , water-soluble cleansers and look for a toner containing antioxidants to be proactive in helping your skin age well . <h> Dry Skin Type <p> What it is : Skin that is tight , flaky and lacking in moisture . <p> How do you know if you have it ? Small pores and an overall feeling of tightness characterize dry skin . Your skin often has more visible lines , less elasticity and a duller complexion . Sometimes people with dry skin will also experience flaking , but this is n't always the case . <p> How to care for it : Moisture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich creams to nourish your skin cells . If your skin feels dry but you still get breakouts , then your issue may not be dry skin . Instead , your skin may be feeling dry because of the products you 're using . Try going without them for a few days and see if your skin improves . If it does , then you know you should use gentler products free of sulfates and other harsh ingredients to avoid irritation . <h> Oily Skin Type <p> What it is : Oily skin is shiny and prone to breakouts and acne . <p> How do you know if you have it ? People with oily skin tend to have larger pores , and a shiny , thicker feeling complexion . Your skin produces more than enough oil so hydration is n't your issue . Rather , blackheads and pimples are a common problem with this skin type . If you still are n't sure if you have oily skin , blot your face with a tissue and see if oil stays behind . <p> How to care for it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often with liquid and gel formulas and stay away from heavy creams and emollients . Also be sure to look for oil-free sunscreens and lotions so that you do n't inadvertently add more oil to your skin . <h> Combination Skin Type <p> What it is : Combination skin exhibits multiple skin types at once . <p> How do you know if you have it ? While most of us have combination skin to some degree or another since there are more oil-producing glands around our nose than other areas of our face , this skin type experiences it to a larger degree . Combination skin is typically marked by a consistently oily T-zone with dryness in other areas of the face . <p> How to care for it : This is the most common skin type , and people with combination skin should consider using different products for different areas of the face to keep skin in balance . Use mild , gel cleansers and alcohol-free toners on oily areas and hydrate dry areas with light serums and moisturizers . <h> Sensitive Skin Type <p> What it is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products or the weather , resulting in rashes , stinging and/or blotchy patches . <p> How do you know if you have it ? Your skin often breaks out and develops rashes and red spots . You may experience , stinging , swelling , flakiness and itching . Your skin tends to flush red from the wind , cleansing or sun exposure . <p> How to care for it : This is the most delicate skin type to care for . Find a skin care routine that works for you by doing patch tests before using a product to see if they aggravate your skin . Avoid harsh ingredients , and do n't use too many active ingredients at once . Active ingredients are the ingredients in the product that are actually enacting change and affecting your skin . These ingredients have been scientifically proven to have medical effects and benefits . Other ingredients are used as a medium to deliver the active ingredient.Also be sure toavoid rough scrubbing mitts and use lukewarm water " nothing too hot or too @qwx437159 27154 @qwx437154 27161 @qwx437161

Melanoma can occur anywhere on the body , including areas not exposed to the sun , like inside the mouth or the palms of the hands . Men are more likely to get melanomas on their back while women are more likely to experience them on their legs . <p> Melanoma begins in melanocyte cells . It occurs when those cells behave abnormally , growing excessively and taking over surrounding tissues .

However , what can we do if working outdoors is part of our daily life ? Here is some practical advice for HR managers who want to keep their employees safe against the dangers of skin cancer . <p> Sun protection policy <p> The first thing to do is to implement a sun protection policy , or update the one you may already have . Make sure it is reviewed regularly and ensures that everyone is safe . You also need to be sure that sub-contractors are aware of the policy , as well as your regular members of staff . <p> Sun screen <p> When being outside in full sunlight ca n't be avoided then it is imperative that adequate sun protection is used . Ensure that all of your employees are advised on the benefits of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety programme . All employees should know to apply sunblock at least 15 minutes before being exposed to the sun . They should follow these simple rules : <p> -+Choose a sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher . Ensure it is water-resistant and provides broad-spectrum coverage ( protects against both UVA and IVB rays ) . <p> -+Apply sunscreen liberally at least 15 minutes before going outside . Be sure to cover every area of exposed skin . <p> -+Do n't forget your lips . Keep them protected using a lipbalm of a minimum of SPF 15 . <p> -+Reapply sunscreen at least every 2 hours . If you get into contact with water or sweat excessively then this needs to be more regularly . <p> As well as providing training on sun protection and the dangers of skin cancer and melanoma , you could also allow your outdoor workers a break every two hours to apply sunscreen . You could provide adequate sun protection for all of your outdoor workers and you could even allow them to start work half an hour later in order for them to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider supplying sunscreen to all outdoors workers or even adding funds to their uniform allowance to pay for sunscreen . <p> Portable protection <p> Sun hats are essential when it comes to protecting your face , ears and back of the neck . Portable protection can be incorporated into a protective helmet or integrated into the uniform . In order to keep your staff safe from the dangers of skin cancer , you need to make it a hard rule that everyone must use the portable protection that you provide . <p> Education <p> Although we are all aware of the dangers of exposure to direct sunlight , it is easy to forget how damaging UV rays can be , even on a cloudy day . It is vital that all of your outdoor workers receive adequate training and education to understand the dangers of skin cancer and melanoma .

Whether skin cancer and melanoma treatment is covered by the healthcare package that you provide , or you simply provide information about what to do if you find a mole then at least your staff are being looked after . As a HR manager working with people who spend a great deal of time outdoors , you need to be aware of the risks of skin cancer and melanoma and stay informed of treatment options .

There are several forms of radiotherapy used to treat ocular melanoma : <p> Plaque therapy <p> Plaque therapy , also known as brachytherapy , is the most common form of radiotherapy treatment . According to the Ocular Melanoma Foundation , in this type of therapy , a small disc-shaped shield called a plaque that is covered in radioactive seeds is adhered to the outside of the eye , covering the tumor . It is left on for a few days and then removed . This has become the standard practice for the majority of ocular melanoma patients with small or medium sized tumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam radiotherapy , targets the tumor through the front of the eye with charged particles that damage the cancer cells .

It does this by pointing a large number of radiation beams at the tumor from many different angles at once or by directing a single beam around the tumor from many different angles . <p> Surgical treatments <p> For large tumors and melanomas on the iris , surgical removal of the tumor is often recommended . If the melanoma returns after radiation treatments , surgery may also be the chosen treatment route . There are several forms of surgical treatment .

This usually occurs when the tumor is large , and it is typically followed-up with a radioactive plaque placed over the treated area to help reduce the chances of the tumor returning . <p> Trans-Retinal Endoresection : This is when the tumor is removed through a hole in the retina . It is often done when the tumor is too close to the optic nerve and it is typically followed up with laser treatment to kill any cancer cells that were missed and to help prevent the cancer from returning . <p> Metastatic Ocular Melanoma <p> Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or metastasized , treatment options are generally not good .

The incidence numbers have been rising for decades now , and with summer temperatures around the world reaching ( or breaking ) records , these numbers do not seem to decline soon . So why is skin cancer so common ? That 's an important question to answer if we want to fight this threat globally . Let 's take a look at the most pressing causes . <h> Awareness <p> The first sentence of this article , where we state that skin cancer is one of the fastest growing types of cancer , is something that usually shocks people . One of the major causes of rising skin cancer rates is the lack of awareness . There are countries where skin cancer is heavily campaigned against . <p> For example in New Zealand and Australia , people are educated at a young age . But for other countries this is not the case . When we understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . <p> For you , reading this article means that you are already aware of the risk or at least exploring it . Make sure to educate your friends and family members as well . That 's important . If you need a simple tool that goes with that , share the SkinVision app with them so they can track their own skin and check for signs of skin cancer whenever they need to . <h> Lifestyle , sun and tanning beds <p> The second common cause for skin cancer is lifestyle . We love the sun ! And that makes sense , as sunlight is healthy and makes you feel good . But the sun 's UV radiation is also the biggest cause of skin cancer globally . <p> How to deal with it ? Make sure to always use sunscreen ( and re-apply often ! ) when you are outside , both for fun and work . And do n't over-expose yourself to sunlight . During the hottest hours , do n't stay in the sun too long but find some shade as well . <p> Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Multiple studies have proven that those are a major cause of skin cancer cases . The UV radiation from these beds is strong and people do not properly protect themselves . <h> Not seeing a doctor in time <p> Whenever we feel that something might be wrong , most of us do n't run off to the doctor immediately . Same goes for our skin . When we see a skin spot that looks a bit odd , or has changed recently - we might worry , but we hope that it will go away . <p> It 's important to know that for skin cancer ( and for melanoma especially , the most deadly form ) it 's essential to detect it early , so that treatment can start and will be sufficient to get rid of it . The longer you wait , the more difficult it gets to treat and the more dangerous it becomes . <p> So make sure to regularly check your skin for any developments and if you feel uncomfortable , go @qwx437159 27154 @qwx437154 27161 @qwx437161

UVB causes tanning and sunburn as well as being responsible for freckles , age spots , moles and ultimately skin cancers such as deadly melanomas . While UVA levels remain constant in all environmental conditions , UVB levels vary according to the circumstances . Here are 6 steps to sun damage . <p> 1 ) High noon ( for your skin ) : UVB is most intense during the summer months and when the sun is highest in the sky , with levels peaking at noon , and remaining high between 10am and 2pm . In temperate regions , the daily summer peak of UVB radiation can be one thousand times higher than in winter . <p> 2 ) Clear skies : Clouds really do have a silver lining since cloud cover scatters UV radiation from the sun back into space . The more opaque the cloud , the less UVB will penetrate it . Scattered clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds transmit 73% and overcast skies reduce UV levels to 31% . <p> 3 ) Exotic locations : The closer your location to the equator , the higher the levels of UV radiation reaching the earth . It 's no accident that you find populations at tropical latitudes have darker skin ; melanin acts as a protective shield against ultraviolet radiation . The lighter your skin tone , the higher the risk of damage in the tropical sun . <p> 4 ) High times : The earth 's atmosphere is thinner at high altitudes and consequently filters less UVB radiation . With every 1000 meters increase in altitude above sea level , UV levels increase by 10% to 12% . <p> 5 ) Snow , sand and sea : Snow , water and sand are highly reflective surfaces which bounce UV rays back upwards .

But natural skin care is more than hippie inspired treatments or earthy packaging . There are many natural skin care tips that we would all do well to follow , especially if we care about the ingredients going into our body and on our skin . Below we go over a few of the best natural skin care tips to make your daily routine a little simpler and a little cleaner . <h> Pay attention to what goes in your body <p> The truth is that natural skin care is about what you put into your body as much as it is about what you put on it .

All we want when this happens is a quick solution that can get us on our way and does n't require an extra trip to the store . For those days , it 's time to turn to a home remedy . You know , those solutions that are passed down from generation to generation and can usually be made with a few ingredients from your pantry . <p> Below we list three of the most tried and true home remedies for clearing up your skin in a pinch . <h> Apple Cider Vinegar <p> The benefits of apple cider vinegar ( ACV ) are being touted everywhere these days , and for good reason . This ingredient is anti-bacterial and antiseptic , which means it kills bacteria that can clog our pores and cause breakouts . It is made from apples that undergo a double fermentation process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as an acid called malic acid . Malic acid has antibacterial , antifungal and antiviral properties , adding to ACV 's ability to fight acne and ward off pimples . ACV also helps balance the pH ( acidity level ) of our skin . Since our skin is naturally acidic , many basic soaps and cleansers can disrupt its balance , which , can in turn , inadvertently cause more oil production and breakouts to occur . The slightly acidic nature of ACV helps restore balance to our skin . <p> How to use : <p> It 's always advised to dilute ACV before applying to your skin because it can be quite strong . Mix one-part ACV and one-part water to make an easy and effective skin toner . Use like your normal toner , avoiding the areas around the eyes , or leave on and rinse off after a few minutes if your skin is more sensitive . As ACV can be too intense for many people at first , be sure to do a spot test before using . Dilute the ACV with more water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the strength over time as your skin adjusts . <h> Honey <p> Honey has been used for centuries as a way to heal and soothe the skin . Its antimicrobial and antibacterial properties make it ideal for cleansing the skin and getting rid of pimples . Honey also makes a great cleanser because it naturally helps our skin retain moisture , keeping it soft and reducing wrinkles . <p> How to use : <p> Buy any type of raw honey ( although many people say Manuka honey offers superior antibacterial and healing properties ) and use it as you would your normal face cleanser . You can also use it as a spot treatment , dabbing it on to your pimples and letting it sit for 10-15 minutes before rinsing off . <h> Tea Tree Oil <p> Tea tree oil is made from the Australian paperbark tree ( Latin name : melaleuca alternifolia ) . This tree has been used for centuries by Australian aborigines for a range of healing purposes and its benefits have recently caught on all over the world . It has natural antibacterial , antifungal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide variety of skin ailments . Because of its ability to kill bacteria , it is especially helpful for treating acne and breakouts . <p> How to apply : <p> Before using tea tree oil , dab a few drops on a cotton swab , wipe it on your inner arm and wait a few minutes to see if your skin reacts . If nothing happens , it is safe to use undiluted on your skin . If you experience a mild reaction , you 'll want to dilute it by 50 percent with water . Once you know your tolerance , use it like an acne treatment . Wash your face as usual and use a cotton pad to apply the oil directly to your breakout , no need to rinse it off . Do this in the morning and evening . You can also use it as a toner by adding four drops of tea tree oil to one cup of water and applying it once a day . Other recipes advise for every 25 ml of water to add 10 drops of tea tree oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add other essential oils as well @qwx437159 27154 @qwx437154 27161 @qwx437161

While it is the rarest form of skin cancer , it is also the deadliest . That 's why knowing what it looks like is key to catching it early and preventing it from spreading deeper into the body . Below we go over the common symptoms of melanoma so you can know how it looks and what you should watch out for on your skin . <h> How melanoma begins <p> Melanoma typically develops from a new or pre-existing mole . It can also start as an unusually pigmented growth or lesion and can occur anywhere on the body . The best way to spot any new or abnormal growths is to first understand what is normal for your skin .

Knowing what is normal for YOU could save your life . If a mole has gone through recent changes in color and/or size , bring it to the attention of a dermatologist immediately . <p> If you notice one or more of these symptoms , contact a doctor or dermatologist immediately . <h> The advanced stage symptoms <p> While melanoma typically begins as a mole or new growth , if it has advanced to the lymph nodes , organs or other areas of the body , the symptoms can manifest in more physical ways . <p> Some advanced stage symptoms of melanoma include : <p> -+hard or swollen lymph nodes ( these are located throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and groin regions ) . -+hard lumps in your skin-+shortness of breath , chest pain , noisy breathing or a cough that wo n't go away-+pain in your liver ( located on the right side of your stomach ) -+achy bones-+a headache that wo n't go away-+bowel issues and constipation-+chronic fatigue <p> If you notice any of the above symptoms , contact your doctor immediately .

According to the American Cancer Society , three things need to happen in order for the cancer cells to metastasize in a new area . <p> - One : they need to attach to the wall of a blood or lymph vessel and move through it into a new organ. - Two : they need to have the necessary nutrients to grow in the new site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . <p> If the cancer cells manage to do all of these things , then a new tumor will develop .

@@43152459 @3152459/ <h> Five essential vitamins for healthy skin <p> Published about 1 year ago , by Roeland Pater <p> Our skin is not just our buffer to the outside world ; it is also intimately connected to what goes on inside our bodies . Through the foods we eat , the environment we live in , the amount of exercise we get and how often we take time to relax , we are affecting the health and look of our skin . That 's why it 's important to pay attention to the substances our body needs to thrive . Vitamins are one of these substances that can often be overlooked but are vital to our skin 's health . <p> Below , we go over why vitamins are important , which ones are essential for supporting your skin health and where you can find them in your supermarket . <p> What is a vitamin ? <p> Vitamins are chemical compounds our body needs in limited quantities to function properly but can not produce on its own . That means we must acquire these vitamins from external factors such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our body needs , split into two categories : fat and water-soluble . Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in our body 's fatty tissues and liver and used when needed , while water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body and are generally excreted with urination . This difference is important to note , especially when taking vitamin pills , as it influences the dose and frequency that is safe for our body . Each vitamin plays an important role in the body and vitamin deficiencies can cause health problems to occur . <p> While all vitamins influence your skin health , there are five in particular you should pay attention to if your skin is breaking out or feeling dull and unbalanced . <h> Vitamins for healthy skin <p> Vitamin A <p> Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin present in many foods . It plays a large role in our skin 's complexion by repairing skin cells , producing enzymes that stabilize the production of collagen and helping our skin stay moist . If you are low on vitamin A you may notice your skin becoming dry and flaky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helping fight free radical damage . <p> Where you can get it : Look for orange fruits and vegetables to get the Vitamin A your body needs . Vitamin A can be found in cantaloupe , mangoes , squash , sweet potatoes and in liver and other green leafy vegetables . <p> Vitamin B Complex <p> Vitamin B complex refers to the collection of eight B vitamins that are essential for many processes in our body . These water-soluble vitamins help our body make new cells , prevent early aging , regulate our mood and sleep patterns , and so much more . Working in harmony together in our body , they reap added benefits for our skin . The B vitamins have been shown to help hydrate our skin and form the basic structure of nails , skin and hair cells . <p> Where you can get it : Eat eggs , milk , legumes , whole grains , nuts and seeds to unlock the powers of Vitamin B complex in your body . <p> Vitamin C <p> With the help of the citrus industry , the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C is a water-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant in the body , helping protect our cells , strengthen our immune systems and prevent wrinkles and sun damage . It also helps our body produce collagen , the substance our skin needs to remain firm and supple . <p> Where you can get it : Eat citrus fruits , bell peppers , spinach , tomatoes and broccoli to give your body the vitamin C it needs . <p> Vitamin E <p> Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin , which means your body stores it and uses it when needed . It protects your skin from free radicals and helps skin cells repair damage . While it is rare to have a vitamin E deficiency , it is unlikely to consume too much vitamin E as long as you are obtaining it from food sources . <p> Where you can get it : Nuts , healthy oils ( sunflower , corn , safflower ) , dark green vegetables , and avocado are good sources of vitamin E. Vitamin E oil is also known to help reduce the appearance of scars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Vitamin K is key for healthy bones and blood clotting in our body . Its role in our circulatory health is connected to its reputation for reducing the appearance of dark under-eye circles and bruises on the skin . It is used to help the skin heal and reduce swelling . Recently , it is also being recognized for its potential to increase skin elasticity and prevent wrinkles . <p> Where you can get it : Vitamin K can be found in dark , leafy greens and vegetables , brussel sprouts and cabbage . Also consider looking for a cream or serum containing the vitamin . <p> Not all vitamins are created equal <p> Unless our bodies have a deficiency in a particular vitamin , the best way to unlock the benefits of vitamins in our body is to eat them . When deciding if you 'd like to add a supplement or vitamins in pill form to your regimen , its important to consult a doctor as vitamins can interfere with medications and proper doses vary based on the individual .

It 's often all you can do to keep makeup on your face , much less consider how to keep your skin breakout-free and protected . But , not to worry , there are a few summer skin care tips that will help on even the hottest of days . <h> Fight clogged pores with cleansing wipes <p> One of the biggest challenges that comes with hot weather is the increased chance of breakouts . As the temperatures rise , pores open up , inviting sweat , makeup and other pollutants in . This grit and grime can get trapped deep down , causing breakouts . Combat this by keeping cleansing wipes on hand . As the sweat starts to drip , wipe your skin to keep the dirt out of your pores . <p> Bonus tip : Look for wipes that contain salicylic acid as this ingredient is known to help dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Despite the increased heat and humidity , moisturizing remains an important skincare step in the summer because the sun can have powerful drying effects . That 's why it 's important to note if your lotion or moisturizer is too heavy for your skin . If it feels too thick and suffocating , you 'll want to look for lighter formulas that wo n't sit on top of your skin and clog your pores . Between the extra moisture in the air and the moisture from your own sweat , a light lotion will keep your skin dewy while still letting your skin breathe . <p> Bonus tip : Look for lotions that are part serum or gel blends . These varieties are lighter on the skin while still offering plenty of moisture . If the serum contains hyaluronic acid , even better , as this ingredient provides a protective barrier to the skin and is known for its ability to retain moisture . <h> Exfoliating is your friend <p> Exfoliating is a great way to keep your skin clear in the summer weather . Exfoliation sloughs off dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pores , removing dirt and buildup . Exfoliate a maximum of two to three times a week if you plan on spending a lot of time out in the sun , any more and you will risk irritating and damaging your skin . Why ? While very effective in clearing and cleansing the skin , exfoliation also removes a protective layer of your skin , making it more tender and vulnerable to the sun . <p> Bonus tip : Acid exfoliators and serums ( for example , those containing glycolic , salicylic or lactic acids ) are powerful exfoliators that cut through pollutants while smoothing the skin . Apply these at night as your skin repairs itself to receive their maximum benefits . But do be careful with these if you plan on being in the sun a great deal . If you use them more than three nights a week , they can make your skin more sensitive . <h> Try a detoxifying mask <p> A mask in the summer months can be your best ally to keep your pores sweat and pimple free . Masks give your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're probably not getting in your daily moisturizer . Make it a pampering evening and apply a mask before bed . Let it sink in and dry out completely before washing it away . <p> Bonus tip : Try using a charcoal or bentonite clay mask . These ingredients are widely known to draw out impurities by binding to toxins in the skin . <h> Always remember your SPF <p> Last , but certainly not least , is sunscreen . With the extra sun exposure your skin sees in the summer , you need to be especially careful about keeping it protected from the sun 's harmful UV rays . Apply sunscreen every morning , layering it into your daily moisturizer and , if you plan on being out in the sun , do n't forget to slather it all over your body as well , paying extra attention to your shoulders , face and other exposed areas . You 'll also want to reapply every few hours as it wears off . <h> And while we 're on the subject , what 's the deal with SPF ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 indicates the factor of time you can go before burning . For example , if you normally burn in 10 minutes , SPF 15 will protect you for about 150 minutes . If you have a history of skin cancer or very fair skin , use an SPF of 30 . Remember the 30 does n't mean it is twice as strong , but refers to how long its effective . With that said though , studies have shown that SPF 15 protects against approximately 93 percent of UVB rays while SPF 30 protects against 97 and SPF 50 shields against 98 percent . These may seem like small differences but they can be significant if your skin is sensitive . The SPF system is , however , inherently flawed because no matter how high the SPF factor is , no sunscreen is effective for more than two hours .

For these areas , just be sure to use a thin , gel-like serum or a lightweight moisturizer that wo n't clog pores . Use a thicker , creamier moisturizer for dry areas . <p> Last , but not least , SPF : It 's also important to look for a moisturizer containing SPF or apply sunscreen after your moisturizer to protect yourself from the sun 's harmful UV rays , which cause great damage to your skin overall . 15 SPF is the minimum , but 30 SPF is even better .

@@43152491 @3152491/ <h> Corporate Health <p> In recent years it has become more and more obvious to business owners that a healthy workforce is also a productive one . Not only do employees who feel well , work well , but they are less likely to incur additional costs to the company in terms of sick pay or loss of profit . In response to this need to encourage health , corporations are now starting to use internal health programs to monitor and improve the wellness of their staff . 27148 @qwx437148 27145 @qwx437145 27146 @qwx437146 27147 @qwx437147 27153 @qwx437153 27157 @qwx437157 <h> What is Corporate Health ? <p> Any scheme or initiative that is run by a company to improve the health or wellbeing of its staff could be called a Corporate Health scheme . Generally these are structured throughout the year and offered on an ongoing basis to staff members to allow them to monitor and track the changes and improvements that come from the scheme . <p> While the idea has been popular in the US where healthcare is paid for on a private basis , these schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where healthcare is government funded .

While this may sound onerous for companies , it is in fact a win win situation for all involved . <h> What does a corporate health program focus on ? <p> This may depend entirely on the needs of the workforce . For example those working in a heavy lifting environment may benefit from general fitness , core body strength exercise programs or from back health initiatives aimed at improving posture . However most schemes are general overviews . They may look at offering support for those who want to stop smoking , lose weight or take up more exercise . Staff may also be monitored for diabetes , cholesterol and blood pressure and may even have their skin moles checked to monitor for possible skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health that is focused on .

Seeing the benefits will encourage participation which in turn helps both the employee and the employer . <p> Having an overall picture of your health can encourage a more healthy lifestyle . For example knowing that you have a mole on your skin will allow you to take charge of monitoring it and knowing when it is time to have it checked . <p> These programs actually save time and money for staff members . They will need to take less time to visit their doctor for routine issues , they are likely to be healthier and need less time off and they will even feel more inclined to work harder , possibly getting overtime or performance related bonuses . <p> The employee will also feel a greater sense of connection with their workplace and their management .

A cash prize is even better . <p> Ensure the workplace environment is supportive : Teaching staff to look after their diet and then offering little more than junk food in the staff canteen is counter-productive .

The workplace should also offer quiet areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that all the hard work does not go to waste . <p> Make it long term : Upon introduction , health schemes can seem intrusive , but if it becomes a part of the culture of the business it will be ingrained and seen as a benefit along with holiday pay and health insurance . That means that corporate health deserves its own department , budget and administration to ensure it runs successfully . <h> Health screenings - intrusive or necessary ? <p> It is entirely up to the company involved to choose the types of health programs they might want to offer , but some can ( and should ) involve health marker checks such as blood pressure and type 2 diabetes screenings . For some employees this may feel intrusive and they may prefer not to participate . <p> There are a number of ways a company can get around this .

@@43152497 @3152497/ <h> Skin care when you turn 30 <p> Published 4 months ago , by Roeland Pater <p> In our teens and twenties , it 's much easier to take a laissez-faire approach to our skin . We may stubbornly leave our makeup on overnight or wash our face only when we remember or feel like it , but by the time 30 rolls around , the effects of time and poor care tend to become visible . This is the time wrinkles start showing up and those dark circles wo n't seem to go away no matter how long we sleep . Why ? Well , around age 30 our hormone levels begin to wane , especially in women . <p> This can lead to a decrease in collagen production and less cell turnover , which makes for duller , less springy and more wrinkled skin . But not to worry , there are some practices that can help and they do n't have to be high-maintenance either . Below are a few skin care tips for 30 somethings and everyone in-between . <h> Adopt a skin care routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have ignored this one before , but 30 is the time to seriously start embracing a basic skin care regimen . The fundamentals " cleanse , tone , moisturize " are n't too complicated to manage either . Get in the habit of following the steps below every morning and night and in no time it will become second nature , with your skin reaping the benefits . <h> Step 1 : Cleanse <p> Cleansing the skin removes sweat , oil , dirt and other pollutants that your skin naturally collects throughout the day and night . Cleanse your skin in the morning and in the evening to keep your pores clear and your face fresh . Your cleanser may vary based on skin type , but with all cleansers , apply them using an upward , circular motion so as to prevent wrinkles from forming . Make sure your hands are clean as well so as to prevent any extra pollutants from entering your pores . <p> Keep in mind : <p> It 's best to steer clear of harsh bar soaps when cleansing your face as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overproduce sebum , the natural oils your skin produces for protection which also contribute to clogged pores and breakouts . <h> Step 2 : Tone <p> After you cleanse your skin of impurities , toner removes any residue left behind by the cleanser as well as any makeup or oils your cleanser might have missed . The added cleansing effects help prepare your skin to absorb moisturizer and minimize the appearance of pores . Some toners may have PH balancing and antiseptic benefits as well . Apply toner right after you have cleansed your skin while it is still damp . The best way to apply it is with a cotton pad or cotton ball , simply soaking the pads in the toner and wiping upwards , starting at your neck . <p> Keep in mind : <p> Stay away from harsh alcohol or citrus-based toners as they can damage and irritate your skin . <h> Step 3 : Moisturize <p> Moisturizing adds a protective layer to the skin that locks in moisture and keeps it hydrated . This hydration is what gives your skin a smooth , luminous appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be a cream , lotion , gel or oil " and gently rub it into your skin in an upward motion , being careful not to tug on the delicate skin around your eyes . Once the moisturizer is applied , give it time to sink in before applying makeup , so you receive its full benefits . <p> Keep in mind : <p> Find a moisturizer that works for your skin type . People with oily skin should opt for lighter moisturizers while people with drier skin should use heavier and richer creams . <h> Start Exfoliating <p> As we age and our skin becomes less resilient , exfoliation can be an important tool for rejuvenating skin cells by sloughing off dead skin that has accumulated in pores . It 's best to exfoliate after toning and before moisturizing , and most dermatologists agree that you should exfoliate one to three times a week , but this depends on your skin type and how it reacts to exfoliation . Experiment and find what works best for you . There are chemical exfoliators and granule exfoliators such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective tools for removing dead skin cells , but chemical exfoliating ingredients like AHA and BHA are often more effective in getting deep into your pores and removing buildup . <p> Keep in mind : <p> If you struggle with blackhead and acne or sun damage , opt for chemical exfoliators that contain AHA and BHA over your traditional granule scrub . For acne and blackhead plagued skin , look for an exfoliator containing BHA as it penetrates deeply into your pores . If you struggle with sun damage , AHA is your preferred option as it mainly exfoliates the upper layers of skin . <h> Wear that SPF , really <p> If you ignored all the SPF warnings in your twenties , now is the time to truly heed the importance of sun protection . Dr. Elizabeth Hale , vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation and a Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at the NYU Langone Medical Center , cites that approximately ninety percent of the signs of premature aging come from UV exposure . UV exposure is also the leading cause of skin cancer . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunscreen after your moisturizer is key for protecting your skin from the sun 's damaging UV rays and maintaining a youthful and healthy visage . Even if it 's gray or raining outside , this rule still applies as UV rays can still reach and harm your skin . Wear a SPF of at least 15 during the daytime , using a higher SPF if you anticipate heavy sun exposure throughout the day . Do n't neglect other areas of your body either . Be sure to cover any exposed areas and re-apply every few hours as it wears off . <h> Add retinol to your regimen <p> While there 's a whole host of anti-aging products and wonder ingredients out there , one particularly effective ingredient that most dermatologists and skin experts can agree on is retinol . Retinol is a derivative of Vitamin A that has been shown to slow down signs of aging by increasing cell turnover and slowing the breakdown of collagen , among other things . <p> Most dermatologists agree it 's never too early to start using retinol , but you should take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be irritating and increase skin sensitivity . It 's also important to note that there is a difference between retinol and retinoids .

Natural oils are another moisturizing option , and they can be just as effective for moisturizing as they are for cleansing .

There are some general guidelines and small tips we can implement to take care of our skin everyday . <h> First things first : cleanse , tone , moisturize , SPF <p> It may seem like a no-brainer but keeping your face clear and hydrated is the first tenant of clear skin . Cleansing removes sweat , makeup , oil , dirt and other pollutants that your skin naturally collects throughout the day and night . Toning balances your skin and prepares it to absorb the moisturizer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , making it soft and supple . The final step , sunscreen , is vital for protecting our skin from the harsh sun and skin cancer . <p> Follow this basic order of operations below every morning and evening to keep your face healthy . <p> Cleanse : Use a cleanser to wash your face and remove dirt and pollutants from your pores . <p> Tone : Apply a toner after cleansing to remove any residual dirt missed by your cleanser and to prepare your skin for moisturizer . <p> Moisturize : Moisture is key for glowing skin . While cleansing keeps your skin clear , it also removes your skin 's natural oils that keep it hydrated . Moisturizer restores this hydration to the skin and keeps it feeling supple . <p> SPF : SPF helps protect the skin from the sun 's damaging UV rays . Use a moisturizer during the day that contains SPF or a apply sunscreen after . Reapply throughout the day to ensure proper coverage . ( you can skip this step in the evening ) <h> Turn to home remedies <p> Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often times , there are remedies for our skin issues right in our own pantry . When your skin feels in need of some extra pampering , check out these recipes for natural skin treatments . <p> And one great all-around at-home treatment is a lemon , egg-white mask . This cleanses your pores , brightens your skin and helps exfoliate all at the same time . <p> All you need is : <p> 1 egg white and the juice from -+ a lemon . <p> Directions : <p> Beat the egg white until frothy . Then , mix in the lemon juice . Apply it to your face and leave on for approximately thirty minutes . Rinse off with warm water and apply a moisturizer immediately after . <p> Fight pimples with ice cubes <p> When the sudden breakout strikes , our first urge is to squeeze , pick or pop our pimples . But this strategy , while satisfying , is ultimately damaging to our skin , causing more inflammation and pushing more dirt down into our pores . When we have a pimple , what we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best way to fight inflammation is with ice . Wrap an ice cube in a soft tissue or cloth and apply to the pimple for at least one minute . This will constrict the blood vessels under the skin and reduce the size and appearance of the pimple . <h> Take a look at your diet <p> Yes , we know , this can be a difficult one to manage . But our home kitchen is our ultimate tool for clear skin because how we nourish our body has a large effect on our skin health . Certain foods and substances can be especially damaging to our skin , while others can keep it youthful and glowing . <p> Here 's a quick guide for what to avoid and what to get more of : <p> Limit your sugars : The problem lies in inflammation . Sugar rapidly breaks down into glucose in our bodies causing insulin levels to spike and plummet , a process that causes something called glycation to occur . During glycation , sugar bonds with proteins in our body and produces AGE molecules . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastin and collagen , responsible for keeping skin firm and elastic . When these proteins are damaged , skin becomes brittle and dry , two factors which promote the appearance of aging . <p> The good news is not all sugar is created equal . Sugars in fruits , while still encouraging production of AGEs , do n't cause blood sugar to spike as dramatically as foods with a high glycemic index such as processed foods , cake and high fructose corn syrup . Vitamins , fiber and antioxidants present in fruit balance the sugars while also providing beneficial properties for your skin . <h> Say no to dairy : <p> There have been many studies done that show the correlation between dairy consumption and acne . According to Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology , 47,355 women , ' found a positive association with acne for intake of total milk and skim milk . ' The issue appears to be the hormones present in milk that trigger oil production in our skin . While it can be difficult to skip the morning latte , many people who cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rainbow : Fruits and vegetables contain vital antioxidants that help fight free radical damage . Trade foods that are high on the glycemic index and spike insulin levels , like white bread , honey , potatoes and corn , for non-starchy fruits and vegetables that keep the body in balance . <p> Drink plenty of H2O : Drinking plenty of water keeps our skin cells hydrated , which reduces the appearances of fine lines and wrinkles and keeps our skin supple . While water helps hydrate our body all-around , that does n't mean you still do n't need moisturizer . Moisturizer gives our skin the direct hydration we need . Doing both is the trick . <p> Do n't forget your vitamins &amp; minerals : Certain vitamins and minerals contain antioxidants that can have powerful effects on our skin by limiting the damage caused by free radicals . Look for foods that contain selenium , Vitamin A , Vitamin C and Vitamin E to boost your skin health . Healthy fats , such as omega-3s and omega-6s , found in fish , nuts and olive oil , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid in our cell membrane 's ability to hold water . <h> Indulge in the occasional mask <p> Face masks give your face an added boost when you need it most , especially when your skin is breaking out or extra dry . It 's also a treatment you can do at home , with ingredients from your local grocer . <p> Try a face mask with turmeric in it . This powerful root has been used for centuries for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties . <p> MindBodyGreen offers an easy recipe you can try to explore this ingredient 's benefits : <p> Ingredients <p> 2 tablespoons chickpea flour <p> 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder <p> 2 teaspoons raw honey <p> yogurt , coconut milk or water ( just enough to form a paste ) <h> Clear skin at home : Preparation <p> Gently wash face with warm water to open up pores . Pat dry . Mix the ingredients thoroughly in a small bowl . Using clean fingertips , place a thin layer of the mask on your face . Be careful to avoid your eyes , eyebrows and mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it dries completely . Use a washcloth to remove the mask , then apply a light moisturizer to lock in all the goodness .
