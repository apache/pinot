The GALVASHIELD coating process achieves a harder and longer-lasting surface . First , a zinc coating that protects the steel tube frame is applied inside and out .

@@30893497 @4593497/ <h> Tracker Boats : Easy to Buy <p> A simple , 30-year-old marketing plan is still working well today on the Internet <p> If you 're looking for a great boat-shopping experience , try poking around on the Tracker Boats website . I was there last week doing some research . I do n't  think there 's another boatbuilder site that let 's a potential customer gather information so easily and make comparisons within the brand . The site then produces a guaranteed price that can include any options you to want to add to the boat , as well as precise shipping and dealer prep figures . <p> Like the looks of this Tracker Pro Guide V 175 ? You can spec your own , and get a no-haggle price , on the Tracker website . <p> Other builders often offer a fixed or advertised price on boats that are part of a special promotion , but Tracker is one of the few that offers " no haggle " pricing on every boat and option in its line . Other boat-brand websites let you " build this boat " and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then leave the actual sales price up to the dealer . And that MSRP price too often has no basis in reality . There are still boat manufacturers that publish a list price that includes a 40-percent mark-up over dealer cost , because the dealers want plenty of wiggle room for haggling and trade-in . I know this because when I write about a new boat , I 'm often asked not to publish the unrealistic MSRP . Instead I 'm given a " street price " that 's much lower . <p> At Tracker you can cut through the bull . The price on the site is the price you 'll pay at the store . Its been that way since 1978 , when Bass Pro Shops founder John Morris offered three Bass Tracker boats , 16- to 17-foot-long aluminum mod-V fishing rigs . Striving to take the hassle out of buying a boat , Morris turned the boat into a commodity , like a television or a washing machine . He offered each model as a boat-motor-trailer package , rather than selling the three components separately , as was the custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fixed price come to the store , and this is what you 'll pay . Your buddy can show up in two weeks and pay the same price . And by the way , the price was lower than the competition . People drove hundreds of miles to Springfield , Mo. , to pick up a new boat at the original Bass Pro Shop . <p> You do n't  need to go to Springfield today . Tracker boats ( and the affiliated Nitro , Sun Tracker , Tahoe , and Mako brands ) are sold through 54 Bass Pro Shops , 20 Tracker Boat Center stores , and more than 200 independent marine dealers that sell Tracker boats . And you do n't  even need to go a Bass Pro Shop or dealer . You can spec out a Tracker right on the website , and then go to the " Buy Now " area and a sales consultant will get on the phone with you , search area stores for your boat , or make arrangements for your boat to be built and then shipped to a Tracker dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dealer or store , you can still do business with Tracker , even in the middle of the night . <p> " Weve had people order a $60,000 boat sight-unseen off the website , " says Tracker director of marketing Maurice Bowen . " That reflects a high degree of confidence in our brand . Our sales organization is set up to help the customer buy the best boat . Its an attitude that 's been ingrained in the company culture for a generation now . " <p> Its a business model that 's made Tracker Boats number one in sales in aluminum fishing boats and in pontoons . Tracker may not be the only boatbuilder to make good boats or offer good deals , but its simple , no-nonsense approach to website sales is unique these days in offering the path of least resistance to boat ownership . It should always be this easy . 157195 @qwx357195

There 's just something irresistible about the thrill of bouncing over waves behind a boat , that kids and the whole family love . Plus , its one of the most versatile activities for people of all shapes , sizes , and skill levels . <p> When gearing up for a day on the water , its important to be prepared before you head out . Be sure to read the warning labels , follow the manufacturers recommendations , and properly check your gear so that you can stay safe and have fun . <p> Here are some tips to keep in mind the next time you take your family out tubing : <p> 2 . ) Choose The Right Tube : Not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others provide a more leisurely ride . Some are designed for one person and others can fit three or four . To narrow down your options , consider how many people you want to tow and how wild they want their ride . Kids of all ages enjoy tubing , so look carefully at weight restrictions and your boats horsepower before picking out a tube . A good place to start is with the selection of tubes at Bass Pro Shop LONG ... or stop by your nearest Tracker Boating Center to check out their selection of tubes . <p> 3 . ) Invest in a Proper Tow Rope : One of the main causes of tubing accidents is due to tow rope failure . This is easily avoidable if you invest in a proper rope and you make sure that its attached according to the manufacturers guidelines . The rope you use will depend largely on how many people the tube will carry . When buying your rope , check the tube manufacturers recommendations for specific tow rope requirements . Also , make sure to check for signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope as needed . <p> 4 . ) Know Your Boat : Whether its a pontoon or a fishing boat , the horsepower of your engine will determine your tube-towing capacity . For example , the approximate top speed of a 20-foot pontoon with a 50hp FourStroke engine is 15-18 mph . This speed might be best for younger children , or those who do n't  enjoy the higher speeds . With that in mind , you can more easily narrow down your tube and tow rope options . <p> 5 . ) Check For Proper Inflation : One of the quickest ways to damage your towable is under inflating it , which not only affects the performance of your tube , but also the longevity . Similarly , overinflating can cause damage to the PVC bladder and it might also rip seams in the cover . Make sure to follow the manufacturers recommendations for proper inflation . <p> 6 . ) Have A Spotter : There should always be a designated spotter onboard to alert the driver if the rider falls off . The spotter should keep track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water , as well as nearby boats . <p> 7 . ) Practice Hand Signals : Before taking off , make sure you and your crew have agreed upon a set of hand signals , just like water skiers use . For example , a thumbs down could mean that you 're going too fast and a thumbs up could mean they want to go faster . Using a set of hand signals will make it easier to communicate and check in with your rider . <p> 8 . ) Avoid prime time : Peak traffic hours on the water are generally between noon and 4 p.m. , when the temperature is at its hottest . Consider going out in the morning or in the evening to avoid the crowds . <p> 9 . ) Just Relax : Finally , remember that a tube can be a whole lot of fun when parked in a bay and tied to your boat or pontoon . Kids can jump off and swim around it , or just hang out and relax . 157195 @qwx357195

@@30893521 @4593521/ <p> Very few boats impressed us the way this SUN TRACKER did . The appearance of the interior alone was enough to catch our attention , but the amenities were equally as nice . This boat was dubbed the " contour beauty " at our test for its soft and round sculptured seats and inviting layout . <p> Consumer Test <p> We cant begin to give enough praise for the overstuffed-looking seats that could easily double as couches in your own living room . This is what a high-end luxury boat is supposed to feel like . The furniture comfort is as good as it looks and we really liked the three chaise lounges . Below each chaise is a lockable door for the storage compartment . However , you can also gain access from lifting the cushion up top , which defeats the purpose of a locking door . Plus the dual captains chair opposite of the helm blocks the access to the lockable door on the rear lounge , but the tradeoff is probably worth it . The first-mate chair is just as comfortable as the helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below the thick padded , threequarter sundeck is a large changing room . To gain access , just pull on the two side straps and once the enclosure is open you 'll find the battery box that doubles as a bench seat . <p> The rear entry gate is one of three openings on board and each gate has a positive latch for safety . What we really like is the carpeted stern swim deck , which is something we have n't seen on a lot of pontoon boats . The four-step rear boarding ladder is one of two ladders on this model including the bow-mounted one . <p> At the raised helm is a very luxurious console that includes a multifunction gauge , 12-volt with its own compartment , Sony CD stereo and a Lowrance depth finder . The burlwood on the console ties in well with the rest of the boat , but there might be too much burlwood trim used in the overall design throughout the boat . Other notable features include plenty of drink holders , including some stylish looking ones near the floor as well as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entertainment center with a sink and faucet as well as sliding drawers below . Everywhere we looked we found amenities that we liked . <p> Inspection Test <p> Two 26-inch pressurized pontoons are the base of this 25-footer and there are lifting strakes on the inside and outside of each log , which are Sun Trackers new NV performance strakes .

@@30893549 @4593549/ <p> Ifthere 's one thing you want to avoid when shopping for a boat of any shape or size , it 's the hidden cost of options and upgrades . Thankfully there are at least a few brands out there that take this issue off the table by simply including such features as standard . Definitely among those brands is the Regency Edition of SUN TRACKER 's PARTY BARGE line . That much is true in 2005 more than ever before . Inour sampling of the 22-foot Regency , we were quite impressed with how the boat utilized every square inch of its 8 +-foot wide layout to offer a boatload of convenience and comfort.Highlystyled furnishings define this boat , and are indicative of its overall versatility and sound design . The unique furniture bases are made of single-wall rotocast material that is screwed to the deck . Single stitched , marine quality expanded vinyl is utilized on all of the furnishings . Sohow does this translate to onboard comfort ? We aimed to find out . Interms of aesthetics , the forward-chaise lounge seating seemed particularly inviting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear . The same caliber of comfort can be had at the helm thanks to a handy flip-up bolster ( which , in our humble opinion , just about every cruising toon should have ) plus slide and swivel adjustments for a perfect fit.Likeits 25-foot sibling that we tested at last fall 's PDB Shootout , this 22-foot version boasts nice curves , smooth angles and a great color scheme . It 's an aesthetic eye-popper no matter how you look at it . More importantly , it 's as user-friendly as a boat can be.Forstarters , a roomy pop-up changer is perfectly placed on the boat for access , and includes a bench for added convenience . It also sports an aft entry with an oversized boarding ladder with handholds for easy swimmer access . SUN TRACKER has designed a new latch that holds the ladder in a vertical position and self engages when in the proper storage position . The ladder 's steps are plenty wide compared to many boarding ladders we 've come across , and it has non-slip strips at the top . Nearbyis the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person to spread out and soak up the sun . On a related note , this comfy surface area has a pronounced , bolstered edge around the back . As we 've stated countless times , this added detail is more than just cosmetic . It provides an added feel of security when using the sun deck and makes a great head rest as well.Thetwo 26-inch round pontoons on this boat are fine examples of some of the largest logs on the market . Each is multi-chambered . In our own inspections , the weld quality on the tubes ( and the rails too , for that matter ) appeared to be excellent with no sharp edges or inconsistencies . The overall design is clean with excellent wiring and easy access.Alsoworthy of note on the standard model is the extended aluminum transom and its extruded box beam design-lighter , stronger and more durable than most toon transoms on the market . The deck rails and trim are all anodized to deliver a superior looking and long-lasting finish . The expanded list of quality features on this boat includes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that extra measure of safety and a custom molded console with plenty of dry storage , full instrumentation and stereo CD with four directional speakers . Onthe I/O version that we sampled , the boat performed like it should : good acceleration out the hole , stable and responsive on the go . Turns were flat , steady and always predictable . The benefits of 26-inch tubes were just as evident at cruising speed as when the boat was at rest . Stability is only part of it . The boat also tracked well , and felt solid at all speeds . Steering this boat was easy , and like the 25-footer , it is quite a pleasure to maneuver in tight quarters . TheRegency 22 comes standard with a 50 ELPTO Mercury Outboard . Combine that with its 30-gallon fuel tank , and you wo n't need to be hunting down the nearest gas dock anytime soon . ( Note : maximum outboard power rating on this boat is 125 HP . ) Theend result is a versatile recreational machine that offers all you would want or need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , performance and beyond . The kicker , which will come as no surprise to long-time TRACKER fans , is the great price at which you can obtain one of these fine boats . The standard package retails for $16,295 , and you can opt for the I/O standard version for $19,895 with a MerCruiser 3.0L 136hp sterndrive.Formore information about the PARTY BARGE 22 Regency Edition , log onto www.suntrackerboats.com , call TRACKER Marine directly at 888 487 2253 to request a free brochure , or see your local TRACKER dealer.Regency ' 05 UpgradesInaddition to its new model introductions , TRACKER Marine also has a slew of product changes for this year 's SUN TRACKER fleet , a number of them pertaining to the Regency Series .

Webb has been teaching children about fishing for over 30 years through his guide service and a program called K. A. S. T. ( Kids Are Special Too ) , sponsored by Tracker Marine Group , which was founded in 1996 to educate kids about the hazards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reel : Depending on the child , a good starting rod and reel is a simple push-button spincast model . The push-button models are easy for a child to handle and they will save you time untangling knots . Alternatively , spinning reels have a little better functionality , but they take a bit more practice to figure out . <p> Once you find a reel , you must find a rod that matches the reel type . The length of the rod is the most important consideration . The length should be the same height as the child or a foot taller . So , a 4-foot-tall child should have a rod that is up to 5-feet-long . <p> 2 . Keep It Simple : When introducing a kid to fishing , keep it simple : a hook , a sinker and a bobber is really all you need . Use Leaf worms ( the small worms -- not the big Nightcrawlers ) . As the adult , plan on handling all the bait and taking out hooks . Let the child try touching the worms if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids focused on casting , catching and having fun . <p> 3 . Practice Makes Perfect : Casting can be hard to master , so help your child practice on land before you hit the water . Take them out to the driveway or a park so that they can work on their accuracy . To ensure safety , make sure they 're casting straight over their heads . <p> You can also demonstrate to them how to properly tie a knot and bait the hook . Its easier to do these lessons before you get to the water when the child has better focus and more time to get it down . <p> 4 . Stay Safe : As with any activity near the water , when fishing , its important to come prepared with basic first aid supplies as well as safety equipment such as a properly-fitting life jacket . Always make sure your child has eye protection like sunglasses or prescription glasses and be sure to bring sunscreen and insect repellent . <p> Another trick is to pinch your hook barbs so that they are flat . Kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a lot easier . <p> 5 . Find the Shade : Shaded areas like docks , piers , rocks and any shoreline vegetation are a favorite hiding ground for panfish ( bluegills , sunfish , crappies , perch ) and a variety of other fish that are easy to catch . Stay around these areas and there 's a better chance you 'll get a bite or two . Plus , the shady areas are a nice way to get relief from the sun on a hot day . <p> 6 . Keep It Short : When planning your trip , keep in mind that children tend to lose interest rather quickly . Its best to plan a fishing trip that lasts around an hour or so . If the fish are n't  biting and interest is fading , you might make up a casting or accuracy contest to keep kids engaged . And do n't  get frustrated if your kids say theyd like to run around and play on the nearby playground . Introducing kids to fishing little by little is how you 'll raise a kid to love fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drinks : Be sure to have easy access to snacks and drinks . Bring healthy and portable snacks , and maybe an extra special treat . Its important to keep kids hydrated in addition to fed , so bring along water bottles or flavored water . Food and drinks will make it much more fun for everyone . <p> 8 . Make It A Learning Experience : Fishing with a child is a great time to instill lessons that will stay with them for a lifetime . Teach them the important things about fishing like when to catch and release or what to do when a fish gets hook gutted . You can also talk about the trees , plants and other aspects of the outdoors . <p> 9 . Do n't  forget the camera : Kids want to show off their big catches to mom , dad , grandparents and their friends . So make sure to bring a camera and take lots of photos . Remember , even a very little sunfish or bluegill can be a monster in the eyes of a little child . <p> 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fun . Teaching a child to fish is important , but it should n't be the only goal . If you make the trip an adventure and a memorable experience there 's a better chance they will want to do it again whether they hook a fish or not . 157195 @qwx357195

If you take that little extra time after every use to keep your boat clean , your efforts will pay off when it comes time to trade it in for a new boat . 157195 @qwx357195

This newest member of the brands Signature Series is designed to be tough and versatile . When fishing is on the menu , two bow-mounted fishing chairs , featuring pinchless hinges , are comfortable perches from which to cast a line or two . But when a party is in the forecast , the chairs can be removed for extra space . <p> The boat features a doublewide helm seat , L-shaped aft couch to port and bountiful bench seating in the bow . There is no shortage of stowage under the well-padded seats . And with the standard entertainment center , you can let the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a Bimini top provides relief from the sun . Featuring a rear entry gate , the Party Barge 20 is surrounded with anodized rails to enhance the safety factor and an aft flip-down boarding ladder makes for easy access from the water . With so much going for it , the Party Barge 20 gives new meaning to the term " progressive party . " <p> We tested this boat on Missouris TableRockLake and found her to be a comfortable platform with lots to appreciate , from her burlwood helm to her extended engine pod . The 24-inch-diameter , multichambered logs with wave deflectors are designed to provide balanced flotation , and our boat handled well in light chop , though steering seemed a bit sticky . Powered by a Mercury 50 four-stroke and carrying a crew of two , our test rig turned in a top end of 18.4 mph at 5650 rpm not hair-raising speed , but just fine for those who feel that half of the fun of boating is just getting there . 157195 @qwx357195
