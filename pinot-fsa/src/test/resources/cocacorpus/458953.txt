With the sadness of terrorist attacks in both Manchester and London together with the strong opinions from various channels about the general election , amongst many things . <p> On top of all that , it seems that some of the tabloids have enjoyed tearing down some of the parenting bloggers for what they choose to share online .

One of these was the word Potential and I loved her take on this together with the one from Cara L McKee . The other word was Sea which , I believe , can be used to express so many things as I did in my poem The Sea of Life .

In the end I had to save it without the music , edit then put the music back over the top and it took ages and ages and well was a real pain in the butt .

It won awards , was published in editions for children and adults and was found to be one of the top 5 happy endings in novels , along with Pride and Prejudice and To Kill a Mockingbird . <p> It was turned into a succesful stage play in 2012 , transferred to the West End in 2013 ( winning 7 Olivier Awards including Best New Play ) and is currently pleasing audiences in New York , London and around the UK . BritMums was invited to attend at the Gielgud Theatre on Shaftsbury Avenue , London . We took along an enthusiastic 11-year-old to experience the production and test its family-friendliness . Read on for our Mum v. Child review . <p> Sion Daniel Young as Christopher in the play <h> The Mums View , from BritMums co-founder Jennifer : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is instantly engaging . It opens with 15-year-old Christopher discovering the neighbours dog Wellington dead , speared by a garden fork . Christopher has Autism spectrum disorder although its never discussed that specifically in the play and the story unfolds as Christopher tries to discover who killed Wellington .

Eds note : Christophers journal about what happens to him serves as a structure for the play . This confusing but interesting play definitely changed the way I thought about things . <p> The lighting played a big part in the play as the setting was meant to be the image of Christophers brain .

There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always something to see onstage with the actors .

Do n't  use the same ones over and over and do n't  use too many . <p> Report it to Instagram . If you think you have wrongly been shadowbanned , alert Instagram . If you have been banned its because of an algorithm and sometimes they get it wrong . While companies like Instagram are notoriously anti-customer service , its good to go right to the source <h> What does Instagram say ? <p> What they usually say . They want people to focus on stories , to build their brand organically , be well-crafted . This can be a lot harder work and sometimes that hard work does n't  seem to pay off . We know lots of bloggers whose Instagram followings have plateaued , and they 've been tempted by some of the " cowboy " practices . In a word : Do n't  .

After 19 months of breastfeeding , Jennis desire for her daughter to self wean has been dented by medical reasons . She is not looking forward to Boos imminent last feed , which will probably be Jennis last breastfeed forever .

Early weaning to solids , bottles , and Formula characterised the march to the end for Sarah and her daughter on their breastfeeding journey .

It was a feed that provided needed comfort from the resulting hysteria of a premature wake from sweet sleep .

She shares her slightly raw , internal monologue where she questions if she was making the right choice in returning to work . I know so many working mums will relate to this . I certainly do . <p> Honestly , some days it can feel like just one long , rat race and often looking around it feels like I am the only mother who has to work .

We all know that we need to be organised to avoid the Monday morning meltdown but how many of us actually follow through with those well-laid plans ? This post from Confessions of a Working Mum provided a bit of light relief and made me hoot with laughter because I find myself in this predicament a lot . <p> So what does a day as working mum actually look like ?

Wont they get restless while you go on and on about wine ? What if they start pulling each others hair and in their best annoying voice start asking if its time to GO HOME ? <p> Admittedly many opt to leave the kids at home when visiting wine country , but if you are travelling from abroad you probably do n't  have that option . <p> While I want family holidays to be something we can all enjoy , for years our vacations have centred around the kids and what THEY want to do . This year I felt the kids were old enough ( 10 , 11 and 13 ) to let mum and dad do something we enjoyed . <p> And what better place to try out this new theory than Napa Valley ? In 1976 Napa helped to catapult California wine to the world stage with the Tasting of Paris where a Chateau Montelena Chardonnay and Stag 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test . One French judge was so horrified she tried to change her score when she found out the California wines had won . This was all good news for Napa and indeed all California wines . In the nearly 40 years since , Napa wine and related industries have grown to add $50 million to the US economy each year . <p> Tasting some amazing cabs at Stags Leap Wine Cellars , one of the Napa wineries that helped catapult California onto the world wine scene by beating French classics in the 1976 blind Paris Tasting . A fabulous story to go with an equally fab winery . Oh , and the kids are here too ! <h> Family friendly Napa : 7 things to do <h> 1 . Go Wine Tasting ! ( Yes , really ) <p> You CAN go wine tasting with the family and the kids may even like it ! The key is picking wineries that have a welcoming attitude towards families . I found several ( you can see my full list of family friendly Napa wineries here ) . Some even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dad try the wine . But do n't  try to do more than 2 wineries in one day , or the kids WILL kill you . <p> If you have n't been wine tasting lately , you 'll be blown away by the experience options available . Its not just the old-fashioned roll up to the counter and try a few vintages before you buy . Now you can have everything from a " seated " tasting in a picturesque setting to a tour ( wine in hand ) to a cask tasting . Many wineries also pair food with their favourite wines . Its all pretty amazing . Expect to pay between $15 to $40 , depending on the experience . Some can be more . <p> My children usually behave well if they know something fun is in store ( such as swimming at the hotel , a train ride , or a cycle or kayak trip ) . You could go one step further and make official bribes ( Napa has a Michaels craft store which my girls love ) . And if all else fails most wineries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sip away . <p> The girls did a blind DRY soda tasting at Frogs Leap Winery . They were given a flight of four samples and asked to identify the flavours . They learned a lot and it really included them in the experience ! @frogsleapwinery gets my vote for one of the best family friendly wineries in Napa ! <p> Who does n't  love dinner on a train ? ! ! Were on the table directly opposite enjoying a Jamieson Ranch cab while the girls keep busy with the view and a game of Cluedo . <h> 2 . Ride the Napa Valley Wine Train <p> What could be more intriguing for a child than having dinner on a train ! The Napa Valley Wine Train , which goes from the city of Napa to St Helena , gives up-close views of the Valleys vineyards while waiters serve a multiple-course gourmet meal on a restored vintage rail car . We took the Gourmet Express early evening train , which conveniently serves dinner very soon after you board the train ( a good option for families ) . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from including a lunchtime Western BBQ themed open-air train ride , and a couple of options that include stops at wineries . I thought dinner would be a nice experience and I was right ! The girls sat together across from us and played Clue ( the American version of Cluedo ) while they drank their virgin Pina Coladas . Mum and dad enjoyed the meal , wine and the views . It was fabulous . <h> 3 . Enjoy a Wine Country Picnic ! <p> No visit to Napa Valley is complete without a wine country picnic . There are several places to buy high quality deli items , including Via Satuii , Farmstead , and Dean &amp; DeLuca . Many wineries also allow picnic on their grounds ( some save this privilege for wine club members so make sure you check beforehand ) . We stopped at Via Satuii which has a variety of choices and lots of picnic benches outside . It fit in very well with our plans because HALL Wines , a must-visit for its out-of-this-world Cabs , is right across the road ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Napas Oxbow market <h> 4 . Visit Farmers Markets &amp; Specialty Shops <p> Farmers markets are a fun way to experience local culture , art and produce . There are several to choose from , but do n't  miss the Oxbrow Public Market , in Napa . It has some pretty cool specialty shops and places to eat , including the Model Bakery ( buy the cookbook , its my new favourite go to for American cookies ) , Karas Cupcakes ( the girls loved these ) and Gotts Roadside ( burgers , taco and shakes ! ) . <p> The girls and I learned how to make spicy Thai coconut soup at @CIAGreystone yesterday as part of their Enthusiasts programme . They have cooking demos each weekend kids under 12 go free with a paying adult . The girls loved it , they thought they were on MasterChef ! <h> 5 . Cultivate little foodies at the Culinary Institute of America <p> The Culinary Institute of America trains the countrys most talented chefs and the campus in St Helena occupies the gorgeous Greystone Cellars building , once owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree in culinary arts there , but even better is that they offer a food enthusiasts programme , which includes weekend demonstrations . All ages welcome and two children under 12 can accompany a paying adult for no extra charge . We learned how to make Spicy Thai Chicken and Coconut Soup , which comes with a glass of Chardonnay . Needless-to-say the children are not provided with a taste of the wine , but instead get a glass of sparkling apple juice . You can also tour the facilities , eat in the cafe or visit the shop which has a childrens section . If you have any little Master Chef fans this is a fun option . <h> 6 . Shop at the Outlets ! <p> International travellers will especially want to pick up some bargains at the Napa Premium Outlets . Kids , teens and parents will like Adidas , Gap , CAbi Factory Store , Ralph Lauren , Tommy Hilfiger , J Crew , Banana Republic , Brooks Brothers , Gymboree , Skechers , Coach and more . Bring an extra suitcase with you and stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napa from a hot air balloon ! <h> 7 . Take a Balloon Ride ! <p> For a holiday to remember , start with an early morning hot air balloon ride with Napa Valley Aloft Balloon Rides . A hot air balloon ride is the ultimate way to admire wine country . Kids as young as 8 can participate . Its a bit pricey , but an adventure for the entire family . <p> Hanging out at the family pool at Vino Bello Resort , which is adjacent to The Meritage <h> Where we stayed : The Meritage Resort and Spa <p> One of the keys to a successful trip to Napa involving children is to find a family friendly place to stay . You might want to avoid romantic / couples focused hotels . A resort with lots of amenities will give kids something to look forward to after a visit to a winery . For us , The Meritage Resort and Spa ticked all those boxes with a family swimming pool/water play area , bocce ball and a 6-lane bowling alley ! <p> Susanna Scott founded the BritMums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted to create a space for parent bloggers to network , and share ideas and opportunities .

The latest movie in the Harry Potter franchise is set in the city in the mid 1920s . <p> To get a proper feel for the city from that era , you could stay at the Warwick New York on West 54th Street or the InterContinental Barclay hotel in East 48th Street , both of which opened in 1926 , the year the move is set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Whitby , the latest boutique property from Kit Kemp 's Firmdale , the group behind the Charlotte Street and Covent Garden Hotels , on 53rd street . <p> No matter that the movie 's New York scenes was largely filmed in Liverpool " the Big Apple is still packed with the 1920s vibe the movie channels . <p> Aarhus , on the east coast of Jutland , is Denmark 's second largest city <p> The city is home to the ARoS Aarhus Art Museum .

You see Italy has all the ticks for the important family holiday . Sunshine , good food and wine , gorgeous scenery and history , art and culture in abundance . <p> Italy has something to offer everyone and because of that it makes the perfect family holiday destination . In fact the Italians are well aware of this and the majority will spend their family holidays in Italia ; they are the champions of staycations and why wouldnt they be ? They can choose from the classic beach holiday , a holiday on the lakes , walks in the mountains , city breaks or the countryside . <p> I can promise you that wherever you go you will find good food and wine , amazing beauty in the architecture and art and a welcoming host as Italy is number one for being child friendly . <p> So let 's take a look at my top 10 family holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amalfi coast Campania <p> Image credit COM.TUR <p> I saw the Amalfi coast from a minibus as we travelled the entire length of the country to holiday in Sicily , we stopped off along the coastline and I could have stayed there not moving another inch .

All punctuated by lemon groves , fig trees and olive groves . <p> The Amalfi coast is home to Sorrento , Positano , Amalfi and Ravello .

Each hotel has beach huts for their clients to change , I love these beach huts , all painted differently and some with play areas for the children , beach bars and even restaurants .

You can also find coastal paths at the top to walk from one village to the next including the Via dellAmore a 1K path that runs from Riomaggiore to Manarola . <p> Liguria is the home of pesto , focaccia and delicious white wines . <h> Puglia <p> One of my best holidays ever was spent in Puglia which is the heel of the boot .

" <p> I am raising our son to be an equal with his sister , to respect women and girls and also to know that his career choice is one he wants .

This post may be a trigger for some and I found tears pricked my eyes reading it , I found it really heartfelt . <p> We did n't  need this level of care it must have been so frightening . These neonatal nurses are amazing and deserve to be recognised for their incredible and loving work . <p> I can totally relate to how life was super hard when the kids were both tiny . My second child was born when my first was 2 years 5 months . <p> The days seemed to merge into one and I laughed when I read Donnas sentence about forgetting to brush her teeth .

My friend is a great mother , she was from the start at age 16 . <p> To see this initiative does my heart some good so pass it on to those you feel might benefit . <p> I remember a lady opening a cafe in our town saying to me , bring all your mum friends I did n't  have any to bring , all my friends were at work !

If you are staying the UK then Butlins do a Just for Tots holiday andA Slice of My Life Wales has written all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style ? A Mum Track Mindwent to The Lake District on a camping trip with a little one and it looked fab !

Somewhere that is on my list to visit is Crete and Emily and Indiana shares a familymoon with us such a lovely idea . Lastly , Babyfoote shares her favourite things to do in Rome with toddlers young children should n't stop you from enjoying amazing destinations . <p> I think the main worry for many parents is the travelling to and from the holiday destination . We are going to be travelling with Wills for the first time in a few weeks and I am really anxious ! If you are travelling by car or by plane , Wave To Mummy has a fab post on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will definitely be using it ! Mudpie Fridays has an excellent post with so many tips for flying with a toddler and I also love this post from Flying with a Baby with loads of tips for solving any in-flight problems that may crop up . <p> Wherever you decide to go , Quite Frankly She Said has a great list of things to help you prepare and Whinge Whinge Wine shares her tips on how to have a harmonious holiday point number 1 did make me laugh ! <p> What are your plans for the summer ? Are you opting for a staycation or are you going away for a week or two ? <p> Next month I will be talking all about days out with toddlers . So many places are geared for older children so I want to share top picks for little ones .

@@105786822 @1186822/ <h> Single Parent Round-up : Blogger highlight <p> I love writing this Round-up and sharing posts from our community but I think its hard to get a good feel for the wonderful bloggers I feature and so with permission from Britmums , I have decided that alongside the usual Round-up format that we know and love , I will also choose a single parent blogger to feature in the Blogger Highlight . Single parent bloggers are more than just single parents and write about so many different subjects whilst addressing the unique situation that some of us find ourselves in . <p> The Single Swan is written by Pen . Not Pen , short for Penny , not Pen as in the thing you write with , but Pen , an anonymous pseudonym . <p> At first , whenever I read her posts , I wondered who Pen was . She was experiencing similar emotions and facing similar problems that I had been , either then , or in the past . I found her blog just as she launched it in 2015 . Her writing was so relatable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was anonymous and now , I forget that I do n't  know her , as her writing makes me feel as though I do . <p> A few people have asked me why I chose the single swan ' for the name of my blog . A few people have also asked me whether I am really called Pen . <p> Swans apparently are one of the few creatures , others being termites , beavers and pigeons who mate for life . Mating for life was my aspiration.Although I left my ex , single motherhood was never my aim , never my ambition.Having said that , I am okay with it.In fact , when I think of the alternative , marrying my ex and struggling through the rest of my life slowly being extinguished , I am more than okay with my single mother status , I am actually pretty happy with it . I am free again to choose my destiny.I am rekindling that fire in my belly . <p> She adds that <p> A single swan is called a pen , a male swan is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We are Pen and Cygnet . <p> She chose to be anonymous so that she could be as honest as possible whilst respecting the privacy of all involved . I envy her in this respect . I wish in some ways that I had done the same and started another blog to document the really hard parts of being a single parent we all know that there are many of them . <p> Pen writes about life in general the exhibitions or museums she visits when Cygnet is with his Father , Music , Days out with her son and she does n't  ignore the big topics such as Brexit , Mental Health and Sex . <p> One of my favourite posts is Sex as a Single Mother . Not only has she written a post that feels as though she plucked the words from my head , she has described the feelings and worries that so many of us have , in a way that makes you just want to high 5 her and say yes , that 's exactly it ! <p> I never hide the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we meet that I have a child . <p> But , my dates have n't seen the amazing things that I have done , that my body has done , all they can see is the scars , the battle lines and the lopsided breasts resembling empty socks.Not sexy ! <p> Pen does n't  just write about serious subjects although Im sure that some people take Tinder very seriously . I really enjoyed her post To The Men of Tinder , This is Why I Did n't  Reply as I laughed and nodded my way through it having found myself seeing the same things and receiving the same messages . You do n't  need to be a single mum to relate to that one . <p> The last post that I 'll share with you , before I urge you to go and check her blog out , is one from the archives , from 2015 and explains the gap in Cygnets baby book . You know the one , where you record birth details , first smiles , first teeth etc . Its simply called , A Letter To My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single parent to her young son , Bear . They have a little cottage in semi rural North Yorkshire and share it with a demanding yellow Labrador , a cat , 2 guinea pigs and 3 fish . She began writing when her health took a turn for the worse and Hannah writes about parenting and most aspects of life . She faces many a co-parenting challenge but hopes that her blog , hannahspannah.co.uk shows a positive view of life as a disabled single mum . Cake is her food of choice and she spends most of winter covered in mud thanks to the dog and child .

I must say I have to agree with Audrey , I think a special talent lies in the people who can make us laugh with their words ; no props or funny comedy faces , simply by the words they share with us on screen . Parenting can be tough and these wonderful writers , who find the funny in the everyday situations that we all experience , are a gift to us all . <p> That 's why this month I decided to feature the comedians among the newbies in my round-up . So let 's get started , first up is I would rather smell like a goat by Tilly from Mummy Rules . This is as funny as it sounds from the title and is such a fabulously written post too .

Effortlessly gliding through life , always with a bag of tricks containing just the right thing for any given situation and obviously with a freshly baked cake in the kitchen . Sadly , this is not the case ! The Adventures of a Beta Mummy shares her fabulous poem , Introducing Alpha Mummy and Beta Mummy , which I think describes most of us perfectly . Funny because it is so true ! <p> This post , or should I say song , from Life is Knutts is short and sweet and made me laugh out loud . Toddlers can be such infuriating creatures !

With rides ranging from the gentle carousel , and other simple fairground classics . all the way up to the adrenaline filled twists and turns of Dragons Fury , there is something for everyone here . <p> One of the most family friendly things about Chessington World of Adventures is how much more it offers guests than just rides . The on-site Zoo , Sealife Centre and daily shows around the park give those with tiny tots in tow something to do while the thrill seekers are hitting the rides . <p> If your little ones happen to be mini adrenaline junkies , there are also some great rides to get them screaming with the big kids . Scorpion Express ( 0.9m and over ) and Hocus Pocus Hall ( no height limit ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as being great for those older members of the group too ) and the Bubbleworks is guaranteed fun for all the family . Those with babies will be able to find Baby changing facilities next to toilets at Lodge Gate and a dedicated baby feeding room located alongside the Forbidden Kingdom toilets near the First Aid Centre . <p> For those slightly older guests Chessington have some really great attractions to introduce children to the joy of rides . Vampire , suitable for those over 1.1m , is a fast-paced family rollercoaster that will see you flying over the treetops with the legs dangling down below , or for those who prefer to keep their feet on the ground , and are over 1m tall , the Zufari ride will take them of a fun-filled tour of the Safari Park . If you have teenagers with you ( that are over 1.4m ) then the lure of Ramases Revenge , Dragons Fury and Rattlesnake will be enough to keep them interested in joining the days out for years to come . <p> With all of this fun being had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk turns to finding a place to eat . The park offers and abundance of food outlets offering anything from a quick sandwich to grab and go at The Original Sandwich all the way up to a sit down meal . Our restaurant of choice is the Smokehouse BBQ . New in Market Square for 2016 , this BBQ joint offers pulled pork , beef brisket , pork ribs and chicken ( all cooked in a wood barbecue pit ) plus the most delicious Mac'n'Cheese for the vegetarians like me . <p> If you want to make a short break out of your trip to Chessington then the onsite hotels are just what you need . We have stayed twice now in the Azteca Hotel and could n't recommend it highly enough . The jungle themed family rooms come with a separate childrens sleeping area , perfect for a good nights sleep ahead of a fun-filled day in the park , and having breakfast served overlooking the safari animals the next morning is always a highlight of my trip . There is also a Premier Inn within walking distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For those looking for an even more wild adventure , you are in for a treat as Chessington have also announced they are opening a glamping area next to the Wild Asia area of the park in May 2016 complete with Safari Tents and after hours access to some areas of the theme park . <p> Our girls adore a trip to Chessington , Lottie who is 7 would ride Vampire all day long and Little O who is just 4 can not get enough of the classic family favourite Bubbleworks . <p> Visiting Chessington is a lovely way to spend the day and has become an annual event for us . While the queues for their most popular rides can reach over an hour long at peak times ( queue jump tickets are available ) , the park itself is well laid out and spacious so you can escape the crowds if you want to . It really is a family park with something for everyone . <h> About 104270 @qwx964270

@@105786901 @1186901/ <h> Family skiing in Colorado <p> Friends often told us we would love a family skiing holiday but , for many years , we werent sure . We kept promising ourselves we would all learn together but never took the plunge , making excuses about creaking joints and past injuries . Our son eventually learned to ski on a school trip to Italy at the age of 12 but Mum and Dad continued to procrastinate . <p> Just when I thought I was too old to ever try out skiing for myself , I was asked to review two ski resorts in Colorado , with particular emphasis on their facilities for families . As complete novices , my husband and I could test out the ski schools and report back on the quality of teaching . As parents , we would have a fair idea about what makes a great family-friendly resort . <p> Trish &amp; husband Dougie Photo credit : Trish Burgess <p> How to get there ? Yes , its a long way to the United States but the nine hour direct flight with BA from Heathrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , once you 've deducted the seven hour time difference , you 're in Colorado at tea-time . Children will be in movie-heaven during the flight and parents will find the time goes surprisingly quickly , especially with complimentary food and drinks . <p> The resort of Winter Park is around two hours drive from the airport . Well-equipped 4-wheel drive mountain carriers can whisk you safely to the resort if you do n't  want the hassle of hiring a car yourself . Steamboat Springs is a bit further away , a shade under four hours from Denver . Many visitors , however , fly into its local airport of Yampa Valley , only 25 miles from the resort . You might think about extending your holiday : have a few days in Washington DC or New York then fly into Steamboat ? <p> Photo credit : Trish Burgess <p> Skiing conditions Some of the best ski resorts in the US can be found in Colorado because the conditions are ideal for the sport . Reliable snow ( average annual snowfall at Winter Park is 323 inches ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , plus a climate which provides dry , powder snow which makes for superb skiing and boarding . So impressive is the snow , theyve even registered the term Champagne Powder- as a trademark in Steamboat . Temperatures can get pretty cold but nothing beats a sunny day after a fresh fall of snow : a blue bird day is one to remember.Which resort ? Youre spoilt for choice with the large number of excellent ski resorts in the Rocky Mountains . Both Winter Park and Steamboat have excellent facilities for all levels of skiing ability across thousands of acres of terrain . Winter Park is a destination for accomplished skiers and boarders but its also the perfect place for beginners who can practise on proper trails without the worry of hot-shot skiers whizzing past . Steamboat has a fantastic wild west feel about it , a holiday resort with a lively town nearby : it may have the edge if you are looking for a variety of activities off the slopes . <p> Photo credit : Trish Burgess <p> Accommodation You cant fail to find the right accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this right . In Winter Park we stayed at the Zephyr Mountain Lodge , the only ski-in ski-out accommodation at the base of the mountain . Ideal for families : 1,2 and 3-bedroomed apartments , with fully-fitted kitchens and large , warm living rooms . Steamboat has a number of hotels and condos hugging the mountainside . Our hotel , Steamboat Grand , was just a minutes walk from the ski lifts and , with storage for your skis at the base , there was no need to lug everything to and fro . At both resorts , plentiful shuttles and local buses regularly transport people from apartment to mountain . <p> Food If you 've any fussy eaters in your brood , you 'll be relieved to know that all bases are covered here . There 's the ubiquitous pizza , chicken and fries but you will also find fare from all corners of the world : Mexican , Asian , even Scandinavian . Pancakes or paninis for breakfast , soups and salads for lunch and even some spectacular fine-dining opportunities at the top of the mountains , reached by gondolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching is extremely good whether private/group , full day/half day , skiing or boarding . The instructors are patient , encouraging and lots of fun plus there 's no language barrier to worry about . The ski schools for children are second to none : all kids are tracked with a GPS tag which buzzes an alarm to the instructor if a child deviates too far from the group . The tracking system also means that parents can see online exactly where their child has skied each day . We did hear some wonderful stories of two brothers who swapped tags to confuse their instructor and one cheeky lad who attached his to a passing snow-mobile : his parents must have enjoyed watching that trail later in the evening . Parents we chatted to at both resorts told us how impressed they were with the teaching and how reassured they were that their child was safe . <p> Photo credit : Winter Park <p> What else can you do ? If you can tear yourselves away from the slopes once you 've caught the skiing bug , you 'll find that most resorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun things to do . At both resorts you can try out tubing ( race your kids down an ice-slide in an inflatable tyre ) , plus you can book ski-biking or cross-country skiing . Still have excess energy ? Snowmobiling is also worth a try , as well as snow-shoeing and ice-skating . The ice arena in Steamboat Springs also offers mind-boggling bumper cars on ice and you can try waterslides and an aquatic climbing wall at the Old Town Hot Springs . <p> A family skiing trip to Colorado certainly comes under the heading of a holiday of a lifetime . It will be more expensive than a skiing holiday in Europe , due to the flights , but having experienced a glorious week of spacious trails , awesome scenery and high levels of customer service , I would say it really is worth considering . <p> If the instructors can teach me , a less-than-athletic , scaredy-cat 51 year old to ski , they will have your little ones swishing down the mountains in no time .

I truly felt that the discolouration had faded and that my eyes werent that puffy . <p> That made me feel great and gave me a well needed confidence boost . <p> After lunch , I went to the bathroom and noticed that my mascara had bled a little onto my under eye area which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its happened many a time before .

I felt encouraged that it was actually doing something . <p> I watched one of the YouTube videos on their site and it suggested you apply it at night and top up in the morning if you felt you needed to , and so after 3 days of morning applications , I began to apply at night . <p> Now , I am not going to say that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye bags or wrinkles I do . I do n't  think it will ever change as after all , I have a young child , I 'm doing it alone and I am long term unwell .

Rosanne Cobb , the safari expert and leader of the team at Abambo Travel , is here to make it easier than ever , with these money-saving tips for families . An ex-teacher , she is also founder of the Safari Awards and editor of the Good Safari Guide . Over to Rosanne : <h> Yes , safaris can be expensive <p> African safari lodges are amongst the most expensive places you can stay worldwide , where you will enjoy the world 's best service with some of the world 's best wildlife viewing . But that means that a safari can be quite expensive when you want to take the family . <p> What are your options for an African safari if you do n't fancy paddling yourself there with a tent on your back ? The good news is , an African safari does n't have to break the bank . Here are my money-saving tips : <p> Picture courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room can often end up much more expensive than if you book an entire house for your own exclusive use . Once you 've booked a house for your family , you can really do as you please , and the cost-per-head drops significantly . This flexibility is especially useful when you are going with extended family " it 's social and comfortable and you can squeeze in more people without the price following suit . <p> The more , the merrier . Booking a house for many can make more sense . Picture courtesy Abambo Travel <h> Tip 2 : Deals , deals deals <p> Africa is saturated with safari packages , overwhelmingly so , which is brilliant because all these competing lodges offer discounts . If you are a spontaneous type , you can get fab last-minute deals leaving within the next couple of months . But do beware , last-minute deals are much harder to come by during school holidays , and you may get stung on high flight costs if you leave it late to book . <p> Many lodges offer long-stay discounts , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ' , along with partner 50% ' deals . If the lodge you like does n't have a published long stay deal , it 's always worth asking . My team at Abambo frequently use our relationships to negotiate special rates . <p> While school holidays are more expensive , there are deals to be had . Picture courtesy of Abambo <h> Tip 3 : Consider the exchange rate <p> In these turbulent times you could be reducing the cost of your African safari by up to 50% on a lucky day . South Africa is the obvious example right now , where you are getting over double for your pound or dollar than a few years ago ( although many lodges are now charging in USD for stability ) . We ca n't always predict currency fluctuations , but it is worth getting familiar with ZAR and USD trends . <p> Reducing the cost of this type of experience by 50% ? Yes , please ! Picture courtesy of Abambo <h> Tip 4 : Go off-season <p> Green season ' or ' emerald season ' safaris take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not including the Christmas period ) , but this varies greatly between countries . The green season is considered poor for game-viewing because animals disperse and the vegetation grows so thick and tall it hides the wildlife from view . However , whilst you are unlikely to see the cast of Lion King sharing a drink at a waterhole , you have a chance of seeing all sorts of newborns under huge , dramatic African skies . Once you 've seen a baby elephant trying to work out how to use its trunk , you 'd choose to travel in the green season every time ! <p> Flights are cheaper in the green season , and usually there are no crowds . Just avoid the areas which shut up shop during this time ( some spots in Kenya , Tanzania , Zambia ) , and you 're really onto a winner . In some places for example the Kalahari in Botswana " you have more chance of seeing wildlife during this time than than the rest of the year . <p> Fancy seeing a baby elephant learning to use its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picture courtesy of Abambo <h> Tip 5 : Consider Mobile Camping <p> It 's not the kind of soggy camping you 've experienced in the west of England , or whilst hiking the backcountry in the States . Your ensuite tent is furnished with hot showers ; your private chef will arrange gourmet feasts for every meal , which are served on white tablecloths ; you 'll have ice in your drinks for your sundowners , and you 'll sleep the sleep of the dead under your feather duvet . <p> Mobile camping is a great option for larger family groups , when it becomes the best value for money , and it 's the most flexible as you can tailor-make your entire itinerary and your campsite moves with you . <p> Its sundowners on the go with mobile camping . Picture courtesy of Abambo <h> Tip 6 : What 's in a name ? <p> Everyone has heard of the Serengeti and the Kruger , and this notoriety keeps the prices elevated . Head for the less-well-known ( and less busy ! ) wildlife reserves to remove the premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zambia , Lake Nukuru in Kenya . Look for smaller concessions which border the big parks : If they are unfenced you will enjoy the same wildlife but without the crowds . <p> Another perk of the private reserve is that they do n't need to stick to the rules and curfews of the national parks , because they do n't have the volume of tourists . Fewer guests means less environmental damage , and because you are always with a trained guide who is respectful of the environment , you have more freedom " for example the freedom to get out and walk or go on a night drive . <p> Guides on private reserves deal with fewer guestsand can make sure your experience is worthwhile and eco-conscious . Picture courtesy Abambo <h> Tip 7 : Flight sales <p> Keep an eye on airline websites to jump on any sales the moment they 're announced . It can be hard to predict . For example , at Abambo we 're in close contact with the airlines and are always trying to get the lowdown on when to advise our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know themselves when their prices will drop . <p> Here 's something that will help : Download the Hopper ' app ( screenshot below ) and it will alert you when prices drop for the routes you are interested in . <h> Tip 8 : Look out for new lodges <p> Lodges inevitably hike up prices when they become more popular , so catch them when they 're new . You can expect some of the top lodges charge in excess of -1700 per person per night . <p> Machaba Camp is the new kid on the block in Botswana 's fabulous Khwai area , but is very quickly proving to be the place to be . And at -650 per person per night in the high season , you 're getting a lot of luxury for a lot less . ( Note : Africa outfitters tend to quote prices in US dollars ; we have converted to pounds . ) <p> Angama Mara is Kenya 's seriously luxury Mara option , and it 's owner-run , which we love . Angama is a very reasonable -965 peak season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Makanyi Private Game Lodge in South Africa too . And hot off the press keep a look-out for Norman Carr 's new luxury camp Mambeti in Zambia ( Liuwa ) , due to open in 2017 . <p> Machaba Camp provides a luxe experience for less <h> Tip 9 : Use an expert tour operator <p> Mistakes when booking your family safari can be very expensive . You may think you 're talking the same language as the lodge if you 're booking direct , but invariably there are misunderstandings . Tour operators give advice that could save you thousands , are there if things go wrong , And their service is free . It 's a money-saving no-brainer , especially when you consider UK tour operators are insured up to the hilt in order to look after you and your hard-earned holiday savings . <p> An expert tour operator can help make your safari experience seamless .

Most of it will be overwhelming and a lot of it can be quite scary . Occasionally there will be a golden nugget of solid advice . You will cling to that nugget and pass on to anyone you see with a bump in an unsolicited fashion , because it kept you sane during the continuous craziness of parenting . <p> In the meantime , enjoy some real , and some slightly alternative parenting advice from this hilarious bunch of bloggers <p> Kerrys letter to Beyonce is packed full of the advice that no one really tells you , but you really wished you had n't  had to find out for yourself .

To make it extra cool ' , shut the curtains to make it proper , kids like that . <p> You sit on the sofa as the music director ' ( win ) and have them dance for you . <p> Going on holiday with kids is about as far removed from a holiday as you can actually get .

Make time to clean or be prepared to hate yourself . <p> Before having kids you may have some preconceived notion that you are going to be a cool parent and be able to handle any question your kid throws at you . In reality any mention of the birds and bees makes you want to put your hands over your ears and sing " lalalalalala " . Luckily Prabs has how to handle it covered <p> 7 . Walk past her room , lob an informative ' book ( see below ) at the bed while she 's got her headphones on and run away . <p> Step Two : Apply the nit solution to everyone 's hair Be prepared for a vigorous workout when applying nit solution to a two year old who NEVER stands still as you chase him around the house for half an hour .

I had short-term memory loss , due to the trauma we had suffered , and my energy was entirely consumed in the cruel game of what I now call relearning to live . Reprogramming my mind to accept life as it now was proved a full-on battle and making sense of it all took about 12 months . <p> At the end of that first year , my mind grew tired of fighting and asking the " whys " .

But whoever said that did not take into account grief and its circular , destructive cycles . <p> Acceptance has not offered a protective shroud against the pain that has continued to hit periodically and randomly , triggered by anniversaries and flashbacks . <p> Acceptance is not the ticket out of the maze of grief , as I had hoped it would be . <p> In this second year , grief has taken other forms , more terrifying in their purging force than the loss of faith and friends I had experienced the previous year . <p> These past few months , grief has been , like a magnifying glass , picked at the very core of who I am . <p> I am no longer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who am I ? <p> I am a strong , determined mama who needs to find a new meaning to her life . <p> I was robbed of my child and with him , I was robbed of my identity as a mother , a wife , a human being . <p> These past two years have all been about tearing down in order to rebuild a life in which I feel happy and in charge . <p> I am still very much on the path . <p> I know now that I can survive the unthinkable , the unmentionable but can I also find new meaning for my life , out of the immense sense of loss I have been experiencing ? <p> Oana Papaconstantinou is a mum of 2 children who blogs at Mama 's Haven on grief , travel , photography and reviews .

Here she shares with BritMums part of her journey . She says , I was , I am , and will always be , a mummy to my blue eyed boy. <p> Baby Loss Awareness week was set up to remember those precious babies that died in pregnancy or during or shortly after birth . It also aims to break the silence and taboo around infant loss and unites bereaved parents and families worldwide . <p> This time , two years ago , I had never even heard of Baby Loss Awarness week . I was too busy preparing for the safe arrival of our first baby , Edward Louis Reid . I was also living in ignorant bliss , with the belief that my baby boy would be delivered safely <p> And he was . <p> Eddie was born on 18th January 2014 " he was big , healthy and strong , weighing in at nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our family finally felt complete . <p> Nothing could have prepared us for what would happen only 12 short weeks later . <p> In the early hours of April 16th 2014 , somewhere between 3am and 5am , we tragically lost our baby boy to SIDS , sudden infant death syndrome and that light was extinguished . On every medical test possible , Eddie was perfectly healthy there was no reason to attribute , no finger to point , no one to blame , which made our loss even harder to bear . <p> In a matter of seconds , our whole world had been turned upside down . Losing a child is a loss like no other . All order of life had been reversed and I felt I had failed as a mother to protect my child . No matter how untrue that was , and despite medical assurances that there was nothing we could have done , the guilt I felt was torturous . <p> My husband Chris and I made a promise to Eddie when we said goodbye to him at the hospital . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him proud in everything that we do . This is what we would have expected him to say to us in 40 years time , not the other way round . <p> The last 18 months have been hell but we would n't be here standing had it not been for the unwavering support and love from each other and our close friends and family . I read an article in the early days of my grief that couples were 70% more likely to break up after the loss of a child and I was terrified this would happen to us . Once you become a statistic , you believe all odds are against you . <p> Chris and I promised each other very early on that we would always speak about how we were feeling and would pick each other up when the other was feeling down . We have held true to those words every single day . I also chronicled my grief journey in a blog as I found it cathartic to put my thoughts into print . We have learnt there is no short cut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the waves of uncertainty . Sometimes , all may appear to be fine , but other times , grief can hit you most unexpectedly .

It 's hard to count your blessings at a time like this but we are grateful for the precious time we had with Eddie and for the time we have with each other . <p> We think about Eddie every day " he is always with us in thought and in our hearts . And whilst time has given us more coping mechanisms , the grief never goes away , it simply changes shape . <p> Out of a desperate need to search for answers and to do something meaningful in Eddie 's name , my husband and I set up a charity 3 months after we lost Eddie in July last year called Teddy 's Wish ' . We decided very early on that the charity would raise funds to further research into the causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieving families going through the same unimaginable pain .

The Christmas juggle is an issue for many families each year , here is her take on it . <p> I have been discussing with friends about how some of us are having real issues arranging and prioritising Christmas particularly when children and in-law families are concerned , how do you please everyone , strike the right balance and have a merry Christmas without causing family arguments in the new year ? <p> Christmas is fast approaching , the season of goodwill and spending time with the people you love . But what if you are struggling to juggle all the people you love or some of your relationships with family or friends are making you dread this festive season ? <p> I have been speaking to some friends in recent weeks about this very issue . Sadly this year has seen for a number of my friends the breakdown of relationships with family members from mothers in law , sisters and brothers and also more extended family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that we should be spending time with family at Christmas . For as long as I can remember my mum had a routine over Christmas which meant that every family member was seen at some point . We would rush up and down the motorway doing the parcel run on Christmas Eve and then get a take away very late on the way home . My poor Mum would then stay up till silly o clock getting everything ready for my sister and I on Christmas morning . By this time she was often exhausted and I always worried that by putting everyone before herself she did n't feel the magic of Christmas . <h> The Christmas balance <p> Fast forward to me having my own family and we have for many years done the same , spent Christmas Day with one side of the family and Boxing Day with the other and alternating each year so each set of parents felt they were treated fairly . We have since having children never really been able to relax for much of these days because we have been on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how much time we could spend at each place . We have an amazing time of course but I do wonder sometimes how to get the balance right . <p> So how do you please everyone and deal with conflict at Christmas ? Well the honest answer is you probably ca n't . You are a family unit of your own and as much as you want to please others what is best for you and your children should be paramount . If that means spending one of the main days of Christmas at home in your pyjamas with the children playing with their new toys so what ? Your family and friends who love you will understand that you are your own people with your own lives . As long as you make time for them on your own terms there really is n't anything to feel bad about . <p> This could be arranging to visit for supper , inviting people to your home instead of feeling pressured to going to them , organising a family walk out at some point where toys and the tv wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as , We wo n't be there until midday as the children will want to play with their presents once they have unwrapped them . ' No one can criticise you for this and it takes the heat off for rushing to get to places at an unrealistic time . <h> Letting go of guilt <p> What about people who you have lost touch with or had a relationship breakdown with over the last year ? Be true to yourself , it might well be hard but if you have no intention of seeing certain family members at any other time of the year why change this at Christmas ? As a family it should be about what is best for you and if that is n't having an overbearing in-law moaning about your poor cooking or family members tutting at how your children behave then that 's okay . We simply ca n't always get on with everyone and there 's no point beating yourself up about it . <p> Ultimately what we all want is to create happy memories with our loved ones at Christmas . The years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas has to offer fly by so why make life hard on yourself by enduring Great Aunt Edna and her sarcasm or Cousin Bill who drinks too much and causes an argument over the table ? You can still see these people should you wish by popping in for a cuppa and a mince pie but that does n't mean you have to spend the whole day with them . <p> No one would choose to have issues with members of their families and it is all about making the best of it . Prioritise what is important to you and spend your time with those who deserve it , not people who will make you feel bad . Talk to your friends and I bet that you wo n't be the only person in a similar situation this year .

I heard him crying and went upstairs to his bedroom to find him standing up in his cot , holding his threadbare teddy comforter , tears on his little cheeks . He reached up to me and I picked him up , the warm , sleepy weight of him heavy in my arms as I kissed his head . I sat in the rocking chair that we bought before he was born and held him close , gently rocking the chair backwards and forwards while he snuggled into my chest and I breathed in the wonderful , unique smell of his soft hair . As I rocked , I sang . Softly , quietly . The same little song Ive been singing to him almost from the day he was born . <p> A song that I now can not sing without remembering the babies who share a space inside my heart along with my very own baby , although he is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to my eyes and although I tried to blink them back they slowly slid down my cheeks and onto Squidges hair . My voice threatened to start shaking , just as it had done on those days when I sat with families who were trying to understand how to say goodbye to their child . I saw a desperate , broken mummy singing to her dying baby boy . I heard the pain and grief in the voice of a dear friend as she talked about losing her son . I felt the wracking sobs that I managed to keep inside until I got into my car at the end of a shift . I remembered the silent tears of the consultant when we had to tell the parents that there was nothing more we could do to save their baby . My heart ached , searching for something that I could n't find or even name . Ached even though I had my baby safely in my arms . When I first walked onto a neonatal unit as a first year nursing student I did n't  know it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile . So close to the absolute fringes of life and yet clinging on with a ferocity that I have never seen matched by another patient . During my training I cared for many patients who had lived their lives as best they could and no longer had anything that mattered to enough to keep them fighting . There was no desperation to live , no reason to stay and so they slipped away quietly , usually during the night when all the other patients were sleeping and the minimum amount of fuss would be made . The tiny patients I care for now are not like this . They continue to fight even when their bodies are exhausted and they are so very tired , unable to let go but also unable to carry on living . <p> Since neonatal care first came to be we have made amazing advances ; bolstering our arsenal of medications and treatments . We can meet even the most difficult and complicated conditions head on ; all guns blazing as we battle to save each and every baby . Yet even with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from mother nature . We can try and provide the conditions which best allow their fragile , under developed bodies to grow . We can take over the work of lungs that still need months to be fully formed . We can give medications to fight infection , drugs to support hearts no bigger than your thumbnail , fluids to provide nutrition , and precious drops of breast milk . We can place them in incubators that mimic the warm , dark safety of the wombs that they left far too early . But sometimes , despite our best efforts , it just is n't enough . It means that their parents are left with an impossible , unthinkable choice . Do they let their child fight on , knowing that they are in pain and that we can not provide them with even the smallest sliver of hope or do they help their tiny , ferocious children to be at peace ? <p> I have held sobbing mothers in my arms as they ask me what they should do . I have swallowed back tears as they ask me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so utterly useless when I have not been able to give them the words that the need because no one has them , least of all me . I have thanked a God that I am not sure I believe in that I do not know what it is to lose a child . Apart from during the height of summer , it is dark when I get home from work and when I get out of my car I stand in the quiet and look up at the stars . Tiny , twinkling points of light in the darkness . I look up and I remember all those babies who had to leave far too soon . I say their names in my mind . <p> The stars are how I imagine the memories held by those who love them to be ; tiny points of brightness in a night so dark and vast that it seems inconceivable that it could ever end . I do n't  like inspirational quotes , especially when someone is talking about bereavement but whenever I see the stars I find myself thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfairness of it all . Why should some parents keep having to stare into the darkness while others live a lifetime in the sun with their happy , healthy children ? <p> Yet I know that it is not possible for every baby to survive and that while I have seen far too many tiny lives ended far too soon , these children have lived . <p> They have held on , sometimes with the most tenuous of footholds , of toeholds on life so that they are able to spend precious minutes and hours and days with their families who love them so completely and who would give anything for them to be able to stay . When they go , those who are left behind are thrown into darkness but every second they lived is another glowing speck of light that can still be seen for lifetimes after the first light went out . <h> About 104270 @qwx964270

It 's important that this step is followed regardless of what sun cream brand you choose as if applied in direct sunlight , sun cream applied to skin can evaporate before it has a chance to bond with the skin and therefore becomes less effective . Apply liberally to all exposed , or potentially exposed , parts of the body . The official guidelines given by Colipa ( Association of European Cosmetic Industry ) are 2mg/cm2 , which approximately corresponds to one teaspoon for the face .

Over 90% of UV can penetrate light cloud cover , and this remains a common mistake and reason for sunburn " both in the UK and abroad . Shade given by trees and parasols only gives protection from around 70% of UV rays .

You hope that everyone around you will be as giddy as you are . For me , that was n't quite the case . Getting pregnant at 19 in the summer after my first year at university , was considered by most people in my life to be a grave mistake . I was studying Japanese in Edinburgh , a city where you can rarely see the sky because the Gothic architecture obscures everything . I had fought my way there , after dropping out of college two months before my A-levels when my brother died . I had to convince the course leaders that I was worthy of my place .

When I became a single mother before my daughter turned 2 , my life choices became even more restricted . Through sheer determination , I built our kingdom around her . When she started at nursery I was able to go back to college studying anatomy and physiology , nutrition , complementary therapies , massage and business studies .

Do n't  be afraid to dream big After leaving home for university , I did n't  ever expect to be returning especially so soon . Coming back to live with my parents after being married ( with a toddler in tow ! ) made me feel like a real failure . That first night , I sat in the room that had been my brothers and thought of all the years that had been stolen from him . I made a list of my wildest ambitions and most urgent dreams . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan where we went on a family adventure 2 years ago ) and I also wrote that I wanted a book deal . No one else saw this list , but giving myself the permission to really go for it sparked a fire in me that kept me on track . <p> 3 . Never give up When life is difficult it can feel deeply unfair , like other people get all the chances or all the luck . We had a devastating amount of family tragedy in my teenage years and being a teenage mum and divorced by 21 was far from easy . In all honesty I can say that the hardship simply made me stronger , more resilient and more determined than anyone else I know . I truly believe that my success has come from the warrior spirit that I 've had no choice but to develop . So if life is especially trying , just know that all this experience is simply making you stronger . <p> 4 . Listen to who you are Since I was very small I would spend hours writing and reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkest times , they gave me comfort and companionship , they offered me direction and hope . I built a world from words , but I did n't  ever consider making a career from writing until it felt like the last option imaginable . It took someone else to suggest it to me . I almost needed permission . Society often dictates what we should do , school makes us feel like our choices are limited . Which is why when my daughter tells me she is going to be a musician , I simply agree with her . She has boundless talent , passion and drive . In my eyes , all she needs is a dash of luck and shell make it . <p> 5 . Surround yourself with people who encourage you Being a single parent can be heartbreakingly lonely , but nothing like as lonely as being in a relationship with the wrong person . Having friends who do n't  understand you , or do n't  support your dreams can feel utterly deflating . I think it is so important to have people in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous and who understand your commitment to your work . Writing the book was a very intense , exhausting and all-consuming process but I loved every moment of it . It meant that I had no time for anything else outside of my family and home life for over a year . I lost a few friends over the course of it , but I also learnt who was really there for me . As you grow older you appreciate that the handful of really close mates who get you are far more valuable than scores of fair-weather friends . <p> Above all , you have to keep your mind and eyes open . New opportunities can present themselves at any given moment . Make choices that feel right for you , remind yourself that every journey starts with a single step and always love yourself enough to know when it is the right time to leave , as well as the time to put yourself out there and make your dreams a reality . <p> Hollys book The Natural Baby : A gentle guide to conception , pregnancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9th and will be available through all good booksellers .

Repeated tastings of water may help children to develop a taste for water 4. 6 . Giving children water at mealtimes may help children to eat vegetables , as it can help to dilute their strong ( and sometimes bitter ) taste 5. 7 . Children taking part in sports or exposed to warm weather need to replenish the lost fluids by drinking more water . 8 . Parents and other care givers can play a key role in helping to ensure that children are provided with drinks on a regular basis and by actively encouraging their consumption . <p> The posts below are from bloggers involved with the #TennisForKids launch . <h> About 104270 @qwx964270

A talent that you could be forgiven for assuming a newbie would n't possess ; but they do . They write , just like the most talented and experienced bloggers on a wide variety of topics . They make us laugh , they make us cry , but most of all they make us feel . To me that is the greatest gift a writer can have . <p> I decided to focus this month on the powerful posts which I have read from our rookies this month . Kicking off with Jonah and the Whale from So this is Mrs T. In this post Katie spoke so beautifully about the progress her son , who has Autism Spectrum Disorder , has made .

Whilst yes , it is time for ourselves and a much needed creative outlet , it is often also a source of income and therefore a second job on top of parenting and our day jobs .

No sooner do we settle in for the summer holidays than September knocks on our door and the kids are all off back to school . I do n't  know about you , but I was glad to take it fairly easy on the blogging front over August and only wrote one poem in the end . I had found the beautiful Chard Reservoir and wanted to express my love for the place using the written word . <p> Over on my blog , I held a Summer of Love guest post series and it was lovely to see a couple of regular poetry writers get involved . The first was Louise from Little Hearts , Big Love and the second was Tracey from One Frazzled Mum who wrote two pieces Love at First Tweet and <p> It was lovely to see the variation coming from the creatives who did write over the summer . In a similar vein to me , Lisa at Lisas Life wrote a poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her piece Turning Up in France and My Real Fairy took us on a short poetic journey through her life called We Are One . <p> It was great to see not one , but two parodies this month .

Let 's try and remember to support each other in this online world ! <p> Finally , my favourite piece of the last month comes from Words and Rhyme and a poem entitled A Caravan of Camels and a Collective Bunch of Bonkers and it reads brilliantly ! <p> With the summer over and everything returning to normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back to their usual routine .

Because sometimes other peoples mishaps are really funny . <p> Everyone has an embarrassing story up their sleeve that makes people howl with laughter . Sometimes people falling over is just really funny . Sometimes we all need a good laugh and to say , I 'm so glad that was n't me . For once . <p> This month I am sharing some stories of misfortune and cringe worthy mishaps from fellow bloggers who have lived to tell the tale , and have drunk enough wine since to be able to laugh about it . Sit back , relax , and enjoy . You have permission to laugh at these stories . <p> First up is a rather smelly tale from Mum Revised . Living in a house with three men , I am in the minority when it comes to finding farting side-splittingly hilarious . However Mum Revised did really make me laugh with her ill-timed flatulence ... <p> " It was n't a small break of air with nary-a-butt lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fermented masterpiece of bowel pre-shart air juice . " <p> ( This was a guest post for The Oops Files series from Absolutely Prabulous , check the series out for lots more embarrassing fails ) <p> Moving on from farting to peeing , and a rather embarrassing tale from Beta Mummy as part of my Rookie Mistakes series .

Our Rach Blogs shares her embarrassing attempt at rescuing her phone after a bath mishap , I do n't  want to give the story away , so I shall tease you with this <p> " Every single person I have regaled with this story has laughed out LOUD at me , whilst simultaneously shaking their head and probably wishing they did n't know me . Even the guy in the O2 shop told me I 'd made his day ( whilst probably thinking what an absolute moron I am and fearing for my son 's academic future ) . " <p> Finally , the post that really inspired the mishaps theme for this month , was the hilarious confessions of sleep deprivation from Whinge , Whinge Wine . There are some very funny mishaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying with laughter was the unfortunate lady who misplaced her tampon <p> " The doctor told me there could be a tiny chance that it may have slipped into my womb as it was still dilated from giving birth , so he referred me to hospital as an emergency .

They were 100% certain I was all clear and sent me home . At home after a traumatic day , and my other half tells me there is a tampon out of the wrapper sitting on the bathroom window ledge .

However for women there is not only a dramatic lifestyle shift but also physical changes brought on by pregnancy and labour . <p> Often , postpartum is the first time many women have given thought to an exercise programme . However , with only 5.5% of fitness industry professionals being qualified in ante and postnatal exercise , finding the right information on how to train safely can be tricky . <p> As a health and fitness enthusiast , I was eager to regain a fit and active lifestyle after giving birth and found the benefits were much more then just physical .

However , if you are a breastfeeding mother , take heart in knowing that to date there has been no scientific evidence to suggest that exercise negatively affects breastmilk supply . Exercising to exhaustion may have a slight effect on the content of breast milk but this is purely short term and will be replenished within 90 minutes . <p> A 1997 Study by Gregory et al. , found that IgA levels ( an antibody playing a crucial role in mucosal immunity ) were decreased in breastmilk for approximately 10-30 minutes post strenuous exercise but that levels returned to normal within an hour .

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RCOG ) recommends that , " if pregnancy and delivery are uncomplicated , a mild exercise programme consisting of walking and pelvic floor exercises may begin immediately " . <p> Your pelvic floor muscles run from your coccyx ( at the back ) up to your public bone ( at the front ) and form the base of your pelvis . Supporting not only your organs ( bladder , urethra etc ) but also your spine and helping to control bowel and bladder functions . <p> You may wish to begin working on your pelvic floor lying down and build up to a seated and finally standing position .

However this should be tested on rare occasions . <h> Get creative <p> Probably the most useful piece of advice I could give is getting creative with your workouts . The key to a successful fitness programme is to enjoy the process . Nothing makes working out less enjoyable than doing the same exercises over and over again ! <p> I started by using everyday objects such as a cooking pot , can of beans or broom handle as weights and leavers . I jammed my broom between chairs and jumped over the top , practiced core stability by standing on a cooking pot with one leg and lifted tin cans ( and wine bottles ) as weights . However , as my son got older and more active , I started to workout with him , using his bodyweight as a dumbbell .

The report , published by The Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity ( ECHO ) , stressed that many children are growing up today in environments encouraging weight gain and obesity and that guidance should be provided on " healthy diet , sleep and physical activity in early childhood " and that more should be done to " promote healthy habits and ensure children grow appropriately and develop healthy habits " .

You make your own speed and meaning you can stay with the flotilla or go off to an isolated cove on your own for swimming adventures . Help is always close at hand and the lead crew will arrive at each evening 's port to help with mooring . <p> To charter a boat requires someone to have a Day Skipper qualification or similar but this can usually be done in advance of the trip .

Many diving schools offer courses for kids and PADI courses are available from ten years upwards . If you have enthusiastic kids who are younger , why not try Mark Warner ?

That one is new to me as it was to Leigh Kendall author of Headspace Perspective who shares with us today her thoughts on Baby Loss and urges us to break the barriers and talk to parents suffering loss . <p> 2014 began with me as an excited expectant mother : now I am a survivor of a rare , life-threatening illness , and an empty-armed mother . My heart is broken , my hopes dashed , my dreams destroyed . <p> At the beginning of 2014 I was pregnant with my long-awaited first baby , who was due to be born in June . In mid-February , however , I started to feel unwell . The symptoms " weight gain , what I thought was heartburn , and breathlessness " were just normal pregnant ailments , I thought . My routine 24 week midwife appointment revealed some concerns , and I was sent to my local hospital for further tests . <p> Not long after my arrival I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELLP stands for Haemolysis , Elevated Liver Enzymes , and Low Platelets . Pre-eclampsia is relatively rare , HELLP syndrome even rarer , and it is rarer still to be affected so early in pregnancy . I did not know pre-eclampsia could arrive at such an early stage , and I had never heard of HELLP syndrome before . <p> Left untreated , both conditions are likely to result in the deaths of both mum and baby . The only cure is for the baby to be born . My partner and I were both utterly devastated " we knew the chances of our baby 's survival at that stage were slim . <p> Thankfully , my condition stabilised and I was taken to a specialist hospital better equipped to deal with my serious illness and our very premature baby . Our son , Hugo , was born the day after I arrived , weighing just 420 grams . Hugo fought so hard . Sadly , he was too small , and premature . He died in my arms when he was 35 days old . I am utterly heartbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There is a reason bereaved parents identify as being members of an exclusive club that no one wants to join : our culture is uncomfortable with grief , and baby loss in particular is a taboo . <p> While I have been the grateful recipient of much kindness from friends and family since Hugo died : people who know how much Hugo means to me , who are always willing to listen to my stories about him , and agree that he was a gorgeous baby . They make me feel included and accepted as a mummy . <p> However , there are many people who do not know what to say . You can see the look in their eyes , sense their awkwardness and their wish to be elsewhere . I understand that there are some who are frightened about saying the wrong thing ' , so prefer to say nothing at all . This is , of course , hurtful . I want to say to them their discomfort will last for a few moments , while my heartbreak will endure for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this has led to a reluctance to engage in conversation , especially with people who do not know Hugo 's story , for fear of their awkwardness or them saying the wrong thing ' " I try to avoid additional upset in my life . The trouble with this is , of course , it adds to the sense of isolation . <p> I always want to say to people : just ask the baby 's name . Just think , it is what you would do if the same parent was out with their baby in their pram . That parent is just as proud of their baby , whether or not the baby is still with them . <p> Guilt has been a close companion to the sadness since Hugo died . Rationally , I know that pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome were not my fault " they are indiscriminate , and no one really knows what causes them " but I felt I had failed as a woman and as a mother , and in a spectacular fashion . <p> For many months after Hugo died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The effort of carrying around the heavy weight of grief and maintaining a constant protective guard around myself was utterly exhausting . Gradually , the pain felt less acute and the protective guard eroded . There are times when I feel guilty for feeling less pain than before , for moving forward ( not on , a crucial distinction ) with my life . <p> However , I still carry the pain around with me , every single day . There is a Hugo-shaped hole in my heart , and there always will be . His photo retains the power to fill me with love , pride , and so much sorrow all at the same time . <p> Instead of watching my son grow , I nurture Hugo 's legacy . I keep his memory alive , make sure the world know he matters through raising awareness of HELLP syndrome , premature babies , and baby loss .

If you were to turn up at my house on any given day youd probably encounter all three of my sons and several of their friends too , racing round the place , building campfires and climbing on things . I 'm trying to find some quiet time amidst it all , while also making the most of having the boys around as in only a few short weeks theyll be back at school . <p> Talking of school , as July drew to a close , many of us were feeling a certain nostalgia about the end of the academic year , and Victoria from Verily Victoria Vocalises captured this perfectly in this poem about her daughters last days at first school . I could certainly empathise with these feelings , as my eldest was also leaving his school behind . Louise from Little Hearts Big Love expressed similar feelings in this beautiful poem about her daughter growing up , as did Vai from Rambling Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , Dawn from Rhyming With Wine expressed " in her usual amusing style " how she feels about her sons current clinginess , and the poems beautiful ending brought a lump to my throat . <p> More chuckles were delivered by Right Royal Mother in her poem imagining Prince George as a difficult threenager ( That charming little chap ? Surely not ? ! ) , by Slouching Towards Thatchams Mummy , Mummy , Mummy " a wonderful parody of an ABBA Song and by Baby Anons post about sleep , swearing and sick from a babys point of view . My Real Fairy also made me smile with her poem about being unable to speak for two days while parenting two young kids ( eek ! ) and Hillies fictional blog , Turning Up In Devon , was as hilarious as ever " if you 're thinking of redecorating , she has some great ideas for paint colours : hippopotamus pant , anyone ? <p> Over in the creative writing department , I 'm pretty sure most of us will recognise what Mummy Here And There expresses in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Catching The Magic has the answer in this piece about taking a break from technology : I think its something we all need from time to time .

I would also urge all mums of young kids to read this stunning poem by Abi at Like Real Life . Those times when you feel like no one understands or sees what you 're going through ? They do . You are not alone .

So with this is mind you 'll need to pack clothes for all occasions . You also need to make everything else as stress free and easy as possible . <p> I like to think of myself as an expert camper . I 've been camping out since I was six years old , so that 's thirty years experience under my belt . I 've camped in torrential rain in New Zealand , blistering heat in France , under the stars in Thailand , in thick mud at Glastonbury , during storms in Wales , in the snow ( what were we thinking ?

Small , portable travel cot " we use LittleLife Arc 2 Travel Cotwhich is a fantastic , pop-up baby tent . During the day you can fold it back into its backpack and take it to the pool/ beach/ river as it has a sunshade for outdoor , afternoon naps . It comes with an all around anti-mosquito mesh too . This was the saviour of our first baby camping trip ! <p> 2 . Baby Carrier " using a buggy is n't suitable for walking along riverbanks , down cobbled paths or through markets a carrier is much easier and more comfortable .

We use a 50QT TriColour Xtreme Wheeled Cooler which can keep ice frozen for 5 days and is great for family camping as it 's big enough to double up as a table or seat . <p> 4 . Decent barbecue " my husband likes to cook on an open fire but when you 're feeding a baby convenience and practicality win for me . We take a Campingaz 1 Series Compact Barbecuewhich is really easy to use , portable and very compact . It 's powerful so makes breakfast/ lunch or dinner quick and stress free . I also use it to boil pans of water to heat up baby food/ milk . <p> 5 . Paddling pool with shade " a great way to keep your baby occupied around the tent , on the beach or by the river knowing they 're safe and out of the sun . Perfect to fill with water on hot days or balls on cooler days . <p> 7 . Kettle " if you have electric hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one wants to get up at the crack of dawn to boil a pan of water , half dressed , half asleep to make their baby 's morning milk . A kettle makes that first feed a lot easier ! <p> 8 .

The two-way zip opening means they can be used in a pushchair or car seat . We use a Travel Gro-Bag 2.5 tog <p> 9 . Baby floor seat " a brilliant camping substitute to a high chair . Baby floor seats are small enough to pack in your car and perfect for feeding , playing or just watching the world go by . You can sit on a picnic blanket with your baby and feed with ease . <p> 10 .

Am I holding on to their childhood for as long as I can in the knowledge that once its gone its gone ? Am I being a mean mum ? <h> What age did we have our ears pierced ? <p> Reading through the replies it seems that as children ourselves , we were made to wait until an appropriate age , which changes from family to family . Anything from the age of 5 upwards to 18 in some cases . My continental friends piped in with their take on the matter , In Spain the doctors are waiting for the baby girl to arrive with earrings in her hand before cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take into consideration ? <p> As mothers we have the final call and all of our decisions are made on what we think is best for them . One factor that weighs heavily is the after care needed once the ears are pierced . No mother wants to be trailing back and forth to the doctors with infected ear lobes . It is true that in the days following the piercing the earrings need to be turned daily and cleaned with antiseptic solution , so lots of mums have decided that the best time to get your daughters ears pierced is at the beginning of the summer holidays , allowing a good healing time before going back to school in the autumn . <p> PE and games plays a huge part in the decision making . Infant schools ask for earrings to be covered in plasters for health and safety reasons and one mum , also a teacher , has had the unpleasant experience of seeing ears ripped open in PE . <p> One mother adds to the discussion saying , Never . I 'm thinking acupressure points and effects ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What are the effects ? <h> What is the average age of children getting their ears pierced ? <p> If I can work that out then maybe I can give my daughters a clear mathematical reply based on averages and percentages , thatll impress them ! <p> If you are a continental mother then you are most likely to have your childs ears pierced at birth of within the first two years of her life . There are also some UK mums who had their babies ears pierced and swear it was the right decision . <p> Glancing through all the replies , I read , 4 , 6 , 7 , 11 , 16 which is n't a clear answer we are all agreeing on . A lot of mums seem to be aiming for the transition from junior school to secondary school and I find myself nodding in agreement .

I went on a school trip to Paris when I was 12 , came back with some of my pocket money and went into Farnham with my best friend and we both had it done . No parents in sight . You can imagine how happy my Mum was when I rang her from a phone box afterwards . Ca n't imagine jewellers even being allowed to do that now . <p> My eldest niece had her ears pierced as a baby , and I do n't  agree with that , its a choice to make when a child is older in my opinion . But I know where my parents live in Spain , its the norm . <p> My daughter asked if she could have her ears pierced 2 years ago when she was 10 . I was happy to let her use her Birthday money to get them done . As a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 16 and remember feeling that it was unjust ! As I parent I feel that throughout the next few years there will be bigger battles to fight ! ! However , I do n't  agree with babies or very small children having piercings . I think a child should be old enough to make a choice about whether to have their ears pierced and responsible enough to independently manage the aftercare !

@@105787010 @1187010/ <h> Health Round-up : Focus on chronic illnesses <p> When I put the call out for submissions , as always , I wondered if I 'd get many responses . And , as always , I was overwhelmed with how many people shared their links and their stories with me . At first I felt a bit sad about this , thinking that its so incredibly unfair that so many of us are suffering with illnesses that have a daily effect on our lives . Some are seen , some are unseen , and many are lifelong . Then , after reading some posts , I realised that its such a good thing for us bloggers to have this arena , to open up and connect with one another , and help people who might be going through a very similar stage . <p> Anyway , enough of my sentimental rambling . My first post is from Erica over at The Incidental Parent . Erica has Crohns disease , and the post I 've chosen covers her diagnosis and initial treatment . I caught something on TV recently , it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in labour asked the midwife if she was going to be alright . The midwife replied something like " Youve got Crohns , this is going to feel like a walk in the park . " I know , from Ericas social media updates , that Crohns is a very unpredictable illness and periods of seeming remission can be halted with awful flare ups . <p> I 've featured Laura from Five Little Doves previously , but I had no idea that she is also battling an invisible illness . I was shocked to read in this post that she takes 22 tablets every DAY to be able to function . This is because she suffers with Fibromyalgia , which is a rheumatic condition characterised by muscular and musculoskeletal pain . At best , it sounds just manageable , and at worst it sounds utterly debilitating . Laura suffers from a fair few illnesses ( " ailments " seems too light a term ) and her blog is often a really challenging read but she 's one of the most inspiring writers I know . <p> Diabetes has been a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly because of the rise in obesity . Not just in adults , either childhood obesity and connected diabetes is also steadily climbing which is a definite call to action for us parents , is n't it ? Kimberly from Odd Hogg has Type 1 diabetes , which I 've previously heard referred to as the " non-junk food one " . True , Type 1 diabetes is n't caused by a diet deficiency , but it does n't  make it any less brutal to manage . Kimberly has recently marked her fourth year since diagnosis , so anyone who is also affected will find her website invaluable as a sort of chronicle of events , including day to day management and experiences . <p> Emma Reed typically blogs about teething and tooth development in children , but she wrote my next pick as her sister suffers from Endometriosis . I had very little knowledge about this previously , knowing only that it was to do with " lady bits " and could affect fertility and ability to conceive . 1.5 million women in the UK are living with the condition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its so important not to ignore the symptoms , which Emma talks about in full in her post . <p> Katie from Mummy In A Tutu is my next blog , and just the title alone was enough to make me have a little cry . Katie suffers with psoriasis , which is a skin condition that can affect any part of the body . Most commonly , it causes thick , red plaques with silvery scales , and tends to lurk on the scalp , elbows , knees and lower back . Like so many chronic illnesses , its not preventable . Its treatable in the sense that it can be managed , but this often involves a lot of trial and error as the medications and products that work for one sufferer may not have the same benefits on another . <p> Kate from Family Fever also suffers from a skin complaint in the form of Eczema . Unfortunately , so does her son , and her post talks about the various triggers and treatments that she has found useful in their household .

I particularly liked her point about giving yourself a break and putting yourself first for a changeI know as a mum , wife , employee and all the rest of it that we NEVER do that and sometimes , self care can make a huge amount of difference to our comfort and outlook . Definitely check out Natalies blog for masses of information and coping strategies on MS , and health . <p> I 've shared this post with you before , but I thought I would share it again as thanks to Channel 4s First Dates programme , Alopecia has been thrust into the spotlight .

@@105787014 @1187014/ <h> SIDS : A father shares his experience <p> Paul Scully-Sloan , author of Daddys with Angels and the founder of the support group on Facebook tells BritMums of the moment he discovered his son TJ had passed away in his cot . SIDS is an abbreviation for Sudden Infant Death syndrome . This post is part of a collection in support for Baby Loss Awareness week . <p> 20th November . It had been a normal day , the kids had been to school and it was just before bedtime . The children were watching television and my wife had taken TJ for a bath . When he had finished he sat and played with his brothers and his sister for a little while . He began to get tired and miserable and his mum asked him if he was tired and wanted to go to bed . He lifted his arms to her and she picked him up . He nuzzled his head into her shoulder and wiped away his snot on her shoulder , as 14 month olds do . <p> I asked if he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper into his mums shoulder . <p> The evening went on and we all went to bed . <p> The following morning just after 6 , we were woken by our daughter , 2 at the time , trying to wake TJ up to play . My wife went upstairs , took her back to her bedroom and returned to check on TJ . <p> Our other son was standing in the middle of the room , frozen , like a rabbit in headlights . TJ was on his bed , bum in the air , the way he usually slept but he had n't  stirred from when his sister had been in . <p> She touched him and as she did , let out an almighty scream calling my name over and over . <p> I went up stairs , by which time the other children were awake , wondering what was happening . I saw TJ on his bed and immediately knew something was n't right . I picked him up and gently layed him on the floor , more gently than I had laid anything else before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me her phone , take the children to the living room and put on the cartoons , give them biscuits and stand by the front door . I dialed the emergency services and whilst talking to them on speaker phone gently tried to revive our son . It seemed like a lifetime , but it was only twenty minutes , the longest twenty minutes of my life , something that will sit in my mind and haunt me forever . <p> A paramedic came in , put his hand on my shoulder and said Youve done enough . I already knew I was trying in vain , but would never had forgiven myself if I had n't  tried . <p> I went downstairs and told my wife he had gone , it took a second to sink in and she skid to the floor , sobbing uncontrollably . <p> The house began to fill with paramedics , police and forensic officers . The neighbours were on their steps , wanting to know what all the fuss was about . <p> My wife accompanied TJ to the hospital in the ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break the news to the children and to other family members . The children did n't  really understand and the family members responded in disbelief . <p> TJ funeral took place 5 days before Christmas . By this time I was becoming quite i 'll with my liver and was vey weak . I wanted to carry his coffin , but was just too weak . The whole ceremony was a blur and still is today . I guess its my minds way of protecting itself . <p> We did n't  enjoy Christmas , but we did what we needed to do for the children . <p> We had searched for some sort of support following our loss but were met with waiting lists or high costs . Or we did n't  meet the criteria . We started our own group on Facebook but that did n't  work out . I found that there were groups and support for mums but not a lot for dads . So after experimenting with an open group for dads on Facebook decided to open a closed one for dads . The first Daddys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angels will know that we consider you as part of our family . We are interested in how you are and will listen if you want to talk or vent about anything as well as allowing us to support you in your loss . <h> About 104270 @qwx964270

Mostly I plan parties or photographs , but I 'm also planning lunches , clothes for the boys , DIY projects , home decoration , days out.holidays I 'll never take , posts I 'll never write but I plan .

That comes from researching , drawing , scribbling and taking notes that I know I 'm going to need in the future . So , with that in mind , here 's my Party Planners Elegant Guide to Britmums Live 2016 . <p> Your Outfit <p> First things first , your outfit . Do not leave this until the last moment . Think about your blog , your brand . People like to make the connection between the blog and the blogger . Dress like yourself you do n't  have to be anyone else , because you 're amazing . <p> Whilst the temptation is there to wear your normal blogging outfit read : pyjamas I 've worn slippers to a conference before because they looked like boots and were so comfortable but in my defence , I was 8 months pregnant , remember that there will be brands in the hub and you wo n't feel professional if you 're not dressed the way you 'd like them to see you . <p> Heed my cautionary tale and do n't  get caught out like I did at a press day when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera and I wore a vest top , jeans , no makeup and mom-hair . Its not fun , it was humiliating and I 've cringed at the memory for over a year now . <p> I 've seen the prettiest dresses and gorgeous tops worn by fellow bloggers at Britmums Live over the past few years have fun and feel fabulous , and you 'll have a great time . <p> Shoes <p> There are stairs , corridors , and you are going to be on your feet for most of the crazily amazing time you 're there . Wear a pair that are cool , light , and that wont give you blisters . I wore some pretty gold flip flop sandals from Next last year and they were perfect . <p> Luggage <p> Bring your suitcase . Really . I laughed it off the first time I was given this advice although I did take my suitcase as I was staying over . I 'm so glad I did . I filled it , and then some . My huge , **38;456;TOOLONG Walt Disney World embroidered suitcase was packed to its limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . <p> This year I have my suitcase as I 'm staying over , and my very new and beautiful Radley De Beauvoir bag which I 'm still swooning over . Its perfect for conferences as I can fit my camera , lenses , money , touch up makeup , perfume , cards , keys everything in it , and its beautiful . Look out for it in my post about what I 'm packing for Britmums Live this week . <p> Rucksacks are fine , but it can get quite crowded in the hub and turning swiftly then accidentally knocking the stand of your favourite brand over probably is n't the best way to introduce yourself although it definitely would get you remembered . <p> Business Cards <p> Cards are so important yet sometimes they 're the last thing that we think about . Were taking our blogs , our brands , to Britmums live . Its a networking event and Ive never been to a networking event where I 've remembered everyones name or blog address before . <p> Cards are brilliant for sponsors , for friendship and for spreading the word about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy unless you only have a few with them hand them out , offer them to people you 're speaking with sprinkle them like glitter . Its publicity for you and your sponsor if you 're carrying one . <p> Camera <p> Polish your lenses , charge your battery and get ready to capture your conference the way you experience it . Remember you 'll most probably want to record your day on your blog later , so take photos of the details that matter to you . Friends youve finally met , sponsors you 're interested in , wide angle shots of the main conference room with keynote speakers everything that 's made the day amazing . <p> I invested in a camera strap this year instead of advertising Nikon constantly and its made such a difference softer , less of a burden around my neck and I can carry it lower on my body . In my bag will be my camera , my 50mm and 105mm lenses . <p> Gadgets <p> As well as your camera , remember your iPhone ! Charge everything the night before you leave , but have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the main room . After a lengthy train journey , unless you 've been smart or lucky enough to sit by a plug , your iPhone is going to be thirsty for juice . Get into the hall early and plug in if you can ! <p> Sponsor <p> If you 're fortunate enough to be carrying someones brand with you into the conference , make sure you know your objectives at the conference with regards to their needs . Are the on your business cards do you have all of the information you need from them to play your role professionally ? Is they post on the front page of your blog ? Get your ducks in a row and be ready with scheduled tweets or any other media you 're using on the day . <p> Transport <p> If you 're arriving by train , please get a taxi to the Brewery . That 's my best advice . The first year I ever did this , I thought it would be simple and a friend and I got completely lost walking around thinking we would find the venue . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caving in and getting a taxi . The lovely people at the front of the Brewery will hail you a taxi to wherever you do and there are always taxis at the stations .

There are some very lovely hotels nearby I 've stayed at the Brewery itself , and M by Montcalm which was possibly the most luxurious hotel I 've stayed in , in England . Staying the night before gives you a not-so-early morning , staying the night after means you can relax with friends you have n't seen since the last Britmums , and get a peaceful child free night in a comfortable bed . <p> Your food <p> Let 's just say Ive never been hungry at Britmums !

We think you might find a lot of reasons why Sicily should be on your bucket list , take a look . <p> We went to the Italian island of Sicily for our family summer holiday this year and had a lovely time exploring . There 's so much to see in Sicily : it 's the biggest island in the Mediterranean and is larger than Wales . It has a rich cultural history and however many times we go there I always want to go back . Kids are welcome everywhere and the food is delicious so it 's an easy place for families to enjoy . It does get very hot there in summer ( it 's close to Africa ) but as long as you have a pool or a beach to cool you down it 's fine . <h> Palermo <p> Palermo is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street food tour- one day . Local guide Chiara took us to some food markets in the centre of the old city and we tried some delicious Sicilian dishes such as- arancini- ( stuffed fried rice balls ) and- sfincione- ( a kind of spongy pizza created in medieval times for the toothless ) washed down with icy- granita . En route Chiara pointed out the main sights of the city and explained some of their history . My kids ( 11 and 15 years old at the time ) barely noticed that they were sightseeing or walking because every few minutes we stopped to eat or drink something . It was an excellent way to see the city . <h> Inland <p> Most visitors to Sicily stick to the coast but I love going inland as well . My husband 's family is from an isolated town high up in the centre of Sicily called Mussomeli and we stayed there for a few days at the start of our trip . The landscape around the town is magnificent , almost lunar , and and the day-to-day existence of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . For example , Mussomeli only has mains water connected every few days or so and the rest of the time you have to make do with whatever 's stored in your water tanks . <h> Verdura Golf &amp; Spa Resort <p> We then spent a couple of nights at the wonderful- Verdura Golf &amp; Spa Resort- near Sciacca on the south coast . Luxury tour operator Scott Dunn organised our stay at the Rocco Forte Resort and I ca n't recommend them highly enough . Scott Dunn offers tailor-made luxury holidays to amazing destinations around the world . All four of us loved the whole experience at Verdura . We had a couple of adjoining rooms with views across the golf course to the sea . There 's a great Scott Dunn kids club , a 60m pool , bikes for guests to use around the resort and the food at the four restaurants was delicious . While we were there my son was thrilled to join in with a Juventus football training session , my husband had his first ever golf lesson while my daughter and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next stop was at an agriturismo near the new airport at Comiso in the south of the island . An agriturismo is a working farm where you can rent a room and they often have restaurants which are open to the public . The- Agriturismo Valle di Chiaramonte- has a lovely pool , free wifi , bikes for hire and a pair of ponies wandering about . We ate every night at the farm restaurant and the food was always delicious , especially the home-made ricotta ice-cream . We used the farm as a base to visit some of the Baroque towns nearby . Most of the buildings in this part of Sicily were destroyed by a massive earthquake in 1693 and were then reconstructed in the Baroque style using golden stone . Today these beautiful buildings are still standing and it feels like every town you come across is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The popular- Inspector Montalbano- TV series was filmed in this part of Sicily . <h> HouseTrip <p> We spent the last week of our trip in a holiday house on the south coast near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday property rental website- HouseTrip- and it worked perfectly for us . The house was like a home from home and we made full use of the kitchen , washing machine , free wifi and lovely pool and garden . The owners lived nearby and were very kind and helpful when we first arrived they even drove with my husband to show him where the best beaches and shops were . <p> Getting there <p> Sicily is really easy to get to from the UK . It has four international airports : Palermo on the north coast , Catania near Mount Etna on the east coast , Trapani in the west and a new airport at Comiso in the south which has Ryanair flights from London Stansted . <p> Getting around <p> We always hire a car from the airport when we go to Sicily . We shop around to find the best deal online and this time we booked an estate car with Dollar through Holiday Autos . <p> Cost <p> The Palermo Street Food Tour costs from 20 euros per person for a 75-minute Market Tour and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights at Verdura from -1,679 per person based on a family of 2 adults and 2 children sharing 2 deluxe rooms on a half board basis . This price includes flights and private transfers . <p> Rooms at- Agriturismo Valle di Chiaramonte- cost 35 euros per person per night including breakfast in high season , children under three years old are free and from three to 12 years old are 15 euros per night when sharing a room with their parents . <p> The two bedroom property we stayed in cost -950 for seven- nights in August booked through- HouseTrip . <p> Disclosure : Gretta Schifano and her family were guests of Solo Sicily on the Palermo Street Food tour , Scott Dunn at the Verdura Golf &amp; Spa Resort and Agriturismo Valle di Chiaramonte for the purposes of this review . <p> Gretta Schifano- is a freelance family travel journalist and blogger who posts at- www.mumsdotravel.com .

@@105787056 @1187056/ <h> Jo Swinson : Shared Parental Leave helps close pay gap <p> Recently BritMums had a hangout on air with MP Jo Swinson , talking about Shared Parental Leave . Here , she writes in a guest post about how shared leave can help close the gender pay gap , which has endured for too long . Jo Swinson writes : <p> This week , on Tuesday 4 November , we had Equal Pay Day it marks the point in the year when women effectively stop earning because of the pay gap that exists between the sexes . <p> Over 40 years after the introduction of the Equal Pay Act in 1970 , the Gender Pay Gap has remained a seemingly intractable issue . But the introduction the Shared Parental Leave can help address one of the root causes of this unacceptable inequality . <h> Why do men still earn more than women ? <p> There are a number of factors behind the disparity of rates of pay between men and women . Occupations traditionally identified as " women 's work " are undervalued and underpaid and the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But a significant cause of the pay gap is the career penalty that women currently pay for motherhood . <p> Research shows that the differential in pay rates between the genders rockets once women reach the age where they might be considering having children . ONS figures from 2007 showed that the pay gap for 18 to 24 year olds was negligible at 1 per cent , and actually reversed in the late 20s with the median 28-year-old woman actually earning more than the median 28-year-old man . However , as women start to have children , the gap rises steadily until it hits 20 per cent for over 45s . <h> Women with children have an even wider gap <p> And the more children that women have , the wider the chasm in remuneration becomes . The pay gap between women and men with no children was 8.0 per cent . The pay gap between women and men with one child is 12.3 per cent , two is 14.9 , three is 19.0 and for women with four children the gap is a staggering 35.5 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have children that rates of pay begin to fall behind that of their male counterparts . Often the Gender Pay Gap might actually be better characterised as the Motherhood Pay Gap . <p> Awareness of the potential detrimental effects of motherhood on careers was reflected in the results of a recent survey by AAT , the professional body for accounting technicians . The survey of 2,000 women ( half with children and half without ) of childbearing age that showed that two thirds ( 67 per cent ) were concerned about the impact that having children could have on their career , with half stating that having a baby poses such a risk to their career that they would consider remaining childless . <h> How Shared Parental Leave can help <p> The introduction of Shared Parental Leave can help to create a cultural shift that begins to address this situation by allowing mothers and fathers to choose how they share the care of their baby in the first year . <p> Under the new rules for babies due on or after 5 April 2015 , mums will still take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after that working couples can share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay . <p> Both mothers and fathers will be able to keep a strong link to the workplace whilst still playing a full part in the early stages of their child 's life . There are many mums who want to be able to balance being a hands-on mum with a dynamic career and there are many working dads who want to be able to spend more time bonding with their baby in the early months of their child 's development . <p> Shared Parental Leave can help create a cultural shift in the workplace , getting rid of outdated gender stereotypes and making it just as normal for fathers to take on childcare responsibilities as mothers . The creation of a workplace environment where men are equally likely to take time out of their career to look after young children will tackle a significant cause of the pay gap and help make the Gender Pay Gap a thing of the past . <p> Jo Swinson is the Liberal Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations and Consumer Affairs in the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills and Women and Equalities Minister .

Liz Jarvis from The Mum Blog talks about choosing a charity that fits with her philosophy . <p> A few years ago , Rosie Shelley and I were invited to visit UNICEF 's headquarters in Copenhagen , where we saw the inspired gifts ' paid for by donations being prepared for distribution around the world . These included life-saving vaccines , peanut paste for malnourished children , and emergency gifts for families who had lost everything . What better way to teach kids about the true spirit of Christmas ? <p> There are many charities running worthwhile projects . A big part of getting involved is researching and selecting the ones that are right for you . <p> I can still remember the time my son and I put together our first shoe box of gifts for the Operation Christmas Child appeal. - Knowing the child receiving it would n't be able to read English , we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft toy of the Raymond Briggs character ; and a game. - We definitely got that warm , fuzzy feeling thinking about the fact we were doing something for a disadvantaged child living in an orphanage in Eastern Europe , and I happily covered the box in pretty wrapping paper . <p> At the time , I did n't realise that there would be religious literature distributed with the shoeboxes , and I was n't aware that the scheme was run by Samaritan 's Purse , an evangelical organisation with a controversial leader . When I found out , a few years back , I decided to look for other charities for my family to support at Christmas . ( Editor 's note : Last year the BritMums blog featured a guest post from Mummy from the Heart about her experience with Operation Christmas Child .

Write a blog post , share it on the link below , and use the hashtag #Christmasgifts on Twitter so as many people as possible can see how you and your kids are planning to make a difference this year . And why not let your school and other parents know what you 're doing , too ? You never know , they might decide to join in .

I do give at Christmas , to something close to my heart but also I have a philosophy on giving that whenever I face a minor setback , I take a moment , take stock and realise it could have been a major one so find an appropriate charity to donate to . This is n't actually as altruistic as it sounds as it helps me to get over the setback as well as helping the charity . Might sound crazy to everyone else but it makes sense to me . <p> Anyway , my point was , to steal a concept for a moment , that charity is for life not just for Christmas . Christmas can be the time of year when budgets are most stretched .

To avoid too much upheaval for the family , his wife and kids have returned to the UK in time for the start of the school year in September . Tony , meanwhile , must remain in Deutschland until February . <p> Tim , Tom and Tony are all experienced dads .

He has been a stay at home dad for almost four years . John started blogging back in 2012 after being invited to one-too-many " mother and toddler groups .

He also writes about every aspect of parenting ; schooling , education , pregnancy and birth , childcare and so on . Over time he has broadened the focus of his blog so he now writes about family finances , photography and occasionally covers men 's style and fashion . John was originally a journalist . He concedes , however , that was a long time ago . <h> 4 Responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love these round ups , giving me more insight into people I already follow and introducing me to other dads that I 'm yet to discover .

I felt lonely , in desperate need of a creative space to call my own-I needed direction . Blogging ( coupled with therapy ) helped me rediscover my voice and identity again . <p> So write what you need to read and hear yourself . <p> Often the posts which are the hardest to write will resonate the most . <p> I was recently and surprisingly informed that my blog is regarded as a Google authority in gluten-free recipes . <p> I did n't  set out for that ( although Im grateful , it is ) , I was simply interested in sharing gluten-free recipes as we eat a lot as a family and by doing so and posting lots of recipes , I quickly became viewed as an authority in that field . <p> Thank you Google ! <p> Do not underestimate the importance of SEO for visibility .

You can schedule when you want your posts to go live on your blog and there are social media tools which take the stress out of publicising your work . <p> Use Social Oomph or similar tools to schedule tweets and directly schedule statuses natively , on Facebook . <p> I have gotten into the habit of plugging across all my handles as soon as I go live including Twitter , Facebook ( FB ) , Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pinterest . <p> Make sure you upload video content to FB directly too , do n't  share a YouTube ( YT ) link on FB as the box will appear smaller there , as FB obviously do n't  want people to bounce off their site and onto their competitors YT . <p> Remember that whilst its important to share content on all of your social platforms , you are simply renting space on networks that are not your own so water the grass on your home turf first : your own blog . <p> 2 . Interact with other bloggers/ on other blogs and sites . <p> Comment on blog posts and connect with other bloggers on social media and in real life at brilliant annual events like BritMums Live . There , you can network and form and cement friendships and working relationships . <p> Commenting on blogs is a crucial way to connect with your peers and it also leads readers from one site to another as readers follow the commenting thread . <p> So make sure your comment counts . <p> Nice post just wo n't cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's enough success to go around for everyone . <p> Stop comparing and start sharing . Collaborate . <p> Two brains are always better than one . Simply , find your tribe , the people you can trust who have your back and think like you do . <p> Guest post on each others blogs as well as many well known sites which accept pitches and submissions like BritMums and Huffington Post . <p> I also host guest posts too so if you have an idea you would like to pitch to me , contact me at mum@honestmum.com . <p> Writing on high authority sites helps to build your brand , offers you quality backlinks and also enables you to reach new audiences . <p> Joining linkies is another great way to connect with bloggers/ readers . They promote the posts which matter to you and help drive traffic and engagement to your pieces . <p> I run the weekly Brilliant Blog Posts linky on a Thursday ( going live on a Wednesday evening ) which sees hundreds link up each week . Linkies prompt bloggers to comment on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on if the blogs offer do-follow links ( which I do for other blogs ) , leaving comments on sites can also boost your own SEO too . <p> 3 . Ensure Your Site Looks Slick . <p> You want PR and hope that with time , others will regard you as a leader in your field , an authority in your niche , then that means looking professional from the get-go . <p> Invest in a designer if you can ( it does n't  have to be expensive ) , have a logo created and some professional looking head shots snapped ( use a camera not your phone ) for your gravatar ( uploading the same image across all platforms ) and ensure your site is clear in design and easily navigated . <p> Have your social media buttons and contact me page ( crucial ) clearly visible and at the top of your blog , above the fold and check that each button works . <p> Simply , make it easy for readers , journalists and PRs to find and connect with you . <p> Create a cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press Page ( once you have some press to add-do encourage other bloggers to interview you if they run interview features as that counts as press too ) . <p> It does n't  matter how long you 've been blogging for , start taking yourself seriously and others will too . <p> Everything boils down to confidence . <p> If you do n't  feel it ( yet ) then feign it . Let 's other people know you are confident in your abilities . <p> Confidence together with hard graft and a dedication to honing skills will lead to endless opportunities and exposure , trust me . <p> Success , however seemingly small at first , has a domino effect so with every small step taken/domino knocked down , the next with fall and the next , leading to greater opportunities and growth . <p> Inevitably as with any journey , mistakes will be made so learn from them , hold your head up high and keep cracking on . <p> 4 . Contact local and national press . Local coverage tends to be easier to get than national so start there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national press but do n't  underestimate the reach local papers and their sites can bring . <p> The Yorkshire Evening Post for example has a huge readership and they often put me on the cover ( something I would n't get with national coverage-not yet anyway ) . <p> National and international press is obviously incredible PR but hard to come by at first . <p> Start local and go from there . <p> Finding journalists email addresses and twitter handles etc online is easier than ever so follow others and drop them a line , making sure you 've thought through your angle and what makes you/you story relevant and engaging . <p> Do n't  pester people but do send a polite email over , secure in the knowledge that everyone needs stories-its how journalists earn their living . <p> You can also search for hashtags on twitter #journorequest . <p> PR is about repetition- reminding people of your name , brand and ethos . Keep getting your work out there . Before you know it , journos will come to you , you 'll be on TV databases and offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to exposure and PR <p> Want to work with brands and get PR from cross promotional work ? Then make videos and write about products and companies you love , tweeting and tagging them when your content is live . Use hashtags and general tags on your site as well as including clear descriptions in the description box on YT to help with searches too . <p> Remember YT is the second biggest search engine after Google and is owned by Google . Do n't  worry about subscriber number , views are more important and as with blogging , consistency . <p> Add links to your own posts which correlate to the videos in the description box to boost SEO and shoot as often as possible . <p> This organic SEO along with you alerting brands of your work via tweets and tagging will help encourage visibility for your own content as they hopefully share to their own followers or at best , can to paid collabs down the line . <p> Once you set up your blog , you might well start being offered commissions and PR exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2010 at a time very few were blogging ( I used to have to explain what a blog was to most people ) yet within two weeks I was offered a paid gig and within 4 , I was a finalist in the BiBs in the Fresh Voice Category which shows you just how quickly things can take off . <p> Do enter awards like the BiBs as this is a great way to garner PR as you feature on lists on their pages and have something to offer journos for a press angle . It 's an annual call to entry so keep going . <p> Trust that talent always rises to the top and within no time at all you can be discovered and importantly trusted by your peers and readers . <p> Just do n't  wait for PR opportunities , go create them . <p> Success happens when you do n't take no for an answer , you keep picking yourself up after every rejection and bravely truckin ' onwards . <p> So become proactive when it comes to getting yourself and your brand noticed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really never been a better time to blog . <p> Vicki writes at Honest Mum .

The men , women and children are crowded round the doorways and leaning in the window frames , all here to see the bloggers who have come to visit . Were here to see the post-earthquake rebuilding project , organised by the Creasion non-governmental organisation and supported by Coca-Cola . <p> I 'm here in Nepal with the drinks company on a #NepalNow project , seeing how Coca-Cola contributing to rebuilding and supporting women with its #5by20 project ( more on which in later posts ) . ( Coca-Cola is sponsoring BritMumss travel , accommodations and other expenses in Nepal . All opinions are our own . ) <p> The women in this poor rural village are in gorgeous brightly patterned sarees , some with coloured string woven into the ends of their long black plaits . Some of the men wear topi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls perform a dance , we hear from a community organiser , who speaks emphatically about the value of the new buildings . She even goes so far to say that for this little community , otherwise unnoticed by the national government , the devastating 2015 earthquake was a blessing in disguise . <p> Community organiser Preeti Tamang ( front right ) with women of the village <p> In less than 18 months , the public-private partnership led by Creasion , an NGO created by a group of under-30s in the charity sector and involving young people , is well on its way to replacing the 55 homes destroyed by the quake . In addition , the project is building a new bathhouse for women . <h> A bathhouse that revolutionises life for village women <p> The bathhouse , called a padhero , serves three purposes . By giving the women a communal building to wash clothes , it provides fellowship and support , a place where they can come share their problems with others while also washing clothes something that Creasion Founder and CEO Aanand Mishra would make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . <p> The padhero also creates a private space hidden from view where women can bathe . As Mishra tells us , in the rural villages of Nepal women often have to wash themselves in public because of a lack of facilities . That can lead to harassment and sexual violence . <p> And by using a water system that captures rainwater and stream water from the surrounding hills , it will allow the women to avoid the half hour walk to fetch water , something they sometimes have to do three times a day . <p> And finally , the Creasion project is also creating toilet facilities in the school , particularly important for girls , who often stop attending school when they start menstruating . <h> Involving the community <p> When we arrived at the village up a steep rutted road in a downpour , the villagers had set up a large tarpaulin for a ritual . A woman anointed our foreheads with red dyed rice and smiling children dressed in their Sunday-best clothes handed each of us a beautiful bouquet of ferns , red carnation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang chimes and sang melodious prayers as we cast flowers and rice into the foundations of the bathhouse and spread a bit of mortar . Building will start when monsoon rains end . Another man lit a small pyre , the ground around it dusted with dye . It was moving ceremony . <p> Leanette from FuntasticLife.com spreads mortar in the padhero foundation <p> Women have been taught to make the bricks used in building the houses <p> The bricks dry for 28 days then they 're ready to use <p> The incorporation of local religion and customs is not just a nicety . By involving the villagers in the project and creating a sustainable economic structure moving forward , this project demonstrates localism at its best . <p> Local women have been taught how to make the bricks , villagers have given input to the architect so the houses suit their needs . Its these activities that will make the project a success , serve as a model for other villages , with the bricks sold to support the village and the larger project . <p> A placade on-site shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creasion is building <p> The same week we visited Bhurunchuli , The Himalayan Times reported that 12,000 earthquake victims of Kavre district received the first instalment of the 50,000 Nepali rupee government relief , for the contruction of houses . Those people will be starting that process . <p> Standing on the hill opposite the main part of the village , we can see the blue roofs of the villagers new houses , nearing completion . They will stand alongside toilet facilities and a building that will transform the life of the women . Even from here , we can see they look like a new beginning . <h> We 'd love to hear what you think about the project !

Tim explains how it all works <p> Book cover : The Glorious Dead by Tim Atkinson <p> There are so many ways of publishing these days it can get a tad confusing . From self- and assisted options , print-on-demand and Kindle Direct right up to the traditional ( but increasingly parsimonious ) deals with a major company , there 's probably never been more choice for the author . But there 's a middle-way , too crowd funding . Specifically , with the world 's first crowd funding publisher Unbound . <p> In case you 've never heard of it , Unbound was founded in 2010 by authors Dan Kieran , John Mitchinson and Justin Pollard . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike a stale and formulaic business-driven venture . Put simply , ' they said , there are lots of potentially great books we 're not getting the opportunity to read . ' <p> As a reader I can certainly vouch for that . When they first launched I clicked to see what the fuss was about and soon realised there were ( potential ) books up for grabs that were never going to appear in Waterstones or on Amazon , but which I really wanted to read . The next step " to pledge , to support them in advance " was obvious . And that 's how Unbound works . Authors pitch their ideas direct and if readers like what they see , they pledge . It 's a bit like buying the book before its published in ( in order to make sure it is ) . <p> But it can be a bumpy old ride , having to market a book before publication . There 's no getting away from the fact that crowd funding is hard work . But it can also be immensely rewarding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real pleasure ( there have been a few exceptions ) and the privilege of having conversations about my book before it 's written is endlessly stimulating . <p> There are drawbacks , as I 've said .

My manuscript was assessed " twice by Unbound before I was allowed to sully their Booker-nominated imprint . But to judge by the reactions of some people ( including a couple of friends ' ) you 'd think what I 'm doing is a cross between vanity publishing and pyramid selling . <p> Well , you ca n't win em all . Except with Unbound , that is .

Its more than about simply eating right . <p> More than 3 million people in the UK are affected by malnutrition , which can lead to muscle loss , less mobility , slower healing , and longer and more frequent hospital stays . Nutrition has real effects for the elderly . <p> BritMums is working is a sponsored relationship with Abbott to be an advocate for nutritional health for the elderly . <h> Becoming frail old ladies for a day <p> BritMums and Abbott Carers got together several bloggers who care for elderly relatives to talk about their challenges with nutrition , get the facts from expert nutritionists and experience what muscle loss is like . <p> At the event , we put on a " sarco-suit " a weighted vest along with ankle and arm weights that makes moving more difficult and everyday tasks more of an effort .

In short , we looked like " little old ladies " . <p> The thing is , we do n't  have to associate old age with frailty . As we get older , our muscles naturally get smaller .

Disease can also affect taste . <p> Because appetites lessen , large portions can be unappetising or off-putting . <p> Food preparation can become an issue with people who are experiencing muscle loss <h> Malnutrition leads to muscle loss <p> here 's a sobering fact : loss in muscle mass begins as early as age 40 . That makes it even more important for the elderly . <p> Even a relatively short period of bed rest ( 10 days ) can lead to 1 kilogram of muscle loss from lower limbs in an older adult . This can result in reduced strength and reduced aerobic capacity .

I am looking forward to spending time with the family . January for us was a little dull and dreary but we did manage to get out and about and get some much-needed Bike practice with the kids . <p> February half term can be a tricky one for finding activities to do , with some family attractions still closed for the winter and the weather being temperamental , but Family Fever has put together a few things that toy can do if you are in the South West of England . <p> For me , nothing beats a nice refreshing walk in the great outdoors as I always find it brings the kids imaginations to life as they race around making up stories and having stick combat sessions . Blog Bay Bee went for a wet walk along Titchfield Canal with her family , Evans Crittens headed to Broad Haven Beach in Pembrokeshire , My Two Mums headed to Upton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toddler friendly walk in the Lake District . <p> The National Trust can always be trusted to out on some great family events during school holidays and their #50things project is a must do for kids under 113/4 , although older children and adults can join in too . Over 40 Mum to One took Monkey to Waddeston Manor and Kennilworth Castle for some outdoor fun . This time of year is also perfect for a snowdrop walk and Mini Travellers headed to Rode Hall and Gardens in search of the beautiful flowers , 3 Kids and a Gluestick headed for Polesdon Lacey and Blog Bay Bee took in the history of Titchfield Abbey . <p> Another popular activity that featured in last months round-up was the Stick Man trail and this month Mummy on a Budget went to Wendover Woods and Parenthood Highs and Lows to Wyre Forest to join in with the activities . Do n't  worry if you do n't  have one near you as Nature Mum Blog made up her own Stick Man trail which looked fabulous and if the Stick Man is n't your thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country Park like Mummy on a Budget . <p> The Coombe Mill family wanted to try something a bit different and headed off to Wadebridge showground for a day at the races which looked like so much fun despite the weather , Dear Mummy Blog went to a lambing weekend at Millers Ark and The Pigeon Pair and Me found some Wilderness in the City by Kings Cross in London <p> If theme park action is more your scene , The Mini Mes and Me spent a family weekend at Alton Towers and enjoyed everything that the resort has to offer , Podcast Dove and Family Fever both recommend Legoland , My Gorgeous Boys recommend Diggerland and we loved Chessington on a visit in November . <p> If visiting animals is more you scene then Monkey World has a fabulous kids go for -1 in half term ( as long as you take a present for the primates ) and the Sea Life Centres have a a variety of events running from Dinosaur Detectives to meeting Timmy from Timmy Time . <p> I hope this has given you some inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about all your fun in next months round-up . <p> If you have any half term inspiration posts , please add them to the linky below . <p> Kara is a busy mother of 6 children aged between 2 and 22 and lives in Dorset .

@@105787139 @1187139/ <h> Review : PowerCube portable charger &amp; USB Hub <p> Bloggers are always attached to their phones and electrical devices which means a need to charge ! We asked blogger Ali Clifford , aka @incredibusy , to tell us her ideas for tidying messy electrical cables , and organising herself so that her mobile phone never goes flat again ! ( a potential nightmare for an epic instagrammer and BritMums BIBs 2016 Choice award-winning writer ) <p> Ali writes : So in an attempt to sort out the nest of wires dotted all around the house , I started looking into ideas on offer for extension leads . Researching on the internet , I found the funkiest alternative to the traditional extension lead " the PowerCube Extension and loads of equally quirky looking gadgets ' in the same PowerCube range , including a Power USB portable more on that later ( needless to say , it 's inspired ! ) <p> Basically it 's a five-way extension lead " six sided cube ( cubes , are n't they ALL six sided ? ! ) which instead of the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute little stylish cube . It comes with a choice of two cable lengths , a generous 3m , or a shorter 1m length . <p> There 's an optional secure mount , which ideally would be screwed to the desk for stability ( alternatively , it does come with adhesive strips if a screwdriver is not convenient for you ) this would be best used if you do n't want any surface clutter " and prefer to have your power accessible to the side or under the desk . <p> The adapter locks to the mount with a twist , so bare this in mind when fixing so that the adapter is in the correct orientation when locked . <p> I totally loved that the design has been well thought through , as each socket is angled at a different orientation to allow for the max number of plugs to be fitted without causing obstruction. ( you know how sometimes you ca n't plug two things next to each other because the plugs are too big ? ? ) Each of the cube units in the PowerCube range are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension unit . <p> Another advantage of the cube extension , in comparison to the conventional strip ' , is that many contemporary devices have short power leads , having all sockets on one cube , can be an advantage . In a compact space , to reach items on your desk . <p> So , back to the OTHER accidental find , discovered on my quest for the perfect extension lead " the innovative PowerUSB Portable , a USB Charger Hub . <p> This is effectively a portable 5000 milliamp per hour mAh battery charger with four USB charging points , which also acts as a hub , so that you can connect multiple devices to a PC , or laptop to transfer data , whilst charging , via a small micro USB cable which is supplied . <p> This is brilliant for client meetings where you need your phone on the desk , and you can charge and use it at the same time ! ( This often happens to me " I travel an hour or so to a meeting , and my phone battery is flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is nowhere near the desk " nightmare ) . <p> Also great for any Apple MacBook users as they only have two USB slots for example " Plugging one of these PowerBank HUBs offers a solution for the lack of USB ports on these contemporary laptops , and means that you can fast charge ' devices , ( rather than trickle charge ' which is how my phone charges when I plug it straight into my laptop ) . AND you can transfer data at the same time , uploading photographs straight from your phone to your laptop for example <p> Because the Power USB Portable comes with a plug , you can also pop it straight into the wall socket for even faster charging . A battery charge indicator light allows you to keep an eye on battery levels " you can even buy Travel Plug extension adapters so you can use overseas too ! <p> Note , you have to wiggle the plug when putting it in , as , from a safety perspective there is a child lock on the socket , so it is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug . These travel adapters are surprisingly affordable at G6.95 for four plugs for mainland Europe , UK , US and Australia . LONG ... <p> With four mobile phone users in the house now ( yep , I succumbed and let the teen and preteen have a phone , all massive instagrammers too ) we often need to charge them all at the same time , this cute little cube is just perfect for that " no squabbling about who used the closest charging point to the sofa " we can ALL use it simultaneously !

@@105787142 @1187142/ <h> Mums in Business Round-up : Decreasing procrastination <p> When Olive started school back in September 2015 I could n't believe my luck . After 8 years of working around small people snatching hours here and there , working to incredibly tight schedules and most evenings . I now had set hours 9:30-2:30 Monday to Friday . My evenings were now my own I could watch TV , chat with Daddy Moo and oh the possibilities ! But in reality I pretty much spent the first school term procrastinating . I actually could n't cope with the lack of structure and hours I had no routine , no plan . Instead of sitting down and thinking " right I 've 2 hours before pre-school pick up I need to do x , y , z " I 'd sit there with a whole day in front of me and find myself overwhelmed and underachieving . I spent time *precious time* procrastinating . My business did n't  grow and I although I had more working hours , I did n't  utilse them effectively . <p> Its such an easy trap to fall into . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working all day . But if we take a step back we can usually see that the 3 hours sat on Facebook whilst it was interesting at the time it was n't beneficial to our business . <h> Clear Your Space : <p> I write about this a lot on Joanne Dewberry because I know this affects me big time . My office becomes a dumping ground during the holidays and I 'm really bad at filing stuff away . Its important to de-clutter your office/workspace . Amanda from VACT has some really useful tips regarding reviewing your physical space and looking at your workflow and patterns . Is everything you need , close to hand ? Do you have designated files and trays in place for all your papers ? Are you printing what 's needed , or just printing for the sake of printing ?

In reality I did . I did n't  set myself targets or goals , without a plan I just squandered my time on short term deadlines . Amanda from VACT sets out a great checklist enabling you to reach your goals . Its important to factor in review dates to see if you are on target to achieve your goal . Make sure your task list is prioritised , otherwise you 'll end up picking out the easy tasks or those with instant gratification , and avoiding those that are more difficult or take longer to come to fruition . *Been there done that* <h> Take A Break or Move Locations : <p> Might sound like you are taking a step backwards in productivity but some of the best ways to fight procrastination is to simply walk away from that task , take a break , go for a walk , move onto something else .

This month however , your poetry and prose sent my brain in all sorts of directions and I could n't tie myself to a single theme apart from eclecticism itself ! <p> For a start we had some wonderful posts inspired by motherhood , beginning with the hilarious Toddler-o ( a Mummys alternative to The Gruffalo ) by Claire at Life , Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claires piece , Laura at Life with Baby Kicks produced its perfect companion The Toddler-os Daddy ( her take on The Gruffalos Child ) " I loved them both .

Funny , touching and bursting with love , its definitely one I 'll be returning to . <p> Moving away from motherhoods humorous side , Becky from Diary of a Fat Bottomed Girl shared a lovely poem Wonder about the way children see the world , and my lovely co-editor Victoria of Vevivos wrote a touching poem imagining her own daughter as a mother one day . <p> The loss of a child is something no parent should ever face , but tragically , all too many do .

@@105787170 @1187170/ <p> The two-woman contest for leadership of the Tory party and Prime Minister between the childfree Theresa May and mother of three Andrea Leadsom provides a unique opportunity to reignite a phenomenon from the Noughties : the " Mummy Wars " . We need to resist that temptation . <h> The Mommy Wars in the UK <p> For those who do n't  remember , the term " Mommy Wars " started in America in the last decade and was adroitly explored in Leslie Morgan Steiners 2007 book on the topic . The UKs " Mummy Wars " emphasized the same differences and tensions between working and staying at home . They drew a hard line between womens various lifestyles , turning these into defined identities that served as a comment on other peoples choices . <p> If you worked full-time , if you used a nanny , if you stayed at home with your children in the heady atmosphere of the Mummy Wars these were all templates : " If you do n't  parent like me , you 're doing it wrong , " was the assumption . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the Mummy Wars waged so passionately then . We look at our own lives and what we 've learned from either having children or not and apply that to others . Its natural to think that the way we organise our lives is the best solution . It is , at least for us . When the opportunity to shout about our choices in the public arena , buoyed by headlines of the latest political row , presents itself , its hard to resist . <h> What it meant for individual women <p> How many times did I have to tread lightly when mentioning my full-time job and my childcare arrangements , just like others were careful when mentioning the decision to breastfeed longterm or bottlefeed or any of the thousands of other choices we make as parents ? Someone might get offended , someone might feel judgedand often they did . <p> Thankfully , that era faded away . Women got more comfortable with their own style of parenting and everyone became more skeptical of an idealised version of " Mother " , either as Working Superwoman or Domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Put two high-powered political women in the news , women who have made different domestic choices , and it suddenly seems that the Mummy Wars could be back in force . <p> Yet the dispiriting way that other MPs on both sides have piled on after Leadsoms comments , via news outlets and in social media , demonstrate that they think Mummy War II is a great sequel . <p> We need to let them know they are wrong . <h> Let 's put a stop to the Mummy Wars <p> Individually we can all do our part . We can be confident in our own choices and support other womens choices , even if they do n't  match ours . <p> We can have sensible conversations about the two women vying to be our next prime minister and not get caught up in this most superficial of identity politics .

I have no interest in the faceless voices on social media anymore as my family mean so much more .

I 'm very annoyed with Ms Leadsom actually for playing the mum card , no matter what she claims to have meant by it . Not only was it grossly insensitive , but its an extremely reductive way of looking at women and mothers . At the end of the day nobody wins with that kind of attitude . <p> Frankly I feel very suspicious of the people currently leading the country , and I would n't put it past them to have cooked this all up behind closed doors . Ugh .

They barely look after one generation let alone plan for future ones . If they did we would have seen this whole aging population thing coming AND proactively done something about it sooner that would n't have seen people working well into their 70s . The main thing wrong with this country is there is never any foresight for the long term and mom pop or no mom I do n't  see that changing anytime soon . The politicians and media are so good at getting good our feathers ruffled about matters that are less important than the state of the country and the real issues at hand .

Hmmm . Both sets of grandparents remained uncharacteristically quiet following our announcement of a holiday to north Africa with our 14-month-old daugther ( Alannah ) . A stoney silence on both sides . <p> Stepping off the plane , the blazing heat practically took our breath away . The air felt thick , the 36 degree heat instantly apparent . We sheltered Alannah from the midday sun and made our way to arrivals . Luckily , we quickly found out travelling in Morocco with a baby is a VIP fast track . The huge queue at immigration became a distant worry as we were escorted by security straight to a fast track lane . Within minutes were through and off on our adventure . Result . <p> Photo credit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car seat ! If you 're a nervous passenger bring one with you , there 's no chance of finding a taxi with one . We did n't  bring a car seat and found the situation fine , but if this bothers you come prepared as you do n't  want to ruin your holiday mood before you 've even left the airport . The driving is erratic , however , the pace is snail like . Donkeys , horse and carriages , men pushing carts , bikes carrying anywhere between two people and a family of five all weave in and out each other . Somehow it just works . Our daughter sat happily , wearing a seat belt , watching the bonkers world around her go by . The roads to our villa across the desert were bumpy and unpaved so the pace of travel rarely moved past sloth-like , which suited us with our lack of car seat just fine . <p> Photo credit : Jessica Brown <p> Accommodation:We stayed in a fantastic private villa , a secluded oasis just 15 minutes drive from Marrakech centre called Fawakay Villas . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Jessica Brown <p> The three-bedroom villa came with high chairs , bowls , plates and baby cutlery , a cot bed with mattress and blankets in our bedroom and sterilising necessities for milk bottles . Our villa Lak Lak had two huge Moroccan baths with glamorous tiling and lanterns making bath-time an adventure for Alannah , every night . She loved it . <p> One of the bedrooms was kitted out perfectly for toddlers/ children with two single beds , games , books , toys , kids DVDs etc . A huge colourful mural covered the entire back wall and paintings by the owners children hung elsewhere . The villa also had a private pool , perfectly shallow for kiddies to play in . <p> Things to know : <p> 1 . ) Pack a travel changing mat There is n't any kind of baby changing in public toilets in Marrakech or in restaurants around the Medina so bring a fold away travel mat for your handbag . Be prepared to change nappies on toilet seats or bathroom floors . <p> 2 . ) Bring a pushchair A pushchair is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorbikes , men pushing carts and random donkeys . The roads were fine to easily push along our pushchair ( we brought a cheap one , nothing fancy , leaving our proper iCandy at home ) . On the first day we used a baby carrier ( we have a BabyBjorn ) . She was too hot and sweaty attached to our bodies in the daytime heat and we worried about her in the sun on our backs . <p> Photo credit : Jessica Brown <p> We switched to a pushchair for all other days out which worked much better . She could relax under the shade and see everything going on ahead of us . We had no trouble with road surfaces and pushchair wheels . Do n't  forget a sun hat and bottled water ! <p> 3 . ) Embrace the locals Alannah got a lot of attention from the locals everywhere we went . They were all singing , clapping , blowing kisses at her and touching her hands and feet . Despite some reports we read we felt really safe with her near the snake charmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locals all showered her with affection , which was lovely . <p> Photo credit : Jessica Brown <p> 4 . ) Bring your own baby food . +appies and baby wipes are fine to get hold of in local stores/ pharmacies however , packaged baby food is n't so easy . I 'm not sure about powdered milk at 14-month-old she was drinking full fat fresh milk we which easy got hold of at our villa . Breakfast was great she loved the mountains of fresh fruit and smoothies on offer , also pancakes , muffins and different fruit breads . But we took enough baby food for lunch and dinner every day . ( Our villa catered for older toddlers/ children with a daily childrens menu . ) <p> 5 . ) Take mosquito repellentIn fact take mosquito everything candles , bite spray , plug ins . The mozzie situation was quite intense . I gave up counting past my 40th bite , the six on my face did little to help my annoyance with the situation .

However , the EasyJet staff were amazing . We boarded the plane first , which meant we had time to faff with our luggage and get settled . They checked on us numerous times during the flight to see if Alannah was OK or needed any water etc . Even though she was not yet 2-years-old we booked her her own seat . Were so glad we did , it made the flight much more enjoyable for all of us . She slept the entire way home from take off to landing . <p> Would we recommend Marrakech to other people traveling with a baby ? Yes , definitely . It was such an experience and a lot of fun .

Its such a relief to know that we are not alone in our parenting experiences , is n't it . I wish I had read some breastfeeding stories before my child was born . The blogs I 'm sharing with you today are all about the beginning of different breastfeeding journeys and I 'm sure you 'll find them inspiring . <p> These blogs are from the 2nd day of the Keep Britain Breastfeeding collaboration last Summer ; so many inspiring and informative stories . <p> The theme for this day especially got me thinking about my babys first latch . It took me down memory lane and got me fishing through thousands of pictures from the previous year . I wish I had thought about it before , I would have savoured the moment even more . <p> Kate from My Family Fever knows what its like to breastfeed a premature baby after a c-section ; definitely not a piece of cake . Its so lovely to read about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They made it through hand expressing , low blood sugar level , sleepiness , latching problems , and finding the right feeding position after an emergency c-section . <p> Another Buns breastfeeding starts were infused with determination , and thrived on perseverance . She was a woman on a mission , with no plan B in sight . The fact that she did n't  get the birth she was wanted drove her even more to make breastfeeding work , twice . Its brilliant to know that she has now trained to support others on their journeys . <p> Hannah from Hi Baby Blog decided early in her pregnancy that her only baby feeding plan was breastfeeding ; and not even an emergency caesarean could stop her . Expecting to succeed , knowing where to get help , and persevering are her top tips for making breastfeeding work . <p> Sian from Quite Frankly She Said did n't  think much about how shell feed her baby when she was pregnant , but that did n't  stop horror breastfeeding stories from being shared with her . An emergency c-section , time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to the development of her knowledge about breastfeeding .

The arrival of her milk was one of painful engorgement , and cluster feeding ; even then , she was at a wedding 5 days later , albeit breastfeeding throughout the ceremony . The resulting lopsided of the demand and supply of breast milk production and cracked nipples were part of the storm before the calm of lovely months of breastfeeding for her . <p> Tanita from Just Motherhood expected to breastfeed and she did . The painful and slow start of her first journey was a launching pad to realistic expectations for her second experience . As with most things in life , the painful moments passed ; giving way to breastfeeding times she will forever cherish . <p> Breastfeeding was n't on Laura from Life With Baby Kicks mind when she first got pregnant , and becoming passionate about breastfeeding was n't on her agenda .

@@105787182 @1187182/ <h> Why your blogs headline is so important <p> Meanwhile , before I confuse you too much , I want concentrate on the most obvious one we all know , recognise and love . <p> Yes , that 's right , the one we type into the headline field at the top of our posts . <p> This is , of course the posts main title . It is the first thing that people see . <p> And not only for your post , but elsewhere too . If you , or some other kind person , were to share your post on social media , what would pop up would be the posts headline followed by a shortened link . <p> here 's an example of this post ready to be shared in a tweet . Clever readers will notice the URL is weird " that is because this post is n't published yet ! I wanted to show you how the headline takes priority . <p> Now I know I have n't written- the most wonderful example of a headline , but I want you to stop and think about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , would anybody click on it ? <h> What kind of headlines do you react to ? <p> I bet they would be ones that promise something fabulous , offer a multitude of relevant tips , answer your prayers , understand exactly what your problems are . <p> That is because they have been carefully constructed especially for you . Their authors have taken their time to try and think like you , their reader , in order to convince , persuade , induce you to click on it . <p> A good headline has many facets , but the most important one is that it offers- something to you , it promises to make your- life better , it tweaks your- interested buttons and it has been constructed with trigger words that have the desired effect " you are compelled to find out more , to read what the rest of the post says , to find out that solution to your problem . <p> Look at your most recent posts headline , and put yourself in your readers shoes . How much does it grab you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does your headline say exactly what 's in the tin ? <h> Headlines should not be set in stone <p> Now you may decide to change your headline during or after you 've written your post , and I suggest that this is a very good thing to do . Your- first idea for a headline should not necessarily be the one you go with . Sometimes the ideas you 've created within your post do n't  match any more , so changing your headline becomes inevitable . <p> Some copywriters spend more time writing- their headlines than they do on the- rest of the content ! This is because they understand the value of the headline and its power of drawing readers in . They- spend a lot of time brainstorming headlines , creating lots of different versions before deciding on the one they prefer . They know that the correct headline could make or break their post , and have a big impact on the numbers of readers and share results . <p> But whenever you change your headline , you need to change your permalink to suit. - For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the automatically generated URL that appears a few seconds after you 've first filled in your- headline , and is created from the words you initially put into the headline field . <p> Every time you write a headline in your post edit page , this action indicates to- the blog you are going to write a post . This means it needs to generate a separate page for that post , which results in that posts page requiring- its own URL . <p> Now its very easy to edit the permalink- if your new headline has become- vastly different . You could use the exact words , or reduce it to the most important words , ideally including the main keyword you 've selected for that post ( if you are up to speed on writing for SEO , which I will post about another time ) . <h> So what about this second headline ? <p> Now that I have touched upon SEO , I cant avoid this mysterious second headline any longer . <p> If you have a WordPress.org blog , you will be able to upload plugins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is WP SEO by Yoast . And underneath the area you write your content , you will find where you can optimise your post for SEO . <p> And one of the- fields provides the SEO Title . This is the headline that is shown in the posts search listing , or snippet . It is created solely for the search engines , so it can be changed to- accommodate the main keyword and to consist of- less than 70- characters , so it does n't  " fall off " the end of the snippet . <p> I 've only changed this posts SEO Title a tiny bit . I spent some- time playing with it , such as trying to place the main keyword at the beginning as that would have given it more impact , but I could n't find a better solution . It does n't  have to- be so persuasive or attractive to my readers , only to the spiders . An SEO Title can be quite dry as long as it fulfils its purpose . <p> And the SEO Title can include extra information , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " BritMums " at the end , which is the best place for it . Do n't  put your blogs name- first , as it is n't as important as the SEO Title of the post , especially since it probably wo n't include the main keyword . <h> Now its your turn <p> The next time you write a post , have a good think about your headline . Do n't  worry about it at first , put in a temporary version and finish writing the content . Then once you 're ready , have a bit of a brainstorm and create a nice selection to choose from . <p> If you 're into SEO , think about how you will incorporate the main keyword you have chosen . Could you place it somewhere near the beginning ? Apparently the search engines prefer this . <p> Write your headline for the benefit of the reader . How will it draw them in ? Does it contain enough interest ? Are you offering a solution or a secret ? List posts are always popular , and relatively easy to write . Also drawing attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And for inspiration , take a look at other headlines in popular blogs . What can you learn from them ? Do you think they got it right , or could you do better ? Do some research into headlines and see what you could learn . To me- this is a fascinating subject !

Perhaps you attend a community bonfire , make a Guy Fawkes or indulge in some tasty treats . <p> For me , 5th November is a very special day . It is the day I became part of the Holmes family . <p> My adoptive parents had two teenage sons and they had always wanted a daughter but were unable to have more children . At the grand old age of 42 , they decided to start all over again and to offer a home to an unwanted child . They contacted the Catholic Childrens Home in Leeds . The staff were so impressed that they wanted to start all over again on the parenting lark in their forties that they arranged a special meeting with the Bishop ! <p> It was decided that as Mum and Dad were that bit older an older baby might be better for them . So they met me and took me home when I was 11 months old . My birth mother had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll to remember her by and I have that doll to this day . <p> Mum and Dad came along to collect me on 5th November 1969 . Mum fed me and apparently we took to each other straightaway . Mum did mention that she could hear a wailing sound but did not work out until later that it was my birth mother . My Mum always wished she could have met my birth mum to tell her that she had every intention of looking after me well . That was not allowed in those days . I understand there is more support for all parties these days . <p> It was dark by the time Mum and Dad took me home to Dewsbury . Mum said it felt like the fireworks were there to mark such a life-changing event for all of us . When I arrived home , apparently one brother took me out to show me off to the neighbours and another helped to give me a bath . <p> All the signs are that apart from a few ill-informed and negative remarks , the community accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with welcome gifts even from the milkman ! <p> The adoption went well . Did that mean my parents were perfect ? Not at all . Would I have wanted them to be ? Absolutely not . They were individuals with good and bad points as was I. Just like in any family . <p> As the years went by people would comment how I looked so like my Mum . Sometimes we would share our adoption story and sometimes we would just smile at each other knowingly . Character and interests wise , I am a mix of my adoptive parents . It is not difficult to work out where my love of learning , my strong sense of social justice or my wish to help the underdog comes from . <p> Every year on 5th November , we would mark the day that I came home and took on my new name of Catherine Holmes . We did this quietly and in quite a private way perhaps sharing a cake and cards or buying each other flowers . <p> Mum and Dad passed away in recent years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I remember , remember the 5th November , I am thinking of Irene and Kenneth Holmes and how they gave me exactly what I needed . <p> An identity <p> A home <p> Love and acceptance <p> Encouragement to learn and to aspire <p> A family <p> For their part , they stated that their family would not have been complete without me and that I kept them young ! <p> You do n't  have to be a paragon of virtue to adopt . You just have to be like most parents loving and trying your best to keep on keeping on through the joys and the challenges . <p> Which is why I ask you to check out the National Adoption Week website and to ask yourself whether you could make a difference to a child who needs a little love and acceptance . <p> Kate Davis-Holmes is a writer and blogger . She is married with 3 children . After obtaining a law degree from Cambridge University , Kate spent 20 years working in local and national organisations .

She has a passion for helping good causes and seeing women get a fairer deal in society . <p> What an auspicious start to your life with your new family ! Anything with fireworks is good , in my book . In fact Bonfire Night is quite simply my favourite night of the year .. It is lovely to read of the deep affection you have for your parents . It sounds as if they would be very proud of you still . I adopted my son ( and met his birthmother ) and people often comment on how alike we are too . Needless to say , my teenager is less keen on hearing this than he once was !

@@105787203 @1187203/ <h> Are you struggling working from home ? <p> Many of us now work at home . Born out of the desire to have more family time and a flexible schedule . One which means we can collect the kids from school and work hours that suit our families . Working from home is a fabulous thing to do , no more long commutes or being stuck in traffic , but it can also be challenging too . If you 're struggling to make your work from home dreams come true , here are some tips to help . <h> Working from home without losing your mind <h> 1 ) Start work early <p> Wake up before your family , especially when you have creative things to do . More routine tasks can be done with half of your focus , but tasks like writing and working on new ideas and projects , are more successful when you are focused on them 100%. <h> 2 ) Dress for the office <p> Clothes play such an important role in how we feel . If you 're working from home in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as productive , as you would be in proper work clothes . <h> 3 ) Schedule and plan your time <p> It 's so important to schedule the tasks you have to complete in any given time slot . Imagine you 're at work with a boss to report to and hold yourself accountable to certain tasks . Also plan the next day the night before , so you can hit the ground running and not waste valuable minutes . If you 're looking for tips to make you super productive and organised , you can still sign up for my FREE 5 day Productivity Challenge ( kicks off 12th September ! ) . <h> 4 ) Create a dedicated office ' space <p> Even if you do n't have an office or a desk , create a little space somewhere to work . Mine is in a certain place on the couch , as I have a unit beside me to store all my paper work . <h> 5 ) Take clear breaks <p> Taking breaks and ideally getting some fresh air , will keep your mind focused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 6 ) Close social media/non essential tabs <p> Multi-tasking is not the way to get things done . You need a strong focus on the task in hand , this means closing all non essential windows on your internet browser . If , like me , the thought of shutting them down to have to reopen then when needed is a pain , you can use use various apps and extensions that temporarily close them , bringing them back in one click ! <h> 7 ) Commit to doing more within your business <p> Parkinsons law states A task expands to fit the time given for its completion ' . When I first read this , it was a huge lightbulb moment for me . The concept is so true , we can do so much if we set our mind to it and commit to it .

If we say we will write two posts , we will do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself to do more , will actually result in more productivity within the same amount of time as you are spending on the task anyway . <h> 9 ) Use a timer <p> Creating mini deadlines putting yourself under a little pressure can be so useful . Try 15 mins of solid work , then 5 min break to do something in your home , 15 mins work on another task , followed again by a 5 minute break and keep repeating . <h> 10 ) Silence your background noise <p> Your environment plays a huge part in your focus and productivity . When I was younger I hated silence . I revised for all of my exams with the TV on , as silence would leave me distracted , almost looking for some noise . Now that I am a mum and our house is never silent , I adore working in silence . So figure out whether you work best in silence or with a background noise , such as music . <h> 11 ) Let go <p> Sometimes in order to give something more focus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do it all .

@@105787214 @1187214/ <h> Summer born babies : School admissions <p> Julie is mum to a nearly 3 year old boy and step mum to an 8 year old boy . Like most parents she finds herself meeting many unexpected parenting issues . School admissions for summer born children is particularly close to her heart at the moment as she is trying to make sense of the current policies and find the best path for her son and for the family as a whole . Read more at Topmums <p> Never did it occur to me when I was told my baby 's due date was the end of July ( in the end he arrived on the 5th August ) that in a few years time I would find myself worrying so much about him starting school . I always imagined this would be an exciting time , and I imagined how proud I would feel of my little offspring trotting off in his uniform on his first day . <p> Back then I gave no thought to the fact that he would be so small compared to a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be three years old when he went for his settling in days ' prior to the start of his first term , whereas some of the others in his class would be about to have their fifth birthday . <p> Apparently my son is termed a summer born child ' ( born between April and August ) , and as it turns out these kids get quite a rough deal when it comes to school admissions . <p> It is general practice in the UK for children to start in reception class of primary school in the September following their 4th birthday . For me , this meant that my son would have only been 4 for approximately 4 weeks when he was expected to enter full time education . <p> Because they are so young when they start school , these summer born children can end up competing with others almost 12 months older than them , and at that age 12 months is a long time in terms of development , both physically and emotionally . <p> Because of this , these summer born children are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are more likely to get bullied . <p> Feeling very unsettled about what was going to happen to my son , I took to the Internet . I have since learned that it is not actually a legal requirement for children to start school at 4 years old . In fact , compulsory school age is not until 5 , and parents have the right to choose whether to send them at age 4 or wait until they are 5 . <p> However , for parents who choose to delay school entry until their child is 5 , schools can then insist that child enters straight into year 1 , missing out reception class completely . <p> So , this is the dilemma that parents such as myself are faced with . Do we send our children to school before we , as parents , believe they are ready ? Or do we wait and send them to school at age 5 missing out an entire year of education ? <p> In fact , there is no actual barrier to these summer born children starting school at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the local council , can make the decision , meaning that depending where you live , the outcome can vary significantly . <p> I have also recently discovered the summer born campaign ' . This consists of an increasing number of parents fighting for the rights of their children to enter school at what they consider a more appropriate age and yet not miss out on that valuable reception year . More and more parents are undertaking a battle with councils and schools to give their children access to the best start to their school life . <p> It has also recently been announced by the government that they will be undertaking a review into the school admissions policy due to concerns over summer born children falling behind and being labelled with special educational needs . <p> What I feel is vitally important is that parents are fully aware of their choices when it comes to school admissions . So many people who I have spoken to about this were not aware that there are any options at all . Personally I am crossing my fingers and eagerly awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future , parents of summer born children will be able to feel excited about their kids starting school instead of worrying . <h> About 104270 @qwx964270 <h> 4 Responses to Summer born babies : School admissions <p> I totally get this because I also have a summer born child two actually , but one is about to start school next year . The reason why I would n't consider keeping her back a year is because I remember the relentless bullying that children at high school were subjected to if they were regarded by the other children as being a bit different because they were a year older than everyone else and had been held back a year . I appreciate that my child may suffer academically and on the sports field but in my opinion it would be worse to struggle socially . I was also a summer child and I struggled socially anyway this is a personality thing , I still do . Had I also been subjected to the bullying that those poor children who should have been in the year above were tormented with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school years at all . I appreciate that having a summer born child and not falling in with the sentiments of this campaign is probably controversial and I may be seen as doing the wrong thing by my daughter but I felt that I needed to share my feelings on it . I really hope that you manage to come to an agreement with your LEA that is right for you and your child.xx <p> Hi Natalie , I do n't  think you can be seen as doing wrong by your daughter as long as you make your choices based on her best interests . We as parents are the only experts on our own children and we are the only ones who can make a decision about what is right for them . As they are all so different , and their circumstances so different , the right thing for one child will not necessarily be the right thing for another . For my son , I believe he would struggle more socially if he were to start school at just turned age 4 as his social skills will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now managed to defer his start in reception class until the September following his 5th birthday . This extra year will give him the time and space to grow and learn both socially and academically . <p> Hi Merlinda , this must be so sad and I completely sympathise with you . However , it does sound as though he has a parent who is understanding of his problems and I believe your support will go a long way towards getting him through these difficult times . A child who is surrounded by people who love and understand them can really help to boost their confidence and self esteem . I sincerely hope things improve in the near future .

@@105787223 @1187223/ <h> Breastfeeding Round-up : Breastfeeding journeys <p> Following on from my collection of responses to last months breastfeeding media storm , Angie from HomeschoolMum Bum reflected on her eventful to uneventful breastfeeding journey . She charted her experience from her teenage mum days , to now as a busy and resourceful , single homeschooling mum of 5 , who is tandem nursing her last 2 children . What a journey she has had , from breastfeeding taboo to the big deal of breastfeeding , to the boring non-event normality of it . I can definitely relate with her take on the normalisation of breastfeeding , though I cant see myself finding boobing talk boring , anytime soon . <p> Jodies ( Wigan Mum ) piece about her gratitude for breastfeeding reminded me of my post about the gift of breastfeeding , part of my breastfeeding themed A to Z Blogging Challenge this month . Even then like many mums , she has n't  found breastfeeding to be smooth sailing nipple pain , nipple eczema , giving up , combi feeding , back to exclusive feeding , worries about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . I am so glad that breastfeeding support worked for Jodie ; what breastfeeding has given her no doubt outweighs the struggles she has had on her journey . <p> Madeline from This Glorious Life wrote a letter to her daughter on the ending of their breastfeeding journey . What a lovely trip down memory lane of sweetness between mum and daughter . There is a way children need their breastfeeding mums throughout the day , but these milk moments are not forever . Even then , it opens up another exciting chapter of a different way of relating and loving between mother and child , mother and family , and child and family . Wonderful , is n't it . <p> Melissa from Beyond Mommying wrote about her breastfeeding pet peeves , likes , and thoughts . I think many breastfeeding mums will relate with the challenge and joys of being the sole possessor of what your baby needs for a significant period of time , day in , day out . It can be both draining and elating , annoying and exciting ; never a dull moment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy Mama Happy Baby wrote about her month-long combi feeding , on her breastfeeding journey . I am pleased for her that despite not having the support she needed , her nipples healed , her perseverance paid off , and she was able to achieve her goal of exclusively breastfeeding her baby . Its good to remember that abundant milk supply does not mean lots of expressed milk as needed . I agree with Julie that breastfeeding experiences , no matter its twists and turns , should be shared without shame or feeling like a failure . <p> Emma at LLM Calling wrote about her breastfeeding grief , 10 years after breastfeeding did n't  work for her . I think we can all relate with the pain of unrealised hopes and plans . Breast is best is a slogan that has the ability to stir up the deepest of emotions , especially in mums whose cup of tea includes breastfeeding . I hope Emma finds her way through her grief . <p> Mo @aNoviceMum is a first-time mother , a full-time teacher , a glass-half-full dreamer , and an eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mum to express herself , and record snippets of her life , thoughts , and times for child . She also desires to encourage and inspire others on their life 's journey . Blogging is one of the gifts motherhood gave Mo and an eye for photography is one of the many blogging treats she enjoys . Mo is always trying to find enough time to do everything on her non-existent and very long to-do list . She finds all of motherhood very fascinating , and ca n't get her head around how so many mothers have more than one child . Breastfeeding is one of her mothering past times , one that has taken more hours of her life than she can believe . <h> 3 Responses to Breastfeeding Round-up : Breastfeeding journeys <p> Great round up ! I 've enjoyed reading about all of these wonderful mamas journeys . Breastfeeding is amazing whether its a short or long journey , easy or hard we all have to stick together and support each other . How horrible for someone to be called bad names over it . Thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  they . We definitely need to stick together despite our different breastfeeding and parenting paths . Its such a shame when some folks resort to name calling when they disagree .

William Gray , editor of 101familyholidays.co.uk picks six destinations that are perfect for a family break in April . <p> 1 . Crete <p> After the wet and dreary winter we 've had , many of us will be desperate to head for the sun at Easter . The Mediterranean will be warming up nicely in April , but the further south you go the more likely you are to bask in sunshine and heat . Crete is a good bet . Not only does it enjoy a fabulous climate , but this gnarled island of mountains and gorges also boasts superb sandy beaches , some fine old harbour towns and , of course , the legendary lair of the Minotaur at Knossos . For independent-minded families , Cachet Travel offers a good selection of villas with private pools , while those is search of a luxury resort will find superb facilities at Daios Cove , including a Scott Dunn Explorers Club for children aged four months to 13 years . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Easter " not the blistering heat you might expect during summer , but ideal temperatures for an activity holiday . Activities Abroad has a great-value seven-night Active Adventure holiday on the beautiful island of Gozo , featuring everything from climbing and abseiling to sea kayaking and scuba diving . It 's perfect if you have teenagers , but suitable for children as young as eight . <p> 3 . Turkey <p> Another hotspot for Easter family holidays , Turkey 's Aegean Coast is the location of one of First Choice 's SplashWorld resorts " a wet n ' wonderful selection of all-inclusive hotels with waterparks either onsite or close by . The Aqua Fantasy Aquapark Hotel &amp; Spa near Kusadasi boasts a range of sports , a kids ' club and no less than seven restaurants . But it 's the waterpark that children ( and big kids ) will make a beeline for . Water slides like the Viper , Screamer and X-Treme will see your waterbabes reaching speeds of 80km/h , while those who prefer calmer waters can kick back in the wave pool or lazy river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ littl'uns . <p> 4 . Morocco <p> Offering good value and fine , not-too-hot weather at Easter , Morocco is just a three-hour flight from the UK . It 's ideal for families who want something a little bit different to a Mediterranean resort . Not that you 'll be left wanting for decent beaches . Morocco 's Atlantic coast has stunning , empty swathes of sand at resorts like Agadir , Essaouira and Oualidia . The surf is also excellent , while other activities range from trekking in the Atlas Mountains , camping under the stars in the Sahara or delving in the souks of Marrakech or Taroudant . Specialist operator Lawrence of Morocco can tailor-make your family holiday . <p> 5 . Wales <p> Sun-seeking at Easter is all well and good , but there 's a lot to be said for staying in the UK and snuggling up in a holiday cottage . Sheepskin has a small , but perfectly formed collection of properties ( sleeping up to 10 ) in locations ranging from the Brecon Beacons , Snowdonia and Pembrokeshire to Shropshire , the Cotswolds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for exploring some of the most beautiful parts of the British countryside and enjoying family walks and other simple pleasures with the kids . Several properties have real wow factor ' " the Red Kite Barn near Builth Wells , for example , is a contemporary , open-plan masterpiece which can be booked with a tree tent ( featured on George Clarke 's Amazing Spaces ) . <p> 6 . Feather Down Farms <p> If the prospect of camping in the UK at Easter leaves you cold , Feather Down Farms has several solutions for keeping you warm and cosy . Firstly , there are the tents themselves " large 45-square-metre canvas creations with wood-burning stoves , oil lanterns and beds piled with thick duvets . Ensuite toilets mean no traipsing outside in the middle of the night , while other glamping ' touches include a sink , dining table and chairs , a real wooden floor and a sleeping snug for kids . Several sites even have hot tubs and pizza ovens . What will really bring a warm glow to your heart , however , is watching your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your chicken coup or help the farmer milk his cows .
