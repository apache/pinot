On top of that , a rejoin-feature to allow players to reconnect to games they accidentally disconnected from , and harsher leaver penalties for players who abandon their teammates . And of course : Galactron himself , who is a giant robot , in space . This update brings a AAA style matchmaking to Awesomenauts , lowering both pings and skill differences in matches across the board . Galactron does this by gathering up players in rounds of about five minutes , and then figuring out how to best group those players across matches . <p> An additional feature is the addition of Simplified Chinese localization .

Today well talk about the removal of the late-joining system , and the rejoin functionality that ties into that . <p> Origins of the Late-Join System An important feature of Awesomenauts has always been the fact that any unfilled slots in a match would be filled by AI-controlled companions , which could be replaced by players as the game progressed . The original idea was that players would never have to wait to start a match . <p> Over the years , player feedback has indicated that many users actually prefered a short wait ahead of matches to try and get all slots filled before the initial droppod ride to the battlefield . As a result of this feedback , we implemented a 4-minute timer ahead of matches after which players can decide to force the game to begin . We continue to see many players wait beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and forcing a match to begin early is generally frowned upon by the community . <p> Always start with a full game When Galactron goes live in Update 3.3 , the new matchmaking system will ALWAYS pair six players together , so matches will always be complete at the moment you transition to the character select menu . This removes many of the reasons for which the Late-join feature was added in the first place , so we have decided to retire this feature when Update 3.3 goes live . <p> Rejoin if you DO disconnect However , a second important aspect of the late-joining feature is to allow players to take over the spot of someone who has either left the match or disconnected for whatever reason . With the new update well start taking more serious steps to combat players who systematically leave games , but well also add a feature that allows you to rejoin a game if you happen to have disconnected from it . <p> If you reconnect within a reasonable timeframe , you will suffer no penalties at all , so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out your ethernet cable there is nothing to worry about . Youll be returned to the main menu if you lose your connection to the game , but once it has been reestablished you can just hit Rejoin and get right back into the game ! <p> Six players start , same six players finish ! Because it is now possible to reconnect to a game , your slot will never be made available to another player , further removing the need for the late-joining system , though a bot will still take over from you while you 're away . <p> Our goal is to facilitate fairer matches by making sure they end with the same six players who started out in it . We strongly believe this will make matches fairer and more fun . <p> We look forward to making these systems available to you in the Public Beta that will commence on July 20th . Of course , well listen to your feedback and improve the system based on that , so please keep in mind that all of this is subject to change . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well go into more details on the punishment that will be applied to players who routinely leave from matches , or repeatedly disconnect from them without rejoining within the alloted timeframe.

@@46333039 @6333039/ <p> I 'm gon na lay down my opinion on the matter of Yuri . It 's not going to be popular , but I think it 's important to establish . <p> Yuri 's old kit was a cobbled mess of failed mechanics . The actual way to play him effectively was absurdly unintuitive and did n't make sense with how his kit flowed on paper . There was excessive , frustrating cheese he could pull in lower leagues . Simple buffs and nerfs rocketeered him between too strong and too weak all the time . Fun , strong , weak , cheesy ; it does n't matter . It was a mess . <p> He NEEDED to be changed . <p> Now , with that out of the way , this was NOT a good change ( *sigh of relief from the Yuri players* ) . I love the spirit ; shifting him to a more solid and logical combat character . It makes him easier to understand and theoretically less frustrating to fight , especially in lower leagues . It 's a noble push , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now it sucks " crowd to dissuade the balance team from trying stuff like this . However , the rework is incomplete and messy . He is way too safe . His mines , being both an aimable 300 damage nuke ( with a sizable range while flying ) that can miss its mark and still potentially hit something , should not have a 4 second cooldown . That 's simply too short for an ability like this , especially when it has effectively no downtime . <p> It also has the very real and less repairable downside of dumbing Yuri down too far . I liked that facemining was strong , high-skill , not cheesy-feeling , and very satisfying . This new mechanic , while it destroys a lot of cheese you can pull and ties his kit together neater , does n't capture any of that . People more qualified than I am have explained this aspect thoroughly already , so I wo n't go too deep , but I will say that even as a casual Yuri player , it 's just not the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something that allows you to brawl in Yuri 's unique method unencumbered while still removing the dead skin cells , as it were . The skin cells I 'm talking about are the massive duration on mines , the fact that you can shut down huge swathes of certain maps by plumping mines in a high-traffic place , and the fact that mechanically , this is encouraged even if it is n't " effective " . It needs to be fixed . I 'm tapped in this regard . I will admit , I 'm not creative or even good enough at Yuri to approach these correctly . <p> So : here 's my plea , put out to all the passionate Yuri players who have been speaking up these past hours : how would you make Yuri less messy while still keeping his general playstyle ? He does n't necessarily need to be easier , just more internally cohesive like this rework is trying to make him . If we work together on this ( and knocking on wood so Ronimo listens ) , we can craft Yuri into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . This is the best opportunity to progress Yuri that we 'll ever see , and I 'd hate to see it squandered by the attitude of " Change is BS , revert it " . <p> I strongly disagree with the randomly-giant text . I think people get confused and think Yuri 's kit is either just passive , unfun area denial or just counter-intuitive non-support brawling . Neither are true . He denied space and used Warp in teamfights which is about as true to his on-paper role as you can expect . He just had some other tricks up his sleeve that gave him more options both in build and in what you can do in a match . <p> Also he was A tier before the early-game rework which hurt basically all late-game Nauts so he was n't alone in that huge balance shift . <p> Tom <p> Post subject : Re : In Defense of Yuri ( And a Plea ) <p> Posted : Thu Jun 01 , 2017 8:16 am <p> Joined : Tue Mar 26 , 2013 6:44 pmPosts : 2615 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nauts least in need of change . His mechanics were largely fair to play against , and his playstyle was unique and fun to play as . Maybe the area control could have used some tweaking , but holy crap not this . Like , there are so many nauts that mindlessly faceroll the keyboard for tons of free damage , and they change *ing Yuri . <p> The only reason he rocketed up and down in terms of balance is because slow bubble had constant base/upgrade issues that made the skill very hard to balance for early vs lategame , which are now fixed . Literally all the naut needed was a bit more mine damage imo . If you wanted to make him a bit easier , I would n't have been against moving the mine hitbox slightly more away from Yuri 's centre to make facemining a bit more forgiving . <p> The current changes are just garbage , forcing him to play insanely safe all the time . Throw mines at range , poke with moving lazer , &amp; never engage because you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As someone who had issues with Yuri in almost every single patch in the past , I do think he received quite a lot of changes that placed him in a good spot in latest patches before the beta . Sure not every new player know how to facemine , but there was sort of a fun of discovery with him , just like with almost any other naut . <p> I 'm not a Yuri main so I 'm not going to vote what direction he needs to go with , but the two fellas above me seem to be much less biased than me and I think you should listen to them . At least Ronimo should . <p> Doppelganger <p> Post subject : Re : In Defense of Yuri ( And a Plea ) <p> Posted : Thu Jun 01 , 2017 10:34 am <p> Joined : Sun Dec 20 , 2015 10:54 pmPosts : 1424Location : C+te D'azur <p> I 'm appaled about the changes that happened about yuri at all , not only being unnecessary , you 're basically removing every single piece of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ted ) . <p> - absolutely revert this new iteration of mine , you 're forcing extremely passive playstyle and not rewarding anymore contrary to what facemine and such was a blast to perform and suceed with- laser change I 'm 50:50 , I could side with it seeing that you took time to nerf upgrades in conjunction with his improved mobility , but you 're atst destroying the 2nd skillfull aspect of yuri here- his new mobility dumb down the rest even more and actually , the only change I at least tolerate ( but was n't placed on the good spot ) is the improved descending while in jetpack , the rest is simply not good at all. - REVERT THIS HP NERF , THIS IS PUTTING YURI DOWN TO C TIER IF YOU KEEP THOSE VALUES <p> Now to try to solve everything at once and please everyone : - revert this new iteration of mine , and make it an option through toaster time- if you 're going to keep that laser mobility rework , do right now fish 's AA rework with a 3 charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making hubble the only damage upgrade- if you 're going for a revert , replace flyswatter with that " improved mobility " and change resonance amplifier , his diversity will be literally non-existent with that route taken- buff in price the AS upgrade on Laser row ( still overpriced as hell : 210 &gt; 175 and even lower please ) - revert the uranium spike change , healingmine were completely fine , this new iteration was completely uncalled for- revert the HP nerf NOW- revert every single mobility change you gave him bar those above , give him a better descending mobility while off-jetpack , make off-jetpack form go through glass-platform and it 's enough- improve if it has n't been done those upgrade : toaster time , space continuity device , chrono rift , banana , flyswatter and resonance amplifier <p> I think I muddied my own point by accident , so let me reiterate myself : <p> This is n't about gameplay . This is n't necessarily about balance . This is about intuitiveness and cohesion . Right now for a new player , Yuri 's kit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see all the pieces , but it 's unclear exactly how it 's supposed to fit . Once you take the time to learn Sanskrit , you realise you 've been holding the blueprints upside down this whole time . What you were doing was taking the pieces and putting them in the wrong way , and now you must go back to the drawing board so you can begin playing Yuri properly . <p> I want Yuri to change , but I do n't want to change Yuri . There 's two options : the first is to translate Yuri to English . That was what this rework did . It can work , but this obviously failed , and all of Yuri 's charm was lost in translation . The second is to make sure that the player is holding the blueprints the right way around . That means getting rid of the parts of his kit that encourage and reward camping and bad play . You still have to learn Sanskrit to know what you 're doing , but at least you 'll already be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's not easy . That 's why I 'm trying to reach out . I 'm so sick of people shunning the idea moving forward with a character , and with smoothing out all the lumpy , misshapen learning curves . I can see a golden opportunity here , if we could just come together with Ronimo 's help , and take it . <p> Since Ronimo does n't know what to do with Uranium Spikes , i would like to see this new mine play style as a form of upgrade , just like with Penny that can switch her brawler AA into ranged AA with an upgrade ( although conditionally/temporary ) Yuri could use both play styles , it does n't have to go , it would give Yuri more options midgame should he find unable to close distance with enemies he can at least harass with small burst of mines since the DPS of the lase would never hope for a more aggressive style without risking Yuri himself <p> I still do n't agree that Yuri 's kit is Sanskrit blueprints . The two abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to learn more than denying space and warping opponents is once you hit L2-L3 where most I expect to just be learning the game wo n't be anyway . This is n't like Sentry teleburst where you 're entirely missing the character 's key strength if you do n't go for facebursting , you 're still applying a large percent of the character 's strengths in matches without the less intuitive aspects . <p> Of course he still has unintuitive aspects like being the only character in the game with a space bar function since Ayla lost hers ' and Max/Chucho are randomly denied the freedom . For the most part I feel his design is more understandable than given credit though . <p> Spare Blade.For the love of God ignore the " manDerp " part of the username . <p> Where Yuri was poorly constructed before was through his useless upgrades . They could have simply revamped a couple of his unused upgrades . They could have added a slow or silence option to mines , or a lifesteal laser upgrade option while removing the bubble lifesteal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yuri was already one of the lowest tier nauts on one of the recent reddit tiering polls and they made him a lot worse . <p> Why would ANYONE choose Yuri over Yoolip right now or with this new change ? <p> fictionarious <p> Post subject : Re : In Defense of Yuri ( And a Plea ) <p> Posted : Sun Jun 04 , 2017 6:00 am <p> Joined : Sat Mar 30 , 2013 11:54 pmPosts : 374 <p> How about we just keep Yuri the way he was , except the following : <p> - No more than one mine out at a time ( at base ) . If Yuri starts to drop another mine manually ( on-key-press-down ) , the previous one instantly explodes . Mine damage blast radius increased to about the blast radius of one of Chucho 's sticky variety . Mines now have a subtle visual indication of their blast radius ( again , think sticky mine ) . New mines actually finish deploying ( are released ) when the key is released . Mines expire after 12 seconds by default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their current lifetime compensate for this major change/nerf ) . <p> The increased blast radius effect will reward Yuris who maintain good map awareness by allowing them to " manually trigger " the older mine that enemies stray too close to , without the enemy actually having to step on it themselves . Since they explode when the key is pressed down , it will allow Yuris to still control where they then want the new mine to be placed , by releasing the key slightly later . <p> The one-mine-out-at-a-time limitation is one that I did not like at first and am still not sure of , but Ronimo seems adamant about this change so I say let 's work with it . I can certainly understand the motivation . <p> - Uranium spikes upgrade now allows mines to be deployed in an arc ( as in the current beta ) . This will allow L3+ plebs to more reliably make use of mines actively without having to learn how to facemine ( at the low low price of an upgrade ) . <p> - Toaster Timer effect replaced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one expires . However , mines will now trigger each other and explode as a set if they are in each other 's blast radius , with enemies no longer taking doubled-up damage if they are stacked . Placing a third mine will only cause the oldest mine to trigger . <p> I think its very important that we " preserve " many of the older and beloved aspects of Yuri , especially face-mining . The base version of Yuri should reward players who have invested the time and experience learning to consistently perform this . For this reason , if there is to be a " slow-down " effect associated with the hold-and-release mine detonate-and-release period ( arc or no arc ) , it should only kick in until after the key has been held down awhile . <p> As for moving while lasering ? Ugghhhh . At least make his vertical and horizontal speeds the same while this is happening . Right now it just feels weird gliding up and down at a faster rate than you can go left or right . And again , consider just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser upgrade instead .

@@46333052 @6333052/ <p> Clunk has some absurdly bad matchups atm ; matchups that essentially totally prevent him from landing any of his explode damage on anyone ( Ksenia and Ted 's ammo-based knockback options are particularly hard counters ) . I think it would be a mistake to give him a CC immunity tool for the entire windup of explode , but the potential rewards for successfully positioning and timing suprise drop-splodes and bounce-splodes against knockback heavy teams should be greater . Clunk is n't coming out of the gutter until we give him either : <p> - an AA/movespeed combination that 's good for more than zoning / extra combo burst- some more balanced tools to more reliably land his necessary damage output . <p> Changing his AA probably is n't necessary <p> Froggy G : <p> Tornado is now a hold-and-release ability with the same base maximum duration as its current base fixed duration ( 1.6 seconds ) . Twister Tweeters only triggers at the conclusion of the maximum duration . <p> Ca n't Touch This effect replaced - Froggy now gains a debuff immunity shield for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now adds 0.8 seconds to the maximum potential duration of Tornado , and adds 0.4 seconds of duration to CTT 's debuff immunity shield if it is also purchased.RBAY 's effect replaced - now reflects 25% of all damage taken during tornado , regardless of source ( 250 solar ) . <p> Same idea for debuff immunity here . Lasting the entire duration would be too much , and putting it at the second half of the skill would n't work well with either Twisters or Bio Fuel Cells . RBAY 's change is admittedly rather big , but overdue imo . The current iteration is simply too swingy and Counternauts-syndrome no matter how much its duration is nerfed or adjusted . This change makes it a less situational and also less offensively powerful upgrade , by sort-of-combining it with the old CTT . <p> Grid Traps and Seige Mode are the names of the ability rows . Catshot / Catling Gun is the name of the AA row . <p> Turret shots visually changed to be cat-like in appearance , similar to Catshot . <p> Traps now fire as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range before becoming stationary and " fully-armed " . If they collide with an enemy before becoming fully-armed , they explode in a medium AoE that inflicts a 1.6 second long 20% movement slow to all affected enemies . If fully-armed , they instead snare a single target for 1.6 seconds . Fully-armed traps have a map lifetime of 10 seconds , but de-spawn by default if another trap becomes fully armed in another location . Cooldown of the skill remains 6 seconds . <p> Split Personality Cat - Catshot cats will split into two smaller cats after impact with enemiesLongcat - increases the projectile range and speed of CatshotKitty Catsuit - increases the damage of Catshot by ( x% ) and Catling gun by ( y% ) Cat Package - increases the fire rate of CatshotFat Cat - adds an explosive cat to your CatshotCat Batsuit - increases the damage of Catshot against enemies that are slowed or snared by 75% <p> Whew . In previous iterations of this overhaul , I had suggested a shorter-duration snare for prematurely detonated traps , but on further reflection I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be either overpowered or useless in practice . Slow CC is a good compromise that always leaves more counterplay open to the opponent without ever being useless . <p> The removal of indefinite debuff immunity is another long-overdue move imo , especially if the stated goal is to promote a more " active " style of play from Derpl . Scaling from 4 seconds to 5.5 seconds still seems very generous considering other duration values in the game , but in practice ( like every proposal in this list , ultimately ) could be adjusted as beta testing dictates . <p> Dinos now deploy one at a time , rather than all at once ( deploying them is now comparable to firing Voltar 's suicide drones , or firing Ted 's shotgun - they have a base rate of regeneration and no other cooldown ) . Yoolip carries a maximum of 3 dinos and constructs one new dino every 5 seconds of inactivity ( not using skills ) . Egg Hatcher increases max dino capacity to 4 . Will probably require major dino DPS / upgrade adjustments . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both less utterly predictable and less annoying . There 's probably many ways to do this , but personally I like these changes as a starting point . Damage values and other properties can be adjusted as necessary . <p> Sentry : <p> Black Hole shield is now a channeled hold-and-release ability with a maximum duration of 2 seconds ( AA still allowed while channeling ) . Black Hole shield no longer has a maximum health value , just a maximum held duration.Black Hole Sun now becomes available for firing a fixed time ( 1.2 seconds ) after the end of the shielding period.Black Hole 's Sun 's duration now scales with the amount of damage absorbed by the shield . Minimum duration is 0.5 seconds , maximum is 1.5 seconds.Night Vision Spywatch effect replaced - reduces the firing delay for Black Hole Sun by 0.6 seconds.Microfilm reduced to two stages of +7.5% . <p> Assuming Black Hole Shield is channeled for 0.8 seconds ( the duration , for comparison 's sake , of Ix 's refract , which grants total damage/CC immunity ) , Black Hole Sun becomes available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds of telegraph period . This seems appropriate given its current constant 2-second shielding period , because I do n't think Black Hole 's " net " power level should go up or down much . But the shield in particular seems like a prime candidate for joining the hold-and-release club . <p> The BH Sun duration scaling makes Black Hole simultaneously a less oppressive base CC and a more reliable base damage-dealing tool at lower damage-absorption values - an earlier detonation means both less time to escape the minimum damage , and less maximum time in the gravity field overall . <p> Nibbs : <p> Fire Breath is now a channeled ability with a maximum duration of 1.5 seconds.Sunscreen Mouthwash reduced to X seconds of +100% movespeed , where X is the time spent in Fire Breath.Teleporting via Orb of Omicron no longer possible while snared ( technically still possible , but Nibbs will not move ) . <p> Not many changes , but a nerf to Orb of Omicron and its interaction with snares . No other naut can negate the snare CC as consistently and effortlessly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum duration reduced to 1 second . Knockback and damage of charge cut in half , tickrate doubled ( what is currently in beta ) . Danger Pins only triggers if the full duration of charge is expended . <p> LUX 's charge should be made more consistent ( and less absurdly punishing ) as a pinning tool , and the current beta changes seem aimed at goal . The price needs to be a drastic and long-overdue maximum duration reduction . <p> Max Focus : <p> Scene Illumination is now a channeled hold-and-release ability with a maximum duration 1.5 seconds . Brutalities of the Kraken Unveiled - adds a final projectile that deals bonus damage if Scene Illumination reaches the end of its maximum duration.UFO spotted at Starstorm Station ! effect replaced - enemies damaged by scene illumination take amplified damage ( 8% ) for 3 seconds . <p> The year is 20XX .

What that looks like in the end will have to be determined by playtesting . Pretty much all of those Derpl changes are prescribed for the purposes of making his playstyle more active ( I believe the same justification has been given for many good changes to Gnaw - not to imply that their situation is identical , but the spirit of the effort is the same ) . <p> Gone are the days when Gnaw could grab hold of a position and maintain it indefinitely via permanently existing mini-turrets that melt whatever they see . So it begs the question : why does Derpl still have so many crutches to help him accomplish the same exact thing ( total positional dominance ) ? <p> Namely : a huge health reserve , amazing single-target DPS and AoE Burst potential while sieged , area-control ganking tools with durations that can exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of time modifiers , as far as I know ) ? <p> The answer is simple : His passive-use benefits have to be through the stratosphere because his active-use benefits are practically nonexistent . But that makes for terrible overall balance : it 's what makes him a " counter-or-be-countered " experience . <p> So the solution , from my point of view , is straightforward : we get rid of the crutches and we give him an actual active tool ( analagous to what the placement damage buffs did for Gnaw ) . But hopefully all of that is where we already agree . <p> Tom wrote : <p> I do n't get what you mean with this . Nukes animation is a constant 0.75sec long already . <p> I took Derpl for a spin recently - as soon as you seige , nuke is available immediately , while an approx. one-second deseige cooldown begins . My suggestion is to simply make nuking an option at the same time as de-seiging becomes an option - might as well make them both 3/4 of a second , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can keep the animation delay because I somehow guesstimated its exact value perfectly . The only real point being that Derpl ' deserves ' to land nukes on things that walk into fully armed traps , not so much on the things that he shoots with a basic projectile ( that 's what Bat Catsuit is for ) . <p> I also want to provide some justification for the idea of making all of these other skills into hold-and-release abilities . Take tornado for example . <p> Which would you say is harder to do ? A. Land every tick of tornado damage consistentlyB . Land just the last tick for tweeters damage consistently <p> Personally , I 'd say A is a lot harder than B. Landing tweeters ( even with a tornado of fixed duration ) is , in many cases , simply a matter of activating the skill a bit earlier than you otherwise might , and timing your first contact with the enemy accordingly . Between boombox and tweeters , tweeters is ( imho ) the lower skill-floor ability . So tweeters belongs further up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , easier to execute . Boombox has the higher ceiling , so it gets moved later down the row . <p> It then occurs to me that there is n't any real reason we should n't have the option to simply end tornado prematurely - any time you do , you are necessarily giving up some damage potential , so it is a trade-off . Is it an even trade-off ? Probably not . Being able to ' cancel ' tornado to utilize dash is definitely a pretty massive benefit . But I do n't think it would be all that drastic a change . <p> Duralumi <p> Post subject : Re : A short list of ideas in the form of hypothetical patchn <p> Posted : Sun May 28 , 2017 10:15 am <p> Joined : Mon Aug 13 , 2012 10:42 pmPosts : 2780Location : United Kingdom <p> Derpl should NEVER have projectile traps.They 'd just enable him to move his " space " forward bit by bit with little risk .

In that universe , the alternate version of me is arguing that all skills that are intuitively continuous should be hold-and-release , and the alternate version of you is arguing that that kind of change would make LUX OP because it would " make him even safer " and " it would just be a meme strategy " . My position is simply that giving players more options makes for a funner , deeper game than giving them less . If certain upgrades have to be adjusted to compensate for the lowered skill floor , so be it . <p> GuyBrush wrote : <p> : fist : - This idea is ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons in TF2 so I do like the idea , but I think it 's in the wrong place and also on the wrong character .

Suffice it to say that I think 4.0 is one of the best patches yet . What were the critical improvements ? Critical improvement #1 has been the armory tab . There is finally something to DO while you wait 3 minutes for a match . Even if its just listening to themes and looking at stats , that 's infinitely better than before . With queu times ideally likely to drop even further once we go F2P ( thanks to more players , hopefully ) , that 's critical improvement #2 .

When I go to the armory tab to look at nauts , I am looking for something a little more comprehensive and all-in-one . I do n't want to have to arrow back and forth between different screens to witness the glory of the full cast . Something more like the " progress view " ( or the naut selection grid ) should be the default . Then when you click on a naut it can take you to the same **32;122;TOOLONG menu . <p> Speaking of , there does n't seem to be much of an order to that menu .

@@46333093 @6333093/ <p> New MatchmakingIn order to improve the overall experience , we 've completely rebuilt the matchmaking system from the ground up . The game will no longer require you to maintain a non-stop connection to the Steam servers , which will ensure you do n't disconnect from a match if the Steam servers go down for a second or two . Matchmaking is entirely handled by our own tech , and we 've fundamentally changed the matchmaking flow . Players will now be matched all at once every few minutes , rather than be assigned to the best possible match that already exists . <p> Persistent Party SystemAn overhauled party system will allow you to team up with your friends more easily , and manage your invitations without hassle . Players who have teamed up will now automatically stay together once their game has finished . For more information about the persistent party system , please check out this blog post . <p> QueueWhile queued up for the matchmaking system , players are able to freely navigate the menu , chat , and watch replays . The only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering a different match . <p> RejoinPlayers who disconnect from a game will be able to reconnect to their match from the main menu . For more information on the rejoin system , please check out this blog post . <p> Removal of Late-JoinAs a result of the Rejoin system being implemented and the new matchmaking system ALWAYS starting a game with a full set of six players , we are retiring the late-joining feature . <p> Leave PenaltiesPlayers who leave or disconnect from a matchmade game and do not return within the allotted time will receive additional punishment . They will be locked out of the matchmaking system for several minutes and have an abandon ' added to their track record . Repeatedly abandoning matches will result in increased matchmaking lockouts . Leaving a match during character selection will immediately result in an abandon , and returns all other players to the main menu . These players will be automatically entered back into the queue . <p> Safe to Leave ' StatusIf a player has left a matchmade game and has n't returned within several minutes , other players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL receive a loss and have their matchmaking rank affected as a result , if their team ends up losing the game in their absence . If all players in a team have left the match , the remaining team will automatically win shortly thereafter . <p> Match / Lobby &amp; Party ChatJoining a party or a match will now automatically add you to private chat channels that are only accessible to players in your party , team , or match . The chat feature is now available in character select . <p> Character SelectThe Character Select screen has been overhauled , and should provide more relevant information about characters . You are able to cycle through backstories , available skins , announcers and skill descriptions in the bottom-left corner . The game will remember your recently played character , and will have this selected as the default for your next game . <p> Fanart GalleryWe have added a fanart gallery to the main menu options .

I thought I 'd make this post to let anyone who does n't know , know , that the Yogscast have been doing their annual charity streaming event , and will continue to do so until December 31st . <p> Reason for bringing this up is that not only is it a great effort for charity , but you can help raise money by using their Humble Bundle page here . At the moment you get 14 games total if you pay $30 , and you will receive every other game or set of games revealed until the end of the event . In total , it 's looking to be 50+ games , for the grand total of $30 ( or more if you want to really help charity ) . <p> As well , their streams are on www.twitch.tv/yogscast . If you 're not the biggest fan of the group themselves ( I do n't watch them as much as I used to but there is undeniably some entertaining Christmas streaming content ) , fair enough . I do know that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs later in the month , where other YouTubers/streamers ( Past occurrences have included Boogie2988 AKA Francis ) fill in . <p> Overall , I wanted to make this post to bring people 's attention to the event , as I figured there might be some people who want a good deal or to help charity or somethin ' . I du n no . <p> Also , one last note , I just learned that some game keys are limited availability so after 50k purchases ( It 's at 36.3k at time of writing ) , you may not get everything listed . So it 's a good idea to take advantage of it fairly-soon and contribute some cash to charity , getting some great games in the process ! <p> Also , for those unfamiliar with Humble Bundle or charity donations ( who actually want to be charitable ) , you can customize which charities donations go to when you select how much you want to pay . There 's a section that let 's you choose . <p> So yeah . Enjoy , everyone . Hopefully some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give something back . <p> You just read an ArmorendG brand post .

' on the whole dopamine rush thing . <p> And that does n't even touch on the principle problem with the XP system that it introduces another layer on which your team as a whole could be losing ( or winning , admittedly ) , and even though it 's allegedly been tuned enough to prevent these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really does n't seem like it accomplishes much other than introduce needless complexity to a once relatively simple game ( nevermind that even before all these things ' Nauts was already fairly complex , like in the 2.6 times ) . <p> And of course there 's still the age-old problem that , apart from me being in the oh-so-lucky position where I have to unlock upgrades for a bunch of characters still for the time being , there is nothing to do in this game ( apparently not even climbing the leaderboards is a possibility anymore ? I 've read something about how that has not been reset in forever. ) ' in the long-term ' - nothing that would keep people sticking around for more than just one or two matches after a new update . And hell , not even those seem to excite people anymore either if ' Nauts ' Steamcharts page is anything at all to go by ( apparently Galactron attracted like no people at all ? Hilarious , to be honest ) . <p> And that really seems to be the thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awesomenauts in general - I mean , it is a four-year-old indie game , and one that was never exactly popular to begin with except for very brief periods of time in very specific circumstances . People 's opinions probably got tainted by all these problems ( that it seemingly still struggles with ) , and short of something drastic I doubt it 's gon na change - there simply is n't like " that one thing " that will suddenly attract a humongous playerbase which will also happen to stick around for longer . I 'm half-convinced that Ronimo could put out another ten characters , two new maps , and provide full VR support and the playerbase would still casually float in the 100-600-strong limbo it 's been in since pretty much forever . I know it makes me sound extremely pessimistic and cynical , but I do n't know how else to see it . <p> What would it take to revitalize it , then ? Hell if I know , but I really do think that it has to be on the scale of either a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after installing all the frameworks necessary to make sure it 'd actually have a chance to survive and thrive as such a title , such as the aforementioned " thing that keeps people coming back for more " ) - an Evolve : Stage 2-type treatment , which is kind of a mix of the two above ( though Evolve 's playerbase once again plummeted after re-release and is now even lower than Nauts ' , so make of that what you will ) <p> I just do n't think there 's precedent for a game with a playerbase as low as this suddenly making a comeback and re-establishing itself without using one of those big measures , and I do n't even know if Ronimo has the manpower/budget to actually be able to afford to go through with any of those . <p> I mean , sure , on the whole Nauts was never a terrible game , and it 's pretty impressive that even so many years after release it 's managed to retain a relatively stable playercount - there 's probably dozens of games on Steam that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on a semi-consistent basis.But it 's clear that it could have been better - the game did have several thousand concurrent players at more than one point ( even this year ! ) , so it 's not like it was always bound to be a &lt;1000-players game . Especially not for a MOBA that pretty much depends on having a large and stable playerbase . <p> At this point I do n't know what I 'm even talking about anymore . Maybe I 'm being too hard on a game that I did ultimately spend 1314+ hours on ( something that really does n't happen on accident ) , maybe I 'm being a little nostalgic , maybe it 's something else.Maybe I 'm not even saying anything ' new ' anymore . At any rate , I do n't expect people to come into this thread saying " Oh * Maks , you 're actually right . " . For all I know I 'm completely wrong and ' Nauts is actually doing great , but again ... <p> I 'm not sure if that 's indicative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ix ' " Unchecked privilege coming our way " line is ( still ) in the game .

Like hello now , I 've been asking for that for literal years by now . <p> Q1 2017 marketing rush sounds like it 's in the plans by Ronimo if reading their internship offerings was anything to go by . <p> Also muddied numbers from EXP are eh but they 're not that problematic . It 's more so an issue that the team is being forced into more and more of an amorphous blob with all the power shifts from individual play into team play . I 'd rather strong individual choices like what items offered than being handed my power increase on a platter .

The game is indeed not in some golden age of popularity and is unlikely to be , because frankly it 's an indie MOBA which 90% of the time just plain fall into obscurity in less than a month and this has been trucking on for quite some years now . Whether you feel it 's destined to burn out or to receive a sudden kick in the form of fundamental changes like F2P or whatever else , it 's pretty clear this game was actually really successful overall . <p> The game is a bit less involved at the moment . Part of that is that an entire Match Making System took so darn long to make and no attention went into the game hype for a while . At this point , it all depends on the effects of the " Big Thing Coming 2017tm " <p> Left like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion.Dark/Maks , I think you need to decide if you 're playing this game or not Feels like you 've become Schrodinger 's player at this point . <p> I 'm sorry , but how about you try to completely purge a video game that you were totally obsessed with at one point and made some amazing friends as a direct result of from your memory ? : pI do n't know what it 'd take for me to completely forget about ' Nauts short of some sort of traumatic event that 'd make me completely disgusted to go anywhere near it , which ... I 'd say is pretty unlikely to actually happen.But you never know .

Awesomenauts Overdrive really could have been a good name for what I 'm talking about , but they used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same great art-style and whatnot , but it would be a new Awesomenauts game packaged with maybe a few new characters , the remastered sprites for old characters , an improved engine and matchmaking system/netcode , a better level up system with the upgrade unlocks just done away with and replaced with just character unlocks as you level or something like solar currency ( see Street Fighter V ) that can go toward cool medals , DLC characters and alternate versions of stages ( such as night time Ribbit IV or Sunrise Aiguillon ) , and character skins or something . Could even incorporate a daily reward system like Smite if they want . Maybe the currently released DLC characters could just be in said new game at base so that it 's not plagued by day 1 DLC characters . <p> Of course , all of this is much easier said than done so it 's understandable why they would n't .

Whether they still get a rating loss or not I think is undecided ( likely to still count as a loss if you leave ) . <p> Also mah god the host migration . It 's soooo much faster and more stable than before . Even with botching up our connections a tonne ( using some hacky connection breaking tool ) we struggled to actually shut down the match or have a host migration fail ( I think it did at one point ? But that caused only a single player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless ) .

When you click a character ( but not locked into it ) you will hear their theme play and it will continue to do so until you either change your selection or the match begins.Should also mention , your selected character and your selected skin from the previous match are now memorised and will automatically be your default selection . <p> The game now actually tells you if there 's something likely to cause a connection issue , such as for me it said UPnP failed to connect Awesomenauts through a specific port , told me which port exactly , and a link to more information about port forwarding . Super useful for anyone who has a poorly set up internet for the game and needs to see what is and is n't there for the game to work , without needing a Technical Support equivalent of Sherlock to work it out . <p> You can watch replays , talk to your party or on the global chat , change settings , and view your in-game profile all while waiting for a match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with waiting for 0-3 minutes.If you alt-tab the game will still notify you when you get put in a game , of course . <p> The menus are much prettier than before in general . They feel smoother , they feel cleaner , and overall I really like them . <p> Now onto the things I do n't like Of course it 's all subject to change and I am reporting every single minor gripe and major issue I find to Ronimo , but I am just posting my current thoughts . <p> While connections overall seem more stable and games manage themselves better , there does seem to be a lot of issues with how parties currently function and the matchmaking itself . We managed to cause a 4v2 match with some developers purely by going into the matchmaking as a party of 3 , and parties seem to currently be responsible for some crash errors . Party set-ups are very nice and maintain your group across the matches but right now they need more bug fixing . <p> The settings menu , while it 's cleaner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sliders lack any explicit indicators and some settings are not exactly clear whether they 're on or off , and the audio slider for the announcers bugs a tiny bit . <p> Bots seem to have encountered hard times this beta . A bot had it 's name broken , if a player leaves a bot seems to take that player 's name and adds " ( bot ) " to the end , but then gets to the shop and instantly gets a new name Not to mention how Derpl bot seems to be bugging now due to the recent nuke changes so he wastes his nukes repeatedly . Although on the bright side I heard bots will likely be seeing some changes this patch too <p> Fan-art showcase seems flat out gone , at least for now . I can see where they likely will put a new showcase ( giant empty space on Main menu . hint hint ) , but for now it 's gone . <p> The " Add player to party " button is a couple of pixels unaligned from the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ever and needs to be fixed so damn fast you 'd think Joost was thrown into the Large Hadron Collider ! 
@@46333128 @6333128/ <p> Purpose of this thread is just a general request of what kind of things are in store for Ted , or what kind of problems he has . This is because back in the last casual SnS2&amp;'Nauts stream , there was a Q&amp;A and this was the answer to whether there 'd be any Ted changes . <p> " 2:16RonimoGames : ted needs a lot of changes , i need more time with him probably with patch 2.11 " <p> So I 'm just kind of asking , and if it can be answered , what kind of problems he has and/or what changes are in store for him ? <p> People are suggesting putting air strike on shotgun and stimpack on machine gun , due to those abilities being more synergetic with the opposite weapon . ( Is synergetic a word ? ) <p> All in all I did n't think ted needed changes , but apparantly I 'm wrong ! Mind you , I 'm the guy who picks up grenades on shotgun . Cause they 're fun , and the only reason I use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would like it to remain the way it is , if that idea of boosting Shotgun 's base Attack-Speed were to get implemented . Shotgun is easier to hit all your shots compared to Machinegun ( 4 cone-hitbox-y shots with super travel-speed with good intervals compared to a stream of fire ) . If SG 's DPS were to be tied with MG , people would prefer to more often use SG with Stimpack rather than MG . <p> If it does n't then I guess I 'd be okay with changing which mode has which ability , since MG tends to be the main and general damage-dealing mode versus ' nauts currently rather than SG .. <p> But , as to claiming that " this is likely , " I 'm not sure . Pretty much conjecture at this point until we get a word concerning what I 've said in the OP from a team member . <p> ( Also , I take grenades too . They actually are decent and fun , but could be appreciably buffed a tiny bit IMO . ) <p> There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he certainly could survive in his current state . I 'm also rather confused why Ted is considered high priority atm . He 's fairly balanced despite some of the remnants of the mess that was release ted . Only thing I think is needs changing is grenade pour homme 's radius is too large/undo the buffs to it , it 's kinda silly in it 's current state . If I had to give a full list of things that " would be nice " for Ted though : <p> -Airstrike row costs are a bit iffy. -Airstrike damage could use centralizing , it 's very hard to not stack damage atm . Do something like +20 a stage to wheelbarrow and DoT down to 150 dot , cost per damage on both upgrades can remain similar. -Rest of airstrike row is OK , there are more interesting rows but it 's far from a bad upgrade row , few number tweaks and it should be in a decent spot . <p> -Stimpack could use more duration at base and the upgrade lowered . Stimpack is weak at base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration. -Angel wing toilet paper . No longer reloads shotgun . Firing shotgun no longer costs ammo whislt stimpack is active ( basically infinite ammo ) . This is the one thing I just had to put out there . It gives more ammo , less reliant on burning all your ammo before stimpack and fits nicely with stimpack 's steroid theme . Ronma pls. -I do n't like grenade , I 'd prefer something new but at the very least , undo it 's buffs/nerfing it 's radius would be nice . Too reliable for that kind of stun duration . <p> -AA row bar figurine is pretty all over the place . Range is soo good , tedris and figurine are in an ok spot , the rest is " wtf is this * " levels of useless. -My only comment will be on UKD . I think it should be +50% shotgun damage per stage and have slightly less arming time on the grenade . <p> Airstrike row definitely needs *minor* tweaking . I generally agree with what Zardoz has touched upon it in a Ted-thread before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed and we 'd be better off with a normal cooldown upgrade <p> hamburger phone:buff it to 200/stage , make it heal ' nauts only , and prevent it from healing targets who are at full health <p> ... <p> Airstrike:Deals 75% damage to droids.Stealthy Ninja Weapons is now +125 DoT/stage.Wheelbarrow with Ammo is now 2 stages of +100 damage to all targets.I-Don't-Carebear stun duration increased to 0.7 seconds.Double RPG is now 2 stages of -1.5 seconds cooldown for 150 solar.Hamburger Phone is now +200 healing per stage and no longer heals targets at full health , but can only heal ' Nauts . <p> I do n't want to give Airstrike that much damage . If I 've read it right , you want Wheelbarrow with Ammo to be 20 per stage ( and using old numbers ) , so WwA potentially offers 600 damage ? <p> The way to solve damage-stacking seems to be to make the other options stronger , like Skolldir 's row as an example . Zardoz 's ideas make the damage upgrades compete a bit more with each other , and gives each upgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger and a cooldown of 3 seconds total seems perfect , as 2 may be too little , and 4 may be too much . Make Adlez also cheaper , as it 's rather expensive for a questionable payoff . Something like 135 solar ? Airstrike also misses often due to its delay , which makes it an unreliable damage-dealing ability , but its AoE , zoning , " immediate-ness " and global presence along with the good damage or utility it provides balances it . <p> Agree on Stimpack needing slightly more duration to be just right . It 's actually good on base when used right , honestly , but 3 seconds feels a tad too little , and upping it to 4 and removing a stage of Personal Assistant ( Duration ) feels like one good way to go around it . <p> I love that AWTP idea . Would love it if Shotgun never gets its base Attack-Speed buffed . Would not , or find it very questionable at least , if it did . <p> I prefer if Grenaide was completely changed to a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help with cheesing Airstrike 's balance and making it too reliable as a source of damage . It 's delay is what balances its potential and global presence . I think Airstrike 's arming time is 0.8 seconds , so if *absolutely* necessary , reduce it by .1-.2 , but I 'd prefer not at all , if we really think its damage-dealing reliability is an issue , and not hinge boosting it on an upgrade on Stimpack 's row . Also he has potentially a stun on both his abilities , and with DRPG , two stuns on Airstrike . That 's possibly rather much . My idea of changing Grenaide is to change it to a sort of " war cry " that boosts the power of allies by 10-15% ( via a blue sword on their head , like Spoonman ) if they 're near Ted for the duration of Stimpack , as an example . Just something that has its own due usefulness , strength , and does n't interfere too much with Airstrike( 's balance ) . <p> Agree on AA row , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his abilities is n't that large . Range is amazing because MG is good , and SG is n't that good . KB and Range are most often picked up because they are the strongest upgrades on his row besides the of-course mandatory damage . It 's better to try to bring the other upgrades up to par . Grenades are actually decent , but could appreciably become 125 per stage with a small lifetime buff . Teddy 's Bullseyes is only bad because SG itself is n't up to par . Just as Range boosts all-around MGing , Bullseyes is the upgrade to boost all-around SGing , but SG is slightly under par , and so the upgrade itself is under par . Tedris , I 'd like it if it scaled in damage based on distance travelled . Right now it 's good at the very early-game , but quickly falls off and just slowly becomes a tickle , and helps somewhat with jungle-control . <p> Edit : Hm , I 'm just sort of doubtful and want clarifying on your Airstrike suggestions ... WwA currently offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm guessing 200 by translating old-number usage to new ? And then you say bring DoT *down* to 150 ? .. And I almost never take DoT . I find just WwA mandatory and do n't damage-stack , as I find the other options equal to stronger . I 'd much rather have stun and Adlez/Hamburger Phone , for example . DoT shines early-game but is n't that superior to the other upgrades . Damage-stacking actually is n't that much an issue with Airstrike IMO . <p> Edit : Hm , I 'm just sort of doubtful and want clarifying on your Airstrike suggestions ... WwA currently offers 80 per stage and you say change to 20 , so I 'm guessing 200 by translating old-number usage to new ? <p> Nah I mean add 20 damage per stage , so it goes from 80 per stage to 100 per stage , gaining 60 damage total . Then make DoT 1 stage of 150 and cheapish , losing 50 damage . It 's a gain of 10 damage when stacking , but also just puts all the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mandatory atm ( mainly due to costs ) , but I think the non-stacking builds could do with hitting a bit harder . Du n no if DoT nerf is necassery , it 's more to keep the max and damage scaling the same so it 's not going too far with changes accidentally . If nobody takes it , revert the nerf . Also Double RPG might need an extra -50 damage with this change to take it back to it 's current values if it 's hitting too hard . <p> LoneGaruga wrote : <p> Agree on AA row , but not to that degree . <p> I 'm pretty much agreeing with you though . I 'm just so used to being all " small changes " n ' stuff that those sort of changes are huge to me . <p> Very good changes to Max , you 've taken modest compromise approach to balance many of his upgrades , which is probably the most reasonable thing to do . <p> The Blanket <p> Post subject : Re : General idea of changes in store for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8:25 pm <p> Joined : Tue Nov 06 , 2012 5:45 pmPosts : 948 <p> why would you change stunpack when it 's one of ted 's new staples and literally the only reason to pick up stim early ? It also solves a ton of his bad matchups further influencing his buys against certain powernauts currently . <p> As a Ted main I must say:1 . His basic attack upgrades ( mostly ) only apply to 1 of his auto-attacks . This makes it very one-sided which gun you are going to use for the rest of the match , as they are both very similar and do n't bring you much of a reason to use one instead of the other , if one is weaker.2 . A whole upgrade that gives his shotgun 1 more ammo . SUCH WORTH MUCH WOW RIGHT ? It 's not even worth the price , which is pathetic for how little it costs.3 . Airstrike should be on the shotgun while stimpacks are on the machinegun . Like a lawt of people are suggesting . I really think this would encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as they love airstrike ) .

@@46333140 @6333140/ <p> We 've known that Fabinaab has been working on Ted McPain since before the Kickstarter was funded , it makes sense that there would be some working form of him in Ronimo 's system by now . <p> The more interesting thing is that when Tim was cycling through the Nauts when he was trying to play as the Solar Boss , I think he scrolled through Ted McPain 's pre alpha form , I think there was some AA artwork I did n't recognise . <p> Sometimes if you want to test if something 's fun , it 'll be made on him .

@@46333145 @6333145/ <p> Lore : Deep beneath the surface of the planet Ill'goth lays a rich solar concentration . The Awesomenauts will have to battle it out underground all while dealing with GIANT SPIDERS if they want to take home the solar . This map greatly stresses the importance of staying in lane as the space between the two IS HUGE and there wo n't be jump pads conveniently in the middle for you . <p> Legend : <p> - Grey dots : 1 solar coin. - Green dots : Health Packs- Grey rectangles : Fall-throughable platforms ( Fall-throughable 's a word , right ? ) - Transparent Green Areas : Bushes , if you will , however in this map they 're more-so .... Cave .... Thingies .... - Red Beams : Forecefields which will go down once the turret in front of it goes down . ( In the case of the beams with the 4 in front of it , those will go down once all 4 turrets are down. ) - Black looking things : Spider Creeps <p> Okay , so I bet you 're asking now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that giant spider-looking thing in the middle of the map ? " I 'm glad you asked ! This is the main attraction of the map ! <p> This spider boss will not spawn until about 7 minutes into the match . And when he does , oh boy , will all chaos break lose . Not only will this boss not go down without a fight using his web attacks , but the team that manages to secure a kill on it will be granted a 30 second buff ! This buff will award the team ( These numbers are still trying to be balanced ) : - 20% Movement Speed - 15% Attack Speed - 10% More Damage <p> After being killed , do n't worry if your team did n't get the kill , after another 7 minutes , he 'll spawn again , ready to be killed all over again . <p> So yea , I 'm open to all comments and critique , I 'd love to know what you think of this . <p> Really cool concept ! We really need more maps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us the ability to make custom maps in the future . <p> That would be awesome , I 'd love a level editor mode , of course none of the maps would be playable in ranked matches as that would be incredibly unfair , but I 'd love to mess around with some friends on custom maps . <p> Great job coming up with this concept . I 've got a few ideas/critiques . <p> -At first glance , I wondered how you would be able to flee the enemy base effectively , without all 4 turrets down . Then I realized you have n't placed the jump pad in the new place , and the " escalator " platforms next to the core . A revision to the concept might be a good idea . <p> -I would add " gray " platforms between the top two turrets on each side , allowing you to counter Yuri &amp; V&amp;S ' flying . <p> -Consider adding silver solar on the jump pad path leaving the base . <p> -Consider creating a forcefield on the floor between the top two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jungle , instead of taking the long way around or teleporting back to base for health . <p> -I 'm also unsure about the buff your team would receive after killing the Spider boss . I could see myself sitting behind the turret for the 30 second duration , until the enemy team 's buff has worn off . I think if the solar received for slaying the Spider boss was significant ( more for whoever lays the final blow , less for the rest of the team ) , I would consider taking him on . Otherwise it does n't seem worth it . Unless of course , it 's possible to kill him solo , which would buff your teammates mid fight . Obviously this would only be accomplished in the late game . <p> Overall , wicked job ! I hope your concept inspires more in the future . I 'd love to see more map designs . BTW , my critiques are very nit-picky , take them with a grain of salt . Without your map design being as thought out as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at all . So bravo ! <p> .... god you know what would be cool ? You know the top area of the map inbetween the last turetand your bace ? That should eather be a hiding area or just plane open to open up the map a bit more x33 .... that and u just need more spring pads , that or more platforming . . it feels too tight , to cramped , there 's nothing wrong with it but you need ways to get around right ? <p> and oyvey , you should have more ways to get in and out , How about make more Forecefield gates that only requier 1 2 or 3 turets to be taken down as wellHave the map slowly be open up more and more is something that has n't  been done yet , it be cool to see that happen x3 <p> outside of me pointing out flaws though , its a good map consept ! just why though did the new boss had to be a spider ? ?
