- Maybe customers would potentially come 20 miles to your shop , so your potential market is the number of vehicles within a 20 mile radius of your shop . <h> Step 2 Initial Marketing Budget <p> Once you get an initial base of customers you might be able to grow and sustain the business based on word of mouth and referrals , but initially you are going to have to do some marketing and advertising to get a base of customers who can then hopefully help spread the word . - You will probably have to run some cheap deals to get customers to try your shop , they wont likely switch for nothing . <h> Step 3 Cost to Acquire 1 New Customer <p> Initially you need to know the cost to acquire 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing budget . - You need to have enough money set aside for initial marketing to be able to secure a core of repeat customers . - So maybe you send out mailers with coupons for a $10 oil change . - You will need to estimate how much it will cost to send out each mailer and what percentage of people who get the mailer will actually come in. - That represents your cost to acquire a new customer . <h> Step 4 % of New Customers that Turn Into Repeat Customers <p> Now out of these new customers what percentage will turn into repeat customers ? - Maybe 25% ? - You will have to make an educated guess here . - You can be sure that every new customer will not turn into a repeat customer , the question is what is that percentage . <h> Step 5 % of Customers that Recommend your Service <p> Once you build that initial base of repeat customers , some percentage of them will share about your shop . - It is very common for people to ask each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Not everyone is going to share , maybe it is just 5% , but those 5% can be very powerful . <p> Now that you assume 5% will share with other people , you have to estimate how many people they will share with each month . - Maybe they only share once every 4 months , so you would estimate that they share with .25 people each month . <h> Step 7 What % of those Shared With Actually Become Customers <p> Next you need to determine what percentage of those people that they shared with will actually come to the shop as a customer . - Then again you are back to the same question , what percentage of those new customers will become repeat customers . <h> Step 8 Total Customers per Month <p> Finally , you will get to your total customers per month . - So in this model that I am building , this number represents your repeat customers . - This is not asking how many actually come to the shop each month , just how many people would you consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 2,000 vehicles . - Of course not every customer comes in every month , but we will address that with the next step . <h> Step 9 Average Revenue Per Customer Per Month <p> So rather than try to estimate what percentage of your customers will come in each month , it might be easiest to just estimate an annual dollar amount that the average vehicle will cost an owner each year in repairs and maintenance . - Maybe that number is $1,000 per year for the average car . - So then all you have to do is divide $1,000 by 12 months and you end up with your average revenue per customer per month . <h> Step 10 Total Revenue <p> Finally , you will take your average revenue per customer per month and multiply by your number of active repeat customers . - Those 1 time customers will also help you generate revenue , but it might be likely that you are offering such steep discounts to get them in the door , that you do n't  make any profit on those jobs . - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but your focus should be completely on those repeat , loyal customers . <h> Cost of Goods Sold for an Auto Repair Shop <p> First , let me define Cost of Goods Sold for you . - Your cost of goods sold is any expense that you incur when your provide a service . - Essentially you have 2 primary cost of goods sold categories . <p> Material Cost These are the costs for purchasing parts or materials for a customers vehicle . - So if you buy parts for a customers vehicle and then add 30% to the cost of the part to charge to the customer , then your cost of goods sold would essentially be 70% of your parts and materials sales . - This is not quite accurate , but probably close enough for your projections . <p> Labor Cost This is actually a tough question . - First , do you pay your staff the same amount whether there is a full day of work or not ? - Or do you pay them directly based on the specific jobs that they completed that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you have labor costs . - Let 's say you charge $100 per hour to the customer for labor , and you pay your mechanics $15 per hour , then your labor cost should be between 15 and 25% probably . - Why wouldnt it be 15% flat ? - Because you should consider taxes and benefits that you pay to mechanics as well . - If you just pay by the hour , then it might not make sense to enter in any labor costs in your Cost of Goods Sold section and just enter in Salaries/Wages in your Operating Expenses section . <p> According to BizStats , the average Cost of Goods Sold for an Auto Repair Shop is 46.72% of your total sales . <h> Operating Expenses for Auto Repair Shop <p> The easiest way to estimate your operating expenses for your auto shop is based on industry data provided by sources like BizStats. - The following categories and expense percentages are taken directly from BizStats : <p> Officers Comp . <p> 7.40% <p> Salary-Wages <p> 12.86% <p> Rent <p> 6.64% <p> Taxes <p> 3.21% <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.94% <p> Bad debts <p> 0.11% <p> Other SG&amp;A Exp . <p> 11.55% <p> Amort. &amp; Dep . <p> 0.00% <p> Interest Earned <p> 0.01% <p> Interest Expense <p> 0.59% <p> Other Income <p> 0.52% <p> Net Profit <p> 6.58% <p> All of these operating expenses are expressed as a percentage of sales . - So first you will need to create your sales projections and then you should be able to apply these percentages to your sales . <p> Your startup costs could range between $25,000 and $75,000 especially if you are planning on keeping some reserve funding to pay rent and other operating expenses during the first several months before you are at a breakeven point . <p> If you work through this process and present your plan to a potential lender or investor , you will be more sophisticated than many auto repair shops right off the bat . - If you need any help as you are creating your financial projections , feel free to reach out to me at adam@projectionhub.com

How to Build Financial Projections <p> If you are looking to start a Dental Practice you are likely to need some financing , which means you probably need some financial projections . - According to a report by Sageworks , Dentist Offices show an average of 14.9% net profit margin . - This is great , but as a Dentist , you did n't  go to school for financial modeling , so that is where we come in to help . <p> Once you sign up and use the Dental Practice financial model , then you can start by projecting your revenue ( income ) : <h> Step 1 Dental Practice Revenue Projections <p> There are a number of services that a dentist can provide , the list of services that we have added to our model is as follows : <p> Cleaning/Exam <p> Dental Bridges , Crowns and Implants <p> Emergency Dental Services <p> Extraction <p> Fillings <p> Oral Surgery <p> The question is how do you predict how much revenue you will generate for each of these services ? - In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to start with the number of patients you can secure for regular exams and cleanings. - That is your customer base , then from your customer base you will be able to predict the percentage of the general population that needs crowns , implants , tooth extraction , cavity fillings , etc. - You need to focus on building your customer base and how that business model works , and then simply assume some percentages for all of your other services based on the core customer base . <p> So here is the exercise I think you will need to go through to build out your revenue projections : <p> How much advertising will it take to acquire one new patient ? - Whether you do radio , tv , Google , or direct mail advertising , you will need an advertising budget and will need to assume some cost per acquiring a new patient . - This Question and Answer on Quora gives some nice guidelines on how to calculate this . - Since you are a new practice let 's assume that you have to spend $200 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting with a $5,000 monthly ad budget . - This will bring in 25 new patients per month . <p> Now you need to determine how much revenue you will generate from the first visit of each new patient , then what percentage of patients will you retain to create your patient or customer base , and then finally how much will your patient base spend each month on the various services you provide . - I have created a spreadsheet to help model revenue for a dental office that you can use here . <p> In order to determine how much revenue you can generate from your different services I suggest that you find some stats on the prevalence of various issues like cavities , the need for crowns , root canals , etc. - For example the CDC provides data on the prevalence of tooth decay ( ie the need for fillings ) among the US population . <p> In this example I created a basic revenue projection for a startup dental office in the first year . - Total revenue for the year is only $73,000 which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring home as a first year dentist , but you have to start somewhere . - As your customer base grows , revenue and profit can grow substantially . - But for your first year revenue you might try to use our revenue spreadsheet here . - Based on this spreadsheet I entered in my monthly revenue projections into ProjectionHub as seen below . <h> Step 2 Expenses for a Dental Practice <p> Our financial model also has about 20 default expenses related to dental offices . - The key expenses I want to point out are : <p> Advertising is $5,000 per month this is what you use to acquire new patients <p> Insurance can get pretty expensive when you include malpractice insurance and liability insurance for the office . - This article is a helpful guide and helps me estimate around 1,500 per year for all the insurance you need . <p> Wages I am assuming that you do n't  hire a dental hygienist until month 7 , you will just do the cleanings yourself initially . - I am also assuming that you do n't  take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small $1,000 per month owner draw . - Finally , I assume a part time office manager at $1,500 per month . <p> Equipment Rental vs .

For many startup gyms the journey to breakeven does not happen over night . - The following blog post will walk gym owners through the process of creating financial projections using ProjectionHub . <h> Gym Membership Sales Projections <p> Sales projections for a gym can be fairly complex . - The first thing we are going to do is project monthly gym members by adding a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model . - We will assume a $70 monthly membership starting with 10 members in month 1 and increasing by 20% per month. - <p> Product Sales <p> In addition to gym memberships you may sell a number of different products or programs . - So next I am adding Nutritional Supplement products . - For example , you may sell protein powder or shakes . - I am going to assume that you start by selling 2 products per month per active member and then grow that at a 20% rate each month as you make people aware of the products and improve your selection . - We will assume the average price for a Nutritional Supplement Product is $10 . <p> Class Sales <p> In addition to retail products and gym memberships , you will likely also sell specific classes . - This may be available for non-members who just want to come and pay for a 1-time class occasionally . - With ProjectionHub you could add unlimited classes and project sales for each class , but for our purposes in this blog post I am going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will start by assuming that classes cost $7 for one-time clients . - We will also assume that you will start by selling 5 times the number of monthly memberships in class passes each month . - So for month 1 you will sell 5 times 10 monthly members = 50 one time class passes . - We will grow this at 10% each month . <p> Program Sales <p> Finally , many gyms have jump start programs for 4 weeks where a customer can try out the gym before becoming a member . - Let 's assume that you sell the average program for $50 to get the customer in the door . - We will assume that you sell 3 times as many programs as you have monthly members because only some percentage of program participants will convert into monthly members each month . - So we will start with 30 program sales per month and grow this at 5% each month . <p> Below is a screenshot of the entries I made in ProjectionHub for the supplements , 1 time classes and special program sales : <h> Cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have completed the sales projections , it is time to enter in cost of goods sold for each product and service . <p> Supplements we will assume a $3 average material cost for the supplements <p> 1 Time Classes Classes will not have material costs , but will have labor costs to pay the class instructors . - Let 's assume the average class has 10 people all paying $7 , so you pay the instructor $30 for the class . - So $30/10 participants = $3 per class unit sold . <p> 4 Week Programs With these programs we are going to assume you just breakeven because these are often just a program to bring potential members into the gym , so we will assumed a $50 cost of good sold for labor cost per unit . <p> Memberships Finally , we will assume no COGS for gym members . -

You will notice that I applied a growth rate to the Tithes and Offerings category because hopefully - you are adding new people to your congregation . - The growth rate depends on a variety of factors , so I am just going to assume a 4% monthly growth rate for the first year and then going down to 2% and 1% monthly for years 2 and 3 . <p> Also , in this particular template that I am creating , I am assuming 25,000 per year from the mother church spread out over 12 months , and a $500 a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Next you will need to estimate your general operating expenses which vary dramatically depending on the specific details of your church plant . - So rather than try to give you estimates for each category , I am simply going to list categories of expenses that you might have , and let you make these estimates based on things like cost of living in your location , whether the pastor is full time or part time , whether you meet in a home or rent a facility , etc . <p> I am going to throw in some estimated expenses into the template for a church plant in the mid west United States . <h> Example Church Expenses <p> Pastoral Expenses <p> Salary <p> Benefits <p> Housing <p> Office Expenses <p> Accounting <p> Staff Salaries <p> Legal <p> Insurance <p> Print materials <p> Maintenance <p> Telephone <p> Travel <p> Internet <p> Utilities <p> Program Expenses <p> Youth Group <p> Nursery <p> Worship/Music <p> Sunday School <p> Giving <p> Missionary Support <p> Congregation Support <p> Denomination Fees <p> Other <p> Building Fund <p> Contingency Fund <h> Church Plant Startup Costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in startup costs to tens of thousands of dollars in startup costs . - Again this all depends on your model of church plant . - I am simply going to list some of the startup costs that you may need to consider depending on your model . <p> Required Startup Costs <p> There really are n't  many required startup costs . - All you really " need " to do is incorporate in your state , and then secure non profit status . <p> 501c3 Filing In order to accept tax deductible donations from the congregation you need to have 501c3 status . - If you have an attorney in your congregation , great ! - Otherwise you might want to check out a service like StartChurch- who can handle this process for you . <p> Cost Estimate $1,800 <p> Optional Startup Costs <p> Although there are n't  many required costs , there are a lot of optional expenses that you may need to consider depending on your church plant model . <p> Facility- This is only a startup cost if you purchase a facility . - If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly operating expenses . <p> Computer - The pastor will likely need a computer to research and develop sermons . <p> Projector- and Screen- Do - you plan to project music or sermon slides on a screen ? <p> Bibles- Many churches have Bibles available for visitors <p> Chairs- - The congregation will want to be able to sit <p> Sound Equipment- In a small church and small facility , you may not need microphones and speakers right away <p> Business Cards The pastor and even congregation may want to pass out cards to invite people to church <p> Telephone The pastor may need a cell phone <p> Website - It might be a good idea to set up a very basic website with contact info , service times , what the church believes , etc <p> Operating Capital Fund Depending on how you want to create your model , it might make sense to have an operating capital fund as part of your startup costs . - This fund could cover the first 6 to 12 months of rent and pastor salary . - It seems wise to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  rely on a certain level of tithes and growth right off the bat . <p> So once you add up all of your startup costs for your particular model , you will need to enter those on the Startup Costs page in ProjectionHub as a Use of Funds . - You will also need to enter an equal amount for Sources of Funds . - So will your Mother Church make an initial cash investment to cover these startup costs ? - Or will you raise funds from individual members ? <h> Reaching- Self Sufficiency <p> Once you complete the Excel template or work through the ProjectionHub app you will be able to see a monthly breakdown of your income statement , cash flow projection and balance sheet for the first 3 years of operation . - You should be looking for the month on your cash flow projection where you start to regularly bring in more cash than goes out . - You should at least try to plan to reach this point by the end of year 3 , or have a clear plan to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful in walking you through the thought process you should go through when creating a financial model and budget for a new church . - If you have any questions , or would like me to review your projections , do n't  hesitate to reach out to adam@projectionhub.com

<p> The first primary question is what should you charge ? - This answer will drive your sales projections going forward . <p> Residential Snow Removal Rates - According to a study by Angies List the averages residential snow removal contract was $378 in 2013. - So the way these contracts likely work is that you agree to clear snow for the entire year for approximately $375 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 inches you earn $375 and if it snows 10 inches you make $375. - It is probably wise to build in some basic protections for yourself . - Maybe you structure the contract in such a way that the customer pays $375 for snow totals within a certain range and if you have a record year of snow there should be opportunity for you to charge additional fees . - For all of the things you need to consider when structuring your contracts , read this article by Angiess List. - In this example , I am going to assume that you charge $375 per residential contract . - I am also going to assume that in your first year you only secure 10 residential contracts . - Further , I am going to assume that you get paid up front for the whole year in November , so you will generate $3,750 in residential service revenue in November . <p> Commercial Snow Removal Rates - In this example I am going to assume that you pickup a number of commercial contracts . - These are all going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per month whether it snows or not . - I am going to assume that you pick up 20 commercial contracts that pay an average of $500 per month from November through March . - For commercial snow removal there are two basic pricing models : <p> Seasonal Rates This means you earn the same amount of revenue whether there is a record year of snowfall or no snow at all . <p> Per Inch Rates - With this contract structure , you will likely earn more per inch plowed , but you run the risk of a dry winter with little to no snow at all which means you earn nothing . <p> Hourly Snow Removal Rates - The hourly rate you can charge if you are a subcontractor and just have a truck and a plow will vary dramatically based on supply and demand , city , etc. - This forum provides some commentary on what rates you might expect . - In this example I am going to assume that you do n't  pick up any subcontracts where you are just plowing by the hour since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others . <p> Based on these assumptions I have created the following revenue projections for your first year in business : <p> November and December Sales : <p> January through March Sales : <h> What Expenses does a Snow Plowing Business Have ? <p> There are a number of expenses that you will incur with a snow plowing business . - You will have fixed costs and variable costs . - The key variable costs are listed below along with an estimated cost for each time there is a " plowable " snow for your 20 commercial and 10 residential clients : <p> Fuel $150 per snow event <p> Wages $300 <p> Salt $100 <p> Chemicals $50 <p> Vehicle Maintenance $25 <p> Total Variable Costs per Snow = $625 <p> Next , let 's assume the following number of snows in each month November through March : <p> November 2 <p> December 3 <p> January 4 <p> February 4 <p> March 2 <p> So your monthly variable costs would be as follows : <p> November $1,250 <p> December $1,875 <p> January $2,500 <p> February $2,500 <p> March $1,250 <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> In order to operate a snow plowing business you need the following equipment : <p> Truck <p> Plow <p> Salt Spreader <p> According to Snow Plow Maker Boss a new " V blade snow plow will set you back about $6,000. - A salt spreader might cost around $2,000 , and of course a truck can range dramatically depending on whether it is new or used . - Let 's assume you buy a used truck for $20,000 in this example forecast . <p> With ProjectionHub once you add these assets into the projection template , we automatically calculate the monthly depreciation expense for you based on your input . <h> Can you get a Bank Loan for a Truck and Snow Plow ? <p> So now the question is whether or not you will be able to get a bank loan for your truck and plow , or if you will have to front the investment yourself ? - If you are looking for a bank loan , your pesky banker is likely to ask you for a set of financial and cash flow projections . - If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that . - In this example I am going to assume that you get a $22,000 loan and you have to come up with a $6,000 owner investment to be able to pay for your truck , spreader and plow . - So you can enter your loan and your personal investment as seen below : <p> $22,000 loan <p> $6,000 personal investment- <h> Snow Plow Contractor : What if it Does n't  Snow ? <p> If most of your contracts only allow you to bill if it actually snows , then you need to run some " Scenario Analysis " which means you run financial projections based on different scenarios . - What if it snows 100 inches , will you have the staffing to service all of your contracts ? - What if it snows 10 inches , will you survive ? - Will you be able to cover your truck loan ?

This means you may need to buy materials to make the product , you will need to pay employees to provide the service or manufacture the product all before you will get paid from your customer . For this reason , a line of credit should work well to even out your cash flow cycle and help you sleep at night . <h> 2. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you allow your customers to pay you 10 , 30 , or even 60 days after providing your service or delivering your product , you are a good candidate for a line of credit . Again , in this situation you will likely need to borrow funds for those 10 , 30 , or 60 days , but you do n't  need a 72 month loan , and you should n't give up 10% in your company for an investment that you only need for 30 days . A line of credit allows you to pull down funds as you need them and then pay them back once you are paid so you only pay interest on what you actually use . <p> Sometimes business owners are required to pay their suppliers much sooner than their customers pay them . For example , you might need to pay your suppliers for the components to build you product within 10 days after receiving the raw materials , but your customer may not pay you for 45 days after receiving the finished product . This means you could have a 60+ day gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can put a real strain on your cash flow .

<p> Before we dig into the details of creating a revenue model for retail businesses , there is a question we have to answer first : <h> What Types of Businesses are Considered Retail Businesses ? <p> Well according to the Census Bureau Report the following businesses are considered retail : <p> Motor vehicle &amp; parts dealers <p> Furniture stores <p> Electronics and appliance stores <p> Building material and garden supply dealers <p> Food and beverage stores <p> Health and personal care stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobby , book and music stores <p> General Merchandise <p> Miscellaneous store retailers <p> Food services and drinking places <p> If your business falls into one of these categories , then you are a retail business . - Retail businesses will typically build a revenue model in a similar way . - Now I am going to outline the key aspects of a retail revenue model and then provide an Excel template that you can use to create your own revenue projections . <h> Retail Revenue Model <h> 1 . - Establish your Target Market and Monthly Leads <p> The first thing - you need to do is establish your target market . - So in retail what is your target market ? - Let me give you some examples : <p> A store in the mall if you are a store in the mall , maybe your market is the number of people who visit the mall each year . - Then you would probably narrow it down from there to get a target market . - For example if you are a womens clothing store , your target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mall . - To get this data , simply call the mall you are looking to open in and you should be able to get this data . <p> - A Gas Station for a gas station , your market is the number of vehicles that drive by your station each day . - You can find this data from your states department of transportation website. - They will typically provide traffic data that will help you estimate your market . <p> A Grocery Store this is probably based on geographic location . - Your market is probably the population in a particular radius around your store . - This can vary drastically depending on where you are located . - In the middle of Wyoming your market might be a 100 mile radius . - In New York City , your radius might be a few city blocks . <p> A Car Dealership this is a tough one . - Your market could be anyone within a 50 mile radius , but if you are a Ford dealership , it might be that your market is only individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are probably many people in that radius that would never buy a Ford . <p> Once you have you target market estimated , you should estimate the number of new leads you will get each month from that market . - You might decided that everyone in the market is a lead , or maybe just the cars that exit off of the interstate if you are a gas station . <h> 2. - Conversion Rate of Leads to Customers <p> Once you have your target market identified , then you need to determine a percentage of your potential customers that will actually become customers . - This is probably the most difficult thing you will have to estimate within your revenue model . - For every other number there is data that you can find , but your conversion rate is so unique to your specific situation . - In order to make your initial estimate it might be best to go do some first hand research . - For example , spend some time at a competing gas station , grocery store , coffee shop , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . - This will at least give - you a frame of reference for what to expect . <h> - 3. - Percentage of Customers that are Repeat Customers <p> For many retail businesses they have a base of repeat customers that come back day after day , week after week , month after month . - You will need to make an educated guess at the percentage of customers who are repeats . - There will be some percentage of customers who try your establishment once and then never come back , but hopefully many will come back again and again . <h> 4. - Average # of Purchases per Month per Customer <p> Next you need to estimate the number of times you expect customers to purchase each month . - If you are a grocery store you might estimate once a week . - A coffee shop , maybe 3 days a week . - A high end restaurant maybe once a year for special occasions . <h> 5. - Average $ Amount of a Purchase <p> The final major assumption is the dollar amount per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - At a furniture store you can just take the average price of your furniture items . - At a bar , what is the price of a drink x the number of drinks the average person orders . <h> - 6 .

@@4684347 @qwx45990 <h> 4 Financial Projection Models for the 4 Restaurant Styles <p> Starting a restaurant could be a daunting task , but knowing what you want your end product to look like provides purpose in the planning . The style of your restaurant should be your first decision , along with a concept . There are 4 styles of service in the restaurant industry : <p> Fast Food <p> Fast Casual <p> Casual Dining <p> Fine Dining <p> Restaurants operate on thin margins , so it is vital to know the style of your restaurant when making projections . Each style of restaurant has a number of similarities and a number of differences when it comes to the financial model of the business . - In this blog post , I am going to outline how I would build a revenue projection model for each of the 4 restaurant styles . <p> After choosing the restaurant general model in ProjectionHub , you need to set up the the revenue sheet . Because the style for this model is fast food , the average order amount is usually around $5-$7 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next , think about the capacity of the restaurant . How many people will you serve ? You would want to put the restaurant in a high traffic area that is easily accessible . Say the city you are putting it in has a population of 80,000 people , and half of those people would eat at a fast food restaurant once a week . Divide that between the 7 days in a week , and you have about 5,700 potential customers per day . Figuring out how many customers you could serve per day depends on your restaurant , brand , and kitchen/dining facilities . I assume that you will do 300 orders per day . So that means 300 orders per day X $6 per order X 7 days a week X 4 weeks per month is $50,400 per month in sales . <p> Here are the steps with the math I used in creating this revenue projection : <p> Total Addressable market <p> City = 80,000 people <p> People who eat at a fast food restaurant once a week = 40,000 <p> Divided by 7 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Revenue Projection <p> Restaurant capacity = 300 orders per day <p> Average order amount = $6 <p> Average daily sales = $6 x 300 per day = $1,800 <p> Monthly sales = ( $1,800 x 7 days ) x 4 weeks = $50,400 <p> Splitting that between food and beverage sales respectively results in the revenue sheet below using the ProjectionHub application : <p> Fast Casual Restaurant Financial Model <p> A fast casual restaurant should provide food in a short wait span , but its quality of food , ingredients , and experience is considered an upgrade from a fast food restaurant.The fast casual industry seems to be growing quickly . Meals usually cost between $7-$15 . Chipotle , Five Guys , and Panera come to mind when thinking of restaurants in this category. - Capacity- for this model is similar to a fast food restaurant because customers typically order themselves ; there is no server to seat them and place- their order. - They are typically open for lunch and dinner . For example 5 Guys is open from 11:00 am to 10:00 pm . This means it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 customers every hour when it is busy , but it also would have slow hours. - Using an estimate of 30 customers per hour , this means that ideally there would be 330 customers per day . However , to use a conservative- estimate , I used 200 customers per day in my model . - An average order of $11 is used in my projections too . These restaurants also have catering available too , which varies per restaurant . This revenue projection can be found with math similar to below : <p> These projections may be modest . If you are to purchase a franchise , it may have more success depending on the name and reputation of the restaurant . <p> Casual Dining Restaurant Revenue Model <p> Going down the line , the casual dining restaurant is more upscale than a fast casual restaurant . Prices typically range from $10-$20 for meals , and customers are seated while a waiter takes their orders . Restaurants may include a wine or bar menu as well . Common chains of casual dining restaurants include Olive Garden , Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because it relies on customers eating within the restaurant , you have to consider additional factors in developing a revenue projection . What type of people will are trying to attract ? Will the restaurant be open for breakfast ? What will the layout of the restaurant look like ? How much seating is available ? How long will the average customer be at the restaurant ? Here are some assumptions I made for my projections : <p> Keep in mind while this seems like more revenue compared to the previous two models , the costs of a casual restaurant may be higher than a fast food or fast casual restaurant as you need- servers and have the task of keeping eating areas clean . <p> Fine Dining Restaurant Projection Model <p> A fine dining restaurant is usually at the top-of-line restaurant . Prices are the highest compared to other styles of restaurant , but the quality of food and level of service reflect the higher price . This article describes several items that factor into a more expensive dining option . The market of customers that will eat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant models , but price point of average orders can be much higher . For my revenue projections , I will assume the average order is $50 . When will the restaurant be open from ? I assume this fine dining restaurant will only be open for dinner . Another question to consider is how many customers will you have each night . This question-answer on Quora gives some good criteria to think about for the capacity of your restaurant . The following are some steps that I think are helpful : <p> In the revenue model I made on ProjectionHub , I added a third category for desserts because some customers may come just for dessert that the restaurant specializes in serving . The revenue split between food , beverage , and dessert is : 60% food , 20% drinks , and 20% desserts . <p> Hopefully these descriptions give you a good idea on what your revenue may be if you are starting a new restaurant ! - ProjectionHub has business models for all four styles that make starting your projections quick and easy .

" - For a numbers focused guy like me , his simple equation to determine whether an investor is worth it or not is the perfect way to answer how much equity to give up in your startup company in exchange for investment . <p> The question is simple . <p> Will this investment improve the outcome of my company by more than the value of the equity taken by the investor . <p> Because I cant explain this any more eloquently than Paul does in his article I have copied a section straight from his article below : <p> " Whenever you 're trading stock in your company for anything , whether its money or an employee or a deal with another company , the test for whether to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough that the ( 100 n ) % you have left is worth more than the whole company was before . <p> For example , if an investor wants to buy half your company , how much does that investment have to improve your average outcome for you to break even ? Obviously it has to double : if you trade half your company for something that more than doubles the companys average outcome , you 're net ahead . You have half as big a share of something worth more than twice as much . <p> In the general case , if n is the fraction of the company you 're giving up , the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth more than 1/ ( 1 n ) . <p> For example , suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for 6% of your company . In this case , n is .06 and 1/ ( 1 n ) is 1.064 .

There are 2 key reasons why the in home day care business model is difficult : <p> Capacity Constraints Typically the state will determine the number of children that can be cared for in one home based daycare. - As an example in Kansas the maximum is 12 children under the age of 16 per home . - This limits the revenue potential for the home . - It is kind of like getting into the home rental business . - You are not going to get rich renting out one home because you can only charge so much for rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small profit to reach a sustainable and profitable level . - Likewise you will likely need multiple home day cares to really make the finances work well for you . <p> High Startup Costs Because you will need to meet a long list of requirements set by your state ( Example here ) , you will likely incur $10,000 or much more in startup costs to prepare a home to be compliant . -

In all likelihood you will be paid by the hour . <p> Hourly rates for child care can vary drastically depending on your location , programming , experience , and most importantly the age of the children you are watching . - You can bill more per hour for an infant typically because infants require more caregivers per child . - Care.com has an excellent babysitting rates calculator that will estimate how much you can charge for care in your location . <p> Maximum revenue Once you know an average hourly rate you will charge , the maximum number of children you can watch at any given time , and the number of hours you will be open each month , you can calculate your maximum monthly revenue . - This will be helpful because it gives you a quick dose of reality to determine whether this is worth your time . - As an example let 's say you are going to charge $7 per hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 200 hours per month . - Maximum Total Revenue = $16,800/month <p> Now that we have some ball park numbers , let 's enter some actual sales projections into ProjectionHub : <p> So here is what I assumed to come up with these sales projection entries : <p> There is a maximum of 3 infants because the typical child to caregiver ratio for infants is 3 to 1 . <p> The hourly rate for infants is $8 <p> The maximum number of billable hours per month for 3 infants is 600 <p> I started the projections in month 1 assuming a 50% utilization rate , so 300 billable hours <p> I assumed a monthly growth rate of 3% for the first year <p> For year 2 and 3 I kept sales at 500 billable hours per month <p> Assumptions for non-infants <p> Up to 9 children <p> Hourly rate is $6 <p> Maximum number of billable hours per month for 9 children is 1800 <p> I started the projections in month 1 assuming 1,000 billable hours <p> I assumed a monthly growth rate of 4% for the first year <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billable hours per month <h> Cost of Goods Sold for a Day Care <p> Next you will need to enter estimated cost of goods sold for a day care . -

You can see that if everything goes right you can expect just under $50,000 in net income per year and free cash flow of closer to $40,000. - Then you have to pay taxes on the net income and by the time it is all said and done you have to consider that you are going to have up to 12 kids in your house for 10 hours per day , 5 days per week . -

Sometimes this problem may drive you to fund your growth with credit cards . - This is not ideal , but it can work . - Just like a microloan , a credit card wo n't solve all of your financing problems , but it can help you kick the can down the road . - The problem is , if you go to an investor and you have very little in sales , you are going to have to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ways to increase your sales so that you can demand a higher valuation when it comes time to meet with investors . - Yes it is risky to get yourself too deep in debt growing the business and then find out you ca n't secure an investor , but generally you will be able to find investment for a growing software as a service business , the only question is the valuation . - How much of the business will you give away . <p> 3. - Alternative Financing Lastly , there are some interesting new ways to finance businesses that charge their customers via PayPal or credit cards . - New alternative lenders are actually taking your PayPal data or your credit card/bank account data to determine how much they are willing to lend to you . - There are two examples of this type of financing . - Kabbage.com uses your PayPal data , social network data , and Amazon or eBay seller data to determine your credit-worthiness and how much you are able to borrow . - Similarly , OnDeck Capital uses your cash flow data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lend and how much they are willing to lend . - Then they actually pull small payments back from you on a daily basis . - They realized that it could be hard to come up with a 1 time monthly payment for your loan , so they pull on a more regular basis . - This reduces their risk and a lender. - Now both Kabbage and OnDeck come at a price . - This is certainly not the cheapest way to fund your business , but it can help you grow without giving away the entire company to an investor . <p> All 3 options here are a bit more realistic than walking into your local bank and asking for a $100,000 line of credit to help grow the business . - That is very rare for a software company and even more rare for a startup. - So consider these financing options as stepping stones until you get to that $500,000 in annual recurring sales . - At that point you will be able to secure an investor without giving away all of your equity . - Good luck !

This is all data that the big banks probably are not collecting because they do not have the systems in place to analyze the data . - Alternative lenders are going to be able to determine which data points are important to focus on and quickly adapt their systems while the traditional banks are going to move like the big slow giants that they are . - <p> The good news for small businesses is that the credit score is not the only data point that matters anymore . - This does n't mean you can ignore your credit score , but it does mean that you can still grow a business even if your credit history is n't stellar. - If you excel in any or all of these 3 data points , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your small business .

@@4684489 @qwx45990 <h> 3 Deadly Pro Forma Balance Sheet Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make <p> Entrepreneurs are often asked to create a set of pro forma financial statements for their business during the process of securing capital through a loan or investor , or when they are about to experience a big change like a merger or acquisition , or a large new customer . - Future financial projections can be tricky all the way around , but the balance sheet is particularly difficult for non-accountants. - Before we get into 3 common mistakes that small business owners make when developing a pro forma financial statement , you must first understand the difference between simple financial projections , and a pro forma financial statement . Here are 3 of the most common and damaging mistakes that you can make when working on your balance sheet forecast : <p> 1 . - Incorrect Accounting for a Loan There are a few ways to really screw up your balance sheet if you do n't understand how a loan impacts the balance sheet . - So let 's say you are applying for a loan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $100,000 loan . - After you get the loan , obviously cash should increase by $100k , you should have a loan account on the liabilities side of the balance sheet for $100k , but what happens in the subsequent months ? - Let 's say you have a $1,000 monthly loan payment , so cash will decrease by $1,000 , but your loan balance will not decrease by $1,000. - A portion of the loan payment will go toward interest expense which will not decrease the loan balance , instead it would decrease net income which ultimately decreases your retained earnings line on the balance sheet . <p> 2. - Failing to Account for Depreciation Let 's assume that you use the $100,000 loan to purchase a building . - So again your liabilities will increase by $100,000 , but your assets will also increase by $100k initially . - Then you need to determine how long the building will last . - Typically you can assume 30 years for a new building , and then calculate depreciation for each month of the 30 years . - This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease due to depreciation . - In our example we can assume the building will be worthless after 30 years , so we will depreciate the building to 0 over 30 years . - So to calculate monthly depreciation you will just take $100,000 divided by 30 years divided by 12 months which equals $277 per month . - Each month the value of your building asset should go down by $277 and your retained earnings should also decrease by $277 per month . <p> 3. - Assets Do Not Equal Liabilities + Owner 's Equity The worst mistake that you can make when creating your balance sheet pro forma is when your balnce sheet does not BALANCE ! - In order to keep your balance sheet balanced , you must utilize the equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner 's Equity . - This equation must always work , it must always balance . - If you change the value of an asset , you must change the value of either a liability or owner 's equity account . - You really need to understand accounting to make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up with an unbalanced balance sheet which could be pretty embarrassing when you bring your financials to a potential lender or investor . <p> Next time you are creating a pro forma financial statement make sure to keep this common issues in mind . - If you feel uncomfortable with your own projections , but do n't want to spend $250 an hour for your CPA firm to review what you have created , feel free to shoot me an email at adam@projectionhub.com and I would be happy to review your pro forma financials for you .
