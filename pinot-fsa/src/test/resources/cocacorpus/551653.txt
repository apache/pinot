The Fund is a newly formed entity with no significant operating history upon which prospective investors may evaluate the Funds potential performance . The ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective depends , in part , on the ability of the Advisor to allocate effectively the assets of the Fund among the various securities and investments in which the Fund invests . There can be no assurance that the actual allocations will be effective in achieving the Funds investment objective or delivering positive returns . <p> The Funds investments may be negatively affected by the broad investment environment and capital markets in which the Fund invests , including the real estate market , the debt market and/or the equity securities market . The value of the Funds investments will increase or decrease based on changes in the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the Funds shares to increase or decrease . The Fund is " non-diversified " under the Investment Company Act of 1940 since changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause a greater fluctuation in the Funds net asset value than in a " diversified " fund . The Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program . <p> There is no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of the shares they desire in a quarterly repurchase offer . Limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the Funds quarterly repurchase offers for no less than 5% of the Funds shares outstanding at net asset value .

The value of companies engaged in the real estate industry is affected by : ( i ) changes in general economic and market conditions ; ( ii ) changes in the value of real estate properties ; ( iii ) risks related to local economic conditions , overbuilding and increased competition ; ( iv ) increases in property taxes and operating expenses ; ( v ) changes in zoning laws ; ( vi ) casualty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neighborhood values or the appeal of property to tenants ; ( viii ) the availability of financing and ( ix ) changes in interest rates and leverage . <p> This is a closed end interval fund .

You should carefully consider the information set forth under " Risk Factors " beginning on page 21 of the prospectus for a discussion of the material risk factors relevant to an investment in our shares . Some of the more significant risks include the following : <p> This is an initial public offering ; we have no prior operating history , and you should not rely upon the past performance of other real estate investment programs sponsored by affiliates of our sponsor to predict our future results . <p> There is currently no public trading market for our shares and there may never be one ; therefore , it will be difficult for you to sell your shares . Our charter does not require us to pursue a liquidity transaction at any time . <p> We established the offering price on an arbitrary basis ; as a result , the actual value of your investment may be substantially less than what you pay . <p> We have paid , and may continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from operations , including net proceeds of this offering or from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flows . We are not prohibited from undertaking such activities by our charter , bylaws or investment policies , and we may use an unlimited amount from any source to pay our distributions . <p> This is a " best efforts " offering . If we are unable to raise substantial funds , we will be limited in the number and type of investments we may make , and the value of your investment will fluctuate with the performance of the specific properties we acquire . <p> Because this is a " blind pool " offering , you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the investments we will make with the proceeds of this offering before you purchase our shares . <p> Our ability to operate profitably will depend upon the ability of our advisor to efficiently manage our day-to-day operations . <p> Because our dealer manager is one of our affiliates , you will not have the benefit of an independent review of the prospectus or us as is customarily performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property manager and their officers and certain of their key personnel will face competing demands relating to their time , which may cause our operating results to suffer . <p> Our advisor will face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties , including conflicts with Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT , Inc. , and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor , which could adversely affect our investment opportunities . <p> Our advisor will face conflicts of interest relating to the incentive fee structure under our operating partnership agreement , which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders . <p> Payment of substantial fees and expenses to our advisor and its affiliates will reduce cash available for investment and distribution . <p> You are bound by the majority vote on matters on which our stockholders are entitled to vote and , therefore , your vote on a particular matter may be superseded by the vote of other stockholders . <p> Many of our properties will depend upon a single tenant for all or a majority of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make distributions may be adversely affected by the bankruptcy or insolvency , a downturn in the business , or a lease termination of a single tenant , including those caused by the current economic climate . <p> We may not be able to sell our properties at a price equal to , or greater than , the price for which we purchased such properties , which may lead to a decrease in the value of our assets . <p> Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to you . <p> Disruptions in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations , financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you . <p> Failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions as we will incur additional tax liabilities . <p> You may have tax liability on distributions you elect to reinvest in our common stock . <p> There are special considerations that apply to employee benefit plans , IRAs or other tax-favored benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our shares to be a prohibited transaction which could result in additional tax consequences . 116697 @qwx526697 116689 @qwx526689 116690 @qwx526690 116705 @qwx526705 <h> Attention 116708 @qwx526708

Covered Persons/Purpose of the Code <p> This Code of Ethics and Business Conduct ( the " Code " ) for Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC Corp . ( the " Company " ) applies to ( i ) officers of the Company , ( ii ) all members of the Company 's Board of Directors , and ( iii ) employees and officers of the Company 's advisor , Griffin Capital BDC Advisor , LLC ( the " Advisor " ) and its affiliates who perform material functions for the Company ( collectively , the " Covered Persons " and each a " Covered Person " ) for the and professional relationships ; <p> full , fair , accurate , timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that a registrant files with , or submits to , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other public communications made by the Company ; <p> compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations ; <p> the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code ; and <p> accountability for adherence to the Code . <p> II . Conflicts of Interest <p> Covered Persons should be scrupulous in avoiding conflicts of interest with regard to the interests of the Company . A " conflict of interest " occurs when a Covered Person 's private interest interferes in any way - or even appears to interfere - with the interests of , or his or her service to , the Company . For example , a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Person , or a member of his or her family , receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company . <p> Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper " personal benefit " , conflicts arise from , or as a result of , the contractual relationships between the Company and ( i ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Griffin Capital Securities , Inc. ( the " Dealer Manager " ) , and ( iii ) any of the Company 's other affiliates ( collectively , with the Advisor , the Dealer Manager , the " Company Affiliates " ) . As a result , this Code recognizes that the Covered Persons will , in the normal course of their duties ( whether formally for the Company or for the Company Affiliates or both ) , be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that may have different effects on the Company Affiliates and the Company . The participation of the Covered Persons in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and the Company Affiliates and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Persons of their duties to the Company . <p> The following list provides examples of prohibited conflicts of interest under this Code , but Covered Persons should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive . Each Covered Person must : <p> not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence business decisions or financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally to the detriment of the Company ; <p> not cause the Company to take action , or fail to take action , for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Person to the detriment of the Company ; <p> report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships related to conflicts of interest ; and <p> not engage in competition with the Company . <p> The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a Covered Person should not be placed improperly before the interest of the Company . Additionally , federal securities laws prohibit personal loans to directors and executive officers by the Company . <p> In order to avoid situations in which a conflict of interest involving a Covered Person may result in an improper benefit , all transactions involving a conflict of interest must be approved by a majority of the Board of Directors ( including a majority of the Independent Directors ) not otherwise interested in the transaction as fair and reasonable to the Company and on terms not less favorable to the Company than those available from unaffiliated third parties , and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter . Conflicts of interest may not always be clear-cut , so if a Covered Person has a question , he or she shall promptly bring it to the attention of the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company . Examples of potential conflicts of interest include : <p> service as a director on the board of any other business organization ; <p> the receipt of non-nominal gifts ; <p> the receipt of entertainment from any company with which the Company has current or prospective business dealings , including investments in such companies , unless such entertainment is business-related , reasonable in cost , appropriate as to time and place , and not so frequent as to raise any questions of impropriety ; or <p> any ownership interest in , or any consulting or employment relationship with , any of the Company 's unaffiliated service providers . <p> The Company encourages civic , charitable , educational and political activities as long as they do not interfere with the performance of the duties of an officer or director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company shall contact the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors before agreeing to participate in any civic or political activities that are likely to unduly interfere with the performance of his or her duties as an officer or director of the Company . <p> III .

Covered Persons are also prohibited from offering or paying anything of value to any foreign person if it is known or it should have been known that all or part of such payment will be used for the above-described prohibited actions .

Open-end funds pool money from many investors and invest in a portfolio of securities , such as stocks and bonds , that is designed for a specific investment objective . <p> Ownership of the portfolio is available to the public through shares that can be purchased or sold , hence the name " open-end " . Closed-end funds also pool money , however , they do not typically redeem shares at the option of the shareholder . Rather , closed-end fund shares usually trade on the secondary market . This structure provides asset managers with a stable amount of capital to invest in less-liquid markets , such as real estate , venture capital , and structured credit . <p> Interval funds share characteristics of both closed-end and open-end funds .

Annualized implies compounded returns for time periods greater than one year . <p> BETA : Beta is a measure of systematic risk ( volatility ) , or the sensitivity of a fund to movements in a benchmark . A beta of 1 implies that you can expect the movement of a funds return series to match that of the benchmark used to measure beta . A value of less than 1.0 implies that the fund is less volatile than the benchmark , and a value greater than 1.0 implies that the fund is more volatile than the benchmark . <p> CORRELATION : A statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A positive correlation close to 1 implies that as one security moves , either up or down , the other security will move in " lockstep , " in the same direction .

The higher the ratio , the better the risk-adjusted returns . <p> STANDARD DEVIATION : Standard deviation of return measures the average deviations of a return series from its mean , and is often used as a measure of volatility/risk .

The prospectus should be read carefully before investing . <p> Griffin Institutional Access Real Estate Fund Risk Considerations GIREX is not a money market fund . Investors in GIREX should understand that the net asset value of GIREX will fluctuate , which may result in a loss of the principal amount invested . <p> GIREX is a newly formed entity with no significant operating history upon which prospective investors may evaluate GIREXs potential performance . <p> The GIREX portfolio will be managed in a dynamic fashion and the allocation of GIREXs assets between private real estate funds and public real estate securities will vary widely . Investments in private real estate funds will likely comprise between 50% and 95% of GIREXs portfolio . Investments in public real estate securities will likely comprise between 5% and 50% of GIREXs portfolio . <p> GIREXs investment in private real estate funds will require it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including management and performance fees . The fees GIREX pays to invest in a private real estate fund may be higher than if the manager of the private real estate fund managed GIREXs assets directly . The incentive fees charged by certain private real estate funds may create an incentive for its manager to make investments that are riskier and/or more speculative than those it might have made in the absence of an incentive fee . The funds are not publicly traded and therefore may not be as liquid as other types of investments . <p> Private real estate funds , like the other investment funds in which GIREX may invest , are subject to specific risks , depending on the nature of the vehicle and also may employ leverage such that their returns are more than one times that of their benchmark which will amplify losses suffered by GIREX when compared to unleveraged investments . <p> Since GIREX is non-diversified , GIREX may invest more than 5% of its total assets in the securities of one or more issuers . As a result , GIREXs performance may be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory occurrence than the value of shares of a diversified investment company . <p> No guarantee or representation is made that the investment program of GIREX will be successful , that the various trading strategies utilized or investments made by GIREX will have low correlation with each other or with the financial markets in which GIREX invests . <p> As an interval fund , GIREX will make quarterly offers to repurchase at least 5% and up to 25% of its outstanding shares .

The Fund 's inception date was 6/30/2014 . The total gross expense ratio is 2.29% for Class A , 3.04% for Class C , 2.04% for Class I. Performance data quoted represents past performance . Past performance is no guarantee of future results and investment returns and principal value be lower or higher than performance data quoted . The maximum sales charge is 5.75% for Class A shares .

Without the waiver the expenses would have been higher . The net asset value fund return does not reflect the deduction of all fees and if the fund return reflected the deduction of such fees , the performance would be lower . Visit www.griffincapital.com for current performance . <p> Distribution Policy Risk . The Fund 's distribution policy is to make quarterly distributions to shareholders . All or a portion of a distribution may consist solely of a return of capital ( i.e. from your original investment ) and not a return of net profit . Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Fund is net profit . Shareholders should note that return of capital will reduce the tax basis of their shares and potentially increase the taxable gain , if any , upon disposition of their shares . based on tax regulations . Pursuant to Section 852 of the Internal Revenue Code , the taxability of distributions will be reported on Form 1099-DIV for 2016 . <p> The Fund distribution rate is the amount , expressed as a percentage , a Fund investor would receive in distributions if the most recent Fund distribution stayed consistent going forward . It is calculated by annualizing the most recent Fund distribution yield . The percentage represents a single distribution from the Fund and does not represent the total return of the Fund . <p> The Fund will not invest in real estate directly , but , because the Fund will concentrate its investments in securities of REITs and other real estate industry issuers , its portfolio will be significantly impacted by the performance of the real estate market and may experience more volatility and be exposed to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio . The value of companies engaged in the real estate industry is affected by : ( i ) changes in general economic and market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate properties ; ( iii ) risks related to local economic conditions , overbuilding and increased competition ; ( iv ) increases in property taxes and operating expenses ; ( v ) changes in zoning laws ; ( vi ) casualty and condemnation losses ; ( vii ) variations in rental income , neighborhood values or the appeal of property to tenants ; ( viii ) the availability of financing and ( ix ) changes in interest rates and leverage . <p> Investors in the Fund should understand that the NAV of the Fund will fluctuate , which may result in a loss of the principal amount invested . The Fund provides liquidity to shareholders quarterly between 5% and 25% of its outstanding shares at net asset value . <p> based on tax regulations .

Straight lining averages the rent payments over the life of the lease . <p> FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ( FFO ) : FFO is a non-GAAP performance measure applicable to REITs that has become widely used and adopted . FFO is calculated by adjusting net income ( loss ) ( computed in accordance with GAAP , including non-recurring items ) for gains ( or losses ) from sales of properties , real estate related depreciation and amortization , and after adjustment for similar items in unconsolidated partnerships , joint ventures and preferred distributions .

The IPA-defined MFFO is designed to promote mechanisms for the assessment of operating performance reflecting both the stage of investment and the underlying financial results of the Non-Traded REIT ; The starting point for MFFO is FFO to which an analyst would adjust for the following items included in the determination of GAAP Net Income : <p> Acquisition-related expenses from real property transactions ; Amounts relating to " straight-line " rents and amortization of above or below market lease assets and liabilities ; Accretion of discounts and amortization of premium on debt investments ; Non-recurring impairments of real estate-related investments ; Mark-to-market adjustments ; Non-recurring gains or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or deconsolidation to , equity accounting , and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures , with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis <p> ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ( AFFO ) : AFFO is a financial performance measure primarily used in the analysis of traded REITS . The intention of AFFO as a supplemental performance measure is to make certain adjustments to the definition of FFO to provide a computation and measure by which analysts and investors can measure a real estate companys cash flow generated by operations . AFFO is usually calculated by subtracting from FFO both ( 1 ) normalized recurring expenditures that are capitalized by the REIT and then amortized , but which are necessary to maintain a REITs underlying assets and its revenue stream and ( 2 ) " straight-lining " of rents . This calculation is also referred to as Cash Available for Distribution ( CAD ) or Funds Available for Distribution ( FAD ) . <p> BUILD-TO-SUIT : A property that is commissioned and custom-built to meet a specific tenants needs . <p> CAPITALIZATION RATE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate at which net operating income is discounted to determine the value of a property .

Funds from operations , as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts , or NAREIT , attributable to controlling interest , or FFO , equaled approximately $1.6 million for the quarter ended March 31 , 2017 , compared to FFO of approximately $ ( 1.4 ) million for the fourth quarter 2016 . ( Please see financial reconciliation tables and notes at the end of this release for more information regarding MFFO and FFO . ) <p> Net operating income , or NOI , totaled approximately $2.9 million for the quarter ended March 31 , 2017 , representing an increase of approximately 40 percent over fourth quarter 2016 NOI of approximately $2.0 million . Net loss during the quarter was approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of $ ( 2.6 ) million during the fourth quarter 2016 . Net loss is due largely to depreciation and amortization expense of our properties , a non-cash item , and in the fourth quarter of 2016 , expensing acquisition-related costs in connection with the purchase of our properties accounted for as business combinations , in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America , or GAAP . ( Please see financial reconciliation tables and notes at the end of this release for more information regarding NOI and net loss . ) <p> 1 Based on aggregate contract purchase price as of March 31 , 2017.2 Total debt divided by total assets.3 The estimated portfolio capitalization rate was based upon total property portfolio net operating income from each property 's forward-looking pro forma projections for the expected year one property performance , including any contractual rent increases contained in such leases for year one , divided by the contract purchase price of the total property portfolio , exclusive of any acquisition fees and expenses paid . <p> Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computed in accordance with GAAP , generated from properties before general and administrative expenses , acquisition related expenses , depreciation and amortization and interest expense . Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us , and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses . The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments , and the corresponding expenses associated with that process , is a key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders . However , we do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows , nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses . Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties . Such fees and expenses are not reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties , and therefore , if there is no further cash on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common stock to fund future acquisition fees and expenses , such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt , operational earnings or cash flows , net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows . As a result , the amount of proceeds available for investment , operations and non-operating expenses would be reduced , or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds . Acquisition related expenses in connection with property acquisitions accounted for as business combinations under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income ( loss ) and income ( loss ) from continuing operations , both of which are performance measures under GAAP . All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses have negative effects on returns to investors , the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us , unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property , these fees and expenses and other costs related to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our net income ( loss ) or income ( loss ) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows . Furthermore , net operating income is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income ( loss ) or income ( loss ) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance , as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity , or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders . Net operating income should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income ( loss ) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance . Investors are also cautioned that net operating income should only be used to assess our operational performance in periods in which we have not incurred or accrued any acquisition related expenses . <p> We believe that net operating income is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our operating assets because net operating income excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of the properties . We believe that net operating income is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community . However , our use of the term net operating income may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount . <p> To facilitate understanding of this financial measure , the following is a reconciliation of net loss , which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure , to net operating income for the three months ended March 31 , 2017 and December 31 , 2016 : <p> Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies , NAREIT , an industry trade group , has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations , a non-GAAP measure , which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT . The use of funds from operations is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time . FFO is not equivalent to our net income ( loss ) as determined under GAAP . <p> We define FFO , a non-GAAP measure , consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on funds from operations approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT , as revised in February 2004 , or the White Paper . The White Paper defines funds from operations as net income ( loss ) computed in accordance with GAAP , excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment writedowns , plus depreciation and amortization , and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures . Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations . Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT 's policy described above . The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements , which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time , which is the case if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value disclosed . We believe that , since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions , including inflation , interest rates , the business cycle , unemployment and consumer spending , presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative . In addition , we believe it is appropriate to exclude impairment charges , as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time . Testing for an impairment of an asset is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis . If certain impairment indications exist in an asset , and if the asset 's carrying , or book value , exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows ( including net rental and lease revenues , net proceeds on the sale of the property , and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP ) from such asset , an impairment charge would be recognized . Investors should note , however , that determinations of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating performance , because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property , including estimated future net rental and lease revenues , net proceeds on the sale of the property , and certain other ancillary cash flows , are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred . While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above , investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that we intend to have a relatively limited term of our operations , it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through for real estate involves the use of GAAP . Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method can not be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP . Nevertheless , we believe that the use of FFO , which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments , provides a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when compared year over year , reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates , rental rates , operating costs , general and administrative expenses and interest costs , which may not be immediately apparent from net income ( loss ) . <p> However , FFO and MFFO as described below , should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income ( loss ) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance . The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO . <p> Changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP that were put into effect and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT 's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses , specifically acquisition fees and expenses , as items that are expensed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance . Publicly registered , non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation . While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years , we believe that publicly registered , non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases . Accordingly , we do not intend to continuously purchase assets and intend to have a limited life . Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered , non-listed REITs , the IPA , an industry trade group , has standardized a measure known as modified funds from operations , which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental performance measure for publicly registered , non-listed REITs , and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered , non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above . MFFO is not equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy , as currently intended . We believe that , because MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that we consider more reflective of investing activities , as well as other non-operating items included in FFO , MFFO can provide , on a going forward basis , an indication of the sustainability ( that is , the capacity to continue to be maintained ) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place . By providing MFFO , we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our property acquisition activity ceases . We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the publicly registered , non-listed REIT industry . Further , we believe MFFO is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our property acquisition activity ceases with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities . Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our property acquisition activity ceases , as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired . <p> We define MFFO , a non-GAAP measure , consistent with the IPA 's Guideline 2010-01 , Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered , Non-Listed REITs : Modified Funds from Operations , or the Practice Guideline , issued by the IPA in November 2010 . The Practice Guideline defines modified funds from operations as funds from operations further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income ( loss ) : acquisition fees and expenses ; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above- and below-market leases and liabilities ( which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to closer to an expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease payments ) ; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments ; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income ( loss ) ; gains or losses included in net income ( loss ) from the extinguishment or sale of debt , hedges , foreign exchange , derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan ; unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from , or deconsolidation to , equity accounting ; and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures , with such adjustments calculated to reflect modified funds from operations on the same basis . The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments , unrealized gains and losses on hedges , foreign exchange , derivatives or securities holdings , unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations , as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income ( loss ) in calculating cash flows from operations and , in some cases , reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk , and we do not rely on another party to manage such risk . Inasmuch as interest rate hedges will not be a fundamental part of our operations , we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO , as such gains and losses are based on market fluctuations and may not be directly related or attributable to our operations . <p> Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA 's Practice Guideline described above . In calculating MFFO , we exclude acquisition related expenses , amortization of above- and below-market leases , change in deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to redeemable noncontrolling interest . The other adjustments included in the IPA 's Practice Guideline are not applicable to us for the three months ended March 31 , 2017 and December 31 , 2016 . Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us , and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses . The purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key operational feature of our business plan in order to generate operating revenues and cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders . However , we do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows , nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses . Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties . Such fees and expenses are not reimbursed by our advisor or its affiliates and third parties , and therefore if there is no further cash on hand from the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock to fund future acquisition fees and expenses , such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt , operational earnings or cash flows , net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows . Certain acquisition related expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income ( loss ) and income ( loss ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAAP . All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors , the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us , unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property , these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property . In the future , we may pay acquisition fees or reimburse acquisition expenses due to our advisor and its affiliates , or a portion thereof , with net proceeds from borrowed funds , operational earnings or cash flows , net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows . As a result , the amount of proceeds from borrowings available for investment and operations would be reduced , or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds . <p> Further , under GAAP , certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income ( loss ) in determining cash flows from operations . In addition , we view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispositions of assets as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance . <p> Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other publicly registered , non-listed REITs which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter . As noted above , MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long- term operating performance if we do not continue to operate in this manner . We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered , non-listed REITs , such as their limited life , limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy , and hence , that the use of such measures may be useful to investors . For example , acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensed acquisition fees and expenses , the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management 's analysis of the operating performance of the properties . Additionally , fair value adjustments , which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions , but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates , may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance . By excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses , we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information . <p> Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs , although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate funds from operations and modified funds from operations the same way , so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful . Furthermore , FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income ( loss ) or income ( loss ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative to cash flows from operations , which is an indication of our liquidity , or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders . FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance . MFFO may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods , and in particular , after the capital formation and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed . FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO and MFFO . <p> Neither the SEC , NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO . In the future , the SEC , NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered , non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a reconciliation of net loss , which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure , to FFO and MFFO for the three months ended March 31 , 2017 and December 31 , 2016 : <p> ( 1 ) In evaluating investments in real estate , we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment . Such information would be comparable only for publicly registered , non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics . By excluding expensed acquisition related expenses , we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management 's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties . Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or its affiliates and third parties . Acquisition related expenses in connection with property acquisitions accounted for as business combinations under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income ( loss ) and income ( loss ) from continuing operations , both of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors , the potential for future distributions , and cash flows generated by us , unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property , these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property . <p> ( 2 ) Under GAAP , above- and below-market leases are assumed to diminish predictably in value over time and amortized , similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate-related assets that are excluded from FFO . However , because real estate values and market lease rates historically rise or fall with market conditions , including inflation , interest rates , the business cycle , unemployment and consumer spending , we believe that by excluding charges relating to the amortization of above- and below-market leases , MFFO may provide useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate . <p> ( 3 ) Under GAAP , rental revenue or rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition that is significantly different than the underlying contract terms .

This property is currently leased on an absolute-net lease basis to Midcontinent Independent System Operator , Inc. through April 2028 . <p> About Griffin Capital Company , LLCLed by senior executives with more than two decades of real estate experience collectively encompassing over $22 billion of transaction value and more than 650 transactions , Griffin Capital and its affiliates have a portfolio consisting of approximately 42 million square feet of space , located in 30 states and the United Kingdom , representing approximately $7.6 billion(5) in asset value , based on purchase price , as of March 31 , 2017 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx526704 <p> 1 Total capitalization includes the outstanding debt balance , plus total equity raised in our public offering , net of redemptions . 2 There is no guarantee that our properties will remain 100% leased . 3 Net rent is based on ( a ) the contractual base rental payments assuming the lease requires the tenant to reimburse us for certain operating expenses or the property is self-managed by the tenant and the tenant is responsible for all , or substantially all , of the operating expenses ; or ( b ) contractual rent payments less certain operating expenses that are our responsibility for the 12-month period subsequent to December 31 , 2016 and includes assumptions that may not be indicative of the actual future performance of a property , including the assumption that the tenant will perform its obligations under its lease agreement during the next 12 months . 4 Of the 79.2% net rent , 68.3% is from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ( NRSRO ) credit rating , with the remaining 10.9% being from non-NRSRO , but having a rating that is equivalent to a NRSRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one example of a non-NRSRO rating . 5 Includes information related to interests in joint ventures . <p> Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time . Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions , many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient . <p> In order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT , the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( " NAREIT " ) promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( " FFO " ) . FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP , excluding extraordinary items , as defined by GAAP , and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property , adding back asset impairment write-downs , plus real estate related depreciation and amortization ( excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preferred distributions . Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets ( which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates ) , they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs . As a result , we believe that the use of FFO , together with the required GAAP presentations , provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating , financing , and investing activities . It should be noted , however , that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do , making comparisons less meaningful . <p> The Investment Program Association ( " IPA " ) issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 ( the " IPA MFFO Guideline " ) on November 2 , 2010 , which extended financial measures to include modified funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MFFO , FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent , amortization of in-place lease valuations , amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments , nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments , markto- market adjustments included in net income ( loss ) , and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income ( loss ) from the extinguishment or sale of debt , hedges , foreign exchange , derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan , unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from , or deconsolidation to , equity accounting , and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures , with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis . <p> Management is responsible for managing interest rate , hedge and foreign exchange risk . To achieve our objectives , we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates . In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments , if any , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure , if any , we may enter into foreign currency hedges . We view fair value adjustments of derivatives , impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as nonrecurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized , and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance . <p> Additionally , we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges , as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations , assessments regarding general market conditions , and the specific performance of properties owned , which can change over time . No less frequently than annually , we evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable . When indicators of potential impairment are present , we assess whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows ( including net rental and lease revenues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP ) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition . Investors should note , however , that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance , because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property , including estimated future net rental and lease revenues , net proceeds on the sale of the property , and certain other ancillary cash flows , are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred . <p> We adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a beneficial indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level . More specifically , MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT 's operations . MFFO , however , is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings . Further , since the measure is based on historical financial information , MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends . By providing FFO and MFFO , we present information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management 's analysis of long-term operating activities . MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions , as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs , as MFFO , or an equivalent measure , is routinely reported by non-traded REITs , and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes . As explained below , management 's evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations : <p> Revenues in excess of cash received , net . Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease . In accordance with GAAP , these contractual periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting . As straight-line rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings , FFO is adjusted for the effect of straight-line rent to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio . In addition , when applicable , in conjunction with certain acquisitions , we may enter into a master escrow or lease agreement with a seller , whereby the seller is obligated to pay us rent pertaining to certain spaces impacted by existing rental abatements . In accordance with GAAP , these proceeds are recorded as an adjustment to the allocation of real estate assets at the time of acquisition , and , accordingly , are not included in revenues , net income , or FFO . This application results in income recognition that can differ significantly from current contract terms . By adjusting for this item , we believe MFFO is reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases ( including master agreements ) that is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance . <p> Amortization of in-place lease valuation . Acquired in-place leases are valued as above-market or below-market as of the date of acquisition based on the present value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and ( b ) management 's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease for abovemarket leases . The above-market and below-market lease values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases . As amortization of in-place lease valuation is a non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings , FFO is adjusted for the effect of the amortization to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio . <p> Acquisition-related costs . We were organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in incomeproducing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders . In the process , we incur non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs , which in accordance with GAAP are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income ( loss ) from operations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for as a business combination . These costs have been funded with cash proceeds from our Primary Offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate . If we acquire a property after all offering proceeds from our Primary Offering have been invested , there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs . Accordingly , unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor , such costs will be paid from additional debt , operational earnings or cash flow , net proceeds from the sale of properties , or ancillary cash flows . In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time , management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments ' revenues and expenses . Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results , cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired , as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made . However , it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after we cease to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis , which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours . Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management . <p> Gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt . We use debt as a partial source of capital to acquire properties in our portfolio . As a term of obtaining this debt , we will pay financing costs to the respective lender . Financing costs are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability , consistent with debt discounts and amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt . We consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt was used to acquire properties . From time to time , we may cancel certain debt obligations and replace these canceled debt obligations with new debt at more favorable terms to us . In doing so , we are required to write off the remaining capitalized financing costs associated with the canceled debt , which we consider to be a cost , or loss , on extinguishing such debt . Management believes that this loss is considered an event not associated with our operations , and therefore , deems this write off to be an exclusion from MFFO . <p> Unrealized gains ( losses ) on derivative instruments . These adjustments include unrealized gains ( losses ) from mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate swaps and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness . The change in fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as a hedge and the change in fair value of the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are non-cash adjustments recognized directly in earnings and are included in interest expense . We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these reasons , we believe the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO , in addition to income ( loss ) from operations , net income ( loss ) and cash flows from operating activities , as defined by GAAP , are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio . However , a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash , such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt , are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO . The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if we do not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above . MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods , and in particular , after the offering and acquisition stages are complete . However , FFO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining FFO and MFFO . Therefore , FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as a more prominent measure of performance than income ( loss ) from operations , net income ( loss ) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements . Neither the SEC , NAREIT , nor any other applicable regulatory body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure . In the future , the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry , and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure . <p> Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the three months ended March 31 , 2017 and 2016 ( dollars in thousands ) : <p> 1 Adjusted EBITDA , as defined in our credit facility agreement , is calculated as net income ( loss ) before interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition fees and expenses , asset and property management fees , straight-line rents and in-place lease amortization for the period less certain reserves for capital expenditures. 2 Interest coverage is the ratio of interest expense as if the corresponding debt was in place at the beginning of the period to adjusted EBITDA. 3 Fixed charge coverage is the ratio of principal amortization for the period plus interest expense as if the corresponding debt were in place at the beginning of the period plus preferred unit distributions as if in place at the beginning of the period over adjusted EBITDA. 116697 @qwx526697 116689 @qwx526689 116690 @qwx526690 116705 @qwx526705 <h> Attention 116708 @qwx526708

Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions , many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation . While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years , we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases . <p> In order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT , the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( " NAREIT " ) promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( " FFO " ) . FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP , excluding extraordinary items , as defined by GAAP , and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property , adding back asset impairment write-downs , plus real estate related depreciation and amortization ( excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets ) , and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships , joint ventures and preferred distributions . Because FFO calculations exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets ( which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates ) , they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs . As a result , we believe that the use of FFO , together with the required GAAP presentations , provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating , financing , and investing activities . It should be noted , however , that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do , making comparisons less meaningful . <p> The Investment Program Association ( " IPA " ) issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 ( the " IPA MFFO Guideline " ) on November 2 , 2010 , which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations ( " MFFO " ) . In computing MFFO , FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-cash items such as straight-line rent , amortization of in-place lease valuations , amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments , nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments , mark-to-market adjustments included in net income ( loss ) , and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income ( loss ) from the extinguishment or sale of debt , hedges , foreign exchange , derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan , unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from , or deconsolidation to , equity accounting , and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures , with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis . Management is responsible for managing interest rate , hedge and foreign exchange risk . To achieve our objectives , we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates . In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments , if any , we may enter into interest rate cap agreements or other hedge instruments and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency hedges . We view fair value adjustments of derivatives , impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized , and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance . <p> Additionally , we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges , as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations , assessments regarding general market conditions , and the specific performance of properties owned , which can change over time . No less frequently than annually , we evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable . When indicators of potential impairment are present , we assess whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows ( including net rental and lease revenues , net proceeds on the sale of the property , and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets and the eventual disposition . Investors should note , however , that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance , because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property , including estimated future net rental and lease revenues , net proceeds on the sale of the property , and certain other ancillary cash flows , are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred . While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above , investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations , it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event . <p> We adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a beneficial indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level . More specifically , MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT 's operations . MFFO , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings . Further , since the measure is based on historical financial information , MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends . By providing FFO and MFFO , we present information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management 's analysis of long-term operating activities . MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions , as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs , as MFFO , or an equivalent measure , is routinely reported by non-traded REITs , and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes . As explained below , management 's evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations : <p> Straight-line rent . Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease . In accordance with GAAP , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting . As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings , FFO is adjusted for the effect of straight-line rent to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio . <p> Amortization of in-place lease valuation . Acquired in-place leases are valued as above-market or below-market as of the date of acquisition based on the present value of the difference between ( a ) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and ( b ) management 's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease for above-market leases . The above-market and below-market lease values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases . As this item is a non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings , FFO is adjusted for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio . <p> Acquisition-related costs . We were organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders . In the process , we incur non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs , which in accordance with GAAP , are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income ( loss ) from operations and net income ( loss ) . These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from our Public Offerings or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate . If we acquire a property after all offering proceeds from our Public Offerings have been invested , there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs . Accordingly , unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor , such costs will be paid from additional debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of properties , or ancillary cash flows . In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time , management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments ' revenues and expenses . Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results , cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired , as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets . By excluding acquisition-related costs , MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made . However , it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after we cease to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis , which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours . Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination fee . We believe that a fee received from a tenant for terminating a lease is appropriately included as a component of rental revenue and therefore included in MFFO . If , however , the termination fee is to be paid over time , we believe the recognition of such termination fee into income should not be included in MFFO . Alternatively , we believe that the periodic amount paid by the tenant in subsequent periods to satisfy the termination fee obligation should be included in MFFO . <p> Gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt . We use debt as a partial source of capital to acquire properties in our portfolio . As a term of obtaining this debt , we will pay financing costs to the respective lender . Financing costs are capitalized as a component of total assets on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt . We consider the amortization expense to be a component of operations if the debt was used to acquire properties . From time to time , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations with new debt at more favorable terms to us . In doing so , we are required to write off the remaining capitalized financing costs associated with the canceled debt , which we consider to be a cost , or loss , on extinguishing such debt . Management will no longer consider the effect of amortization of these financing costs in operating models and also believes that this loss is considered an isolated event not associated with our operations , and therefore , deems this write off to be an exclusion from MFFO . <p> Preferred units redemption premium . Preferred units were issued as a partial source of capital to acquire properties . As a term of the purchase agreement , we paid issuance costs to the investor that were capitalized as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets . Further , the purchase agreement allows us to exercise our right to redeem the outstanding preferred units , and , in doing so , we will be obligated to pay a redemption fee . In conjunction with the redemption , GAAP requires us to write off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred units to the total amount of preferred units issued . The write off of the issuance costs would be reflected on the statement of operations as a loss due to preferred unit redemptions . Management believes the loss , similar to the extinguishment of debt , is considered an isolated event not associated with our operations , and therefore , deems this write off to be an exclusion from MFFO . <p> For all of these reasons , we believe the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO , in addition to income ( loss ) from operations , net income ( loss ) and cash flows from operating activities , as defined by GAAP , are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio . However , a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash , such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt , are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO . Additionally , MFFO has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value . The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if we do not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above . MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods , and in particular , after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed . However , MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO . Therefore , FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income ( loss ) from operations , net income ( loss ) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements . <p> Neither the SEC , NAREIT , nor any other applicable regulatory body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a non-GAAP performance measure . In the future , the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry , and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure . <p> Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2016 and 2015 ( in thousands ) : 116697 @qwx526697 116693 @qwx526693 116705 @qwx526705 <h> Attention 116709 @qwx526709

Bloomberg 's default risk rating is an example of a non-NRSRO rating . 4 Total capitalization includes the outstanding debt balance plus total equity raised and issued , including operating partnership units , net of redemptions . 5 Includes information related to interests in joint ventures . <p> Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time . Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions , many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation . While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years , we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases . <p> In order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT , the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( " NAREIT " ) promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( " FFO " ) . FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP , excluding extraordinary items , as defined by GAAP , and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property , adding back asset impairment write-downs , plus real estate related depreciation and amortization ( excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets ) , and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships , joint ventures and preferred distributions . Because FFO calculations exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets ( which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates ) , they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs . As a result , we believe that the use of FFO , together with the required GAAP presentations , provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating , financing , and investing activities . It should be noted , however , that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do , making comparisons less meaningful . <p> The Investment Program Association ( " IPA " ) issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 ( the " IPA MFFO Guideline " ) on November 2 , 2010 , which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations ( " MFFO " ) . In computing MFFO , FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-cash items such as straight-line rent , amortization of in-place lease valuations , amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments , nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments , mark-to-market adjustments included in net income ( loss ) , and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income ( loss ) from the extinguishment or sale of debt , hedges , foreign exchange , derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan , unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from , or deconsolidation to , equity accounting , and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures , with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis . Management is responsible for managing interest rate , hedge and foreign exchange risk . To achieve our objectives , we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates . In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments , if any , we may enter into interest rate cap agreements or other hedge instruments and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency hedges . We view fair value adjustments of derivatives , impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized , and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance . <p> Additionally , we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges , as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations , assessments regarding general market conditions , and the specific performance of properties owned , which can change over time . No less frequently than annually , we evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable . When indicators of potential impairment are present , we assess whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows ( including net rental and lease revenues , net proceeds on the sale of the property , and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets and the eventual disposition . Investors should note , however , that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance , because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property , including estimated future net rental and lease revenues , net proceeds on the sale of the property , and certain other ancillary cash flows , are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred . While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above , investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations , it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to any liquidity event . <p> We adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a beneficial indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level . More specifically , MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT 's operations . MFFO , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings . Further , since the measure is based on historical financial information , MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends . By providing FFO and MFFO , we present information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management 's analysis of long-term operating activities . MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions , as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs , as MFFO , or an equivalent measure , is routinely reported by non-traded REITs , and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes . As explained below , management 's evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations : <p> Straight-line rent . Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease . In accordance with GAAP , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting . As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings , FFO is adjusted for the effect of straight-line rent to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio . <p> Amortization of in-place lease valuation . Acquired in-place leases are valued as above-market or below-market as of the date of acquisition based on the present value of the difference between ( a ) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and ( b ) management 's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease for above-market leases . The above-market and below-market lease values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases . As this item is a non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings , FFO is adjusted for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio . <p> Acquisition-related costs . We were organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders . In the process , we incur non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs , which in accordance with GAAP , are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income ( loss ) from operations and net income ( loss ) . These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from our Public Offerings or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate . If we acquire a property after all offering proceeds from our Public Offerings have been invested , there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs . Accordingly , unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor , such costs will be paid from additional debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of properties , or ancillary cash flows . In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time , management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments ' revenues and expenses . Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results , cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired , as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets . By excluding acquisition-related costs , MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made . However , it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after we cease to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis , which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours . Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination fee . We believe that a fee received from a tenant for terminating a lease is appropriately included as a component of rental revenue and therefore included in MFFO . If , however , the termination fee is to be paid over time , we believe the recognition of such termination fee into income should not be included in MFFO . Alternatively , we believe that the periodic amount paid by the tenant in subsequent periods to satisfy the termination fee obligation should be included in MFFO . <p> Gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt . We use debt as a partial source of capital to acquire properties in our portfolio . As a term of obtaining this debt , we will pay financing costs to the respective lender . Financing costs are capitalized as a component of total assets on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt . We consider the amortization expense to be a component of operations if the debt was used to acquire properties . From time to time , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations with new debt at more favorable terms to us . In doing so , we are required to write off the remaining capitalized financing costs associated with the canceled debt , which we consider to be a cost , or loss , on extinguishing such debt . Management will no longer consider the effect of amortization of these financing costs in operating models and also believes that this loss is considered an isolated event not associated with our operations , and therefore , deems this write off to be an exclusion from MFFO . <p> Preferred units redemption premium . Preferred units were issued as a partial source of capital to acquire properties . As a term of the purchase agreement , we paid issuance costs to the investor that were capitalized as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets . Further , the purchase agreement allows us to exercise our right to redeem the outstanding preferred units , and , in doing so , we will be obligated to pay a redemption fee . In conjunction with the redemption , GAAP requires us to write off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred units to the total amount of preferred units issued . The write off of the issuance costs would be reflected on the statement of operations as a loss due to preferred unit redemptions . Management believes the loss , similar to the extinguishment of debt , is considered an isolated event not associated with our operations , and therefore , deems this write off to be an exclusion from MFFO . <p> For all of these reasons , we believe the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO , in addition to income ( loss ) from operations , net income ( loss ) and cash flows from operating activities , as defined by GAAP , are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio . However , a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash , such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt , are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO . Additionally , MFFO has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value . The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if we do not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above . MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods , and in particular , after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed . However , MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO . Therefore , FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income ( loss ) from operations , net income ( loss ) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements . <p> Neither the SEC , NAREIT , nor any other applicable regulatory body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a non-GAAP performance measure . In the future , the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry , and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure . <p> Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2016 and 2015 ( in thousands ) : 116697 @qwx526697 116693 @qwx526693 116705 @qwx526705 <h> Attention 116709 @qwx526709

We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our interest rate swap agreements . <p> For all of these reasons , we believe the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO , in addition to income ( loss ) from operations , net income ( loss ) and cash flows from operating activities , as defined by GAAP , are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash , such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt , are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO . Additionally , MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value . The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if we do not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above . MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods , and in particular , after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed . However , FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining FFO and MFFO . Therefore , FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , net income ( loss ) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements . <p> Neither the SEC , NAREIT , nor any other applicable regulatory body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure . In the future , the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry , and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure . <p> Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2016 and 2015 : 116697 @qwx526697 116689 @qwx526689 116690 @qwx526690 116705 @qwx526705 <h> Attention 116708 @qwx526708

( 3 ) Investment grade tenants are either tenants and/or guarantors with investment grade credit ratings or those whose non-guarantor parent companies have investment grade credit ratings . Of the 67.2% net rent , 59.2% is from a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ( NRSRO ) credit rating , with the remaining 8.0% being from a non-NRSRO , but having a rating that is equivalent to an NRSRO investment grade rating . Bloomberg 's default risk rating is an example of a non-NRSRO rating . ( 4 ) Total capitalization includes the outstanding debt balance plus total equity raised and issued , including operating partnership units , net of redemptions . ( 5 ) Includes information related to interests in joint ventures . <p> Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time . Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions , many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient . Additionally , publicly registered , non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation . While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years , we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases . <p> In order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT , the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( " NAREIT " ) promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( " FFO " ) . FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP , excluding extraordinary items , as defined by GAAP , and gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back asset impairment write-downs , plus real estate related depreciation and amortization ( excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets ) , and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships , joint ventures and preferred distributions . Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets ( which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates ) , they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs . As a result , we believe that the use of FFO , together with the required GAAP presentations , provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating , financing , and investing activities . It should be noted , however , that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do , making comparisons less meaningful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 ( the " IPA MFFO Guideline " ) on November 2 , 2010 , which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations ( " MFFO " ) . In computing MFFO , FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent , amortization of in-place lease valuations , amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments , nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments , mark-to-market adjustments included in net income ( loss ) , and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income ( loss ) from the extinguishment or sale of debt , hedges , foreign exchange , derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan , unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from , or deconsolidation to , equity accounting , and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures , with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis . Management is responsible for managing interest rate , hedge and foreign exchange risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed rates or variable rates . In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments , if any , we may enter into interest rate cap agreements or other hedge instruments and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure , if any , we may enter into foreign currency hedges . We view fair value adjustments of derivatives , impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized , and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance . Additionally , we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges , as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations , assessments regarding general market conditions , and the specific performance of properties owned , which can change over time . No less frequently than annually , we evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable . When indicators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows ( including net rental and lease revenues , net proceeds on the sale of the property , and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP ) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition . Investors should note , however , that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance , because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property , including estimated future net rental and lease revenues , net proceeds on the sale of the property , and certain other ancillary cash flows , are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred . While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO as described above , investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations , it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flows prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a beneficial indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level . More specifically , MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT 's operations . MFFO , however , is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings . Further , since the measure is based on historical financial information , MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends . By providing FFO and MFFO , we present information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management 's analysis of long-term operating activities . MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions , as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs , as MFFO , or an equivalent measure , is routinely reported by non-traded REITs , and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations : <p> Straight-line rent . Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease . In accordance with GAAP , these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting . As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings , FFO is adjusted for the effect of straight-line rent to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio . <p> Amortization of in-place lease valuation . Acquired in-place leases are valued as above-market or below-market as of the date of acquisition based on the present value of the difference between ( a ) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and ( b ) management 's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases . As this item is a non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings , FFO is adjusted for the effect of the amortization of in-place lease valuation to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio . <p> Acquisition-related costs . We were organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders . In the process , we incur non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs , which in accordance with GAAP , are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income ( loss ) from operations and net income ( loss ) . These costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash proceeds from our Primary Public Offerings or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate . If we acquire a property after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs . Accordingly , unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor , such costs will be paid from additional debt , operational earnings or cash flow , net proceeds from the sale of properties , or ancillary cash flows . In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time , management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments ' revenues and expenses . Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results , cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired , as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets . By excluding acquisition-related costs , MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made . However , it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after we cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours . Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management . <p> Financed termination fee . We believe that a fee received from a tenant for terminating a lease is appropriately included as a component of rental revenue and therefore included in MFFO . If , however , the termination fee is to be paid over time , we believe the recognition of such termination fee into income should not be included in MFFO . Alternatively , we believe that the periodic amount paid by the tenant in subsequent periods to satisfy the termination fee obligation should be included in MFFO . <p> Gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt . We use debt as a partial source of capital to acquire properties in our portfolio . As a term of obtaining this debt , we will pay financing costs to the respective lender . Financing costs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance sheets and amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt . We consider the amortization expense to be a component of operations if the debt was used to acquire properties . From time to time , we may cancel certain debt obligations and replace these canceled debt obligations with new debt at more favorable terms to us . In doing so , we are required to write off the remaining capitalized financing costs associated with the canceled debt , which we consider to be a cost , or loss , on extinguishing such debt . Management will no longer consider the effect of amortization of these financing costs in operating models and also believes that this loss is considered an isolated event not associated with our operations , and therefore , deems this write off to be an exclusion from MFFO . <p> Preferred units redemption premium . Preferred units were issued as a partial source of capital to acquire properties . As a term of the purchase agreement , we paid issuance costs to the investor that were capitalized as a component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchase agreement allowed us to exercise our right to redeem the outstanding preferred units , and , in doing so , we were obligated to pay a redemption fee . In conjunction with the redemption , GAAP requires us to write off the issuance costs on a proportional basis of the redeemed preferred units to the total amount of preferred units issued . The write off of the issuance costs are reflected on the statement of operations as a loss due to preferred unit redemptions . Management believes the loss , similar to the extinguishment of debt , is considered an isolated event not associated with our continuing operations , and therefore , deems it an exclusion from MFFO . <p> For all of these reasons , we believe the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO , in addition to income ( loss ) from operations , net income ( loss ) and cash flows from operating activities , as defined by GAAP , are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio . However , a material limitation associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash , such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt , are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO . Additionally , MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value . The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if we do not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above . MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods , and in particular , after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed . However , MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining MFFO . Therefore , FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent a measure of performance than income ( loss ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements . <p> Neither the SEC , NAREIT , nor any other applicable regulatory body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure . In the future , the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry , and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure . <p> Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the three months ended March 31 , 2016 and 2015 ( in thousands ) : 116689 @qwx526689 116695 @qwx526695 116696 @qwx526696 <h> Attention 116706 @qwx526706
