@@23757164 @3757164/ <h> HTML Made ( Hopefully ) Easy . <p> Fronkensteen requested a tutorial on links , so I thought I 'd go the whole hog . Well , nearly the whole hog , as I do n't know the whole hog myself . I do know the basics however , so here we go . Oh , p.s. this is technically called BB code , as Flawed Perfection ; ; pointed out . HTML uses &lt; &gt; brackets but is virtually the same , however it wo n't work in Mibba stories etc . <p> Intro : <p> All html is written in brackets - on Mibba , they are the square ones - and . You place your brackets either side of the text you want to change.Like so : -text/-A forward slash is used in the last bracket to tell the computer you now want to stop the code . <p> The difference comes in the code you put in the brackets . The following have spaces in between the brackets , because otherwise they would change the text and you would n't be able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a size code , and a color code . The order in which you place the brackets is important here - you want them to be like a russian doll , if that makes any sense . A box in a box . Like so : ( If I want to change the color of a link ) url = http : **25;0;TOOLONG color = # 00FF2D My Homepage / color / url My HomepageInstead of:My Homepage ( color codes both on left handside of url code ) or color=00FF2DMy Homepage <p> Other Common Mistakes : <p> Not putting the / in the last bracket.e.g . ( Here only the ' italics ' should be in italics ) italics blah blah blah . <p> Not writing one of the brackets.e.g . ( Again , only ' italics ' should be in italics ) blah blah blah italics <p> Putting in an unnecessary space.e.g. iitalics <p> Forgetting one of the brackets.e.g. iitalics <p> Not putting the # in the color bracket.e.g. color=0000FFcolor <p> Not putting the = in the link bracket , e.g. LONG ... <p> Also , one last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For some reason , comments on profiles do n't like url codes , but they will accept standard italics and bold codes . For me , the centre code does n't seem to work anywhere except for my signature . <p> In Conclusion : <p> You 'll notice I 've used various of these codes on titles etc. - once you get the hang of them , they 're pretty easy to type in . Make sure to use the preview button , if you can , to make sure you 've got them right . And remember to remove all the spaces when you try them out ! <p> Any others you want to know ? If I know them , I 'll put them up . : cute:Hope this is useful !

Now , it 's not going to be easy . You need to be a local star before you become a national sensation , and it does n't happen overnight . It 's a long , bumpy road , but hang in there and soon we 'll be hearing you on the radio ! <p> First of all , you 're gon na have to believe in yourself . Be positive , keep your head up , and most importantly , be confident . The music industry does n't want a timid sheep on their stage ! They want a fierce lion , who pushes herself/himself to the limit . <p> If you 're really serious about becoming the next big thing , you may want to invest in some vocal tuition . You may not need it , but even if you 're singing is amazing , it will definitely improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to work out what sort of voice you have , and what kind of genre is suited for your voice . Your voice coach will tell you what you need to know . <p> Record yourself singing . Most phones have voice recorders now , but if you have a tape recorder , that 's absolutely fine . You need to know how good you sound and where you can improve . I know it 's hard , and a bit cringeworthy hearing your own voice on tape , but trust me , it is totally worth it . <p> The next step requires absolute confidence in yourself . Have you ever heard about Justin Bieber 's success story ? You know what I 'm going to say next , do n't you ! Yes , record yourself on video ! It 's not that hard . Choose a song that is suited for your voice , and just go for it ! Upload it on Youtube , Facebook , Myspace , really spread it . You need to make yourself noticed , push yourself up the ladder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all natural . The music industry is all about taking chances . But get ready for negative and constructive criticism . There will be some haters , but just let them keep on hating . Every pop star has haters . Take Justin Bieber for example . You ca n't let them rule your life ! <p> Now it 's time for you to make a decision . Roll solo , or make a band ? If you 've already made up your mind , then great ! If not , you may want to consider the benefits of bands . If you 're not THAT confident in singing all by yourself , then go for it ! Ask around , go on a few websites . A good one to go on is a talent website called Starnow . If you have made up a band already and need some inspiration , check out a band called Cut Ribbons . Go on , Google them ! They 're local stars in my area , and I happen to know them ! They 've helped me out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 've had songs on the radio , AND they 've won Best British Band ! You can do that to , if you put your mind to it ! <p> From here , you need to get your voice heard . Book a gig to play at , or go to an open mic night ! You 're sure to get noticed . Many clubs and bars hire local artists and bands . And if you hear of a local big event , you 've really hit the jackpot ! Do n't be afraid to make yourself known . Ask your friends and family to spread the word about your performance . Be ambitious . Through time , you 'll collect fans and followers . <p> How about making yourself known on a few social networks , too ? The first thing you need to do though , is make a website for you or your band . There are a few good ones to choose from such as Webs or Wix . Both are simply straightforward and easy to use . Then , you may want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have enough fans , a Twitter account for yourself/your band . The limit is sky high . Record a demo , and Google record labels in your local area . Contact one , send them the song ! If they do n't like it , it 's okay ! As they say , plenty more fish in the sea . If they do , then that 's amazing , well done . You could also send the track to your local radio station . If it 's broadcast worthy , then they 'll play it ! <p> I hope this helps , and good luck ! I hope to see you on the ladder of fame soon !

I will be answering those questions . By the end of this , I hope to answer all of your questions ! <p> How to get the Layout : <p> This is something very easy to do , but for those who are unfamiliar with Mibba , it seems impossible at first . I will give you two ways to get to the layout page . <p> One : Go to the top of the page and click My Mibba , so that it takes you to your own Mibba page .

It tells you exactly how to do everything from bold to font types . <p> If you have any problems understanding , comment and I will answer . <p> That 's all I can think of at the moment , but if anyone else has any questions , ask them and I will answer to the best of my Ability .

@@23757169 @3757169/ <h> How to Respect Someone 's Opinion <p> Personally , I 've come into contact with a lot of people who disagree with me . Maybe it 's because I have " radical " beliefs , " insane " policies . Whatever the reason , I 've also often noticed that these people fail to display their differing opinions in a way of grace .. commonly doing so with rude words , insults , or just plain uneducated naivety and coming off narrow-minded . Obviously , I do n't hold any of my personal beliefs , opinions , or policies above anyone else 's . But I do respect . It is needed and appreciated if you plan on having your opinion be taking seriously or even considered . <p> Do n't be CynicalBasically , this rule goes for anything and everything in life . If you 're going to present an idea or action to someone ( especially if they 're going to probably disagree ) , do n't hold yourself to less principals then you 'd hold the other person . Do n't be motivated by extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally believe is right/correct---the other person will be much more likely to understand , take seriously , consider , and possibly agree if you speak in way that shows , although you are concerned about yourself , you also care for what happens to others and what their opinion happens to be . <p> If You Have Nothing Nice to Say , Do n't Say AnythingMaybe the other person is being an asshole . Maybe they are annoying . Maybe they 're even wrong . Maybe they are n't . Whatever the case is , if you 're going to open your mouth solely for the purpose of calling them out , insulting them , or being bitter .... Do n't speak at all ! Speak what 's needed and cut to the main course and do n't get caught up in being a jerk . It never works and---get this---people wont take you seriously . <p> Do n't be IrrelevantThis can be considered one wit the rule above , but it 's so important that it needs to be noted . Do n't point out the person 's flaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current topic . Do n't talk about their misspelling , do n't talk about a misplaced comma or period , just do n't . If you do n't have anything else to debate on whatever the two of you are speaking about , just walk away , because chances are , if you retort to this tactic ..... people wont take you seriously ! <p> Try to Understand Their POVIf you want to be understood yourself , you need to at least attempt to comprehend them . You do n't have to agree , you do n't have to be their new best friend . You do n't even have to like the person . But , the first step to being understood is understanding . Simple . <p> Kill ' Em with KindnessWhen you 're too tall to be talked down to , it 's hard to do , right ? Right . If someone wants to argue/debate farther despite what you want , smile and say , " That 's okay . I 'm cool with whatever you think . I do n't care . " It takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nice , lovely , and wonderful about it ... nothing 's better . <p> R-E-S-P-E-C-TYou 're not the same person . You do n't walk the same , you do n't talk the same ... and you absolutely do n't think the same . And that 's okay ! But , let me tell you , saying " LOL . Fuck you , buddy " against " I respect your opinion , but I do n't agree . That 's okay , though . I do n't need to . I hope you feel the same way , pal . " makes all of the difference in the world . Take the high road and you 'll be joined in return , I promise . <p> Do n't Try to Change OpinionsThis one is easy to preach , but rather hard to carry out . Not everyone in the world needs to have your mind , your thoughts , you opinions , your religion , whatever . If it 's not hurting you physically , walk away !

These are the feelings one usually gets on the first day at a new school , when traveling to a new location , or when meeting someone for the first time . Throughout the novel To Kill a Mockingbird , the children continuously encounter uncomfortable circumstances which force them to find meaning by interpreting information and educating themselves . Harper Lee uses the children and their experiences to show that irrational beliefs and fear of the unknown can be eliminated by education and knowledge . <p> Without evidence , the children initially blame unfortunate occurrences on the unknown . Lee opens the novel with the children attempting to find logic and reason for the events leading to Jems broken arm and subsequent deformity . Scout and Jem debate whether the accident occurred because of the encounter with the Ewells or because of Dills suggestion of coaxing Boo Radley out of his house . The compulsion by the children to illogically blame misfortune and tragedy on unfounded beliefs and superstition reoccurs throughout the novel . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unknown . This is evident when Miss Stephanie Crawford , the neighborhood " scold , " reinforces the childrens fear with an unsubstantiated account of Boos violence with a pair of scissors.When Dill , who is endlessly drawn to and fascinated by Boo and the allure of the Radley Place , asks Jem what he thinks Boo looks like , we see a childs vivid imagination at work : " Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall , judging from his tracks ; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch , that 's why his hands were bloodstainedif you ate an animal raw , you could never wash the blood off . There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face ; what teeth he had were yellow and rotten ; his eyes popped , and he drooled most of the time " . <p> Because Jem has never seen Boo Radley , he combines rumors , gossip , and his own lack of knowledge to concoct the worst description imaginable . <p> Due to their age , the children are confined to safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have limited mobility and are unfamiliar with the world outside of Maycomb County , which had recently been told that it had " nothing to fear but fear itself " Their summertime boundaries are Mrs. Dubose two doors north , and the Radley Place three doors to the south . Both boundaries are described as gray , uninviting places with a " malevolent phantom " in one and Mrs. Dubose , who is " plain hell , " in the other . Harper Lee uses the color gray to symbolize mystery , uncertainty , and fear of the unknown in the childrens otherwise black and white world . The gray Radley estate with its rotted shingles and " slate-gray yard , " the " gray , " aged Mrs. Dubose , and Dills copy of the fictional Gray Ghost , all contribute to the childrens anxiety and sense of confusion about the world around them.The childrens sense of curiosity and wonder , their need to gain knowledge , compels them to conquer their fears by leaving their innocent , safe world , crossing the boundaries , and entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reside and answers are found . <p> As the events of the novel unfold , the children are forced by fate to enter the gray world and distinguish the difference between what they have been " taught " by others about morality and what they have learned through their own experiences . As the children learn more about Boo , with the discovery of the items in the tree knothole and the unexpected return of Jems newly sewn pants , for example , their irrational fears begin to diminish as true knowledge triumphs . Similarly , when Jem is forced by Atticus as punishment to read to Mrs. Dubose , he learns that she is not the gray , old women from Hell the children had imagined . In the final chapter , as the dramatic events conclude and Scout finds herself face to face with Boo , all her insecurities and " gray " fears melt away as she recognizes that Boo is a kind , decent human being , and indeed , her protector .

The children , like all of us , embark on a journey through life in which they are forced to leave their black and white comfort zones and sort through the gray areas to determine for themselves whether their actions and beliefs are moral in a civilized society . Through their individual experiences , and with the guidance and wisdom of their father Atticus , they learn that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird and that one never knows another unless he stands in his shoes and walks around in them .

During the following school day , the body begins to feel the true impact of this fatigue , and the student feels the need to fall asleep during those few moments when his teachers are at their most banal . The students eyes begin to droop . He starts to nod off and the weight of his colossal head becomes overwhelming . It is at these moments that one should take certain precautions in falling asleep . <p> Falling asleep in the classroom is fantastic , but missing important information is not . Be sure to sleep only when something completely insignificant is occurring in the classroom , such as those few moments that the teacher allows for the opportunity to work during the class on homework ; even teachers forget that homework assignments are meant to be done at home . A great time to sleep is when the class has to sit through another three and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate to real life , excepting the test the following week .

Yes , those long dreary hours of listening to the teacher drone on and on really do come in handy for something . The student should be sure there is someone else taking notes . This is closely associated with the first issue , but it includes the participation from a well-rested individual . This individual should be a close friend rather than an unknown person , who could be apathetic to the condition of the sleeper . There is such a thing as a few good Samaritans that will help a sleep-deprived student , but such an occurrence is rare and should not be depended on . <p> The final issue to address is learning to place the body in a comfortable but not an exuberant position . Examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to : moving the head completely back to stare up at the ceiling , placing the head on a flat surface and allowing the oral passage to open while creating rivers of saliva , using the arms as pillows , and finally , the neck joint at a ninety degree angle with the head suspended awkwardly . There is also the infamous " head bobble . " This movement is perhaps one of the most obvious manners of sleeping . It is the sleeper nodding his head with droopy eyes and suddenly awaking as they feel the sensation of falling . Certain people even have the habit of snoring in class , which causes major issues in both the art of slumber as well as common courtesy . <p> While slumbering in a subtle manner , it is necessary to cover the eye that is closest to the teacher .

As teachers begin to grow more adept at busting chops , so , too , should students become more artistic . The final thing to learn is that sleeping in class is a unique craft that must evolve . Try new methods of sleeping or perhaps different times to sleep , and if that works , keep doing it until the teacher grows aware ; then do something else . By following these guidelines and building more methods , it is possible to become the best sleeper the world has ever seen , or more appropriately , not seen .

@@23757177 @3757177/ <h> Private to Public School - The Social Difference <p> I adressed , in my previous article 1 , the consequences of bullying . I understand that this is something that is a huge problem in public schools around the world , by ' popular ' kids who reign superior . I know because I used to go to public school , and to be honest it made my life a living hell . Kids are degraded , abused , even physically beaten every day because they just do n't fit in . They 've done nothing , but they 're still hurt because they have less power than the kids who are hurting them . They 're helpless . They ca n't do anything about it , and can only try and withstand being wounded . If this situation is familiar to you , you may find that private school is a drastic and life-changing alternative . <p> As a girl who made the switch from public to private school several years ago , the differences in my classmates ' attitude , my social life and the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that the ' popular kids ' would terrorize their lesser classmates ( my friends and I ) to the point of physical pain . Fistfights , degrading , insults ... all of it was completely normal to me . The teachers did n't help- they either did n't know , or honestly did n't care too much to bother . <p> This all changed when I moved to private school in the seventh grade . As private schools only allow a select few children in , children with great attitudes and respect for others , my classmates proved to not only be extremely kind , but they were also ambitious , well-mannered and goal-oriented as well . Even at the age of twelve , the kids were surprisingly welcoming , offering to show me around the school and saving seats for me at lunchtime . When I was coaxed into singing that day for the school assembly , the nice girls who had showed me around gave me a standing ovation , cheering and clapping so loud that the entire grade joined in . <p> Not only were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment changed drastically . In public school , everyone was at eachother 's necks , fighting for popularity . But when I came to private school , I found that , as impossible as it may seem , everyone was perfectly civil towards another . It was n't like we were all best friends , but there was an air of respect around the school , and we all respected each other 's goals and beliefs , regardless of our differences . Getting good grades as not only encouraged by the school , it was encouraged by my classmates as well , and this alone drove me to get good grades and achieve my greatest . We were all open to change , and to make friends , and in this way everyone fit in and everyone was happy . <p> Even the teachers were in on it .

They knew every parent 's name , and they worked with us and really helped us do our best in school . <p> I found that I changed as well . I had supportive friends , and a supportive environment , and in this way I learned to love myself again . I no longer felt insecure about myself , and I was n't constantly trying to fit in . I could really find myself here , without the judgement of others . In public school , I had been part of the ' emo ' crowd , since it was really the only group that accepted me . But in private school , I realized that I could be anything I wanted to be , and over time I found who I really was , and my own style - an Indie-prep type , a girl who was nice to everyone and felt good about who she was .

This may be intimidating to some kids , but if you make sure to do your best , I assure you you 'll do just fine . <p> I understand that private school can be pricy , and some families may not be able to afford it . But make sure you try . Find your priorities here . Cut back your spending . Babysit . I assure you , when you find the right school , it 's all worth it . <p> Private school , for me , was a dream come true and soon became my home . Honestly , I ca n't praise it enough .

@@23757178 @3757178/ <h> How to Properly Kiss Up to Your Teacher <h> Be Quiet <p> The first step to properly kissing up to a teacher is being quite and at least acting like you 're paying attention . First impressions are VITAL when it comes to school especially to teachers . If you come in loud and obnoxious and are always smarting off then the teacher will immediately peg you for a class clown and start grading you extra harshly . Trust me , I know from frist hand experience , not the route to go . Stay quiet and attentive but most of all alert ! If your teacher has to call on you twice then she knows your not paying attention and will most likely call on you more often . This leaves more room for you to make a mistake and smart off , do n't  take that chance ! If you simply must fall asleep , sleep with your eyes open ! <h> Agree <p> If your teacher is one of those people who love to hear themselves talk and constantly lecture the class then nod your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put your opinion in there as long as its with the teachers of course . for example : teacher : I absolutely hate it when children are late to class ! student : I completely agree Mrs/Mr so and so , students need to be on time in order to learn and make something of themselves ! ' this will earn you brownie points I guarentee it . <h> Presents <p> Bring them gifts around the holidays and for their birthday , such as candles , chocolates , and flowers and when you hand it to them be sure to give them your sincerest smile and say , ' I was n't sure what you liked but I wanted to get you something since I feel as if I 've learned invaluable information in this classroom and because your one of the most devoted knowledgable teachers this school has to offer ' sure maybe this is a little sugarcoated and overdone but if your teacher is old then this is perfect ! <h> Homework <p> Turn in your homework early , at least a day early , and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know exactly how you feel , then simply make your answers sound educational and sound as if you truely tried . This will cause the teacher to believe you to be reliable and dependable and if something really does happen to your work and you do n't  have it , the teacher will most likely allow you to get away with it since more than not you always have your homework and on time . <h> Tutorials <p> Even if you do n't need help on your homework show up to tutorials every now and then just to be there and show the teacher that you like their classroom so much that you would spend time in it with your free time . Chat with them when they are n't busy helping other students and make small talk . <h> After Class <p> After the bell rings you can ask the teacher if they need help cleaning up , usually this is the case for some science class .

Click on the images to enlarge them and see the full view . <h> Step 2 : <p> The background for the layout will be the first thing I 'll go over . The only thing needed to be changed is the color for the background . I chose a light purple , though you can choose whatever color you 'd like . Suggestions : use duller colors , no bright , neon ' it hurts my eyes ' colors . Know that other people will see your layout on one of your stories , and trust me if it 's neon or has a gif image in the background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a background image , paste the URL in the image input , go to " repeat " and choose " repeat " . <h> Step 3 : <p> Next go to " content " . Here you will change the " background " , " text " and " box " . First go to background and change the color , I chose a lighter color from the forebackground . I suggest you do n't use a background image on this section , but if you will be using a bakcground , go to Skylineillusions and check the textures , use one of them as a background for the section . Make sure to credit her ! Go down to " text " and change the color to a readable color , I chose white . Change the font size to a 10px or 11px , something you can actually read . You may also change the font . The alignment can be changed too , to either left , right , justified , center or default . Change the link color to a visible color too . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 600px or lower . Margin top and bottom need to be a 10px or 5px . Now go to padding and delete all the pixels it has : 25 30 25 30 to 5px to all of them . As you go down to the rest of the options you will notice it has border to box shadow . Those are something to make your layouts more fancy . Though I will not be going through them . i 'm just simply showing you how to make a layout , you can explore those options later . <h> Step 4 : <p> Go to " title " . Change the background color to white and set the transparency to 100% . If you have a banner you made or an image you found on the Internet and would like to use it instead of having the text , paste the URL on the image input and go to " repeat " and click " no-repeat " . Go to text and change the color to white and set the transparency to 100% . Move to the box and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the image in the input area . Do n't change anything else . <h> Step 5 : <p> Subtitile is next , that 's the chapter title . Leave the background alone and move to the text . Change the color to one that will fit your color scheme of your layout . The change the font size , font , and alignment . In the preview that I show below , ignore the indent , that 's my mistake , sorry . <h> Step 6 : <p> The only thing needed to be changed in " text " is the color of the text , size , font and possibly the alignment . <h> Step 7 : <p> Next is " summary " . Ignore the background and move on to the text . Change the color to white , leave the transparency alone . Change font size , font , alignment , that 's it . Do not dare touch the box ! Leave that alone . <h> Step 8 : <p> Let 's go to chapters ! Almost done here ! Skip background and go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to what . Go to color and change it to the desire color you 'd like . You will see that the color you just changed belongs to what 's under the chaper links , being the description to the chapter the link takes you to . Now change the link color , that changes the link . You can also change the alignment . I decided to do this , but it 's optional to yours . Go to " indent " and type 35 , check what happens to the links . Do n't change anything from the box . <h> Step 9 : <p> Now to save your layout . You can either update an existing layout or make a new one . Set a title and either press enter or click " save " . And then you are done ! <p> Hope this helped with whoever was having trouble with the layout generator . Almost everything from this tutorial can be used to make blog layouts too !

Were all different , and what works for me is n't necessarily going to work for everyone . These are just some simple general ways to start living a little healthier because it can definitely be intimidating at first . <h> Diet and Exercise Are Both Equally Important <p> This does n't  hold true for everyone , there are always exceptions to any rule , but for the average person , it takes a combination of diet and exercise to become more fit or to lose weight . If you 're not eating the right foods and properly fueling your body , you 're not going to have the energy to exercise . Conversely , if you do n't  exercise , you 're not going to receive the health benefits that come along with it . <p> So many of my friends have fallen into the trap of thinking that the latest crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , and it just does n't  work that way . Crash diets are likely to fail , and when youre not receiving enough nutrients , your body goes into starvation mode , clinging on to every single thing that it gets and severely dropping your metabolism . Also , you can do an hour at the gym every day , but if you 're going home and eating an entire cheesecake or downing a bottle of wine , it kind of cancels that hour of exercise out . <h> Start Off Slowly and Simply <p> Much like the fable of the tortoise and the hare , slow and steady wins the race . Take it from me , its easy to have one grueling session at the gym , make these grand fitness goals , and then fall short because you bit off more than you could chew . As with anything in life , the best way to stick to something is to start off gradually and then work your way up from there . If you 're having trouble with eating healthy , begin by having one healthy meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives . For example , swapping fried chicken for grilled or baked chicken . <p> With exercise , start with simple cardio and body weight workouts . Do what 's easy for you but still gets you up and moving . For example , try to incorporate a walk into your daily routine , take up a fun fitness class , the possibilities are endless . It has to be something that you enjoy doing because if its something you absolutely hate , you 're not going to continue doing it . <h> Pay Attention to Your Body <p> A lot of us have issues with overeating because we eat when were emotional or bored or just because we want something , and one part of healthy living is learning how to view food as fuel and paying attention to our bodies . Most of the time , hunger is more mental than physical . Now , this is not to say that whenever you feel hungry , you should ignore it . Our bodies are amazing machines , and we need to eat well-rounded meals in order to keep ourselves running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mental hunger is to try drinking a glass of water and having a thirty minute span between when you first felt hungry to when you have your meal .

Plus , a lot of times when we feel hungry , our bodies are really just crying out for water . <h> Stay Motivated ! <p> There are countless ways to keep that initial spark of motivation alive . A lot of people find motivation boards or little markers to show how far you 've come to be a helpful source . For me , I like keeping positive quotes everywhere and little reminders of why I 'm doing this , like a pair of shorts that I bought a couple of summers ago but werent able to fit into this past summer . <p> Be warned of the dangers of " fitspo . " While a lot of the quotes are inspirational , its never a good thing to compare yourself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way , and you never know if the women in the photos have attained those bodies through healthy and safe means . A lot of fitness models end up getting breast implants because losing breast tissue is a common result of aiming for that low percent of body fat , so if you have an image of a girl with six-pack abs , skinny arms and thighs , and DD-sized breasts in your head , you 're setting yourself up for disappointment . The only person you should ever be comparing yourself to is you , not your friends , not your favorite celebrity , but you . If you feel fitter , healthier , and happier than you did the day before , you 're on the right track . <p> Another aspect of staying motivated is to constantly be challenging yourself . Once you 've grown comfortable with a fitness routine , start switching it up ! There are a lot of great month-long challenges on Pinterest that work to improve a certain fitness move or target a specific muscle group , and these can be fun to incorporate into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals , try to cut some of the unhealthy things from your diet , like fried foods or alcohol . <h> Embrace Those Little Wins <p> Personally , I feel like this holds true for life in general , but really take the time to be proud of each small accomplishment you make . Do n't  judge your success based on the number on the scale or the amount of calories you 've consumed , appreciate every stride that you make . Even though I 've always been fairly active , when I first started out , I had so much trouble doing squats . I could crank out the crunches or the leg lifts as if they were nothing , but it was a struggle for me just to finish twenty squats because my glutes werent very strong . Last month , I incorporate a squat challenge into my workout routine , and I remember feeling so proud of myself when I could do two-hundred squats at the end of the month . Another little win for me was when I could fit comfortably back into my jeans because I 'd spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feeling of accomplishment , no matter how small , that really keeps you going and makes you begin to appreciate how far you 've come and what your body is capable of . <h> Do n't  Be Afraid to Indulge <p> One of the main things that keeps people from sticking with a healthy diet is that feeling of being restricted and focusing on all the things that they cant have . While its probably not the best idea to workout and eat healthy for the workweek and then binge on junk food all weekend , do n't  be afraid to have those things that you love . A pizza or a cupcake every now and then is n't going to totally derail your diet and exercise routine , it just has to be done in moderation . Personally , I 've found that once you start weaning off of all the junk food , you do n't  really crave it as much anymore . Do n't  get me wrong , I still have cravings , but instead of pining for cake and brownies , I crave healthier options like peanut butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your favorite foods without feeling guilty is to try to find healthier options that still satisfy your craving . I have countless recipes for my favorite baked goods saved that use substitutions or incorporate healthy foods like fruit and veggies to make them less terrible for you . For example , my mother is constantly craving hamburgers , and while she still has a Big Mac every now and then , most of the time , we have ground turkey meat burgers , salmon burgers , or veggie burgers instead . <h> Other Helpful Tips <p> Be sneaky ! Trick your mind by eating meals off of smaller plates . <p> Find ways to incorporate fun exercise into your day-to-day life ( I get most of my cardio from dancing like a fool ) . <p> Stay hydrated ! Sadly , most people do n't  drink enough water , and its so simple to keep a water bottle on hand or eat more foods that contain a lot of water . <p> Keep track of what you eat . While I do n't  endorse obsessively counting calories , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat in a day because it can be easy to end up snacking a lot or eating a lot of bad things . By keeping a food journal , you can be more of aware of just how much you eat and what you eat in the course of a day . <p> Fit healthy living into your lifestyle . The workweek can be busy and hectic , so try to squeeze in your workout at the time that is best suitable for you . To resist the call of the drive-thru , make healthy meals ahead of time so that when you get home , all you have to do is pop it in the microwave . <p> Most importantly , do n't  get discouraged . Everyone has their off-days , and just because you have one bad day does n't  mean that you have to give up or overcompensate by starving yourself the next day or pushing yourself too hard in the gym ( this kind of behavior can lead to eating disorders ) . Just remember that tomorrow is a new day and continue to live healthfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it certainly is n't easy , but the benefits of health and happiness are more than worth it .

Youve probably been taught by a dedicated tutor or laboured gruellingly over the fingering charts , trying to memorize the various notes . What most players are n't  taught , however , is how to clean their instrument . If you do n't  clean a brass instrument , all of the spittle ( yes , I know its disgusting to think about , but its true ) accumulates in the bends of your instrument . And trust me when I say it is n't pleasant to lift the mouthpiece up to your lips and notice a smell that reminds you strongly of a rotting corpse . This tutorial will show you how to fully clean your instrument cheaply and ( relatively ) quickly . <h> You will need ; <p> A bath , basin or something that will hold both water and your instrument . <p> Vaseline or another form of petroleum jelly . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the most important piece of kit aside from your instrument itself , and also the most expensive . Most music stores will sell you it at a range between 3-5 ( About $5-$8 ) . If you can get it , I highly recommend asking for Blue Juice . It 's one of the best on the market . <p> A cloth/duster and a roll of kitchen towel/toilet roll . <p> An old towel . <h> Procedure : <p> The first and most important thing to do is to remove everything from your instrument . And I mean everything . Valves , screws ( most cornets will have a screw that stops the frontmost tuning slide from falling off when you pull it out , as will many makes of trumpets ) , and I suggest taking the valve caps off as well . You should be left with the shell of your instrument . This will allow the water to flow quickly through the instrument . <p> Next , run a bath . No , I 'm not joking . Run a bath of water , quite warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath salts or bubble baths . Place your instrument slowly into the water , and leave it for about an hour . This will soften any grit and grime stuck to the insides of your instruments . I usually add the valve caps and mouthpiece in with this for about ten minutes , and then dry them off with some kitchen towel . <p> While you 're waiting on that finishing , its a good idea to grease up your tuning slides . This is where Vaseline comes in handy , but if you do n't  have any , valve oil can work just as well . Taking quite a generous amount of Vaseline on your finger , lather it on the part of your tuning slide that goes into the instrument . Rub it into the metal as well as you can , and then take another piece of kitchen towel , and take it all completely off . This removes any grime from your slides . Youd be surprised at how dirty they can get . Add another layer of Vaseline , this one much thinner than before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your slides , allowing them to move freely . <p> Next give your valves a wipe down . Youve probably been told not to do this , but it removes any crust , and gives you a clean slate to work with . Taking a cloth , just lightly rub the chamber a few times . Apply your valve oil to the main chamber ( this is the part below the spring , with all the holes in it ) , and sit them down again . <p> By this point , your trumpet or cornet should be ready to lift from the bath . Before removing it from the water , give it a shake around , firstly from left to right , and then up and down . You might see some flakes coming from the inside , especially where your mouthpiece attaches , but this is normal . Lift the instrument from the water , and put it on an old towel . Shake it carefully for a moment bell first to remove any water drops from the main part of your instrument . You now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend leaving it overnight to fully dry out . <p> When you 're sure that your instrument is dry , put a little Vaseline onto the exposed slide metal that is on your trumpet .

You may need to add a little more valve oil at this point . Blow some air through your instrument to check the valves are in the right way . If you find the air is blocked , turn the valves ninety-degrees at a time , checking to make sure that you can get a clear path of air to the bell . <p> And there you have it ! No fancy sprays , polishes or abrasive cleaners , and nothing too expensive . Just a simple and effective way to clean out the inside of your instrument and keep it smelling fresh ! And the best part ? You should n't have to do this more often than every six months . That means more time for playing and impressing your friends . 
@@23757183 @3757183/ <h> How to Beta Read <p> On Mibba , correct spelling , grammar , capitalization and formatting are thought of quite highly . They are part of the rules , for one , but they also play an important part in the success of your story . Despite the notable additive , " Never judge a book by its cover , " the aesthetic value of your story is important , and relies heavily on those four elements . If it looks sloppy and hastily put together , wrought with spelling and grammatical errors , people will not give it a chance . This is why betas usually focus the most on these technical applications , but a good beta can provide so many more benefits . But how can you do this ? <p> The first thing to do is read the piece . Read it with a clear mind . Read it as a reader , not a beta , and allow yourself to become immersed in the story the writer is telling . Be the audience , not the reviewer . When you 've done that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you feel once it was over ? What were your thoughts ? What were some questions you had ? Did you like it or did you hate it ?

And then you read it again . <p> On your second read , dissect the piece by paragraph . Focus on each paragraph as a mini-story of its own and break down each sentence . What you 're looking for here - besides technical spelling and grammatical errors - is syntax , cadence and vocabulary . Syntax , at its most basic form , is how we order our words . Cadence , though more often used in music , is the pace at which our words flow . And vocabulary , in the way that 's needed here , is simply how we use those words : word choice .

Beta readers should look for instances where contradictions are made , facts change , unintentional changes in tense occur , and any other inconsistencies . <p> An essential part of beta-reading a piece is providing the author with your opinions , but sometimes betas shy away from commenting on the content of a piece they are editing . They often feel that if they do , they may overstep a boundary and taint the piece with their views .

Make sure you 're both on the same page by having the author detail what they need you to do with their piece . Also , ask how theyd like changes to be made ; some authors do n't  mind if you directly edit the piece , while some would prefer if you left edits in the margins. <p> Take notes : While reading , make notes of things you like , things you do n't  like , things you 're confused about , and bring it up with the author . <p> Say it out loud : When reading , especially when it comes to dialogue , say it out loud to see if its sounds natural and not forced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsure of , look it up .

Because every writer works in their own unique way , Ive come up with five different tips to help you get started on planning your next plot . Hopefully one of these suggestions will help improve your brainstorming session and simplify the process of turning an idea into an intriguing plot ! <h> The Big Challenge <p> The main character of every story is essentially faced with one major challenge . The protagonist will either be challenged by an antagonist , the world they live in , or one of their biggest flaws , and this is a great foundation for your plot . Once you have chosen the challenge , begin drafting ways to demonstrate that conflict to the readers and also possible solutions for your character to try . Just make sure that your challenge is something your intended audience can understand and sympathise with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good plot should be able to be summarised in just two sentences , without specifically stating characters names or the setting . This is only in reference to your basic plot , and this is your starting point for constructing an imaginative story around that simple concept . For example , Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet could be summarised as " Two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths resolve the feud between their families " , but there is a lot more story built around that starting point . Once you have your two sentences , start thinking about more details , like why the two families are arguing , and what qualities the two lovers have that made them fall for each other , and you 'll have an exciting plot before you know it ! <h> The Three Acts <p> Everyone knows that stories follow the basic plan of having three main acts : the beginning , the middle , and the end . Divide your idea into these three sections . The beginning should be where you introduce your characters and setting , and then throw in your main challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters go on their journey and change for the better , with the end answering all questions and concluding the story . It is important to develop each section accordingly , and keep in mind that the middle should be longest and the end the shortest . Once you have your ideas organised into the three acts , expand on them to create a plot outline . <h> The Storys Goal <p> You probably already have a basic idea of what you want your story to be about , so in order to develop that into a good plot you 'll need to have a goal for your story . What sort of messages or themes do you want to convey to the reader ? Using this technique , you can begin to think of conflicts or characters to add to your plot that will contribute towards this goal . Even short scenes or minor characters you create are still important , so write a list of them and their purposes and then arrange them into a flowing story . <h> The Protagonists Goal <p> Every character in a story has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about is your protagonist . Determine what their motivation is behind their actions and use this to help develop your ideas further . If you give them something important and relatable to achieve , then you will attract more readers . Although you may give a character one goal at the very beginning of the story , it is allowed to change come the end , as long as their motivation is still the same . For example , a superhero characters goal may initially be to track down hidden bombs in a city , but then switch to jailing the villain who is behind the attacks , but the motivation is still the same of wanting to save the innocent civilians . Once you start pushing your characters towards their goals , you 'll start drafting a more interesting plot . <p> Thinking up a good plot can be a tricky task for any writer , but after trying some of these suggestions you will surely be able to have a fantastic plot outline ready for your next project !

Describing the bombed buildings or the bullet holes in old houses will grab peoples attention and help set the tone of your story , all while seeming to be simply part of the setting rather than exposition . <h> Create Some Mystery <p> If you can build up the suspense to your exposition ahead of time , then you will lessen the possibility of it becoming an information dump .

Here are my tips and tricks to preparing and performing an improvised solo for a jazz band ensemble . <h> Choose a Riff <p> A lot of times musicians just repeat certain riffs . These are just little phrases that consist of three or four ( sometimes more ) notes . Now , when I say repeat , people usually repeat the pattern itself , using different notes in the scale to spice it up a bit . Choose one that best suits you and the song you 're playing . I have one specific riff that I always play , no matter what piece it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riff to match the music . Just find one that 's comfortable to play . <h> Play in the Key <p> Make sure that you 're playing in the key . I like to have the scale out and right next to the sheet music while I 'm playing . This helps me , because I 'm able to just glance over and there 's all the notes I have to play , all the notes I can play my random riffs with . If you play outside the key , that 's fine . It might sound really good . But there 's always the possibility that it wo n't , which is why it 's great to stay inside the key as much as you can . <h> Stand Up <p> This is pretty straight forward : STAND UP ! ( Unless your band director tells you otherwise , of course . ) Most jazz musicians stand up when they 're playing their solos . Obviously the piano , drum , and bass players do n't . However , trombones , trumpets , and saxophones should . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down while the soloist stands . This is to not only bring the attention to you , so that the audience really listens , but it 's also to project your sound .

@@23757194 @3757194/ <p> I want to start things off by saying that no two tattoo artists are the same , including at-home artists . I want to emphasize on the fact that , while this article pertains to a vast majority of people who work out of their homes , there are is a very small percentage of tattoo artists that simply ca n't afford owning a store , or do n't want to but are licensed and treat the tattoo as an industry , and not a game . This article , is directly speaking about the risks associated with going to an unlicensed tattooist that is unaware of the seriousness of tattooing and treats it as a hobby . While there is always the chance of infection or lack of quality with tattoos , someone working out of their home increases those chances exponentially , which is why tattooing out of your home is illegal in many U.S. states , and parts of the world . This article is meant to be informative , not to attack individual artists . <p> Okay so we 've all heard the horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tattoo from their best friend 's cousin , and it ended up looking scraggly and was eventually covered up or removed . Maybe you 've read a story about the man who contracted a flesh-eating disease and decided to sue the artist for his massive medical bills . Either way , some people are horrified to the point where they think that tattoos are just bad ideas in general , or people will turn their heads away and say , " It could never happen to me . " If you 're anything like me , you wonder how exactly an atrocity such as that could have occurred , and what led to it . Well , alas , this is exactly what this article is about ! <h> Skill , or Lack Thereof <p> The first thing I can think of when it comes to tattooists that work in their home or make house calls , also known as , " Scratchers , " is why they do n't  have their own studio ; the reason why is pretty much that because they cant get enough business to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired by a local one . Why ? Because , 98% , they simply do n't  have the skill . <p> A lot of the time , tattoo artists go to art school to hone a raw talent they already possess ; I 'm not saying this is present in every artist , especially with those who have been tattooing for a number of decades , but , its a quality that 's increasingly becoming a standard that needs to be met . After speaking to a number of shop owners in my area , I 've learned that many tattoo parlors wont even consider taking in an artist that has n't  had previous art experience . <p> Anyways , after going to a school anyone who wants to be a tattoo artist is usually taken on as an apprentice in other words , they go through an internship . During this internship , they 're tought everything they need to know about tattooing : how to hold the machine , how to keep clean , how deep they need to penetrate the skin and how deep is too deep , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-3 years . After that , the shop owner decides if they want to keep the apprentice as a full-time employee or not . So when you see someone that tattoos out of their home , its safe to assume that they either havent had formal training or they had the training and never made the cut . <p> Why is that so important ? Scratchers are notorious for delivering painful tattoos because they do n't know how to hold the tattoo machine correctly . They almost always penetrate the skin too deep and the result is a lot of bleeding , a lot of crying and a lot of scarring . If they are n't going too deep , though , they 're too shallow and this is where the term , " Scratchers , " comes from . This is when they just scrape the surface and do n't make it past the first or second skin layer , so when the time comes for the healing process , the ink just peels away and you 're left with some abhorrent speckled mess . <p> Another reason as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , because tattoo machines vibrate and if you do n't have complete control over your hand , you 're going to deliver shaky lines and wobbly shading . The end result is a tattoo that looks more like a child 's drawing . <h> Health Risks <p> Lack of skill aside , there are a massive amount of health risks to take into consideration : <h> The Use of the Kitchen <p> Kitchens are one of the most disgusting rooms in the average household , second only to the bathroom . This also happens to be where a vast majority of home-tattooists perform their work , hence the popular term , " Kitchen magicians . " The reason for this is because that at-home , " Artists , " think that its a perfect place to tattoo since you can so easily clean the surfaces with things like ammonia or bleach . But bleach does n't  kill everything . <p> Kitchens are full of food-borne bacteria that simply ca n't be avoided unless you obsessively clean your home with bleach ; you have raw meat sitting on the counter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ever-present . Just think of how nasty a sponge is they smell sour and when you 're done washing the dishes you have to wash the ickiness off of your hands , right ? That 's because sponges are full of bacteria and germs , the same reason that rotting food smells bad . Isnt that the same sponge you use to wipe down your counters and clean the inside of your microwave ? Yuck . Believe it or not , most kitchen magicians wont take that into consideration when they 're prepping their meals . <p> Another thing about working in their kitchen is the use of tap water . The risk of bacterial infections when using tap water is staggering , as tap water is n't exactly filtered . Sure , it goes through the normal basic filtering as required so we all do n't  die of lead poisoning from drinking it , but , it still has a lot of bacteria and unwanted minerals in it . A lot of scratchers use tap water to clean their tools and workspace because its free and think that its already filtered enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germs that are present in the water will be all over their equipment . <h> Contamination <p> The use of the kitchen is n't the only reason that someone working out of their home is risky . In my previous article I mentioned how a tattoo artist should always be changing his gloves , and I said it for a reason : always assume that there is bacteria on everything . If the artist touches something , his or her gloves are contaminated . Scratchers are n't  known for their knowledge in cross-contamination , and rarely change their gloves with the exception of in-between clients because they believe it to be a waste of gloves . What does this mean ? That means that his tools , bottles and counters have a very high possibility of holding nasty diseases , especially Hepatitis ( Diseases like this can live inside of you for years without showing symptoms so its very easy to be infected without knowing unless you regularly are tested ) . <p> Other than the lack of glove-changing , a big deciding factor in the danger associated with at-home artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a high-client volume so they cant really afford a quality autoclave . What 's an autoclave ? Its the same machine that surgeons and dentists use to sterilize their tools , and I do n't  mean that it just cleans them autoclaves completely sterilize tools so that the bacteria levels are reduced to 0 , literally . It removes every last trace of the person it was previously used on . Reputable autoclaves are , on average , $3,000 . Sure , anyone can purchase some $200 autoclave off of eBay , but , that 's the same as buying some 1999 Mitsubishi with no working A/C over a 2013 Porsche . When the scratcher ca n't afford a good autoclave , they resort to dipping tools in boiling water or using bleach to , " Sterilize , " their equipment . And no one ever said that bleach removed Hepatitis or HIV . That being said , you have a 1 in 1,000,000,000 chance of getting an infection in a reputable tattoo parlor that undergoes regular inspection by health departments ; when you get tattooed in someones house , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that you have a 1 in 4,000 chance of getting an infection such as MRSA . Or worse . <h> Animals <p> People have pets , and there 's nothing wrong with that , but , do you want to be tattooed in the same room that Lassie is in ? Animals are dirty , everyone knows that , and our furry friends have all sorts of dander and God knows what else floating around in the air . Not to mention they 've been licking their butts and everything else so now you also have to worry about what they might be carrying . All it takes is a friendly kiss from Fido to get a worm . <p> Now that we 've covered the health risks and the importance of formal training we 'll cover a couple more subjects that , while they did n't fit in with the main topics , are just as important . <h> Tattoo parties <p> I 've only ever seen one tattoo party in my lifetime , and , the only thing I can really compare it to is an orgy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't properly cleaning equipment and are just tattooing one person after the other with little regard to cleanliness . If you do n't know what a tattoo party is , it 's when a tattoo artist invites a whole bunch of people to their , " Workplace , " and just kind of mass-produce tattoos for cheap . Because there are so many people waiting in line for a tattoo , the artist is usually in a hurry and performs a rush job . For the most part , the scratcher is only interested in making a lot of money and running . <h> Liablity <p> The biggest risk with kitchen magicians is that they wo n't be held accountable for anything if something goes wrong . Why ? Because there 's nothing on record . Tattoo parlors always have legal documentation filled out before the tattoo is performed , they have liability insurance and they accept responsibility for their actions . At-home artists , not so much . They have no record of you ever receiving a tattoo from them and they have no liability insurance so all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never even seen this person before , " and they wash their hands of you . So if you get a flesh-eating disease , who are you going to go to ? The artist ? Obviously not - you 're going to have to pay for your medical bills and the cover up , if you decide to get one , all on your own . <h> You Pay for What You Get <p> The Numero Uno reason people will go to an at-home artist is because of the cost , which is a major no-no . The last thing you should ever worry about is the cost of a tattoo , because tattoos are you-get-what-you-pay-for products that happen to be very , very permanent . It 's the same concept as where to get your hair done : you can go to Great Clips and spend $20 on highlights that look more like painted-on stripes , or you can go to an independent salon and spend $90 to have supermodel hair . In the long run , you 're going to want the better of the two products so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parlors so expensive when home-tattooers charge significantly less ? Other than their level of skill , it 's because they buy high-quality ink that lasts without fading or blurring ; by being willing to spend a little more on your tattoo , you 're ensuring that your tattoo will be done with nicer ink . By spending less , you 're going to get a tattoo that will need more touch ups down the road which will inevitably cost you more money in the long run , as well as running the risk of the ink having less-than-reputable materials in it that may be harmful to your well-being . <p> In the end , tattoos are for life and they 're just like any other medical procedure . Would you undergo a transplant in someone 's basement , or would you let someone fill a cavity for you in their living room ? You would n't , and you should treat tattoos the same way because if you do n't , you could end up as another statistic that contracted some disease or just got a hideous tattoo.

The death of his friend made him cold and distant , therefore making him another character who is hard to portray . Creating an OC with XXXXXL boobs might give you the impression he 'd like that , since he loves his perverted little books ... But you 're wrong . Like I said , he 's like Sasuke . Tough exterior , people . And do not give him a Sakura reincarnate either . He 's already had a team mate similar to Sakura , her name was Rin , and did she get him ? Obviously not . So do n't even try it . <p> Neji : Neji , he 's arrogant , you have to love that . I have one word for you . Destiny . And do n't come with an OC related to Tenten ! ! &gt;&gt; Or an OC with a childish personality . The boy is mature , and not in for babysitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , he 's not hard to pair up . Given the right plot and ' encounters ' you can make a brilliant fanfic with him in it . Just make sure he 's in character . <p> Gaara : Another one of the more complicated characters . You can not get your OC close to him within 5 chapters . It 's impossible . If anyone can relate to his past and what it changed him into , you 'd know the boy is very hard to get close to . And remember , he does n't sleep . Why , you ask ? Because Shukaku might take over when he 's asleep . Got it ? Good ! If it 's Gaara after the timeskip , it would make him a bit easier to approach , and if he does n't have his tailed beast anymore , all it takes is a good plot . Just do n't make him lust after your OC instantly for having ' good looks ' , alright ? Alright ! <p> Kiba : Dog boy ! He 's not very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot , encounters , and you 're in . Even an Hinata reincarnate would work . <p> Did I have all the popular good guys , now ? And no , I did n't put Naruto in , because ... Well ... He 's the bloody main character of the entire show , how can you not get his personality on paper ? O.o <p> Now , here 's the part we all hate . Out-Of-Character . The only reasonable explanation for this is the people who lack imagination and talent , or the people who never even bothered to watch the fucking series ! Like , Itachi being sweet . Sasuke running after girls . Sasori who killed his parents . Deidara who screams like a girl . Hell , Deidara who grew a fucking vagina . If you 're going to discriminate Kishimoto 's hard work , you might as well just create your own male characters and be done with it . Honestly . I at least study the character I want to write about before I go and put his personality on paper ! <p> Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one . She ca n't be cold , yet loving , trusting , distant , multiple evil personalities , gentle , cute , funny , sarcastic , angelic , have angel wings , love blood , yet does n't want to kill , but is a masochist , but would never hurt someone purposely unless she 's one of her other persona 's . You know what you get out of that ? A twitching , foaming , total NUTJOB . Getting driven away by men in white coats and dumped in a pillowy room . Stick to one personality . Okiii ? =3 <p> Oh and , if she has an original demon in her , give the demon some brains . Do n't be all , " Oh no ! The demon is coming out ! " *demon mode* " Demon mad . Demon kiilll . " And then goes on a rampage killing everything in sight , leaving her love interesting to stare at the track of dead bodies , which somehow manage to include Tsunade . She 's the hokage for crying out loud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark corner " Oh noes , I killed everyone ! " Yeah . Then comes the incredibly retarded romantic scene . She gets kissed , told it 's ' ok ' and everything will be alright and they shall run away together . But on the way runs into Kabuto and gets PWNED . Yeah . Nice . <p> Oh ! Oh ! ! And the Authors among us who insist on saying , " 50 rates and messages or I wo n't update ! " who in the name of Hitler do you think you are ? Do you really think that people will be all , " OMG ! I MUST RATE ! OR SHE WO N'T UPDATE ! ! D : " Uh , no . Actually . It 's rather rude and conceited . And I 've noticed that most of you insist on placing your entire life story in the memo before you read the story . Do we give a fuck about you and your insanely boring problems , or highlights in your life ? No . We want to read the friggin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honestly , nobody gives a rat 's furry ass . Do n't we all write so people will read , and maybe , appreciate it ? Do we have to force appreciation out of them just because we all like to know what happens next ? And the irony is , because some actually give them their 50 rates , their pathetic stories get on the Highest Rated list . <p> Want me to mention a name for this ? Fate-x from Quizilla.com . She applies to most of these DON'TS . But I doubt she 'll ever take the hint . But , go ahead , abuse people 's curiosity . Not like the real writers amongst us are n't talking about how pathetic you truly are . And I 've actually read through your so-called fictions . You have a tendency to repeat your phrases after every 5 sentences . And now , if Fate-x were to read this , I 'm quite sure her reply will be something like ; " A least I have popularity , you 're just jealous because I actually get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite the opposite . You do n't have popularity , JK Rowling , my dear , has popularity . Am I jealous ? No . If I were jealous I would n't be able to criticize your writing , but instead , would criticize your personality . Am I doing that ? No . I rest my case . You insist on bossing people around , have them do stuff for you just so they can read your poorly written fanfics to burn some time . Yet , god forbid someone has some critique on it . Hypocrit . Anyway , moving on . <p> Now , I just have to criticize some Authors that do n't appreciate constructive criticism on their fanfics . Some of them , even start cursing on you for trying to help them with something CONSTRUCTIVE . Meaning , HELPFUL . I can understand if someone says , " you suck , stop writing " that it 's just wrong . Yes . You may curse at them for saying that . However if they do give you some points like ; " you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suggest you do it more like this ..... Blabla " is n't that good ? I mean , I 'd appreciate it a lot . Sure , I just said a load of things about Fate-x , but I am not going to correct everything and giving her examples . If she has a pair of brains , she could figure it out . <p> Actually . I just gave you a lot of DON'TS and just a few DO 'S . But I think you can guess that the opposite of the DON'TS are overall good O.o And do n't worry , your OC does n't have to be a freak of nature who fails at everything . Just do n't make her all perfect and flawless . Give her some flaws . <p> Another thing I would like to throw in here are titles of stories . If it 's from a song , in other words , the lyrics ... That 's fine . Except everyone is using it , and I wonder , why ? Did thinking of a title become so hard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an original title , make sure everything is spelled right . Your story needs to be a polished gem stone , and if you 're like me , you will not rest until every little corner of your story and every little word is perfect . Banners ? Do n't ask for those right away . Maybe for the first chapter , make your own banner ? Just a suggestion , nothing important . Everyone loves banners , but it 's not the end of the world if you get none . <p> Yes , I expect to get some hatemail for this . I expect flaming . And I welcome them with open arms , because I know , I 'm a foul mouthed criticist who rants . But at least I 'm helping someone who might be reading this right now and is planning to write a Naruto fanfic in the future . <p> I do n't attack anyone personally , however , if you decide to attack me personally , be prepared for the **25;164;TOOLONG : AKA : Ashley chasing you down with a flaming squirrelkebob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nose , which will in turn rupture every spinal vertabrae and nerve in the way , leaving you a wiggly wavy pile of shit . = )

When I first admitted to having a problem and starting to tell people I trusted , one comment stuck out above the rest . They made out it was easy to stop cutting and I was an over-dramatic emo cry baby ' . It was their main comment though that has lead me to ask the question , is it really that easy to stop cutting ? <p> When I started to tell the people I trusted , I found out who I really could trust and someone I later found out I could n't , practically spat at me that I was stupid for cutting and it 's easy to stop you just have to put down the razor blade ' . <p> It made me wonder what it 's like from an outside view that 's never encountered it before . In a later conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people who cut either do it for attention or are just stupid who exaggerate their problems . Personally I can barely agree with any of that statement . <p> Yes , in the latest emo ' trend , some people thought it was cool to cut ' and maybe they were doing it for attention , but that aside , can you really just classify everyone who does self harm as attention seekers ' and over-dramatic ' ? <p> From a personal view I would say someone who cuts may subconsciously be looking for attention or it may be something else . It 's a problem . Anything that causes someone to cut is a problem , and it obviously holds a big part to their lives . No matter what it is , why do some people continue to believe that it 's completely controllable ? <p> I know people who have also cut , through Mibba or through groups and other places , but not everyone has found they can control it . For some , they do n't know why they cut ; others only know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . Every situations different and the level of strength that person has varies so from my perspective I 'd say the situation varies , but for most it 's no-where near a walk in the park . <p> In my opinion what this girl said was completely wrong and that she should n't have judged everyone with a connecting factor that they harm themselves in some way . I feel the media has blown this up way too much . <p> She 's not gon na be the only person in the world with this point of view , but to me , my stance on this topic is most likely gon na stand at this ; If you cut , it 's part of who you are , they 're your personal problems and an individual does not sum up a whole situation . Cutting does not mean you 're over dramatic or necessarily want attention , but it does mean you need help from people close to you or professionals to overcome the situation .

For some , respect for the law means that people should obey laws , whether they like them or not . But to me , it means that people should acknowledge the laws themselves , and that many are protecting them , not punishing them . <p> For example , let 's take the law of not being able to utilize , possess , or purchase tobacco under the age of 18 . That is a national law , and some people may be defiant to its enforcement because it is a barrier for underage smokers . But , what some people do n't realize is that this law is for their protection .

Without these laws in our country , everything would be chaotic . <p> Respect for the law is not only people acknowledging what the lawmakers are doing for everyone and obeying them---if people do n't approve of them , respect for the law also means that we are taking legal action to strive towards that goal .

Even if you have a wonderful setting and an amazing plot , if your characters are bland then your story wont live up to its potential . Here are five tips that can help round out your characters and make your story stand out from the rest . <h> Speech <p> Everyone talks differently . Dig a little deeper into your characters mind or history to find out how they talk . Are they well educated ? If they are , perhaps they wont use any slang , or maybe instead of saying simple words like good they will use other adjectives like excellent . If the person comes from a particular region or country , they will have unique expressions compared to other characters . Maybe they even have a catchphrase . Find a couple of ways that makes your characters stand out as individuals during sections of dialogue and you will be well on your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No two people grow up under the same circumstances , and its often our past that defines us . Even if two characters share similarities in their history , they will still differ in their personalities and this is something to use to your advantage . For example , a person who grew up as a victim of war will view the world differently to someone who was a soldier on the opposing side . Allow their history to realistically shape your characters and you will make your story more believable . <h> Flaws <p> Perhaps the biggest mistake you can make is not giving your characters any flaws . Readers do n't  like to see perfect Mary Sues , so I recommend giving your characters at least one defining flaw . Making a character arrogant or impatient can be the last thing you need to do to round them out and make them more interesting to read .

Are they acting out of fear ? Or maybe its love that propels them on their journey . There has to be an end goal that your character wants , and although its up to you whether or not they achieve that , showing their motivation will create another good layer for your characters . <h> Change <p> By the end of your story , your characters should have changed somehow . While you dragged them along their journey , maybe they recognised what their greatest flaw is and worked on it . Perhaps they acknowledged their fears and overcame them .

@@23757207 @3757207/ <h> How to Create Spells For Harry Potter Fanfiction <p> As an avid writer of Harry Potter fanfiction , I 've created my fair share of spells for my stories . And question that comes up from quite a number of my readers is , " How do you come up with your spells ? " <p> Even if its subconsciously , I have a process that I use when I need to make a new spell for the story I 'm working on . Ive been told it works very well , and as far as I know , its similar to how J.K. Rowling made up the original spells for the books . <h> Think About Your Spell <p> Spend a little time and ask yourself what you want the spell to do . How complicated will it be ? What will it look like ? Are there specific wand movements ? What exactly does the spell do ? Take a little longer thinking about the last question . Keep in mind at all times that magic has its limits and it cant solve any problem . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter Wikipedia and look up the rules of Transfiguration J.K. Rowling has already stated in the books . And finally , think about if the spell has a practical application . As previously stated , magic ca n't solve every problem . Would a spell like the one you 're thinking up actually exist in the canon ? Spending time on this will prevent eye-rolls from your readers and add to your fic rather than take away from it , especially if its canon-based . <h> Research <p> A spell might already exist somewhere in the fandom . Be sure to check the Wikipedia page that compiles spells from not only the books , but from the movies and games as well . Spells that Ive used from the games include Herbivicous , Glacius , and Meleflores . So if a spell already exists , go ahead and use it . You can take inspiration for spells from all over the fandom . However , if it comes from a fellow fanfiction writer , you should ask the author for permission before you use it in your own fic . <h> Pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to pick a name for your spell . The first way involves a spell that is a more specific spin-off of a spell already in existence in the canon . When I say specific spin-off , I mean when a spell is directed at something or twists a little to get a particular effect . There is a difference between a character saying , " Accio ! " and " Accio Firebolt ! " <p> One of my spells demonstrates this rather well . I had a sequence planned where I wanted the suits of armor to sing and dance , but I did n't  know what to use for an incantation . I knew that Locomotor was the basic spell for making things move , and after some research , I found that in the seventh book when McGonagall makes the armor come to life , she uses Piertotum Locomotor . Since I knew I wanted the armor to do something funny , I added on the phrase " humorous , " creating the full incantation Piertotum Locomotor Humorous . <p> The second way is to completely make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be a spell that would be in the canon , you can use Latin roots and words to create the names . Its a technique Rowling herself used , and if you look at her spells closely enough , you can pick out Latin in them . For instance , in the spell Sectumsempra , there is the root sect ( from words like seco and secare ) , which means " to cut . " The root fits the spells use . <p> Another one of my spells , Diffinda Corpus , ( inspired by the How To Be A Death Eater letter ) went through this process . I took the already existing Severing Charm , Diffindo , and changed it up a little . Since the concept of the spell was the cut or sever the body , the word for body , corp , made for a good addition to the spell . It made Diffinda Corpus , or the Pancake Curse . <p> The final way might be a bit of a cop-out , but if no incantation will come to mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having an incantation is most useful when a character besides the main character uses it , especially non-verbally . Keeping some mystery to spells can be a good thing , but its not always the most appropriate course of action . <h> Pick a Name <p> A name for a spell and its incantation are almost always different . The Levitation Charm and Wingardium Leviosa both refer to the same charm , but one is the name and one is the incantation . Your character would n't yell , " Levitation ! " and similarly , they would n't refer to it as the Wingardium Leviosa Charm . <p> Sometimes the name is similar to the incantation . Crucio and Confundus are two good examples , and in the case of Confundus , its referred to as The Confundus Charm . Whatever the name you pick for your spell is , it should somehow include what that spell does in a concise manner . You would say Jelly-Legs Jinx over Makes Your Legs Feel Like Jelly Jinx . <p> Finally , you would decide what category of spell your new bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter Wiki : <p> Curse : Spells that have the intention of harming , controlling , or killing . Curses are not taught at Hogwarts because they are considered dark magic . Can be countered by a counter-curse . <p> Charm : Spells that make an object behave in an unnatural way without changing the inherent nature of the object , which is Transfiguration <p> Hex : Spells that are aimed to cause pain or discomfort . They are not as harmful as curses , but are still considered minor dark magic and are therefore not taught at Hogwarts . <p> Jinx : Spells that are aimed to cause some discomfort but mostly amusement for the caster . They are considered defensive and are therefore taught , and can be countered by counter-jinxes or anti-jinxes . <p> Spell : This is a sort of catch-all category . Transfiguration magic goes here , along with any other magic that does n't  fit well into any of the other categories . <p> And sometimes if you cant quite pick what the spell is , you just go with what sounds right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now combine everything together . You know what the spell does , what it looks like , how to do it , what its name is , and what the incantation is . All you need to do is put it into your fic and have fun with it .

A good line of dialogue can prove to be a great way to get a reader 's attention , especially because dialogue is often the easiest thing for people to read . Dialogue can also prove to be less daunting to a reader while a large block of text can be overwhelming . <p> Open With Action <p> Opening with action is a great way to get a reader interested in the story . A good bit of action can make readers look forward to what 's to come . When a story opens with action , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair amount of action in it , and that is an attractive quality to many readers . <p> Open With Description <p> A beautiful description of the opening scenery or character can be a great way to start a story .

By introducing the reader to a problem in the first line , you are giving them a good indicator of what is to come , and your chances of hooking them into your story are very good . Conflict is what the story is all about , so it makes for a great opening line when done right . <p> Starting a story can be the scariest part of writing , but if you put a little work into it and do n't overthink , you can have your readers hooked from the very first line .

This will tell you how to set up the folders you will need for downloading custom content ( CC ) . <p> Now you need to start your game to make sure your folders are set up right . Once you start your game there should be no intro before it loads , and when you 're in game , there should be no sparkles when you are building walls.If these things are still here you have done something wrong . Carefully reread the instructions and look at the pictures to make sure you have done it right . Do not continue if you have n't , because it wo n't work . <p> How to Add Custom Content <p> You should now have been in your game , and the intro should have been gone and the sparkles when you build walls should not have appeared . <p> Now , here will explain how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of crap in there that you do n't need to know so I 'll just explain here briefly the rules of downloading CC . <p> Rules of Downloading CC <p> 1 . Make sure that what you want to download is for SIMS 3 . If it is for sims 2 and you place it in your sims 3 game , it will slow it down and might cause it to crash . It 's an easy thing to confuse sometimes but trust me , once you 've been there ( like me ) , you will never ever forget to check what game the CC is for : P <p> 2 . Make sure that what you are downloading is a . package file . Sims 3 packs and individual sims do not need to be installed in the same way . Here is how you install sims 3 packs , and here is how you install downloaded sims . <p> 3 . What I do is I find what I want to download , save it in Documents - Electronic Arts - The Sims 3 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , delete the zipped files , and move the unzipped/extracted files into the packages folder . <p> 4 . It is a really good idea to organise your Packages folder before you start . Inside the Packages folder , I have folders for Hair , Clothes , Objects , Poses , Other and a folder called Keep Up To Date . <p> Put any hair you download into the Hair folder.Put any **35;191;TOOLONG you download into the Clothes folder.Put any buy objects/building objects/decoration objects into the Objects folder.Put any poses/animations you download into the Poses folder.Put anything that does n't fit elsewhere ( such as the nosparkles and the nointro packages already in there ) into the Other folder . <p> Very important - put anything that requires being updated every version in the Keep Up To Date Folder . If something you are downloading says it is a core mod , or that it changes the core mod , place it in here . If it 's anything that is going to change things around in the game ( relationships , censoring , faster skill building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , put it in here . <p> 5 . If your game does not load or is looking weird , go to your Keep Up To Date folder first . Although it is possible that hair and clothes can be broken files , it is not likely . Objects can sometimes cause trouble , but not as often as core mods , or things that change the game around . <p> Generally speaking , if your game will not load at all it will be something in the Keep Up To Date Folder . If your game loads but freezes , or there is strange stuff happening , it will be something in your objects folder . <p> So if your game is not loading or locking up frequently , move your Keep Up To Date folder into your Mods folder ( or anywhere outside of the Packages folder ) . Test your game.If it loads , then there is a file in this folder that is causing your game to screw up.If it does n't load , then it is somewhere else . Remove your Objects folder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it works.Once it works , it will be the last folder you took out that has the problem file in it.Start putting back a few files at a time from the problem folder and reloading your game . When it starts having problems again , it will be the last few files you put back in the Packages folder that are causing the problem . It 's a bit of trail and error . Hopefully you never have to deal with this : D <p> 6 . Lastly and VERY IMPORTANT , before you install a new sims 3 expansion pack or stuff pack , or do ANY of the patches , remove all of your custom content and make a backup of your save game.You can then update your Keep Up To Date package files and then add in the custom content once it is done and load your game straight up and most of the time , it should work . <p> Deleting CC <p> Before you delete any custom content , it is essential that you back up your save game before hand . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see it as it was ever again . I 've been there , and it sucks.It is a good idea to take note of any CC that needs to be uninstalled in a specific way . Many CC requires that you delete anything to do with it in game , including interactions , before you delete it from your Packages folder . <p> My Favourite CC <p> Right ! Now for some really good downloads and my personal favourites . : ) <p> Mod The Sims is a brilliant site for CC . The following is mostly from there . I do n't remember if you have to register to download , but it 's free and it 's safe . Also , this site saves a list of what you have downloaded before so you can find it again if you need to update it . <p> Make sure when you are searching for CC that you are searching for Sims 3 content . <p> Make sure that if you go to a user 's account to find their downloads that way , that you check if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so under the ' download ' tab , under expansion/stuff packs required when you hover over the icon . <p> Make sure you have the expansions/stuff packs required . <p> IMPORTANT Note Regarding Downloading Objects <p> This is REALLY IMPORTANT if you patch your game and keep it up to date ( I think the base game is up to 1.33 now . You can find out what version your game is by opening the Sims 3 Game Launcher , and then hovering over the tiny Sims 3 icon in the bottom lefthand corner . It 's the first 3 numbers . ) . <p> Some CC objects such as beds , counters , sofas , windows , etc. that people AND pets can interact with will not work in your patched game if the CC is older and has not been fixed by the creator . It does not matter if you have Pets or not , this problem comes in the patches and not in the Pets expansion itself . <p> So when you download objects , if your game is up to date , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed for pets ' or whether it ' works with all expansions ' . As a general rule anything created mid December 2011 - present should be fine , but anything else you might want to check up on . A great way of doing this is to click on the ' comments ' tab , go to the last page , and see if anyone has been having problems with the object . If nothing has been written there since 2009 , I 'd avoid it . It wo n't be compatible . Your game will crash . <p> &amp;quot ; More Slots ! &amp;quot ; : Electronics Edition . This is not a mod because it does not alter the objects in the game . Instead it creates copies of TVs , etc. with more slots to place tissues , fruit , gems , etc. , to make your Sims ' homes homier . <p> One More Slot Please . This is a very cool CC item that allows for you to place objects/sims at a different hight . So , if you wanted your couch on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and then place the couch on the slot . It 's great for decoration purposes and movie making . <p> Cooking And Ingredients Overhaul . This needs to be updated for the latest patch , but still kinda works . It has n't crashed my game yet , but it 's doing weird things in others . What this does is it adds more ingredients to the game and changes what you need for the recipes you make , and adds more plantable fruits and vegetables such as oranges and dragon fruit . It is ideal for a gardener or for someone wanting a more realistic game . <p> Nraas Master Controller . This always has to be updated when you patch your game . No exceptions . What this does is allows for amazing control of your sims in game . You can change their appearance without a dresser , change the memory updates , kill your sim , force them to age up , and just ... it does a lot.This creator has some other amazing mods too , like reading books only once and autosave features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a number of hidden skills in The Sims 3 , such as dancing and chess , that this CC will reveal under the Skills tab in game . I love this because otherwise you really have to pay attention to your sim 's dancing , etc. , to gage what level they 're at . It 's great for those with obsessions over making their sim the best of the best ; ) <p> The Sims 3 Booty <p> The Index of Booty for The Sims 3 is a fantastic site . What this site does is it takes material from sites such as Peggy Sims and The Sims Resource that you would otherwise have to pay for , and uploads it for free . It is somewhat illegal for them to be using EA 's source codes , etc. , and selling their products , so I say f*ck them . Things like this should be created out of enjoyment , and not for profit . <p> I use this site for almost all the clothing , hair , and accessories I download . I use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't recommend it . A lot of the time you 'll find you have to download a complete set for one thing you want , and it clutters up your game too much . The more CC you have in your game , the longer it takes to load and the more can go wrong with it . Also , many of the objects from the sites on this one are not interactable , not updated , and so they 're pretty useless . <p> I hope that someone found that useful ! I 'm obsessed with CC in The Sims 3 . I could n't play the game without it since I started using it . It 's really not as hard as it seems to get it working . <p> I made a video using a few of these mods , etc. , here , and if anyone would like to know exactly how I did something then here is the place to ask : D <p> I might make another journal for hints and tips on making Sims 3 videos , because at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful things on the net about this , but not all in one place .

From birth , you could tell that something was up with Kevin with his constant crying whenever he was around his mother then being joyous around his father . I did n't understand why he hated his mother so much but after reading some comments on the movie , I had to agree with some of them . The reason of hatred towards his mother may be because of the fact that he felt the resentment she had towards him . If you watched the movie , you could see that when she was pregnant with Kevin , she was n't too happy about it .

Yes , Kevin acted nice when he was around but by the time Kevin was fifteen , he should have noticed the odd behavior in his son 's attitude especially towards his sister , Cecilia . Now , that takes me back to when Cecilia was born . Kevin never liked her , I guess he wanted all the attention or something along that line . I remember when he was brought to the hospital to see his little sister when she was born , he put his hand into a jar of water and sprinkled it all over her face resulting in her crying . It 's funny ( or not ) how Kevin and Cecilia are complete opposites . Kevin never smiled unless he did something bad and he was rarely in a good mood while his sister , Cecilia was a very joyous child , every parent 's dream and loved her brother dearly . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him was he had some sort of secret obsession with her but it seemed stupid because it was for a fact that he wanted his mother to suffer .

I ca n't blame her for getting to that point , in fact , I saw it coming . But the little devil saw that as a way to manipulate his mother by telling his dad he fell off when his mother was changing him . Before I go on , I have to say this , he was wearing diapers when he was eight ? Who should I blame for that ? Anyway , he knew his mother would feel guilty if she did n't do anything he wanted by making her remember about his broken arm by slightly touching the scar it left on his arm . <p> I knew that Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was reading to him . Keep in mind that he never liked her but that night , he cuddled up to his mother and yelled at his dad ( which he never does ) to leave his room . She read the story of Robin Hood to him and he became interested in the bow and arrow Robin used , not Robin Hood the character . I found it quite disturbing how detailed the book was because it 's meant to be a bedtime story , so describing how a bow and arrow is used is n't really a good idea to read to your deranged child . <p> There were so many things Kevin did that his father overlooked or took it as the mother being careless which made me dislike the father .

I was devastated when I found out he killed his sister and surprised that he killed his father . I guess he never liked his father because , let 's face it , his father never knew him at all . He got sent to juvenile jail because he was fifteen at the time and his mother even moved to a run down house close to the prison so she could visit him ; she is his mother after all . <p> At the end , I knew he was scared when he was being transferred to real jail because he was turning eighteen .

Her house was destroyed by people who knew who she was , she had to leave her high-paying job to be a clerk at a travel agency . She was even slapped in public by a parent .

However , because there are only so many pre-made ones , people who want to have special , unique and attractive layouts have to look further than your average white and blue story . <p> Here are some simple tips to keep in mind . <h> Coordinate Colors <p> No one wants to read a story in which none of the colors have nothing to do with one another . If your background is a light peach color , browns , dark reds , and oranges look wonderful with it . Do not use bright colors and light ones together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look good . <h> Keep it Simple <p> If your layout is too fancy , people wo n't be able to read it . I 'd advise using , at most , two background images - one for your banner , and one for the story 's background . <h> Make it Easy to Read <p> This is important to ensure your story or poem can indeed be read and not just looked at . In other words , do n't make the text too small or too big ( I tend to gravitate towards anywhere from 9-16 point size ) , or too close to the color of the content background . For example , if your content background is black , do not use dark gray text . <h> Decide on Your Theme <p> Is your story centered on the page ? Do you have a banner ? Is the story set in the city , the country , or the forest ? Once you have a story , it 's not hard deciding on the layout . Take my story Smiles Around Cigarettes . The story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan-fiction , and involves many dark and confusing aspects . Therefore , the basic style would be black . The story background and the border of my banner are black , where the content text is white , and the links are a soft gray . The banner 's colors are muted and darkened , adding to the concept of darkness the story has . <h> The Layout Maker <p> Upon the creation of the new Mibba , I was quite confused by the multiple pieces of the Layout Maker . After a few tries , I got the hang of it , but it was no easy process . <p> You 'll notice that the Maker consists of a screenshot of your story , a blue-and-orange box which is the entire of your control over your story 's appearance , and an option to save what you 've created . Said box should look like this : Page , Content , Title , Subtitle , Text , Summary , Chapters , and then Save This Layout . <h> Page Tab <p> Upon clicking Page , you 'll see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repeat , Attachment and Position below it . You now have the option of either a tile ( seamless ) background image that flows smoothly , or a solid color background .

Do n't worry about the Text or Box options for Page , they have no real purpose . <h> Content Tab <p> Here , you should see the same arrangement as Page . Choose a solid color for your background color , as images make reading it nearly impossible , and then locate the subtab for Box . Decide on how wide your story is to be . <h> Title Tab <p> Here is where the most creative aspect of layouts comes in : banners . Simply find an image or two you like , edit them however you want on Photobucket or Photoshop ( making sure to include the title in the banner ) and copy and paste the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banner should appear there ; if not , choose the Box subtab and edit the top padding until your banner is fully visible . <h> Subtitle Tab <p> A subtitle is a fancy word for chapter title . Choose the text size and color and style , and you 're set . <p> By now , you 're probably getting the hang of it somewhat . If you think you 've got the layout maker down cold , continue on , and best wishes to you in doing so . If you 're still unsure about the maker , contact someone whose layout you admire and ask them simply , how did you make your layout ? 
@@23757216 @3757216/ <h> Creating a Custom Story Layout <p> This tutorial is organized as a series of examples that will ( hopefully ) get you comfortable with the layout maker . It 's not necessary to read every section to learn to make a story layout , but if you do you should be able to make any style layout you like . <p> If you have any further questions not covered in this post , feel free to check out any of the following threads : <h> Intro to Story Layouts <p> To create a new layout , go to My Mibba &gt;&gt; Stories &gt;&gt; Layouts and click the aqua " New layout " button . You 'll be asked to select a template for your layout ; if you 're creating a new layout from scratch , select " Default " . <p> The story layout maker has seven sections , each with three subsections . Each section controls a different part of your layout . The subsections for each section are always Background ( where you change the background color and/or background image for that section ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section looks ) and Box ( where you can change the width , margin , padding , border , and shadow of that section ) . <h> The Seven Sections <p> Here 's an overview of where each section is and its use : <p> Page : the page is the largest box ; it covers the entire story layout . Because of that , this section is only useful for changing the background of your layout . 1 <p> Content : the content box holds all the content of your story . Text settings in this section will be overridden by the text settings of the sections below . 2 <p> Title : this is the story title . This shows up on every page of your story and is where banners are usually inserted . 3 <p> Subtitle : this is the chapter title . It only shows up on chapter pages of your story . 4 <p> Text : the text settings in this section will be overridden on the summary page of your story , but will appear on chapter pages . 5 <p> Summary : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your story shows up here . It only appears on the summary page . 6 <p> Chapters : this is the list of chapter links and descriptions that shows up beneath the summary of your story on the summary page . 7 <p> ( Access any section or subsection in the layout maker by clicking its name. ) 8 <p> Tip : Each section title has a box on the right side . Hover over it to highlight the part of the layout that section controls . <h> Understanding Overrides and the Seven Sections <p> Story layouts can be thought of as nested boxes . Settings in the smaller boxes ( ie , sections lower down on the list ) override / cover up settings on bigger boxes / sections higher on the list . <p> Tip : Because some sections override the settings of other sections , changes you make and see in the layout maker may not appear in your final layout . For example , if you change the font through Page &gt;&gt; Text &gt;&gt; Font , all of the font will change in the layout maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overridden by those of other sections , the font will not appear to change when you save the layout and apply it to a story . <h> Understanding Width , Margin , and Padding <p> Width is ( you guessed it ) the width of a section . A section will be as wide as the width you input + the left padding + the right padding . <p> Margin is the space between two section of your layout . You can change a section 's top , bottom , left , and/or right margin . If you change a section 's bottom margin to 10 and the top margin of the section below to 20 , the total amount of space between the two sections will be 30 px . <p> Padding is the space between the edge/border of a section and the content inside it . You can change a section 's top , bottom , left , and/or right padding . <h> Things You 'll Need <p> Before you jump into making your layout , make sure you have the following information ready : <p> Direct links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an image is a URL that ends in . png , , jpg , or . gif . When you upload an picture to an image-hosting site like imgur or photobucket , you 'll be given a direct link to the image . A direct link to an image looks like this : http : **39;228;TOOLONG <p> Tip : Make an account on an image-hosting site and always upload images you 'll be using in layouts there . That way you do n't have to worry about your images being moved or deleted and you 'll always be able to find the direct link to your images . <p> The dimensions of your banner if you 're inserting one : In most browsers , you can find this information by right-clicking the image and selecting " Properties " , " View Image Info " , or something similar . You can also paste/open your banner in an image-editing program to find the dimensions . If you open your banner in MS Paint , for example , go to Image &gt;&gt; Attributes to find its dimensions . <p> Hex codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find colors to use in your layout through the color picker in the layout maker , but if you have specific shades you know in advance you want to use , you 'll need the hex codes . A hex code is a hash mark followed by six letters and/or numbers . For example , the code for white is #FFFFFF . <p> Tip : To find colors that match a specific image , use a pallete-generating website like CSSDrive . <h> Changing Backgrounds <p> The background subsection is the same for every section . The following examples change the page background , but can be followed to alter any section . <p> Select a position from the Position drop-down menu.3 Since the Content section of story layouts are automatically centered , most of your image will be blocked if you select the " Center Center " position , unless you move the content box . <p> Select either " Scroll " or " Fixed " from the Attachment drop-down menu.4 A background image set to " Scroll " will move as you scroll down the page ; a background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place while the rest of the page moves as you scroll . <p> The other two options for Repeat are " Repeat X " and " Repeat Y " . " Repeat X " will repeat the image in a horizontal line across the screen ; " Repeat Y " will repeat the image in a vertical line . <h> Adding a Banner <p> Banners can be added to a story with BBcode , but the code will have to be added to the top of every chapter posted . The following instructions explain how to insert a banner into the story title section so that it 'll automatically show up on every page of a story . The same instructions can be applied to the subtitle section , but then the banner will only show up on chapter pages . <p> Past the direct link to your banner into the Image field.2 The banner should show up immediately , but you 'll probably only see a small sliver of it . <p> Select " No Repeat " from the Repeat drop-down menu.3 ( You may want to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this example simply shows what most people choose , which is to have a non-repeated image . ) <p> Select " Center Center " from the Position drop-down menu.4 ( You may choose a different position for aesthetic purposes ; this example simply shows what most people choose , which is to center their banners . ) <p> Open the Box subsection of the Title section.5 Scroll down to the Padding options . <p> Set the Top padding to the height of your banner.6 You can set it to a larger number if you want extra space above your banner , but if the sum of the top and bottom padding does n't equal at least the height of your banner , it will be partially cut off . <p> If you do n't want the title text to show up over your banner , go to the Text subsection of Title.7 <p> Scroll down to Size and change it to 0.8 The title text should disappear immediately . <p> If the sides of the banner are still cut off , or if you do n't like having extra space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Content section . Make sure you 're in the Content section and Box subsection.9 <p> Change the Width to at least the width of the banner.10 If you change it to exactly the width of your banner , the text below will be the same width as your banner . There will still be space around your banner and the text ; this is the ContentPadding . <h> Borders <p> The default profile layout does n't have any visible borders , but they can be added to any section . Border options can also be used to create rounded edges for any section . <p> Adding a border to the content section <p> Go to the Content section and the Box subsection.1 Scroll down to find the Border settings . <p> Select a Style setting from the drop-down menu.2 The border will not show up immediately if the width is set to 0 . If the Style is set to " None " , the border will not show up even with a width greater than zero . <h> Pattern Borders / Sidebars <p> Paste the direct link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Repeat setting is not set to " Repeat " , select it from the drop-down menu . The pattern should fill the content section right away . <p> You may want to repeat step 10 for the Box subsection of the Subtitle section12 and the Box subsection of the Title section.13 <p> If you only want the pattern to show up on the sides , go to the Box subsection of the Content section and change the padding.14 If the Top and Bottom padding are set to 0 , the pattern will only show up on the sides . <h> Floating Banners <p> Making the banner appear to " float " above the rest of the content requires use of the transparency setting and changing some margins . <p> To add a pattern border around the chapter title and text but not the banner , first go to the Content section and Background subsection16 and paste the direct link to the pattern in Image field . Change the Transparency to 0 and make sure Repeat is set to " Repeat " . <p> Next go to the Box subsection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Left padding to 0.17 <h> Changing Text <p> Color : Sets the color for regular text ( ie , not links ) . Be sure to choose colors that will be readable with the background ! <p> Transparency1 : Sets the transparency of regular text . This can make text difficult to read and should only be used for the story and/or chapter titles . <p> Link Color : Sets the color for links . Be sure to choose colors that will be readable with the background ! ( This setting is not necessary in the Title or Subtitle section because that text is never a link . ) <p> Transparency2 : Sets the transparency of links in the text . This can make text difficult to read , so use very sparingly if at all . ( This setting is not necessary in the Title or Subtitle section because that text is never a link . ) <p> Align : Sets the alignment for the text . <p> Indent : Sets an indent for only the first line of text in a section . ( In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters indent . ) Mibba requires a space be left between paragraphs , so the Indent setting should only be used for aesthetic purposes and not in place of proper formatting . <p> Line height : The line height is the height given to each line of text . It should be at least the same value as the text size . If you set the line height too low in a section with multiple lines of text , it will render the text unreadable.1 <p> Word spacing : Sets the amount of space between each word . <p> Letter spacing : Sets the amount of space between each letter . <p> Font : Sets the fontface for the text . ( More than one font is listed on each line because if the computer used to view the story does not have the first font installed , it 'll use the second font on the list . ) <p> Size : Sets the font size for the text . <p> Style : This option has two settings , " Normal " and " Italic " . If set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be italicized . This setting is most useful for story and/or chapter titles . <p> Weight : This option has two settings , " Normal " and " Bold " . If set to " Bold " , all of the text will automatically be bolded . This setting is most useful for story and/or chapter titles . <p> Variant : This option has two settings , " Normal " and " Small caps " . If set to " Small caps " , all of the text will automatically be changed to all capitals , with formerly lowercase letters appearing smaller than formerly uppercase ones.2 <p> Transform : This option has four settings , " Normal " , " Capitalize " , " Uppercase " , and " Lowercase " . " Capitalize " will change the first letter of every word to uppercase , " Uppercase " will change all lowercase letters to uppercase , and " Lowercase " will change all uppercase letters to lowercase . All stories and titles on Mibba must be properly capitalized , but these settings can be useful for changing the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want your story title to be all lowercase , you can name the story in proper title case so as to follow Mibba 's rules , but set the story title to lowercase in the layout maker so that it appears that way within your story. ) 3 <p> Decoration : This option has four settings , " None " , " Underline " , " Overline " , and " Line-Through " . This option is most useful for story and/or chapter titles.4 <p> Shadow options : The shadow options are discussed further in this post . These options are most useful for story and/or chapter titles . <p> Changing text in chapters <p> Text on chapter pages ( ie , chapter content and author 's notes ) is changed through the Text section and Text subsection.1 Remember that text must be legible ! <p> Chapter titles are changed through the Subtitle section and Text subsection.2 It is not required that chapter titles be visible ; to hide chapter titles , set the Size to 0 . <p> Changing text on the summary page <p> The text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Text subsection.1 <p> The text of links to and descriptions of chapters are changed through the Chapters section and Text subsection.2 <p> The story title is changed through the Title section and Text subsection.3 It is not required that the story title be visible ; to hide the story title , set the Size to 0 . <h> Shadows <p> Shadows are a new feature of the layout maker . Shadows do not work on Internet Explorer 8 or below . ( Neither does transparency . Two good reasons to switch browsers ! ) <p> Shadow options can be found in the Text and Box subsection of every section . Four options control shadows : <p> Color : Sets the color of the shadow . <p> Radius : Sets the size of the shadow , ie , how far away from the section/letter the shadow goes . <p> Offset X : When set to 0 the shadow will be directly behind the section/text ; when increased , the shadow will move to the right . <p> Offset Y : When set to 0 the shadow will be directly behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An example of a shadow around a section ( changed in the Box subsection ) 1 <p> Shadows can make text illegible , so use them sparingly ! Remember that your story content must be readable . <h> Saving and Applying Your Layout <p> Saving your layout is the most important part of the process ! Once saved , your layout will be listed on your layouts list ( My Mibba &gt;&gt; Stories &gt;&gt; Layouts ) . You 'll be able to make it public , edit it further , or delete it through that list . 
@@23757217 @3757217/ <h> Train to Busan <p> Train to Busan was released in 2016 as a zombie thriller directed by Yeon Sang-ho where a zombie outbreak occurs on a train , endangering the safety of passengers . With an animated prequel , Seoul Station , released a month later , this movie duology took the summer box office by storm . <h> Plot <p> As a divorced fund manager , Seo-wook struggles to care for his young daughter , Soo-an . With his mother taking care of home life while he works himself to a near stupor , it comes to his sudden attention that Soo-an wants to go see her mother that lives in Busan for her upcoming birthday . <p> After some meek arguments , Seo-wook caves and decides to take his daughter to the next city as a proper gift , one that she would enjoy unlike the Wii he 'd invested in . As the next day arrives , Seo-wook notices fire trucks , ambulances , and a load of police cars making their way through traffic on and off . He thinks nothing of it while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ex-wife know they are on the way . <p> While hell manifests in the city as the train makes through the ominous tracks to either salvation or their impending doom , an outbreak on the other carriers forces Seo-wook to group up with surviving passengers in hopes of getting out alive . <h> Overall <p> If you know anything about me , it has to be how zombie movies make my life ... even the ones that would make you question being friends with me . There 's always that thrill of being in those shoes ( unless it 's Dawn of the Dead because there 's so much unnecessary sex in that mall , good lord ) . Train to Busan reminds me much of World War Z. It could quite possibly be in the same universe as such , given the magnificent portrayal of zombies and how quickly they turn . <p> The plot does n't take long to develop . I mean , how far can developing a zombie outbreak go other than quick action and a lot of neck biting ? Unlike the norm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range of characters . From high school students to newly married couples struggling to survive while the mental break of others drives them astray ; it 's a whole lot of adrenaline-pumping fun . <p> My only complaint with this piece is that it ran far too long than it should 've . It 's a two-hour-something movie that starts off great in the beginning and end , but loses me for a few scenes during the middle . I do like the technical way of having to save others by outsmarting these brain-eaters , but I think they could 've done away with the nonsensical high-school romance that ends in mere demise . <p> All-in-all , this is definitely a movie you can watch by yourself or with a group on a Saturday night when you just want to get Chili 's take-out . Even if it ends up being rubbish food , you 'll have a pretty awesome movie night . 
@@23757218 @3757218/ <h> Please be nice to your cashiers ! <p> And I 'm saying this , because as a cashier , I have to deal with a lot of crap from people . I really hate when people are rude to me about prices , and it 's not even my fault . I 'll try to do what I can to make sure you get the right price , and the correct discounts , and if you just did n't read a sign right , I 'll make sure to explain it to you as nicely as possible . <p> Just please , if you are ever at a store , and something does n't ring up the price you expected , handle it in a polite way and do n't immediately go off on your cashier . <p> I 'm mostly bringing this up because I had an extremely rude customer today . <p> The store I work at is closing , and per our liquidator , the price that something rings is the price it is going to be . A couple came into my line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price and I told them their total . They then immediately became rude , claiming they were supposed to get an extra 25% off , which does not happen at my store . My supervisor , who happened to be on register behind me ( we 're short staffed and very busy ) said this nicely to the customer , and the woman immediate snapped at her to mind her own business . <p> Okay , I work at Kmart , so if you 're at all familiar with Kmart ( or Sears ) we have the Shop Your Way rewards program , which allows you to earn points on what you spend and then use those points to get a dollar amount off your purchase . <p> I think this customer confused her $25+ points with 25% off . I did not know she had the points because she did not tell me about them or ask me to use them ( they do not automatically come off , and I told her this and that I would gladly take the points off ) . So with the points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pin number to use them . I told the woman this , and she snapped at me about not having a pin , and I pretty much said , " I was just about to tell you , your pin is right here on your card , you just need to enter these numbers . " <p> Somewhere in the midst of all this , I asked this woman , " Please do not snap at me . " <p> She then replied to me , " I 'm not the one snapping at you , you 're the one with the attitude . " <p> At which point I became both frustrated and upset , and honestly was now trying not to cry . And it was the type of trying not to cry where I could not speak ( I was also shaking really badly ) . I completed this transaction as quickly as I could , rang up the next customer ( who was extremely nice , had witnessed the whole transaction before her , and tried to actually cheer me up . Seriously , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done with her , I went on my break ( my supervisor insisted , because I was clearly upset ) and I went into the employee bathroom and cried . <p> I 've had plenty of rude customers , but this woman ( and a little bit of the man she was with ) were just terribly rude . I found out from my supervisor once I came back , that she had apparently told the managers at my store to basically kill themselves , she also called corporate before coming to the store , and corporate talked to my supervisor and even told her that she was sorry that we had to deal with them . They were honestly just very unpleasant people ( and I really hope none of this is bashing , I 'm trying to be objective about describing this ) , but I just want people to be polite to cashiers . <p> We seriously get so much crap for things completely out of our control ( and sure , there are cashiers out there who are immediately rude to customers ) but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight over something . We are people , and we deserve respect . <p> I never have customers that are so rude , that they make me cry . So again , please be kind to your cashier wherever you go .

@@23757219 @3757219/ <h> Creating the Perfect Mix <p> Though there are sites such as 8tracks that make the fanmix process a little more straight-forward , I find that I personally always lean more towards the tried-and-true method of making fanmixes , such as those that can be found on livejournal , because I feel like there 's a little more freedom as far as what songs are available and can be used . For example , you can only use two songs by a given artist or from a given album , and my mixes tend to be heavily tilted towards a certain artist or album because that 's the feel I 'm going for at the time . <p> Everyones different , but this is the process I go through when making a fanmix or a ficmix , and I 've found it to be fairly simple and efficient for getting the sort of mix that I want . <h> 1 . Find Your Focus <p> Its best to start out as broad as possible and then slowly narrow your focus down . For example , you may want to first select the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow it down to a single episode or one pivotal moment within that characters transformation . For this tutorial , I 'll be making a fanmix for the pairing of Gabriel and Kali of Supernatural . Because the pairing is really only featured in one episode , its is n't as difficult to narrow down , but if I chose to make a fanmix in honor of the Katniss and Gale pairing from the Hunger Games trilogy , I 'd probably want to only focus on their relationship over the span of one novel instead of trying to take on all three books . Large fanmixes are great , but they 're not exactly practical if you plan on sharing your fanmix. <h> 2 . Build Your Playlist <p> When you 're first beginning to build your mix , its better to start out by choosing as many songs as possible and then slowly editing what songs make it to the final cut . It does n't  matter how many songs are on your first playlist . Feel free to add any and all possible songs that may apply to your chosen character or pairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general feeling you get from the song . Of course , not all of these songs are going to be on the final cut , but its always nice to have options . If you happen to have a large music library like me , its definitely a lot easier to pick twenty songs from say , a list of fifty songs than it is to choose twenty songs from a five-thousand-song library . Heres what the first draft of my example mix looks like . Obviously , seventy-five songs and almost five hours of music is excessive , but that 's where the next step comes in. <h> 3 . Edit , Edit , Edit <p> For me , this is by far the most difficult and time-consuming step in the process : narrowing down the playlist . Some songs will be easy to weed out , but as the list gets lower , the editing becomes more difficult . Its best to try to keep it down to one or two songs on a given topic . For example , with the first draft of my Gabriel/Kali mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into a common theme of redemption . In my final draft , there are only two songs with that theme . <p> Another method of narrowing down songs relies simply on taking the time to listen to the mix . Most of the time , there will be a few songs that stick out and do n't  seem to mesh well for whatever reason . Going back to the example , this mix leans more towards the genre of alternative rock , and there were a couple hip-hop songs that , although perfect lyrically , just did n't  sound right in the context of this particular collection of songs . <h> 4 . Take the Time to Listen <p> It seems like an obvious step , but the more time you take out to actually listen to your mix as a whole , the more cohesive itll turn out to be and the easier the editing process with become . When you think you 've narrowed your list down to an appropriate number of tracks , simply listen to it on shuffle . I like to listen to my mixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them because if a mix makes it through a week for me , its safe to say that its wrapped up . There 's always that one song that maybe does n't  quite fit in as well or those two songs that maybe sound a little bit too similar , and its having that trial period that really helps clear those issues up and make the mix feel more polished . <p> Here 's what the final cut of my example playlist looks like . I 'd say that nineteen songs is a huge improvement from the initial seventy-five that I had on the first draft . <h> 5 . Finishing Steps <p> Once you 're completely satisfied with the content of you playlist , its time to work on those last few finishing touches . If you have n't already thought of a title for your mix , nows the perfect time . Its also the right time to put together a front cover or front and back covers , choose the lyrics that you associate most with your chosen focus , and arrange the tracks in the order that youd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do all of these things in . To add album artwork , album title , and associated lyrics , simply right-click on a track , choose " Get Info " from the drop-down list , and fill in the information for each track . To add the cover , you can drag and drop the image file into the box labeled " Artwork . " <p> If you choose to share your mix , the final steps in the process are to package the playlist and upload it to a file-sharing website . I 've found that the easiest way for me is to create a new folder on my desktop , drag-and-drop all of the tracks and the covers into that folder , and then compress the folder into a . zip file .

In 2016 she released a limited edition self-titled EP that contained five of her single . <h> " Wild Horses " <p> " Wild Horses " is one of Bishop Briggs most popular singles , starting with a soft introduction and building quickly to a dark , electronic pop chorus with a pounding drum line that really sets the pace for the song . The beat is strong throughout the song , and you really get the sense of the rushed galloping of horses . It 's an incredibly strong start to such an amazing EP and it sets the tone for some incredible dark pop . <h> " River " <p> The second single on this self-titled EP is " River " , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's reminiscent of Queen 's " We Will Rock You " with the beat being set by stomping and clapping , possibly a song she knew well due to her growing up around a large karaoke scene . <p> In this song , we really see the vocal range of Bishop Briggs come into effect .

Its a must listen to , and really shows you everything that is Bishop Briggs ; strong bass , hints of electric , pop and rock , and a voice thatll knock you off your feet . <h> " The Way I Do " <p> In " The Way I Do " , Bishop Briggs sings more melodically , with her strong voice still coming through but with less of the powerful , hard to hit notes . Its a slightly softer song for her with more of an electronic and gospel feel to it .

Still a great song , but maybe not the strongest on her album . <h> " Pray ( Empty Gun ) " <p> " Pray ( Empty Gun ) " is by far my personal favourite from Bishop Briggs . Again she calls on her reference to religion and love in her lyrics , but there 's just something more poetic about it compared to her other songs . The verses are delicate , especially for Bishop Briggs , but the pre-chorus builds quickly the strength for a powerful chorus with a fantastic bass and electronic feel to it . I feel like this song is more unique with the backing track , even though it does follow the strong drum beat that all her songs share . Its an incredible track , and I never get bored of it . <h> " Be Your Love " <p> " Be Your Love " is the last track on this EP and its much more " chill " than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lot softer , but still clearly a Bishop Briggs song . It has a more R&amp;B kind of feel to it , with the backing track feeling smoother than the guitar and heavy electronic style she favours in her other songs . Its a good finish to the EP , bringing all the power to a soft close that makes you satisfied rather than waiting for more . <p> Overall , Bishop Briggs first EP is a fantastic introduction to her as an artist . Its a dark side to pop not often explored and the collaboration of genres mix so well with her husky yet smooth vocals . Although her tracks do share a lot of similarities that make them blend somewhat , I still think each song is distinct enough to make it a good EP . 
@@23757222 @3757222/ <h> How to Successfully Code a Signature for Mibba <p> A big hello to those of you browsing the forums , wistfully picking apart the complicated , colourful , crazy signatures of other Mibbians ! I 'm here today to give you a brief overview of how to make and display your own complicated signature . It 's actually way easier than it looks - all you need to do is memorise a few code tags for decorated , coloured and resized text , and have a nice colour scheme in mind . <p> You 'll need to start by finding a website where you can easily copy and paste colours . I use ColorPicker , a very basic site with a gradient in . ( You can use the ' analogic ' , ' complimentary ' etc tags at the bottom to generate related colours . ) When you 've your site at hand , open a new tab and locate My Mibba &gt; Profile &gt; Signature . <p> I recommend using the Preview key often as you code , so you can check you 've not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post a few shots for use in aiding you in your quest to code a signature . <p> The very first thing you need to do is decide the alignment of your signature . Available codes for alignment are justify , centre/center , right and left . <p> Now you should have a few colours in mind . If you want text that fades from green to blue , you would use the code gradient=#124508 , #084145beautiful , fancy text/gradient . Otherwise just use colour . <p> You can use gradient and color/colour to change the colour of the text . If you are using colour , then you can simply put the name of the colour instead of the hexadecimal ( #000000 ) code , i.e. colour=red or colour=#FF0000 . Both will work with the colour tag . With a gradient tag , only the hexadecimal will work . You ca n't use gradient=red , green , sadly . <p> Using i , s , b , o , u , sub and sup , you can decorate your text . i will produce italic text , s will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , o will overline it and u will underline it . sub and sup will turn the text between them into subscript or superscript . ( That means that text placed inside sub/sub brackets will fall below the bottom of the text before and after it , and the opposite is true for sup/sup . ) <p> Use the simple code colour=white/colour to create a white line that breaks the alignment of the text to shift it about . Use as many as needed . <p> If you have a link , and want to include it in your amazing red and orange signature , you 're not going to want a ditsy little blue word messing up your code . Simple fix . Seperate the word you 'd like to hyperlink from the rest ( cut off any current **29;269;TOOLONG ) and then type url=www.example.com ( with your url in place of the example ) in front of the word/s . Then between the url code and the word itself , type the colour or gradient code you want the text to appear as . It 's important that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ url , otherwise it breaks the colour and the link . Also be sure to close the gradient first and the url last . For example : LONG ... gives you Mibba ! , but in pink . <p> I think I 've covered most of the important bits . Hope to see many more beautiful signatures on the forums ! 
@@23757223 @3757223/ <p> There are multiple arguments around the development , measurement and classification of intelligence(s) . One of psychologies bigger arguments is should intelligence be define as a singular and superior form of all encompassing cognitive skill . More in tune with the works of Eyesnck and Spearman . Or rather should this complex cognitive functioning be explained more in the way of intelligences , in which one would draw attention to the suggestion of a multiple intelligence framework . This article will act as a knowledge booster and basic summary around one proposal of multiple intelligence . <p> Howard Gardner introduced the theory of multiple intelligence into the psychological dictionary , albeit accidentally . His proposal began in the scientifically ignored publication ' Frames of Mind ' ( Gardner , 1983 ) . However , since the time in which it was published much has developed and the theory has become more accepted . In many cases , it is now more widely accepted than Spearman 's theory of ' g ' . Gardner ( 1993 ) explains his reasons for the proposal , explanations and self-evaluation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original project had started as a developmental research project turned into a matter of intelligence definition . It would seem to be a relatively pleasant accident than young researchers should so unintentionally stumble upon one of the most influential theories of intelligence psychology . However , in the 1993 publication review and extension of multiple intelligences ' Multiple Intelligences . The Theory in Practise ' , Gardner states that the intention of the theory became to broaden the understanding and definition of the cognitive ability . In other words , Gardner and colleagues wished to make the matter of intelligence not only more comprehensive , but furthermore they wished to make it an overall more generally fair an applicable understanding . <p> Of course it is no secret that the intelligence view favoured by educational institutions is the unified intelligence theories surrounding a single , prestigious form of general intelligence . Hence the need for a reliance of such IQ declaring tests as SATs . Exams which are utterly pointless to more select individuals such as those children with autism or acquired brain injury ( ABI ) . However this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a popular phenomenon and a long lived fad . In it 's aims to emphasise a multifaceted theory of intelligence , MI emphasises the importance of understanding the individual abilities and not looking at a uniformed education purely focusing on the general and ' needed ' knowledge which must be taken in school the rigid subject matters imposed alongside an educational curriculum . Especially true of those with more specialist educational requirements and seemingly more limited intellectual ability . <p> Clear differences can be seen between ' g ' and MI . These being in the values ascribed the rated intelligence(s) . For example , in the testing of general intelligence , the focus is on more valued forms of knowledge associated with academia and learnedness . Linguistic and logical ( mathematical ) intelligence , tested in the form of examinations with a singular conclusion and measured in a rating of numbers which determine how intelligent the individual is then deemed to be . ( E.g. 85 = Low IQ , 100 = Average , 130 = Above average , 150 Genius ) . This then decree 's much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher IQ score is likely to be accepted at the more prestigious educational establishments and thus permitted into higher academic orders ( E.g. Oxford , Cambridge , Harvard or Yale . ) <p> In contrast however , Gardner argues that there is not a singular definition of intelligence and that although logico-mathermatical intelligence and linguistic ability surely helps the individual , assists their education and may influence some roots in their life , it neither defines nor truly contributes to the persons overall success as is believed in general intelligence . Rather , he believes that those who simply possess the two major abilities will gain academic success , but it is the remaining five of his intelligences which offer a more determined form of success . <p> There are seven key intelligences listed under Gardner 's proposals : <p> Linguistic Intelligence <p> Mathematical-Logic Intelligence <p> Musical Intelligence <p> Spatial Intelligence <p> Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence <p> Interpersonal Intelligence <p> Intrapersonal Intelligence <p> The belief is that each one of these intelligences exists independently of another , in complete contrast to the belief that one form of intelligence would impede of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus act as predictor of performance of another . Instead , the belief is that one may excel in a singular intelligence facet or just as easily he may excel in several facets or achieve intellectual excellence . Multiple Intelligences rates more fairly on those with autism and ABIs due to the testing of a singular intelligence in segregation to others . This allows for topical excellence in overall intellectual absence ( as is often common as a result of the diagnostic al criterion surrounding autism and ABIs ) . <p> This occurs due to the brain layout . The idea is that each of the seven intelligences link to different parts of the brain , thus activity levels within this area is an influencer of the intelligence level surrounding that intelligence . Evidence has been granted for this . Pinel ( 2011 ) explains about the discovery of specialised brain locations ( Wernicke 's and Broca 's areas ) . The areas are key to certain cognitive abilities , in times of reduced or ceased functioning , the respective cognitive function is thus reduced or eradicated dependent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance which one must understand before furthering their knowledge around multiple intelligences is that no singular one of these intelligences is more important than another . Each are equally weighted and connectively separate . One can excel at logic and struggle with language . We simply rate some as more valuable functions due to current societal hegemony . A shift away from a uniform definition of intelligence could be beneficial , as a globally more applicable rating of intelligence is needed . It would further our knowledge around gender , cultural and age implications of intelligence . Despite the flaws around multiple intelligence in that any form of withstanding investigation is near impossible due to the neurological procedures ( including post-mortem brain dissections and lobotomies ) , it avoids the more impractical and abstract assumptions of g . <p> Multiple intelligences allows for people to continue learning , their intelligence is not fixed by eleven years of age and although there is a natural biological potential for all , the belief remains that people 's potential can indeed be boosted and early enough detection of intellectual difficulty with a singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Canon is just the facts surrounding your respective fandom or bandom . It includes the birthdays of individuals , the history of their life . If its a band , it includes accurate discography and tour dates . <p> I 'm sure some of this information applies to other types of fan fiction , including actor fiction and even Harry Potter fan fiction , but I 'm focusing on bandom . <h> Research is Key . <p> Wikipedia is a great research for basic information , however , it should never be your only source . Users can edit Wikipedia at their own will . I 've done it myself to make Brendon Uries page say he was dating Ryan Ross . So if you see something on Wikipedia , plug it in to Google or ask around and back up the facts you saw . <p> Read primers ! Primers are these amazing things on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people who are writing in a fandom . These tend to include birthdays , family information , and basic canon facts , as well as some you may not have known . Ive been writing my bandom for years , but I recently read a primer on LJ and found out something I did not know . These primers are also written for things like pairings , band in general , band girlfriends , and tours ( like Warped ) . <p> Read interviews with the band members . You 'll not only get information about them , you 'll get a perspective on that information as well as a feel for the way they talk . If its a group interview , you 'll see who talks about what most , who talks most in general , who barely talks . Is one of the members serious while another ca n't seem to take anything seriously ? <p> While YouTube is n't the greatest place for getting factual information , it is a great place to study the personality of your character(s) . Does he look at the camera when he talks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is laughing ? It also helps to know what their voice sounds like . I mistakenly gave a character a soft , girly voice once when she actually had a pretty carrying vocal range . <p> Looking for a timeline is great . Sometimes fans will actually make a timeline and sometimes you have to make your own . If you have to make your own for a band , consider going to their website to see if they archive old tours because this will give you a time frame . If you want to write about the summer of 2006 , you 'll want to know what was going on then . <p> Acquaint yourself with the people surrounding the people in the band . Are you noticing that you 're seeing the same guy kind of lurking in the background of a lot of pictures of the singer of your band ? Find out who that guy is .

@@23757226 @3757226/ <h> So , You Want to Write a Book <p> Since the day I could read , I was infatuated with stories , thatching together my personal book shelf from a very young age ; it was at no surprise that before long the desire to create my own had me typing at my computer . I did n't  know it at the time , but this is what taught me the two absolute most important lessons to becoming an author : read and write . I know it sounds redundant ; of course you 're going to read , how else would you understand the layout of a book and yes you 're going to write you 're writing a book . The point I 'm trying to make is that these two components can not just be a past time , they need to be your life . Novels are n't  like essays or poems , they have their own textual format and it is absolutely vital that you become fluent in its language . <p> The greatest part of writing that sets it apart from all other artistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could n't glance at a canvas and depict how the painter mixed the colors or fashioned his brush , but with a novel there 's no smoke and mirrors , you can always see how its creator strung together their words and paragraphs ; there is never something you cant take away and there 's nowhere for them to bury their secrets . If you 're an ambitious young writer and there is anything to take away from this piece , let it be this : practice your writing every day ; I do n't  care if its on paper , receipts , napkins or bathroom stalls ; you need to not only want to write , but crave it , and once you 've done all that , read twice as much . <p> Okay , you 've done the homework and now its time to write but where to start ? I 'm sure there 's hundreds of internet articles that would advise you to first choose an idea , map out your plot line , generate characters blah blah blah ; you can give that a flip of the bird . Its bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  know I was writing a book , I did n't  even know I was writing a story just write and I promise the ideas will come . Obviously if you start with an idea you 're already two steps ahead of the game , but its by no means a requirement . The same goes for writers block , there 's no such thing , only people who stop picking up their pencil ; you might have to write a couple pages of garbage before the train gets back on its tracks , but nothing is ever not worth writing . As you progress you will constantly find yourself lost in thought , fantasizing your plots next steps to a point bordering on obsession , but its necessary ; nobody just thinks up a four hundred page story on the spot , it takes time and dedication . <p> Let 's jump ahead a few months ; you 've finished your first manuscript congratulations , its a feat not many complete with many soldiers lost along the way , so have a beer , have two , you 've earned it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still work to be done . A manuscript is only the bone structure to your story , now you 're going to need muscles and to do that is going to require editing its a word I can only image most writers cringe at , I know I hate nothing more than to correct my own work but there 's no detours , no easy street . It just has to be done . After you 've strived through the painstaking hours of revising each and every word within the story , you 're going to want to revisit the pages of your labor but you need to refrain from looking , you 're preparing for your final edit . Like anyone who has ever glimpsed at an optical illusion and been unable to see the face hidden behind the shapes , its near impossible to distinguish until returning to the same image a little later ; the same can be said about writing . All those lines you thought were flawless will later turn out to be slop with much required tuning but its not your fault , it can be hard to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will be proud to call the work your own . As for where it goes from there , only God can tell . <p> The truth is I could never really tell you how to create a novel , writing has no E=Mc2 ; like a fingerprint , every author has their own literary identity more commonly known as voice that they and only they can discover . There is one thing however that unites us all , and that is passion . To create something truly beautiful and genuine you need to find your muse ; I wo n't lie , writing a novel is n't easy , in fact it could very well be the hardest thing you 'll ever do . There will be times when you 'll just want to throw down your pencil and quit , I assure you I was no exception and endured my own episodes of near defeat ; but that 's when you take that motivation , the one thing in your life that has you cry yourself to sleep every night with a pain that just wo n't heal , or pushes you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the world ; you channel that inspiration into every word you put down and when you step back you realize its not only by you , but a part of you , and that makes all the difference . <p> On a final note , I would just like to say this : writing is not just a tool , its a gift and one not to be taken lightly . Literature can move mountains and bottle up seas ; it has influenced the world for centuries and will continue to do so for many more . It takes a very special kind of person to be able to put his pencil on paper and have people sit for hours gawking at their work . It will act both as your sword and shield but leaving you to judge how you use them , so I will leave you with the wise words of Ben Parker , " With great power , comes great responsibility . "

I had never understood what it truly meant until two years ago , when I left this world . The day I died . <p> See ? The usual response to something like that is , " What ? Wait , she died ?

In this tutorial you 'll see how to write the HTML for a basic layout . Part II will guide you through the process of writing the CSS to go with it . <p> This tutorial has been adapted from the Custom Layout Tutorial written by the lovely and fabulous lovecraft , as well as her FAQ ( updated FAQ ) . The bulk of it is her work ; I 've just updated it a bit for New Mibba . <h> Important Terms <p> Here are a few key terms and concepts you 'll need to understand to make your own layout : <p> HTML &amp; CSS : HTML and CSS work together to make your profile . In simple terms , HTML is where you build your layout ( ie , what parts there are and where they go on the page ) and CSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , font , and background images ) . HTML uses angle brackets ( you may remember them from math class as less than and greater than signs ) ; CSS uses curly brackets these : . On the New Mibba , HTML and CSS are edited on the same page . Your CSS code will always go between these lines : <p> &lt;style type= " text/css " &gt; CSS CODE &lt;/style&gt; <p> Your HTML code will go below &lt;/style&gt; . <p> &lt;div&gt; &amp; &lt;table&gt; : A &lt;div&gt; is a section ( or division ) of your profile . A table is the further breakdown of a div . In your HTML , divs and tables will build your layout ; then you 'll use CSS to change the way they look . <p> Opening and closing : Every time you use an opening code in HTML , you need to have a closing code when you 're done . Closing codes always start with forward slashes . So &lt;div&gt; defines the start of a division in your code and &lt;/div&gt; ends the division . There are a few exceptions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the code for creating a line break . <h> Making Your Layout HTML <p> Enough introductions ; time to start making your layout ! Take a deep breath and let 's get started . <p> Go to your custom profile editing page by going to My Mibba &gt;&gt; Profile &gt;&gt; Custom profile . If you already have code and think you might want to use it again , save it to a text file on your computer or in a draft on Mibba . Your layout should be blank . Ready for step one ? It 's pretty simple . Paste this into your layout : <p> &lt;div&gt; Content &lt;/div&gt; <p> Not so bad , eh ? We created a division to hold our content , which right now is just one word . Try submitting your changes and looking at your custom profile . It should look like this . Pretty boring so far , but you 've just taken your first step to your own layout ! <p> Now we 're going to add an identification to our div so that we 'll be able to change its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important to add identifications as you go ) . An identification looks like this : id= " name " . <p> Change your HTML to look like this : <p> &lt;div id= " container " &gt; Content &lt;/div&gt; <p> ( Note : All added code will be in bold . ) <p> Our container div will hold all the content of our profile . It separates the content of our profile from the background of the page . Now we 're going to break our layout down further with a table , which will let us divide our layout into as many parts as we want . <p> Tables have three parts : &lt;table&gt; , which is the entire table ; &lt;tr&gt; , which is a table row ; and &lt;td&gt; , which is a table division ( column ) . A table needs all three parts to work , even if the table has just one row and one column . <p> Now that we have IDs , there are a few rules we need to talk about for tables . First is cellspacing . Cellspacing defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . If you have it set high , there will be distinctive gaps between your cells . The code to set cellspacing is this : cellspacing= " 0 " ( or whatever number you choose ) . <p> Second is the table 's border . The border that appears automatically is generally unappealing . The border is set with this code : border= " 0 " ( this number is the thickness of the border set to zero , the border wo n't show up at all ) . <p> What we have now is the skeleton of a layout . Next we need to decide how many sections we want in our layout and how to fit them together . We 're going to divide our layout up like this . ( The letters and numbers are just labels ; we 're not going to put those in the layout itself ! ) How do we turn that picture into code ? Remember that a TR is a row and a TD is a column . A , B , and C are TRs . A and C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a problem , though : we want to make the TDs in rows A and C twice as wide as the TDs in row B. To do that , we need a code called colspan . Colspan tells a division how wide to be . We 're going to add colspan= " 2 " to TDs one and four so that they 'll be twice as wide as TDs two and three . <p> This wo n't change the way your profile looks right away , but , believe it or not , we 're almost done with HTML ! Now we just need to add the content , which can be whatever you want eg , pictures , links to your writing or other sites , an about me section . We 're going to put all these things into this layout to see how it all works . <p> First , let 's add some headers . " Header " is what titles are called in web design .

Class is a type of I 'd that 's used to make everything in that class look the same . We could use an I 'd instead of a class , or we could use both , but for this tutorial all our headers will be the same style so by using class , we 'll only have to tell headers what to look like once in our CSS for all our headers to look the same . <p> ( Your profile should look like this . Since we have n't told headers what to look like yet , they still look like regular text . Do n't worry , we 'll fix that with CSS ! ) <p> Now let 's add an image to TD " one " . To add an image , use this code : &lt;img src= " direct link to image " &gt; . Only pictures of you can be uploaded to your Mibba gallery , so if you do n't want the picture on your profile to be of yourself , you 'll need to upload it to an image-hosting site like photobucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct link to your image .

Links are designated in HTML and CSS with the code &lt;a&gt; . Leaving the URL in our layout is a bit ugly , though , so we 're going to hide the URL in text . To do that , we use this code : &lt;a href= " URL " &gt;Text&lt;/a&gt; . <p> Your layout will now look like this .

As you saw when your profile just held the word " Content " , you do n't need any special codes to insert text . You do need codes to make text bold , italic , strikethrough , or underlined . Let 's add some filler text to TD four and examples of each of these four text modifiers : <p> Notice the &lt;br&gt; at the end of our filler text so that our modified text will start on the next line . Our four text modifiers can do much more than the default behaviors you 'll see on your profile now , but that 's something we control with CSS . <p> Your layout should now look like this .

@@23757231 @3757231/ <h> Freudian Perspectives and Psychoanalytic Approaches to Personality <p> When thinking of psychology , the layperson may not be quite sure what is meant . Of course , the common first thought is of psychic abilities . That a qualified psychological practitioner , or even the amateur psychology student , the common misconception is that they can read minds . Of course , this is about as true as is a fantasy novel with fairies , unicorns and vampires . That meaning , you can believe it all you want , that is not to say that it is true . <p> So then , quite reasonably it may come as a shock to find that one of psychology 's many areas of interest lies around the personalities which we all posses . What makes a personality ? Are there any particular components which need to be met for a personality to be deemed such ? Must one have personality traits ? Are these interchangeable or fixed ? Psychology has made numerous theories around personalities . <p> Psychoanalysis is term unlikely alien even to those uneducated in psychology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's achievements , he is still the face of modern psychology . Thankfully , Freud had a theory around personality , which stemmed the beginning the psychoanalytic personality theories , and thus stems personality theory in general . <p> Freud was one of the earliest thinkers of personality . Following from his Victorian predecessors , he used the simple model of unconscious and conscious thoughts . Although the pre-Freudian view was that people kept experiences in a series of unconscious thoughts , and ultimately it was only the present which was forming the conscious thoughts of an individual and that abnormal psychology and mental health focused on those who were significantly more plagued by the ' unconscious ' thoughts of the past Freud objected to this view in a manner so profound , it not only started a new theory surrounding personality , but a brand new school of thought throughout psychology itself . <p> Freud thought things to be more complex than simply the conscious present and unconscious past . So much so he suggested three forms of mind : The Conscious mind ( the things of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preconscious mind ( things of which we are not explicitly aware , are based between the fully unconscious and the conscious and are temporarily kept within the unconscious thought , however can be accessed by the conscious mind and exploited by the individual . e.g. things kept in long term memory ) , and finally he believed in the unconscious mind ( the thoughts of which we are unaware . ) <p> The unconscious , he claimed , was made that way due to acts of repression . This simply means that socially aware people ( with a developed Superego see later ) will use psychological defence mechanism ( below ) in order to push aside psychologically harming or socially unacceptable experiences or desires . However , these are never truly forgotten and will remain with the person throughout the life course . <p> Freud did not wish to emphasise these as clear cut , standard and unarguable states of mind . There is much interlink between them . Things in the unconscious can be accessed as much as those things in the conscious or preconscious domains . They simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy ) . These can be altered also by the extent to which repression is enforced around that thought or desire . So , unconscious thoughts can become conscious thoughts with reduced amounts of repression placed upon them , just as conscious thoughts can become unconscious with increased repression . <p> Surrounding the Freudian technique of dream therapy in which Freud used people 's dreams as a point of therapeutic discussion in order to help access their more unconscious thoughts which were potentially harming their psychological states . He came up with two premises surrounding the assessment of dreams and accessing of unconscious thought . <p> For these it is important to note that although some regard psychology as a form of science which due to the empirical nature and statistical methods used , it arguably is - many of the more prominent psychologists have argued also that as a science concerned with people , some interpretation is to be allowed due to the naturally subjective nature of human participants . This is clear within Freud 's proposals . <p> Firstly , the key thing to note is the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced from the dreamer ( or patient ) . The raw data of the qualitative study . This is the direct experience provided from the dream recollection . However , it is termed subjective as it has been edited by the dreamer in order to meet the levels of social desirability expected from the dreamer . As many of you will know , for a therapeutic relationship to work , honesty and objectivity must be reached . Essentially , the perfect form of therapeutic relationship would arguably be one which did not possess human presence . Rather two beings unable to lie or edit their experiences . As this will not happen , there is a need for interpretation conducted by a trained therapist . Thus enter Freud 's second key term for the analysis of dream content . ' Latent content ' refers to the interoperated message of the dream . This is the information which the dreamer will often imply by way of codes but will not refer to explicitly . This then is the key to the unconscious thoughts . <p> This is where Freud 's theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The psycho-sexual presence of the unacceptable unconscious mind . <p> Freud claimed that there although dreams are always personal as everyone 's experiences are different . There are some common codes which have explicit meanings found within dreams , it is these that one must identify in order to gain full understanding of the latent content within dreams . ( e.g. ladders = sex ) . Thus a demonstration of dream would look something like this : <p> As you can see , the person talking about climbing a ladder in their dream will have the psychoanalytic therapist translate the true meaning of the dream to be about sex . <p> To help this point , Freud developed two proposed way 's of thinking . Primary process thinking ( related more to the unconscious ) is the irrational mind activity often present in dreams . This emphasises the realism of things which are impossible . So , in a dream one may possess something which they truly want , but that in reality is a complete impossibility . This serves as a justifier of the pleasure principle , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they desire . This is then controlled by repression and the reality principle stated in the secondary process thinking . This refers to the logical , organised and more acceptable thoughts which accompany the conscious mind . <p> Now you have been provided with a more detailed understanding of the Freudian perspective and psychoanalysis , I move swiftly onto the personality development of an individual , starting from the child 's earliest days . Again , I forewarn that this contains some of Freud 's more stereotypical ideas . <p> Freud argued that children , when born , have desires which are purely animalistic . These desires must be met with speed . They serve as survival and progression reactions . They address hunger , pain and reproduction . Children score high in possession of the pleasure principle and low in the possessions of the reality principle . As an interesting but not entirely relevant point he claims they also posses thanatos ( the death principle ) . This helps to form the proposed structure of personality he suggests . <p> The first of these is the i 'd . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure principle in its full . This is seen when babies want and have no acceptance of a delayed response . It is the instinctive need to gain something which is wanted when it is wanted . Following this , the ego develops . This is a slightly more rational based desire . Although desires are still strong , and the child will still adopt a way to obtain their wants , delayed responses and different strategies are used . They learn the techniques which should be used to gain the wanted item and are using more logical , rational and human approaches to obtaining their desires . Finally the superego develops . This is similar to a conscience . Although it is an adult feature , it still allows for the wanting , however it facilitates people to be more able to accept rejection and failure and to cut losses over wanted items . It is socially , politically and environmentally influenced and is not simply instinctive . Of course , as these develop we become more reliant on our rational thoughts ( provided by the ego and superego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight for control . This has appropriately been called ' intra-psychic conflict ' . <p> Freud outline 5 stages to personality development , starting from the earliest moments of a childs life . They address psycho-sexual issues as well as the development of personalities . These stages are as follows : <p> The Oral Stage ( from birth to one year ) Can be observed as a period when children will place almost anything within their mouth . This stage is important for personality development as it allows the expectancies of the child to form . Cathexis can develop in this period , this is simply where the child will become over attentive those who meet their pleasure demands . However , an over-indulgence of this can theoretically lead to an oral-receptive character later in the child 's life ( this is someone regarded as being preoccupied with demands and must have their needs met ) . Under indulgence leads to an oral-aggressive character ( someone who exploits others for gain ) . <p> The Anal Stage ( from 18 months to three years ) This is commonly the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in handling this can again lead to two proposed personality types . Anal-retentive character ( overly orderly , stingy , stubborn and delays gratification of others ) , or anal expulsive character ( resists the rules and authority of others , untidy and disorganised individuals ) . <p> The Phallic Stage ( from 3 to 5 years ) Development of penis envy ( girls ) or castration anxiety ( boys ) . Freud also argues for the development of the Oedipal Complex at this point . Here he says that boys develop sexual beliefs about their mothers , thus see their fathers as a sexual challenger . Whatever your beliefs around this , it is suggested that this is where the development of sexuality also begins . Issues with the development at this stage is different for males and females . Males may become promiscuous , or alternately may develop more feminine sexual desires and thus grow more liking of men . Females may develop more feminine sexual desires such as the desire of children and the liking of men , alternately like males they may develop more masculine desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Latency Stage ( 5-12 years ) A brief gap in development from childhood before puberty . <p> The Genital Stage ( 12 years+ ) - The stages tie together and thoughts become more mature . Personality characteristics are displayed more . However , the remaining unresolved issues from previous stages return , particularly those surrounding the Oedipus complex and the oral stage . Freud claims that the displaying of a lack of sexual desire by this point is abnormal ( and can be a strong indicator of the persons sexuality ) . <p> As mentioned earlier , adults form psychological defence mechanisms which allow for these personality characteristics controlled by the unconscious mind to be controlled and presented in more socially acceptable ways . This is particularly true of those with a more normal development , and thus absence of significant mental health problems and may differ in cases where the individual suffers from an abnormal psychological balance . These deference mechanisms also control the intra-psychic conflict between the i 'd , ego and superego . These mechanisms are as follows : <p> Repression <p> Denial <p> Projection <p> Reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Displacement <p> Regression <p> Isolation <p> Undoing <p> Sublimation <p> However , despite the outstanding contributions which Freud has undoubtedly made to psychology and psychological sciences ( including psychiatry ) some points of evaluation should be noted . The work was more qualitative , and though reliable , his subjects were his own patients suffering from complex sometimes undefined problems . This makes empirical testing for the validity of his theories hard , if not virtually impossible . Although he gathers enough evidence and has strong cases to serve as a reliable and somewhat valid explanation(s) the issue of retesting will always be a problem . <p> Points can be awarded around the applicability of the theory . Although Freud 's work focused on primarily unhealthy ( psychologically ) participants , his work can be applied to both normal and abnormal populations . Something which is often exceptionally rare within psychological fields , as only minor adjustments are needed and comprehensive explanations are provided . This means that most concerns can be explained using psychoanalysis . The work also continues to develop as time continues , more theorists are interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names ( Jung and Adler ) have adopted psychoanalytical approaches to their work . <p> Freud also contributed quite significantly to the current structure of the mental health system . Introducing talking therapies as important and placing emphasis of uncovering the secrets of the unconscious mind . This means he has had a significant overall contribution and benefit in the fields of psychiatry and clinical psychology . <p> Thus , it is safe to confirm that despite the sketchy ethical implications and the sometimes over sexualised nature of Freud 's work . One can confirm it is seemingly of more benefit than error in the discipline of psychology . Particularly when one considers the extensions to the work which have happened as a result of Freud 's thinking . However , these will be emphasised in future articles . <p> For information as to where information was drawn from , please do not hesitate to ask .

@@23757235 @3757235/ <h> Sexuality : The Nature vs Nurture debate <p> The Nature-Nurture debate is a long running psychological debate . One which is still greatly of interest in matters of , behaviour , child development and even what makes a criminal . For the purpose of this essay I shall focus on one representative argument in the nature-nurture debate , this being sexuality . The belief of sexuality being a factor of Nature or Nurture will be discussed through the Psychological Levels discussed in Psychology : the science of mind and behaviour ( 2nd Ed ) 2012 . These being biological ( Evoluntionary Psychology ) , Environmental ( Behaviourism ) and Social ( Social Psychologists ) . <p> Evolutionary Psychology began with Charles Darwin upon the publication of his book The Origin of the Species in 1859 . Since then Evolutionary Psychology has only advanced . Around the time of Darwins work , Mendel ( 1855-68 ) was working on understanding genetics , he proposed that there were two of each gene given to a person by their mother and their father . This theory was later expanded to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an understanding of Chromosomes and Hormones creating DNA . <p> This could then be a great example of why LeVay ( 1991 ) suggested that there was such a thing as a Gay Gene which determined whether or not an individual would be homosexual or heterosexual . His study was performed on deceased males , both homosexual and heterosexual . He discovered a difference in the size of the mens brains . This was suggestion for their being a strand of the mens DNA which determined their sexuality . <p> Following this research was that of Griffith Vaughan Williams ( 1993 ) . He also believed that the Gay Gene existed and that it was passed from mother to son much like an X chromosome . His study was conducted on over 50 pairs of brothers who were homosexual . He found that 46% of these brothers had at least three matching chromosomes . This was , he suggested , proof of natural sexuality . <p> However the results of the two above studies are from conclusive. 46% is not a high enough percentage in genetically related individuals to claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it turned out all of his homosexual participants had died from AIDs , this could have been a major factor in the difference in brain sizes . On the opposite side of the nature scale is the work of Buss ( 1998 ) ( as cited in Peterson and Hyde 2010 ) which suggests that humans females especially are naturally tuned to procreation , suggesting that heterosexuality is biologically determined . <p> Some Psychologists would say however , that sexuality is a creation of ones upbringing and the things they are exposed to everyday , this then is an argument that sexuality is mostly nurture . Since the removal of homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses in 1973 , media has been able to introduce the topic more and more . People are now more commonly exposed to stories of homosexuality ( and bisexuality ) in magazines and newspapers from their role models , and on television programmes . Bandura ( 1977 ) came up with the Social Learning Theory . This theory suggests that children who witness an event , or repetitively observe behaviour are more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such behaviour . <p> Following up on the point of media coverage of sexuality is a study conducted by Ward and Friedman ( 2006 ) . This research looked into the television viewing of adolescents and their attitudes of sexual behaviours . Their study found that when exposed to video clips of sexually stereotypical roles the adolescents had a more positive attitude and higher belief that such sexual behaviour was normal . This backs the work of Bandura and would allow one to suggest , the more exposure given to homosexuality the more the behaviour seems acceptable and normal . This then suggests an increase in homosexual ( and bisexual ) behaviour being a nurtured factor . <p> The social learning theory would then be a good backing for what was found by Wellings , Field , Johnson and Wadsworth ( 1994 ) . ( as cited in Stainton Rogers and Stainton Rogers 2001 ) This being that they asked Males and Females how many times they had been involved in any homosexual activity . They found that more males than females had partook in some homosexual activity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90% of all male participants in the study admitted to having a female partner and did not regard themselves to be homosexual . <p> This does then not completely back the views of Bandura ( 1977 ) and Ward and Friedman ( 2006 ) . According to research into the views of homosexuality among American males ( Whitley &amp; Kite 1995 ) it would suggest that American Males are less accepting of homosexuality than American Females . It was said that males were asked to rate their views of homosexual men by answering whether or not they would socially accept them . Kite and Deaux ( 1986 ) concluded that the reactions of heterosexual males was different when talking to homosexual males dependent on their views of homosexuality . Less information about themselves was provided , requested from others and their ratings of the person declined when they knew the other male was homosexual than when they did not . <p> However , both of the above research were done before a time when sexuality was such a large media topic with such easy access to it . This then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment in which a person is brought up can affect their viewpoints of a topic . ( those brought up in homophobic families are perhaps less likely to be or admit to being homosexual ) . <p> The above evidence leads me to conclude that sexuality is almost certainly a result of both nature and nurture and that ones biology itself can not be the singular cause for the individual being homosexual or heterosexual . It seems to be due to a mix of factors including the persons biology and genetic structure , as was suggested by Williams ( 1993 ) and the environment the person is brought up in and they are exposed to according to the social learning theory . Bandura ( 1977 ) . However , according to the above evidence it seems of better judgement to suggest that the sexuality of a person is far more dependent on their nurture than their nature as nature suggests human need for procreation which does not leave a place for homosexuality as being biologically determined .

Sperm donors are used in many situations : with lesbian couples who wish to have children , by single women who have n't found the right man to have a child with , even by heterosexual couple due to problems with conceiving . <p> Generally , sperm donors are the biological father of the child their sperm has created , but they have no legal or financial rights in the eyes of the law . Since 2005 , the UK has removed the right for anonymity for the donor as the children conceived through the donated sperm are able to trace their biological father when they hit 18 should they wish to . <p> Now , it has been ruled by the High Court that " men who donate sperm can apply to seek a role in the lives of their biological children " following cases where two lesbian couples used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they were friends with .

While this ruling does n't mean that every man that submits an application to seek a role in their biological child 's life will be accepted , it certainly does make you think . Even though this only applies to people who use sperm from donors they know , it raises questions about what the future will hold for the possibility of unknown donors being able to seek access to their biological children despite having no legal role as parents of the child . <p> Sperm donations used to be anonymous for the men and safe for the parents of the child , so why the changes ?

Being a parent is more than just being the one who biologically created the child , it 's about giving the child love , care and affection , and being the one to financially care for the child .

You may have felt it in front of your friends or your coworkers , or even your kids , and all I know is that : <p> No one wants to break down in tears in front of people they have to face everyday . <p> It 's impossible to look dignified while crying . <p> So here are a few tips to fight the crying impulse . <h> Method 1 : <p> Think happy thoughts . This tip wo n't help you fly off to Never land but it will prevent you from losing it , in front of people . If you feel the sudden heat swirling in your throat and rushing to your face , STOP . And think about how someone you dislike embarrassed themselves . Although it 's not necessarily a good thing to take joy in others pain , it should hold you over until you can apologize in private . Or not . Which ever floats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's causing you pain . Think about puppies , your favorite fandom , a celebrity that you adore ! Even start thinking about food . Thinking about food long enough can make you hungry and I 've found that hunger often distracts you from other things . <h> Method 2 : <p> Pick the aggravator apart . Not literally . We do n't need any more crazy people in this world . But in your mind , analyze whoever or whatever is making you cry . It may seem odd and it may seem counter productive but , criticize them . <p> Look at their clothes , their hair , their stance , anything will do . If the person making you cry is your significant other or ex significant other , do not relent . Think about how stupid they are for making you cry/ breaking up with you etc . You are a wonderful person , and they have just made the biggest mistake of their lives . <p> The same goes for being fired or reprimanded by a boss . Pick . Them . Apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insult them in private later . <h> Method 3 : <p> Write a story . Writing has always been good for expressing and releasing your feelings . The character , the setting , the plot , just take it out on those factors . <p> If you do n't have anything to write on near by , write it out in your head . This will also help with distraction . Odds are if you are thinking up a storm while someone is talking to you , you wo n't hear anything they 're saying . Therefor if you ca n't hear , you ca n't cry , because you are not aware of what is being said . <p> *This method is not to be used when being reprimanded or fired by a boss or reprimanded by a teacher . <h> Method 4 : <p> Physical distractions . Widening your eyes , will prevent the tears from falling . Do not blink . Blinking caused tears to fall . If you are a Doctor Who fan , just pretend the person making you cry is a weeping angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to 1920 . <p> Loosen your jaw . That may seem odd , but by loosening your jaw you are easing the pain on your throat . <p> Pinch or bite yourself . And by bite yourself I mean your lip or your tongue , not somewhere noticeable . Small pains , will distract you from crying . Your body will re-direct the your emotional pain to a smaller more manageable pain in your body . Do n't overdo it though , no need to seriously harm yourself . <h> Method 5 : <p> Keep a calm and carry on . Adopt a calm , nonchalant look . If you look too happy , some people might get creeped out or think you 're laughing at them . <p> Do n't look at anyone face , instead focus on something beside them or a part of their body that does not involve the T-Zone ( eyes , nose , mouth ) . <p> So if you ever feel the urge to cry , look back on these methods and use them . But let me warn you ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can result in high levels of stress , which can then result in physical injuries ! So when you get to a private place , cry or write it out . Or go to the gym and work it off .

@@23757243 @3757243/ <h> How to Clean and Change Strings on an Acoustic Guitar <p> I love guitar . Its a beautiful instrument , and does wonders for the sex appeal of men and women all over the world . Unfortunately , you are n't  going to be getting the ladies ( or men ) with a guitar that sounds duller than sin and is covered in fingerprints and dead skin . A vastly overlooked part of being a guitarist is learning how to properly clean your guitar and how to re-string it to perfection . In this tutorial , I 'm going to attempt to show you how to do both on an acoustic <h> You Will Need : <p> An acoustic guitar , obviously . <p> A fresh set of strings . It will depend on your guitar and personal preference as to what gauge of strings you use . I generally use .10s . <p> Several soft cloths . <p> A cleaning kit . Most music stores will sell you them for about 20 . <p> A string winder ( this is optional , but really helpful ) . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old strings off of your guitar . The easiest way to do this is to loosen the string by turning the tuning peg towards or away from you until you hear the sound getting flatter ( or lower ) . Taking your string winder next ( or if you do n't  have one , your nails ) and get a good grip on the little pegs on the bridge of your guitar . Carefully prize the pins out of their niches . The bottom of the string should follow . Completely unwind the string from the top of your guitar , and discard it . <h> Step Two <p> Now that there are no strings on your guitar , its time to clean the fretboard . A ridiculous amount of dead skin and dust is pushed into the grain of the wood every day , and its important to remove some of the grime every so often . Depending on the cleaning kit you 've bought , you should have a few different options now . The kit that I have includes five different cleaning tools . The first thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most kits come with one of these in a handy spray bottle . Spray a little of the formula onto one of your soft cloths , and rub it into the wood of the fretboard . You will notice a dark stain on the cloth as you clean , particularly with the darker woods , but do n't  worry about this ; its normal ! Clean the entire fretboard until it shines , but do n't  put too much of the formula on or you 'll end up with a soggy stick of wood . Next , if your kit has it , choose the fretboard conditioner . Mines has a handy little applicator tip , but some do n't  . Massage some of this into the fretboard , making sure to remove any excess . Your fretboard is now clean and conditioned . <h> Step Three <p> And now onto the most laborious task ; the body . To keep the finish on you guitar looking new , you 're going to have to polish it regularly . Again , your guitar cleaning kit should come with some tools to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most finishes . The first of these is cream of carnauba bodygloss . Its a cream-based , and appears very streaky at first . In small sections , out some of this onto a cloth and sweep it over the body in a wax-on wax-off movement . Do this until the guitar is streak-free . Next , you 'll need a guitar polish . Nearly every guitar cleaning kit will come with one of these . Spray a little of this onto the surface , and do the same as before , ensuring not to leave any streaks . Your guitar should now be looking shinier than ever . <h> Step Four <p> The final task is to add more strings . Taking one of the pegs that you removed from the guitar earlier , get a string and find the small ball at the end . The peg will have a small groove in it at one side , so fit the string into that groove nicely , making sure that the ball is at the thinnest side of the peg . Again , being very careful , insert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the string is sitting properly on the nut at the top of the fretboard . Thread the string through the hole in the pegs at the top of the guitar , and begin winding . You 're going to want to wind until the string is relatively tight . Do n't  tune it up straightaway , stretch the strings a bit by placing your finger underneath the string and pulling gently . Do the same for the rest of the strings . <h> Step Five <p> Finally , once everything is re-strung , tune the guitar up . Youll have to do this quite a few times over the course of the next few days , but the tuning will eventually stabilise once the strings are stretched enough . The last thing to do is to slide a bit of string cleaner over the strings . Not necessary , but I find it keeps my strings for much longer . <p> You should n't have to do this often ( I re-string my guitar once every two or three months ) , but it is an excellent way to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible .

@@23757249 @3757249/ <h> How to Get More Readers <h> Step One <p> Advertise your work . Pimp out your story to your friends , in journals , or use forum threads like this one . Make sure to add strong hooks to your descriptions when advertising your story . Never give away too much ! Add mystery , something that 'll make people want to click your link and start reading . You can pimp your story pretty much anywhere . Add a link in your signature , talk about it in a journal , make it super special and bold on your profile , or even advertise on entirely different sites ! if you have an account on another writing site , add links there . If you have a blog or a tumblr , you can easily post excerpts or summaries to gather more readers and fans . And if you 're brave enough , you can always share your work to your friends on facebook and other social networking sites . <h> Step Two <p> Use comment swaps . Some people dislike comment swaps , but even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are the easiest and quickest way to make your story more popular . Use forum threads like this one to comment swap your chaptered story . Use this thread for your one-shots , and this one for your drabbles . If you want a more detailed review on your story and are willing to give one in return , then this thread is the right one for you . Journals are also a great way to comment swap . <h> Step Three <p> Use pretty and easily readable layouts . Not only does this attract readers to your story , it gives your work a much more original and professional feel , something readers flock to like insects to light . If you need help learning how to make story layouts , you can use this forum thread . If you want a pre-made one that is made by fellow users , you can use this thread . And you can always ask any questions you may have about making your layouts here ! Also , if you see someone who has story layouts you admire , ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to help you out . <h> Step Four <p> Make steady updates . This only applies to chaptered stories , but I think it is extremely important . Soooo many people have a lot of difficulty updating their story often or even on a somewhat steady basis . If you work hard to master this challenge , readers will find your story , and continue to follow it . If you abandon your readers , they will also abandon you . The easiest thing for a reader to do is stop reading . I think posting a new chapter once every week is a good start , but do n't update too often ! If you update every day for a few days , chances are that your readers might get annoyed and feel like they ca n't keep up . It will also wear you out much faster and give you an excuse to go without updating for a long time afterwords . Do n't update in random crazy spurts , be steady ! <h> Step Five <p> Listen to your comments , listen to your readers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your writing , then allow yourself to beam ! Be happy , and make sure to thank them if you want to go the extra mile . The same thing goes for a more negative comment . If someone gives you advice or suggestions on how to improve your work , do n't close up against their words or get defensive . Listen to them with an open heart and try as hard as you can to fix your mistakes . Thank them , too ! They have been thoughtful enough to take the time out of their day and try to help you with your story . These kind of comments prove that yes , they have read it , and that they 're trying to help you , even if they may say some things you 'd rather not hear . Then , on the other hand , if someone is flat-out bashing your story with insults that seem offensive and not in the slightest helpful , that is when you report it . Go here to learn more about reporting . <h> Step Six <p> Make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well it applies to all writing ! Make it unique , something you 've never read or even heard of before . This will make your readers curious and captivated , along with allowing your story to be much more interesting . Write characters with interesting and unique qualities . Make your plot twist and turn until your readers get lost and ca n't seem to find their way out of the story even if they try . Making your story orginal and unique is really not as difficult as it seems . Take another idea and add a twist to it , perhaps . Or think of something new altogether ! <h> Step Seven <p> Research . For heaven 's sake , research ! Write what you know . If you are n't sure about something , look it up until you 're more than confident writing about it . If any information is incorrect in your story , and your readers manage to notice it , then ... you 're doomed . Do your research before you write . Look up anything and everything , and make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bearings . If you are n't sure whether someone from so-and-so town would use a certain phrase in their dialect , look it up ! Do n't guess , do n't improvise , especially if it 's something bigger than a simple phrase . Make sure you know details about what you 're writing , so that you can connect with your work . <h> Step Eight <p> Write what other people love and what you love . This does n't necessarily mean you should write about " popular " themes and topics , as those can be easily classified as cliche . Pay attention to what kind of stories your favorite authors are writing . What exactly do you like about them ? Reflect off these details , and make sure to listen to what people have to say , especially readers . Talk to people outside of the internet . Ask advice from friends and family , or host surveys on what people would like to hear next . You can visit this forum thread or this one to browse through what hundreds of users desire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through what hundreds of users hate to see in stories . The options are endless ! <h> Step Nine <p> Make your first chapter amazing , make it so your readers ca n't help but to subscribe and beg for more . The first chapter is the most important one . It 's your story 's outer shell , it 's what your readers will read first . It 's what will make up their first impressions of your story and whether or not they want to continue . Have a hook so powerful that it snags them by their throats ! Ahh , of course not literally , but you probably understand what I mean . If not any other chapter , the first one should make your readers interested . Do n't type something up and then automatically post it . Read it over , revise it , ask for con/crit before you post , let it settle in your head for a few days before you actually post . Would you read something like what you 've just written ? Pretend you 're the reader for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your passion-filled intense-writer mode before you edit your work and definitely before you post it . <h> Step Ten <p> Love your story . It 's your child , growing up with each sentence you type into its life . Make it live ! Give it adventure and nourishment . If you take the time and put effort into your story , and if you really love writing it , there is no doubt that your readers will love reading it and that its audience will grow .

@@23757254 @3757254/ <h> A Proposed End to Human Suffering <p> Less than 65% of the people on this planet are happy ( Bobby Dodd Ph.D ) . There are very legitimate reasons for this unhappiness , and there is a solution to all of it . Ending the human species all at once in a painless manner that the general population does not see coming would solve all issues on the planet . All suffering can be eliminated , and should be , if the planned end of the earth can get support by the scientific community , and generous resources and funding . <p> Living as a human is not a pleasant experience , on average . Every 3.6 seconds , someone dies of starvation ( Think Quest ) , about 33.4 million people are living with HIV , and in the past ten years , about ten million children alone have been psychologically traumatized by warfare ( Unicef ) . Even the " good " parts of life really are n't  that good . Only 13% of marital relationships are romantic after 20 years , and zero percent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love " ) . In recent studies , its also been shown that people who make less than $20,000 a year are only in a bad mood 12% more often then people who make over $100,000 a year . Love and money can not save us from our woes ( Eric Qui+ones ) . Anyways , it is estimated that for the price of $30 billion a year , world hunger could be cured , yet the U.S.A spends 18 times this amount on military and arms trade each year ( " What Would it Cost to End World Hunger ? " ) . Obviously , as humans we do n't  care enough about each other to work through our problems and would rather kill each other then give a little trust and helping hands . <p> One may think this is sufficient evidence that we live in a cruel world . Some would argue that the happiness on this planet balances out this pain , but religion can be argued evidence that this is not true . Though many religious scholars have found gaps in our understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one has come up with any positive evidence for the positive claim of an existence of a god ( Theodore M. Drange ) . In order to believe in something that has no positive evidence , one must have reasons other than logic for the belief . One idea is that this faith comforts them . Their lives are not worth living without an unopened box that they can believe having knowledge of the innards of would right all the wrongs in the world . As long as they have this supernatural element , a lock on the box so it can never be opened ( religion ) , they can imagine that the content of this box of unknowns explains that there is a good reason why our world is so full of suffering . Taking this into account , without the belief in things with no positive evidence , a higher percentage of people would be suicidal , as evidenced by increased suicide rates among those who do not regularly attend religious services ( B.A. Robinson ) . Human life is not worth living . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we as a species display might be on the right path to ending all suffering . If we could put an end to all lives on this planet at one time in a way that is painless and with no warning , no one would suffer in the process of dying . Additionally no one could suffer after they died because they would lack the neurological activity to feel emotional or physical pain . They would not fear for their lives if they do n't  see their demise coming . They will not feel the loss of their loved ones as they will not be aware that they are going to die , either . They will not feel any physical pain as they parish if it happens instantly , because the neurological signals of pain will not have time to reach their brain before the time their brains are incapable of reading them . Killing everyone on earth would solve all of its problems , and not cause any suffering in the process of doing so . There are many , many arguments against this plan . One is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , but society has already taken away peoples right to die . People know that when they kill themselves , many people around them are hurt . It is estimated that a suicide immediately effects at least six other people besides the committer . In essence , this is just an exchange on one right for another . Also , though the right to live is being taken away , the people will never know that this happened . What good is a right if you do n't  even know when its gone ? Its like having an invisible cookie . If someone steals it , you will never feel any effects of the loss , because there is no way of knowing if you have the cookie or not . This is the reason people do not value their invisible cookies , and therefore should not value their right to live , in this specific situation . Another argument is that killing people is wrong . This argument is unsupportable in anyway . It assumes there is such a thing as right and wrong , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is riotous or not , and as previously discussed , most agree there is no positive evidence for a god ( Theodore M. Drange ) . On top of this , even assuming there is a god , most religions believe in an afterlife , and usually one that treats its obedient followers favorably ( Victor J. Zammit ) . Because of this , killing everyone on the earth would just be sending the worthy to their enjoyable afterlives sooner rather than later . Those committing " Sins " of killing that would send them to unfavorable afterlife would be making a sacrifice of their favorable afterlives much like the religious figure Jesus Christ who was said to have sacrificed his life for the good of others . Assuming this god is loving and reasonable , he would excuse the people involved in the " Sin " of killing because they only did it out of compassion . On top of this , if the god is not loving and reasonable , why should we be so concerned with pleasing him ? It would be giving into a cruel tyrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to human suffering . <p> Unfortunately , we do not currently have the means to carry out this plan . The earth currently has about 23,375 nuclear war heads ( " How many nuclear weapons are there in the world ? " ) . It is estimated that if 14,000 were used , the earth would go into nuclear winter for three years and that only 40% of the world population would die from direct effects , including starvation and disease . Even if we set off all the nuclear weapons on his earth at one time , the effect would not be enough to kill everyone , let alone instantly and painlessly ( " Does the US have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the entire world ? " ) . There is also the option of sending our nuclear weapons into the asteroid belt in hopes of sending a large piece of rock off course and into our planet , but even if the plan was kept top secret , chances are amateur astronomers would see the meteorite coming ahead of time and notify others , causing worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) . It would be possible , however , to destroy the earth in an explosion if we used vacuum energy , and it only would take the volume of a common light bulb to evaporate all our oceans in this way ( " Top 10 ways to destroy the earth " ) . Still , we would have to figure out how to harness the energy and hook it up to a power plant . If we let this reaction run out of control , we would have created more than enough energy to blow our planet to small pieces , and satisfy all of the " quick , painless , and thorough " requirements . It is estimated this could be accomplished in the next 50 years if the project is started now and has the support of the scientific community , plus generous funding ( " Top 10 ways to destroy the earth " ) . Some may say that this would be too expensive , but once the plan is over , money ceases to have any significance , so resources should only be limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get their hands on without causing suspicion of the people not yet involved . With the right cooperation , the ending the world is a feasible task . <p> Our world of humanity is not worth living in . All the problems that have ever come into existence for the human race have one simple solution , and that is to end the race all together . If done correctly this will cause no suffering and can be done within this generations life time .

Best-selling author Brad Meltzer has been writing novels for more than a decade . He has studied and written about some of the most revered institutions and documents in human history , including the U.S. Supreme Court , the Presidency , the Secret Service , Wall Street and the Bible . Brad has assembled a team to investigate the countless clues and theories uncovered through his years of research .

However , they have come to find out that America 's icon of freedom might actually be loaded with secret symbols put there by a secret society looking to take over the world . They follow a claim that the Illuminati , a secret European society loosely affiliated with the freemasons , turned every inch of the statue into a coded message . Brad and his team investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . When consulting a numerologist , he shows the team why he believes the statue is really a monument to the all-powerful number 7 .

Christine took a look at the measurements to see if she was " hiding a larger idea . " Upon looking at her measurements such as the height , 151 and 1 inch , the pedestal , 305 and 1 inch , the index finger , 8 feet and 1 inch Buddy comes to question why they added a single inch to all her measurements .

The pose is known as a sign of the Free Masons and after looking up all of the creators the team concludes they were all members of the secret society . <p> In Meltzer 's words , " The Free Masons are the worlds oldest and largest brotherhood . They 're steeped in covert rituals and symbolism ... There are about 6 million Free Masons in the world today .

Without that extra inch the number is not divisible by seven and it does not break down into seven . <p> Siegel says , " If you know about number symbolism you know that the number 7 is one of the most sacred , divine numbers .

Bush , his father , his grandfather all through the skull and bones society , which is considered the American branch of the Illuminati " . <p> Meltzer explains the Skull and Bones society as " an infamous secret society , founded in 1832 at Yale University . Their members are the power elite . Both President Bush and Senator John Kerry are members , which also makes them the most over played bad guys . Theyre blamed for everything from the invention of the nuclear bomb to the Kennedy assassination . " <p> When asked if the team was supposed to take his word Dice tells them to look around and theyll see Illuminati signs such as the rising sun , the pyramid and the eye and a pyramid with illumination behind it . " The Illuminati has set up multiple , enormous monuments . Go to Rockefeller center , the cathedral of St. John . Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much Dice talks , the team is unconvinced . Later they meet up with Dr. Stan Monteith author of " Brotherhood of Darkness " at the obelisk that Dice had mentioned . <p> Dr. Monteith says , " If you were to look at this from a helicopter you would see a point within a circle . That has a specific occult meaning . Its the idea of an eye , you 'll see it on the back of a dollar bill . They use the eye repeatedly as the emblem of knowledge ... the eye of Lucifer . " <p> Dr. Monteith expressed his belief that New York is the modern day Babylon and that Babylon would one day be destroyed . After their visit with Dr. Monteith they head over to Rockefeller center . Out front is Prometheus holding a torch in front of a lit fountain . <p> Scott then says , " What 's interesting , I think is that Rockefeller , the one that allegedly admitted being in a secret society and wanting a new world order , would have a place after him like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of flags around . Its sort of in a sense I think , going along with what Mark Dice was saying . " <p> Leaving the center the team then heads to St. Johns Cathedral . Upon seeing Atlas , the Titan who holds the world , Christine states , " Isnt that a weird place , right across from one of the most beautiful cathedrals - " Scott finishes her sentence by saying , " Atlas holding up the world , one world . " Buddy then notes that Christianity is on one side of the street with the cathedral and paganism on the other with Atlas . According to what Dice was saying earlier , that was purposefully done . <p> Meltzer states , " If you believe that Prometheus holding the flame is an Illuminati symbol and Atlas with the world on his shoulders represents one world order and that this was intentionally placed across the street from a catholic church . And that the statue of Liberty is an Illuminati beacon , then yes , you can say that there 's a powerful network of symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . But that 's if you believe the Illuminate even existed in the 20th century .

Meltzer states that he " wanted somebody creditable who does n't  dress like they should have been on the X-Files .

@@23757261 @3757261/ <h> Welcome to the Badlands <p> Halsey . She 's a biracial , bisexual , bipolar twenty-one-year-old rising singer/songwriter breaking the mold for modern female artists , and her debut album Badlands was released 2015 , following her debut 2014 EP named Room 93 . <p> Born Ashley Frangipane , she now uses Halsey as her stagename , and was discovered at just seventeen after posting a song she wrote and performed on her SoundCloud account . It garnered her a great amount of attention and she signed to a label . That song was called " Ghost " and it now features on Badlands . <p> Badlands is described as a concept album , meaning the songs it holds express a particular theme or idea . Halsey herself has described the Badlands as a dystopian society , inspired by post-apocalyptic movies , and surrounded by wasteland , meaning anyone in the Badlands are trapped there . This is a metaphor for Halsey 's own personal mental state , and found writing it to be an escape from real life , despite describing there to be no escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an optimistic metaphor because it is still an escape to her . This could act as comforting advice to her fanbase , filled with younger fans and those the same age group as her , going through similar struggles . <p> The honest and hard-hitting lyrics are gripping from the word go , and tied in with clever electronic melodies , it makes for a strong and complete collection of good tunes . Some are the kind one might sing along to loudly and obxiously in the car , while others provoke deeper thinking and emotion . <p> The album opens with the track " Castle " , in which Halsey boldly proclaims , " I 'm headed straight for the castle / They wan na make me their queen / And there 's an old man sitting on the throne now saying that I probably should n't be so mean . " I see a song about a woman taking back what she knows , taking back her personality , and not letting anyone stand in her way . <p> " Castle " blends into " Hold Me Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halsey down . The dark subject matter is uplifted by the heavy beat , putting anyone in mind of Halsey 's bold stage moves that she matches with this song , in which she drops to her knees on the chorus and thrusts/grinds her way through the lyrics . The song , however , is not so much a sexual one . It would appear to be a possible struggle with not feeling pure , and being restricted within this feeling . <p> The album 's third track , " New Americana " , describes the youth of today and their diversity ; how different they are from their parents , their grandparents , and possibly even other people their own age , however " we do n't feel like outsiders at all . " That lyric has shown it is okay to own who you are , and with Halsey 's alternative style , it is very believable that this is possible . <p> The next two tracks , " Drive " and " Roman Holiday " , seem to deal with the classic teenage love story and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing . But with Halsey 's sincere lyrics , there are no cliches spotted here . " Drive " is slower , sadder , but something people can relate to . " Roman Holiday " , on the other hand , is much more bouncy and catchy , and gives the first blunt sexual reference of the album when she states , " Could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on that drive to Queens ? / ' Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat . " Halsey 's straight-forward speak of sex in her songs is refreshing , and " Roman Holiday " also appears to handle the struggle of people believing her relationship with this person she 's writing about to be an unhealthy one , as hinted by the title ( a Roman holiday is described through a simple Google search as " an occasion on which enjoyment is profit is derived from others ' suffering or discomfort . " ) and also by the lyrics that mention her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's perfume , and general talk of sneaking around . <p> The lovesick songs blend into " Colors " , another one about a boy , but it 's less romantic and more recognising how unhealthy he was and how it was to be with him . " Colors " is described even by Halsey herself as the fan favourite , and gathering by the countless lyric edits I have seen with my own eyes all over the internet , Tumblr in particular , with the spoken-rather-than-sung line , " You were red , and you liked me ' cause I was blue . You touched me and I was a lilac sky , and you decided purple just was n't for you . " Halsey has described those lyrics as being about changing yourself for a person , but that person ends up not liking the changed version of you , even though you did it for them . <p> The next song , " Coming Down " , follows the theme of unhealthy relationships as well as the escapism with a partner that was explored in " Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from herself or others around her , Halsey is n't clear , but " Coming Down " is another song that hits hard . It appears to show insight to escapism through drugs , as well as being away from the real world when it mentions a hotel . There are more mentions of religion , of God , of the devil and demons , linking us back to " Hold Me Down " . <p> Halsey repeatedly describes how she found God , the Devil , a saviour , a martyr , " in a lover " which would be assumed to be this boy , but at the chorus she also sings , " I 've got a lover , a love like religion . " The repeated mention of religious references shows a further struggle with purity or acceptance . <p> This song also features two further sexual references too , which are quite the contract when mentioned with religion , one being more daring than the other . The chorus proclaims , " ... demons play , they run around beneath our feet / We roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyric , " With his educated eyes / And his head between my thighs . " The brave mention of oral sex being performed on her in a song sung by a young woman , is the kind of change I find amazing to see . Nobody would bat an eye if it were a man , but Halsey has shocked people with her sexual innuendo and stage presence . It 's something that a woman should be able to express , uncensored , and it 's a welcome adaption to the industry . <p> " Haunting " and " Control " are the two songs that follow , and to me , " Haunting " is a weaker song on the album , but that 's just my personal tastes . It describes being in a new relationship but being haunted by a past one , possibly that of the boy sung of in the few songs prior , showing the album taking place in a timeline . <p> However , " Control " jumps into a whole new realm of thought . Something that possibly tackles her process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a song so many listeners could relate to , claiming , " My mind 's like a deadly disease , " which fellow sufferers would certainly agree with in their own pain and demons . <p> She sings , " I 'm bigger than my body / I 'm colder than this home / I 'm meaner than my demons / I 'm bigger than these bones . " Beating the depression by being ' meaner ' could be viewed as positive or negative , but in this case , it appears to be negative . The next few lines say , " And all the kids cried out , ' Please stop , you 're scaring me. ' / I ca n't stop this awful energy . / Goddamn right , you should be scared of me. / Who is in control ? " <p> It sounds as if she sees herself as a monstrous entity , further fueled by the lyrics , " I could n't stand the person inside me / I turned all the mirrors around . " Despite feeling like a monster , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in control , and she is a strong woman capable of dangerous things . She feels she should have the control , but does she actually feel like she has gained it ? <p> " Control " is a heavy-topic song , but fortunately is followed by the much lighter yet fiery " Young God " . Halsey once amusingly tweeted , " There 's a song on my album called " Young God " and I hope every single one of u loses your virginity to it . " <p> As one might expect , the song describes an exciting relationship and the invicibility of being young and in love ... and of course , Halsey 's increasingly iconic sex mentions . The mention in this song is possibly the most unsparing and head-strong of all , outright stating , " There 's a light in the crack that 's separating your thighs / And if you wan na go to Heaven , you should fuck me tonight . " <p> The song is upbeat and holds power to its words , and was the first Halsey song I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could be the perfect ' our song ' kind of tune for some young couple out there facing the world together . <p> The final track of the album is " Ghost " , the song that was Halsey 's original claim to fame , and my personal favourite of the entirety of Badlands . It describes her attraction to those who might not be faithful , honest , or good people , but the excitement of that ' bad boy ' image is too much to resist . The song appears to switch its genre , with the start almost reminiscent of a killer Nicki Minaj rap verse , with softer and slightly edgier vocals , before blending into what listeners grew used to hearing through the rest of the more upbeat side of Badlands , then becoming gentle and sadder at the chorus . <p> In the chorus , Halsey sings , " My ghost , where 'd you go ? / I ca n't find you in the body sleeping next to me / My ghost , where 'd you go ? / What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The song , when looked at it in its entirety , deals with the pressure of trying to find yourself and who you are , losing touch with reality , and knowing that you 're not going to find it in somebody else , but trying anyway . <p> Badlands as a whole is that struggle of self and self-doubt when everyone around is watching and expecting more , but there is no more to give . The Badlands are not a real location , but that 's not to say their concept is n't one of the most important ideas expressed through music this year . And this is not even the deluxe album , which has a variant of other songs to explore Halsey 's escapism in yet more depth . The fact that a girl so young has shown such a mature understanding of the world and her own honest view of the struggles in mental health is both astounding and wonderful , and perhaps just what we have needed to hear for so long . <p> Halsey is fresh , talented , and right at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything someone young and lost needs to help find themselves the way Halsey is , Badlands is it . 
@@23757263 @3757263/ <h> How to Get More Readers <h> Step One <p> Advertise your work . Pimp out your story to your friends , in journals , or use forum threads like this one .

If you have a blog or a tumblr , you can easily post excerpts or summaries to gather more readers and fans . And if you 're brave enough , you can always share your work to your friends on facebook and other social networking sites . <h> Step Two <p> Use comment swaps . Some people dislike comment swaps , but even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are the easiest and quickest way to make your story more popular . Use forum threads like this one to comment swap your chaptered story . Use this thread for your one-shots , and this one for your drabbles . If you want a more detailed review on your story and are willing to give one in return , then this thread is the right one for you . Journals are also a great way to comment swap . <h> Step Three <p> Use pretty and easily readable layouts . Not only does this attract readers to your story , it gives your work a much more original and professional feel , something readers flock to like insects to light .

And you can always ask any questions you may have about making your layouts here ! Also , if you see someone who has story layouts you admire , ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to help you out . <h> Step Four <p> Make steady updates . This only applies to chaptered stories , but I think it is extremely important . Soooo many people have a lot of difficulty updating their story often or even on a somewhat steady basis . If you work hard to master this challenge , readers will find your story , and continue to follow it . If you abandon your readers , they will also abandon you . The easiest thing for a reader to do is stop reading . I think posting a new chapter once every week is a good start , but do n't update too often ! If you update every day for a few days , chances are that your readers might get annoyed and feel like they ca n't keep up . It will also wear you out much faster and give you an excuse to go without updating for a long time afterwords . Do n't update in random crazy spurts , be steady ! <h> Step Five <p> Listen to your comments , listen to your readers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your writing , then allow yourself to beam ! Be happy , and make sure to thank them if you want to go the extra mile . The same thing goes for a more negative comment .

Listen to them with an open heart and try as hard as you can to fix your mistakes . Thank them , too ! They have been thoughtful enough to take the time out of their day and try to help you with your story . These kind of comments prove that yes , they have read it , and that they 're trying to help you , even if they may say some things you 'd rather not hear .

Make your plot twist and turn until your readers get lost and ca n't seem to find their way out of the story even if they try . Making your story orginal and unique is really not as difficult as it seems . Take another idea and add a twist to it , perhaps . Or think of something new altogether ! <h> Step Seven <p> Research . For heaven 's sake , research ! Write what you know . If you are n't sure about something , look it up until you 're more than confident writing about it . If any information is incorrect in your story , and your readers manage to notice it , then ... you 're doomed . Do your research before you write . Look up anything and everything , and make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bearings . If you are n't sure whether someone from so-and-so town would use a certain phrase in their dialect , look it up ! Do n't guess , do n't improvise , especially if it 's something bigger than a simple phrase . Make sure you know details about what you 're writing , so that you can connect with your work . <h> Step Eight <p> Write what other people love and what you love . This does n't necessarily mean you should write about " popular " themes and topics , as those can be easily classified as cliche . Pay attention to what kind of stories your favorite authors are writing . What exactly do you like about them ? Reflect off these details , and make sure to listen to what people have to say , especially readers . Talk to people outside of the internet .

It 's your story 's outer shell , it 's what your readers will read first . It 's what will make up their first impressions of your story and whether or not they want to continue . Have a hook so powerful that it snags them by their throats ! Ahh , of course not literally , but you probably understand what I mean . If not any other chapter , the first one should make your readers interested . Do n't type something up and then automatically post it .

However , they have come to find out that America 's icon of freedom might actually be loaded with secret symbols put there by a secret society looking to take over the world .

Brad and his team investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . When consulting a numerologist , he shows the team why he believes the statue is really a monument to the all-powerful number 7 .

Christine took a look at the measurements to see if she was " hiding a larger idea . " Upon looking at her measurements such as the height , 151 and 1 inch , the pedestal , 305 and 1 inch , the index finger , 8 feet and 1 inch Buddy comes to question why they added a single inch to all her measurements .

The pose is known as a sign of the Free Masons and after looking up all of the creators the team concludes they were all members of the secret society . <p> In Meltzer 's words , " The Free Masons are the worlds oldest and largest brotherhood . They 're steeped in covert rituals and symbolism ... There are about 6 million Free Masons in the world today . Everyone from our founding fathers , including George Washington and Benjamin Franklin and presidents like FDR and Gerald Ford were members .

That sort of exists within free masonry , kind of a secret within a secret society called the Illuminati , " says Greenfield . <p> Meltzer says that " the Illuminati was formed in Bavaria in 1776 .

Christine and Buddy meet up Josh Siegel , a numerologist , to discuss the numbers they uncovered . Christine brings up the numbers they found , 13 , 1 and 7 . Siegel goes on to say they need a number that repeats itself and that would be the number 7 . In his own words he says " As a matter of fact , you could call the statue a shrine to the number 7 .

Without that extra inch the number is not divisible by seven and it does not break down into seven . <p> Siegel says , " If you know about number symbolism you know that the number 7 is one of the most sacred , divine numbers .

Their members are the power elite . Both President Bush and Senator John Kerry are members , which also makes them the most over played bad guys . Theyre blamed for everything from the invention of the nuclear bomb to the Kennedy assassination . " <p> When asked if the team was supposed to take his word Dice tells them to look around and theyll see Illuminati signs such as the rising sun , the pyramid and the eye and a pyramid with illumination behind it .

After their visit with Dr. Monteith they head over to Rockefeller center .

According to what Dice was saying earlier , that was purposefully done . <p> Meltzer states , " If you believe that Prometheus holding the flame is an Illuminati symbol and Atlas with the world on his shoulders represents one world order and that this was intentionally placed across the street from a catholic church .

@@23757274 @3757274/ <h> A Fine Line : Tips for Writing Self-Insertion <p> In the world of online fiction , much like fanfiction , self-insertion has a tendency to get a bad reputation . At first glance , a good majority of self-insertion stories can come across as simply a rabid fan-girl writing out her fantasies , and there are indeed a good chunk of self-insertion stories that fall into that category , but there is more to this type of fiction than meets the eye . Writing self-insertion can serve as a means of self-discovery , as long as it is done properly . <p> This tutorial outlines some ways to keep your self-insert from turning into the stereotypical Mary-Sue . <h> Staying True to Reality <p> Though it may be tempting to give yourself the looks or the body that youve always wanted ( after all , it is your story ) , that would not be true self-insertion . One of the main aspects in self-insertion is staying true to who you are , flaws and all . Once you begin to tweak things , the character becomes less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish you were , which is one of the things that gives self-insertion such a bad name and pulls you into Mary-Sue territory . <p> No one wants to read about a perfect character , regardless of whether they 're a self-insert or an original character . Its incredibly boring to read about a character who always does the right thing , always gets what they want , and is the absolute epitome of morality . Some of the things that flesh a character out and make them feel real to the reader are their quirks and imperfections . Being able to accept and embrace your own flaws can help aid in both character development of your self-insert and conflict and plot development of the story itself . For example , I 'm aware of the fact that I 'm ridiculously impatient and have serious commitment issues , and those character flaws often come into play in my own self-insertion stories . <p> No one is perfect , and as humans , our complexities are what make us individuals . As a self-insertion character , complexities will help readers be able to relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved and invested in the actual plot of the story . <h> Staying True to the Character <p> Once you 've established yourself as a character and have developed that character in your story , stick to the characterization that you 've established . If your self-insert is quiet and shy , its unlikely that they 're going to audition for the schools talent show , pull off a great performance , and knock everyones socks off . This may work in Disney Channel films and shows , but it is n't very realistic . <p> Also , once you 've established them , stick to your characters means . If your character is a starving freelance photographer living in a shoddy apartment and eating only Ramen noodles , its unlikely that they 're going to be able to afford countless Coach purses and other designer digs . Glamorizing your self-insert acts as another red flag that allows readers minds to skip directly to the Mary-Sue label . <p> Just like in other forms of fiction , its important to stick to the characterization you 've developed in self-insertion . <h> Remember to Treat Your Self-Insert as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting your self-insert on a pedestal is the easiest way to cross the line into turning your self-insert into a Mary-Sue . Even if your self-insert is the main character , the entire universe shouldnt revolve around them . Keep in mind any minor characters that you 've decided to include and any conflict that you 've planned out for the story . <p> Just like in life , nothing worth having comes easily , the same holds true for self-insertion . Having everything go your characters way is also another thing that will cause your self-insert to be labeled as a Mary-Sue . You must treat your self-insert the same way that you would treat any other character by having them face obstacles and deal with their own shortcomings . <p> In short , developing a self-insert is not much different from developing any other original or fandom character . You just have to avoid giving your self-insert any special treatment , flesh them out , and treat them the same as any other character .

The album is a cross between deep-rooted pain and undying love . Songs like " Blue Jeans " reference to this love , how it is restricting and incapable of being let go . The album was released in January of 2012 and has since become quite popular , with allusions to her songs in recent music ( #Selfie : " Why does the DJ keep on playing Summertime Sadness ? " ) . Born to Die topped the charts in eleven countries , and was announced third best album of the year in 2012. <h> 1 . " Born to Die " ( 10/10 ) <p> The opening track , and also the name of the album , " Born to Die " essentially sets the tone for the album as well as pulls the listener in and prepares them for a tender journey through heartache and love . Lana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost masculine , voice , adding to the dreamy haze the song has . <h> 2 . " Off to the Races " ( 10/10 ) <p> The second track picks the pace up , and is one of the more unique songs on the album . The lyrics are tasteful in its description of codependency . The hints of crud language hardly even sound crud in Lana Del Rey 's distinctively harmonic voice . It is rap-like at times , but the gentle delivery of each line resonates with the listener on a deeper , less superficial , note . <h> 3 . " Blue Jeans " ( 10/10 ) <p> " Blue Jeans " is the third track on Lana Del Rey 's album and a delight to listen to . It 's lyrics are relatable even though the general gist of her song may not be . She sings with her heart ; her high and low intonations add to the meledrama of the song . This song in particular has a strong contrast between her particularly high and astoundingly low voice . <h> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background music sets the tone of this song , and the slowness adds to that effect . This song is a sharp turn from the others on her album , very sweet and reminscent . Each line is filled with emotion - deep longing and sadness . This song is actually the video that went viral before the album dropped and started the frenzy of fans Lana Del Rey has accumulated . <h> 5 . " Diet Mountain Dew " ( 8.5/10 ) <p> Not a particular favorite of mine , " Diet Mountain Dew " is one of her few songs that is more fast-paced and high-pitched . The song follows the theme of love for this album , and has this unqiue combination of scratchy , pitchiness and soft deepness that works well together and brings a fresh of breath air to music . Lana Del Rey proves here in thsi song that it is not always necessary to sound perfectly auto-tuned. <h> 6 .

" ( NME Magazine ) <h> 7 . " Dark Paradise " ( 10/10 ) <p> The seventh song of this album brings back the listener back to idea of this undying love , this yearning for someone that ca n't be satiated .

" Radio " ( 9.5/10 ) <p> This is the one song on the album that appears not to be about love , and rather about fame .

" Carmen " ( 8.5/10 ) <p> " Carmen " is song holds a very strong meaning , telling the story of a young girl with a substance abuse problem . Lana Del Rey has a way with her lyrics that paint the picture of this young girl 's story ; her words are richly suggestive without giving away everything . It is a somber , soft song that strikes against the rest of the tracks on this album . <h> 10 . " Million Dollar Man " ( 8/10 ) <p> Lana Del Rey reverts back to a love affair gone wrong in this song , droning about the how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down . " This song does n't just depict her lover as being this spectacular being but also as " screwed up . " It is easily relatable for anyone that has had the wrong man , but loved him anyway . <h> 11 . " Summertime Sadness " ( 10/10 ) <p> " Summertime Sadness " has easily become the most popular song on this album . It has been remixed countless times , and referenced everywhere in pop culture . It is the perfect mix of pop and indie . The lyrics are strong , yet dainty in their delivery . Lana 's sadcore tone gives the pop music depth . Charting across Europe , the single reached the top ten in Austria , Bulgaria , Germany , Greece , Luxembourg , and Switzerland . <h> 12 . " This Is What Makes Us Girls " ( 8/10 ) <p> Lana Del Rey turns back to upbeat sounds as she describes what " makes us girls . " The song is twisted in its lyrics , mistakeningly making you think that it 's cliches about girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " rambunctious , Lolita-esque teenhood interrupted " ( TheAtlantic , Spencer Kornhaber ) . <p> For a second album , it is quite the winner with most of the songs being more likely to love than hate . It appears that with Lana Del Reys soft deepness , and softer highness , anything she sings is going to give off this whimsiness that is refreshing against mainstream music . The critic Ellen Willis once wrote of Bette Midler : " Blatant artifice can , in the right circumstances , be poignantly honest , and she expresses the tension between image and inner self that all of us-- but especially women-- experience . " Lana Del Rey tells stories through her songs that are understandable , relatable , and hit hard with anyone that has loved and lost . 
@@23757276 @3757276/ <h> How to Write an Article <p> Writing an article is an art , just like writing a story is . It may not seem as exciting or creative , but ultimately it is ; just in a different direction . And unlike stories , articles are also able to express opinion . <p> Whether you 're writing an article , tutorial , or news , there are seven basic things you should make sure you do with your article or that your article includes . <p> 1 . Proofread and spellcheck : Please . I 'd like to actually be able to read and understand your article ; it 's kind of a necessity . Plus , people will call you out on it relentlessly . There 's an Editing and Proofreading thread if you feel your article needs a bit more fine-tuning . Also , Mibba articles utilize block format ; that basically means you leave each new paragraph un-indented . <p> 2 . Do n't lie with your lead : If you say you 're going to show both sides of an issue in your lead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit irritating . Represent the article you 're actually posting , because the lead is meant to draw people into that article . And try to make it catchy and/or interesting ; if you ca n't come up with a short summary or lead-in to your article , it 's fine to quote your own article . <p> 3 . You 're allowed to express your opinion : You 're also allowed to be biased ; it 's your article and your ideas . And opinion articles are most definitely allowed on Mibba , last I checked . However , other people have the same rights , so do n't get too upset if someone attacks your idea . That being said ; if you disagree with an article , then comment saying that ... not a personal attack on the author . Make sure to explain why you disagree , rationally and logically . And try to keep things on the article comments page , not personal profile comments and such . <p> 4 . Back up your points ! Like I said in number three , opinion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally pointless without supporting facts . Do n't just tell me that veganism is good ; tell me why it 's good . That 's one of the things that separate journal from an article ; a journal can be an illogical rant , but articles need logic and fact . As well , not everyone is going to like your opinion ; that 's a given . So instead of trying to please everyone with your article , you should focus on making your article as airtight as possible . Try to make sure your idea is expressed clearly and that people who disagree can only attack the idea , not your article . <p> 5 . Make sure your article goes somewhere : Just like a story , it needs a beginning , middle and end that all tie together . Your article should n't be a set of random paragraphs about how animals deserve love too , meat tastes icky , and global warming is real ... that then ends with ' Which is why you should become a vegan . ' Your main point should definitely show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't try to write about too broad a topic , because this is just one article . If you do want to attack a broad topic , try writing a series of articles about different , smaller , more manageable facets instead . Ex : One article about animals deserving love , being intelligent creatures , and inhumane slaughter techniques , a second article about the non health benefits of meat , and a third article about the reality of global warming and how becoming vegan helps save the planet . <p> 6 . Sources : This is a bit of a minefield , because sources are n't technically required and articles wont be denied solely because they do n't  have them . However , with that said ... if you claim something is fact and it 's not commonly known ( i.e. a statistic ) , then it 's nice to know where you got it from . The more credible the source , the more credible the article appears . Also , when quoting from a book or when quoting a person , in text citations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your words , and you are n't plagiarizing . <p> 7 . Images : Try to keep them relevant to the article . I understand , that sometimes it 's hard to find a picture that relates back to your idea , but there 's always something . And hey , that 's what the image description thing is for : a place to explain how a picture of the Sun and an article about veganism go together . Make sure your images end in . jpg , . png , or another picture ending ; you do n't want the site address where the picture is , you want the picture itself . Oh , and as the notice says every time you submit an article ... do the admins a favor and make sure your images are a good size for your article and they fit within the given parameters . The recommended width limit is between 150 and 250 pixels and images must be at least 70x90 pixels . <p> If you 've already posted an article and it does n't seem to have been approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That and the Article Help and Brainstorming thread are great places to go if you have questions as well !

@@23757279 @3757279/ <h> Featured : Writing Nonlinear Stories <p> Sometimes , we want our stories to start with a bang ! But the bang of a story is rarely the first thing to happen . There are backstories and past events that guide our characters to climatic events . By utilizing a nonlinear writing style , we throw away the constraints of time and write our stories in a way that keeps readers guessing . <p> Writing with a nonlinear perspective can be difficult . When you do not write chronologically , you run the risk of confusing your readers and losing them somewhere along the timeline . By incorporating the following pointers into your nonlinear writing , you can avoid the pitfalls of throwing chronology to the wind . <h> Cues <p> When switching between the past , present and future , you usually must let your reader know , somehow , that the transition has occurred , and this can be accomplished in many ways . <h> Structural Cues <p> The easiest and most straightforward way to let your reader know of a time change is to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to italicize an analepsis ( flashback ) or prolepsis ( flashforward ) , or use page dividers to signal changes in time . Headings can also be used when the specific time is important ( i.e. , One Hour ago or 3 Months Prior ) . <p> This method has the benefit of eliminating the chance for confusion , because the reader can bluntly see a separation of time . However , this method does not provide subtlety that may be needed in some stories . <h> Object Cues <p> You can use objects , literally and figuratively , to signify changes in time . A well-known example of a literal object is the Pensieve in the Harry Potter series . A pensieve is an object that stores memories . Consequently , readers know when the pensieve is used , the events being told of happened in the past . Like structural cues , literal object cues are very direct and prevent reader confusion . <p> Objects can also be used figuratively to signal a time change . Before starting a flashback or flash-forward , have your protagonist observe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character could look at a photograph of his mother , flashback to a childhood memory , and re-enter the current time by once again interacting with the photograph . In this instance , the photograph is the object cue that let 's the reader know what time period were in . " Object " cues may not be objects at all , but also sensations such as sounds , smells and emotions . <p> Figurative object cues have the advantage of smooth , narrative transitions . The change in time is written out , rather than being structurally observed , and allows your story to flow freely in and out of time . <h> Continuity <p> When a story has no time continuity , other types of continuity become important to hold the story together . When transitioning between time periods , something needs to remain the same to allow readers to accept and understand the transitions . Examples of continual devices include : <p> The Character : This is the most common thing to carry from scene to scene . Though the character may experience different attitudes , emotions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers a path to follow . <p> The Setting : The setting is often very different across time , but when a story has one setting , a non-linear narrative can spice up the story line . An example may be starting a story with a house burning down in a tremendous fire , and in the next scene , the house is still standing and perfect . Readers know the setting is the same , but something dramatic occurred in the time gap . <p> The Theme : Though rare , some stories have no common time , no common character , and no common world . They seemingly take place in separate universes , yet can be united by one thing : theme . In Gon+alo M. Tavares short story " Six Tales , " six brief narratives are presented , each with different characters , times , settings and narrative worlds , yet the story is united on the theme of extremism and meaninglessness . <h> Timing <p> Though nonlinear narratives abandon chronology , time is still of the essence . When writing a nonlinear story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would play out if it were linear . <p> Though an author may write in a nonlinear style , readers still comprehend stories linearly . As they read out-of-order scenes , they naturally rearrange them in their minds to fill in the blanks . The fun of reading a non-linear story is this re-piecing process , so as an author you must ensure the linear story ties up neatly . By having both a linear and nonlinear concept in your head , you can plan ahead for transitions and cues . You can also ensure that you 're arranging the events in an order that will benefit from a nonlinear structure . Ask yourself questions like : <p> Which event would create the most suspense to start with ? <p> Which scene contains the catharsis , or climax of the story ? <p> Will this scene reveal too much at the beginning ? Will it be confusing ?

It would be a good idea to lean back and ask yourself if what your character is doing makes sense for the given situation . While this is already a challenge even with a short story , it becomes a more difficult and more important task with an epic . Your readers are going to follow the character just as much as you are , and many of them will probably sit back and ask themselves why your rebellious character chose to actually follow the rules for a change when he has n't for the majority of the story . <p> Characters in general become more important in an epic because , most of the time , you end up with more of them .

Your main characters have their main conflict , of course , but they will also have several smaller ones , as will your supporting characters . Keep track of all of these and , like I mentioned above , write them all down so you at least do not forget to cover one . Your main characters might stop a nuclear meltdown , but if you left a supporting character in the middle of the SATs he 's been worrying about for the majority of the novel , the readers are going to notice . <p> Also important is the avoidance of fluff .

Epics are long and often difficult for some writers to compose , so make sure you do not have eyestrain after a long session at the computer or a wrist sprain from a long session of handwriting .

@@23757285 @3757285/ <h> How to Draw a Picture <p> The world is filled with many forms of art ranging from sculptures , to drawings , and to carvings . Drawings are important , for they can reflect an era in the history of time , feelings in a critical point of life , and so much more ! Drawing ; although it is not a very easy matter and even though it does n't  require much skill there are still keys , or even rules to follow with drawing . These rules include getting materials that you need , deciding on what to draw , deciding the perspective to draw from , creating an optional rough draft , drawing the picture , and finally sharing . <p> The first step to drawing is getting the needed materials . When you draw there must be a surface , or canvas you will draw on . A very popular material to draw on is a simple , blank sheet of printer paper or a poster board . Writing utensils , such as markers , pens , pencils , and paint are used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out should also be put to the side with your utensils just in case you make a mistake . These are the basic materials needed to draw a picture , yet if you feel the need for more than it is up to you to add more items to your list of materials . <p> After getting your materials you should start deciding on what to draw . Giving your drawings a meaning can make it easier to decide on what to draw . Brainstorming ideas is another great way of determining on what to draw because it can help you think of concepts and thoughts that have great influence and importance to you . Drawing a picture that fights for a cause , protests against an unfavorable idea , or even call for attention to a particular disease can turn out to be a great picture ! Not only does it hold significance to you , but it can also hold significance to someone else . <p> Once you 've gathered your materials , and decided what to draw you can finally reach the next step of making a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can draw in first person perspective , where you create an image that the viewer can directly see . Second perspective drawing is a technique where the scenery disappears into two different points on the drawings , called vanishing points . This perspective is commonly used among artists . The final perspective , third perspective , is where the scenery vanishes into three different vanishing points on the canvas . These are the different perspectives you can draw in , but choose wisely of the perspective , for if you share your artwork with someone else they can easily misinterpret it . <p> There is an optional step in drawing , in which is called a rough draft . A rough draft can be to draw on your canvas lightly , creating guidelines before you actually start creating the real lines of your drawing , or it can be to draw freely on other sheets of paper until you get the right image you 've wanted to show . This step is optional because in drawing it is n't required for you to practice or to use guidelines . For beginner drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the drawing does n't  come out as you wanted than you can simply erase your light marking and start over . <p> Following the optional step , or skipping it , is to draw .

Take your time when drawing , for art is n't something that can typically be rushed . Put your full effort into drawing the picture since it holds value to you . <p> The final stage in the process is sharing your art work or preserving it . In this stage you can show off your work to friends or family - even enter it into contest and an art museum . On the other hand , if you 'd rather keep it to yourself you can hang it on a wall and even frame it .

I du n no , they live in the grass and they 're invisible to the human eye . Ben in this show is an elf , and Holly is a fairy , except she 's not just any fairy , she 's the Fairy Princess of the Little Kingdom . <p> Now , as I was saying , this is a kids show . As an adult having had to watch the show because my niece - who is six years old at time of writing - loved that show , I have seen some God-awful subtext that the child viewers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Continued One-Upmanship <p> This is pretty much a bad move that keeps happening in every episode . There 's always some dispute over who is the better race ; elves or fairies . The elves demonstrate why they 're better in any given situation , and the fairies demonstrate why they 're better in that situation . How about quit the quarrelling and team up to use each others strengths to your collective advantage ? It would be like , for example , two soldiers , ones a sniper , the others a close-range fighter , constantly trying to prove to the other why they 're better than them when what they should be doing is teaming up and the close-range guy does some hand combat to make the enemy an easy target for the sniper . Yes , fairies can fly and do magic . Yes , elves can run and lift heavy weights . Neither race is better than the other . The whole is greater than the sum of its parts . The End . <h> ( Implied ) Slavery <p> Fairies treat elves like second-class citizens , really - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other fairies are a bit less snobby about it , as far as I 've seen . The Royal Fairy Family do nothing but order the elves around , like " we want this , this and this by this date . No arguments " . The elves are more considerate of nature so if Nanny Plum is out of flour and orders more , that one huge bag of flour takes a week to make . That 's not good enough for Nanny Plum so what does she do ? She belittles the elves way of working and uses magic to speed up the process , which , by the way , goes horribly awry . Point is , these poor elves work night and day for those damn fairies and its not like they get paid , even in gratitude . Besides , where the hell are the Royal Elves ? Slave labour , I 'm telling you . <h> Disrespecting Others Traditions and Forced Integration <p> These ere fairies think they can get way with anything , from the aforementioned rushing of the production of flour to cheating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elf event , the Elf Games , like the Olympics , but for elves , and only elves . No fairies were allowed to participate , but that just went in one ear and out of the other for Nanny Plum . Princess Holly was actually the more mature and considerate one in this situation , she was protesting when Nanny Plum insisted that they " give Ben a helping hand " in winning the Elf Games , not knowing or caring that the use of magic would get him disqualified . And guess what , that Nanny Plum did get Ben disqualified by helping him using her magic . In the final event though , Ben does n't  have a partner for the wheelbarrow race , so Holly volunteers herself to help him win , without magic , and they do indeed win . And because she 's Princess Holly Thistle , she got to ask - no , insist - the Wise Old Elf to add some extra sports for fairies to take part in and be good at , and thus the Elf Games became the Elf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elves cant have a single celebration to themselves , can they ? <h> Discrimination ( Ties In With One-Upmanship ) <p> They basically go hand-in-hand because by proving their own race superior , they have to belittle the other race , kinda like a fairy saying " haha , I can fly and do magic , you cant , I 'm therefore better than you , " or an elf saying " haha , I can run faster than you , I 'm therefore better than you " . Neither race gets away with this , it happens both ways . There 's not much more I can say about this , to be honest , except I remember seeing an episode in which Ben and Holly play hide and seek , while Holly was the seeker , Ben actually ran and hid somewhere , which made him pretty easy for Holly to find , and he explicitly said no flying and no magic . When it was Hollys turn to hide , she did n't  actually hide per se ; she made herself invisible , therefore blatantly ignoring Bens rules because she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , this upsets Ben when he figures out that Holly cheated and used magic when she was n't supposed to , but because she 's his best friend , he forgives her and they try it again , and this time Holly agrees not to fly or use magic . Point is , Holly thought herself superior to Bens rules because she 's a fairy , and he s an elf which is an obvious reminder of the heirarchy that goes on in the Little Kingdom . Also , Nanny Plum is the worst culprit with her arrogance , because she has an admirer in Captain Redbeard , an elf pirate who happens to be Bens uncle , I think . He fancies Nanny Plum and greets her romantically but she 's just like " ugh " . Yes , she was flattered at first but that quickly got old and now his flirting just creeps her out . Possibly because he s an elf and there 's some unwritten law forbidding elf-fairy romances ? Who knows . <h> The Education System <p> I 'd like to stress the severe segregation that still goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairies are so eager to crash an elfs party at any given opportunity . The only time the elf kids and the fairy kids see each other is outside of school hours , because there is no integrated education in the Little Kingdom . Elf school teaches manual labour , while Fairy school teaches magic and nature . Elf schooling is taught by the Wise Old Elf , who is way past his retirement by now with a beard as long as Dumbledores . Fairy schooling is taught by none other than Nanny Plum , the Master of Messing Up . The fairy children have to learn to control their magic , and do spells correctly , which is something even Nanny Plum evidently still does n't  know how to do yet , though she makes out that she knows all there is to know about using magic properly . In every single episode , you will see an example of a fairy kid trying to do a spell and messing it up , like that one time when Holly turned Ben into a frog , and tried to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a frog too . So she tries to do multiple variations of the same spell to get him back in human - sorry , elf - form , and even the Wise Old Elf has to come in and lend a hand to turn Nanny Plum back into the fairy she is . <p> And even then , there are many examples of Nanny Plum trying to show off with her magic and it goes terribly awry - one of which I already mentioned , with the flour - and then there 's that bastard magic picnic basket . Youd think that these stupid fairies would learn to not ask for " more , more , more " jelly , but they do it , every time , and it results in a jelly flood , every time , so Nanny Plum has to use the Emergency Spell which cleans the jelly up , but then the fairies are magicless for the next 24 hours . Surely there 's a less drastic spell to clean up the jelly flood ? <p> And despite all this , Ben Elf and Princess Holly Thistle are best friends .

@@23757289 @3757289/ <h> What Caused the Civil War ? <p> On the 22 of August 1642 a civil war broke out in England . The war was Parliament against the King and the king ruling at the time was King Charles I. Though there were many small reasons why the civil war eventually broke out the main three reasons were religion , a highly regarded thing in the 1640 's when England had just become Protestant and was reforming itself , power was the other thing , everyone wanted power and the last large cause was money . Charles was always in need of money , but it seems so was everyone else . In this essay I 'm going to show you more about these three reasons and last of all the smaller triggers just before the outbreak of the war . The civil war may have started as something that both the King and Parliament thought they could control and win and by doing that bring the other down , but they both soon learnt that what they had created was something beyond their control because when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It may then become clearer to you who were more to blame for the outbreak of the civil war in England , Charles or parliament . <p> In this paragraph I 'm going to explain the role money had in causing the civil war . I think that money was one of the earliest complaints and disagreements between Charles and Parliament . From the beginning Charles liked to spend a lot of money and he ran very expensive household . As if this was not enough he also spent a lot on his favourites , he was also constantly giving expensive gifts to people . This cause Charles to slowly go into debt and it did not help that the previous King , James , had also been in debt . When his situation got too bad in 1625 Charles was forced to ask Parliament to give him some more money . When Parliament voted against giving Charles the money Charles became infuriated . So Charles collected the money anyway and sent Parliament home . Charles was happy , but he continued spending and soon all the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made everyone pay the ship tax . Before that the only people legible for the ship tax had been the people who lived by the coast . The ship tax was a tax that went to pay for the navy . This tax was the only one Charles could bring in without consulting parliament , but in doing so he made himself more unpopular with the people and Parliament . Later in 1640prlaiment demanded that Charles raised no more taxes without their permission , although Charles did not agree to this he did compromise by making Ship Money illegal . Money was very much more of a problem for Charles as he was constantly running out . The reason money became an area of conflict was that Charles wanted to take the hard earned money of the people of England away through taxes . Many people thought this was unfair and I find it a bit unfair too because the people had to work very hard for the money just to have it taken away by a man who could easily do without some of the things he has . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an issue for the people and Parliament who were the people being taxed . <p> Then there was the issue of religion . In this area Charles made a mistake very early on in his reign by marring a catholic . This was n't the best move since England had just changed and reformed to have their own church , the Church of England which was protestant . When Charles married a Catholic many people began to question his faith and did he really believe in the Church of England . If he did n't this would be a big problem as he was the head of the church , or as they called him , protector of faith . The ordinary people that objected the most to the marriage were a group of Protestants called the Puritans . These were in short the extreme Protestants . They looked down on all forms of fun and leisure . Parliament also had a problem with the Catholic queen because most of them were strictly protestant . After this religion became a problem and source of conflict between the Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous effort to make the church more Catholic . One man helped him a lot and that was the Archbishop of Canterbury , Laud . With him Charles began the change the church ever so slightly so that it was slightly more Catholic , Parliament on the other hand were trying to make the church even more Protestant . In 1640 when Parliament made a list of demands one of them was that all the changes made to the church be reversed . The king again did not agree out right , but he did compromise by putting Laud in prison . The Scottish people had their own church and it was even more protestant then the English puritans . So when Charles tried to force them to use the English prayer book they were not happy especially after being neglected that long . When the Scots did n't use the prayer book Charles began to try and find ways to forced them too . This upset many Scots and they got together and created the Solemn league and covenant ' this was then signed by over 1,000s people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise an army and then so did Charles . So you see religion played a key role because it is really one of the only reasons that the Scots got involved . The Scots were trying to stop the king from making more changes to their church . <p> Then there was power . Parliament wanted more power because they believed that Charles was n't running the country well and was n't listening to the sensible advisors . They were also often neglected and did n't get much say as Charles often sent them home or just did n't listen . Charles on the other hand did n't want parliament to have that power , but he did n't see that parliament was n't given any power so it made them thirsty for it and they thought that the only way they could get that power was by war . Charles took away parliament 's power bit by bit when he sent them home each time and did n't call them back for meetings . At the beginning of his reign you could have said that Charles had a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slip away a long with his reputation with the people . Instead all that power went to parliament . Before the civil war more people sided with parliament then the king as they thought that parliament would do the better things and help them . So in a way Charles lost a lot of power when he lost his people . He lost the ability to control his country and the people in it . Just before the civil war Charles had lost all trust any of his subjects had in him , the only people who still stood by him were those who would benefit from Charles still being in reign . For the reason that Charles lost the vote and trust of his people is one of the reasons why he lost the civil war . When he lost his people he lost many of his soldiers . Charles had trouble trying to gather up sufficient army and when he did many left again . But before the civil war he did manage to gather a reasonable army , but the parliament just took control of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war because that was what the parliament was fighting for . They were fighting for more power and say . <p> Then there were the small triggers before the war actually broke out . Both sides made some . One of the mistakes made by the king was when he arrested 3 MPs . This did not go well with the rest of the Parliament . The king made several fatal mistakes , but in the years leading up to the civil war he was prepared to compromise to the parliaments wants . This is the time where parliament did n't want to cooperate . Charles wanted more money , but parliament would n't give it to him . Then when parliament made demands Charles did n't actually agree straight out to them all but instead he made fairly good compromises . Then parliament became really angry and took control of the army that Charles had been gathering up for a little while . This meant that Charles lost all of his men apart from the few private soldiers that were on his side , but there were n't enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for him . <p> In conclusion I do n't think you can pin the blame of something as big as a war on one person . I think that there are many people to blame and rather than people I think the problem was the lack of communication on both sides meaning that neither knew quite what the other wanted . I think that both sides made mistakes , but I would have to say that Charles made the most . Although this may because he did n't listen to others and did what he wanted , he was also ever so slightly big headed which may have caused him to do some things without thinking through the consequences they would have . But then parliament made some rash and silly mistakes . They were very stubborn and would n't settle for less then they asked for . This was one of the reasons that the compromises that Charles tried to make failed and fell through . So I think that there are many people to blame for the civil war in England .

According to studies conducted by NASA 2005 was the warmest year in recorded history , worldwide . It tied with 1998 . In fact the past nine years are all among the top twenty five warmest in known history . <p> This warming is caused by the massive CO2 emissions in the air around us. this comes from our cars , homes , industrial and commercial facilities and more . Between the year 1800 and the year 2000 carbon dioxide level in the air went up 31% . From 280 parts per million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking thing is by the year 2100 the number is expected to be 970 parts per million . <p> Then once face with the statistics people sometimes say , ' Oh well so the Earth has warmed up a bit , big deal ' .

Annually thousands of people die , directly and indirectly because of Global Warming and Climate Change . <p> One thing that factors into this that surprises most people , is hurricanes . Hurricanes and Tropical Storms are partly formed by reactions having to do with heat over large bodies of water . So as the CO2 emission warm up the air , hurricanes and tropical storms become increasingly more likely . In the last five years the amount and intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms has risen over 100% .

New Orleans , the city recently flooded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina ( the hurricane also arguably the result of climate change ) would permanently sink underwater . <p> There is even more shocking statistics though .

@@23757299 @3757299/ <h> Impression without Expression leads to Depression <p> What makes my situation all the more depressing is that being gay is socially acceptable , up to a point . It 's okay to be like this now , for anyone . But I ca n't accept this world 's approval . The world is n't really overated , underated probably fits just fine . From a Christian view , I am taught to be apart from this world and this only really adds to my predicament : I ca n't act on this . Chu Hien said that an ' Impression without Expression leads to Depression , ' which I really do agree with . Because I ca n't act on this " impression " , or rather feeling , I 'm super depressed . It 's just perfect how things always turn out for me . It 's wonderful how " being yourself " and " doing the right thing " are such essential facts of happiness , but yet are so contradictory to each other . The strangest thing is that even though I know this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it slip . Last Sunday , I was beaming coming into church : smiling like an idiot because Lindsay told me she loved me the night before and I almost let that slip to Lisa . It 's so weird how in a second you whole life could change , but I guess that is for a lot of things . One time , when Amy and I were talking about gays , she said that it just changes your whole opinion about the person . But honestly , that 's bullshit . I mean anything that someone does can change your opinion of them at any time and place . Just someone speaking to you rudely or nicely or whatever can really change how you view them . So it 's not just because of them being gay , because it 's not that huge of a deal to you , even though it is to them . Something like that should n't change a person 's opinion of anyone else and definitely not in a bad way , but I guess it 's inevitable because shit happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about someone , but you can sure control your actions . So I just hope that when and if I do admit my secret , people will understand enough to keep their negative opinions to themselves and to , most importantly , not hate me to death . I could possibly die from being hated so much , I 'm relatively sure of that . You know when you find a song that really fits your situation , like it was written for you , or rather , that the writer was going through the exact same thing no matter what the critics say that song really means ? I guess that 's the thing about music and anything really , like when you over analyze something till it fits just about any situation . If that 's the case then what does it mean when everything just fits ? It 's like one huge blob . Well , Marie Digby 's song Unfold sounds just like what I 'm going though . It talks about how she 's ' unfolding ' : showing people her imperfections . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ? I mean if your straight that 's it right ? What kind of imperfections could you show ? ' Cause I 'm confused at what those imperfections could be . So what , she was fat ? BIG DEAL ! Imagine standing in front of people about to tell them your deepest and darkest secret ( not that you 're fat ) , now THAT is scary . It 's kind of sad how my problem seems so big that nothing else is big enough to even count as an issue to me , which I 'm sure is not the case , ' cause I bet a lot of people have bigger problems . I wish I could make myself believe that as much as my mind knows it has to be true , it seems to rule out that fact ' cause this problem is too big to look past . Sometimes I do n't see the necessity of having opposite sexes , like it 'd be nice to just all be one . I mean okay so we 'd have sexual tension with everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for that . I 've been forced into thinking about my future recently and well I still do n't know what I 'm going to do , or even what I want to do . It 's a shame that what you 're going to do and what you want to do are different things all-together . If I could , I know I 'd run away . I guess it might be weird coming from a kid who has no academic problems , but it 's just that I hate society sometimes and I hate how I have to go to school my whole life , just so I can get a good job , for whatever is left of my life . Life is so much more than education and jobs and being a productive part of society ( ' cause God knows we all want to do that so bad -. - ) . I want to feel the wind on my face as I cruise down a deserted highway , I want to feel the adrenaline pump through my veins as I jump off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of New York at night , but most importantly , I want to do all this with someone : someone important . I know I 'll end up with someone amazing who will be perfect and love me just as much as I love them , but I would really much prefer it if God sped up his process . I guess I 'm still waiting for that boy . That boy that will sweep me off my feet and make me forget all about my past feelings . My whole life I 've waited for him to come and I hope he still is , because if he is n't I do n't think I have a backup plan and I just might fall into the trap . Well , Lisa definitely thinks something 's up . It 's amazing sort of , I do n't give her observation skills enough credit really . Today she was just talking about Marie Digby and I felt so close to her , just because we could relate and I sent her what Lindsay said , about how she loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I did n't feel the same and how I let Lindsay know that and stuff , but I still do n't think Lisa bought it . She was just like ' oh just do n't let yourself get tempted ' . I really do n't give her enough credit and I 'm sort of mad about this , but on the other hand I 'm really glad she noticed , I mean could I be more obvious ? I think when it comes to GAYS , Christians block it out . It 's like even if everything pointed to that reason , most Christians force it out of their minds and try to convince themselves that it 's not , like it 's not even an option because it 's too pitiful and low . But geez realistically , it 's a huge thing . I mean one out of ten people are gay and that 's a big deal , because that 's still too many . It 's just like how church never mentions gays because it 's such a touchy subject and why is that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his congregation is secretly gay and he secretly knows that it 's such a big deal that he just should n't mention it or he 'd get on peoples nerves , even though being gay ' should n't ' be a big problem to surpass . BULLSHIT . I love the quote " Love is giving someone the power to break you " . It 's kind of the negative side of love , but I love it so much . Well I was reading New Moon and it just seemed so out of place : such a nice quote in the middle of a vampire book . I 'm not so sure why that is either ; because I 'm sure vampires deserve love . Possibly as much as gays do ... It 's like saying that everyone deserves love from anyone else , if it 's true and pure ? Is it possible that pedophiles , or so we call them , truly love ? What if someone was to love a 12 year old at 30 , but if it was true is it right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . I do n't know , maybe society programmed us to think this way , maybe a 60 year difference should n't even matter if it 's love , it 's possible . If maybe one day love could just be love no matter who it came from , maybe that 's that is what creates a better world for everyone , just because we 're not so limited and not persecuted because of choice .

When in London , it is so easy to miss all the good things to do , spend too much money and then see London as somewhere which is too expensive .

Here are my top ten places I 'd recommend for people thinking of visiting London to make it enjoyable . <h> 1 . Harrods <p> Though some of you may know Harrods for its reputation of being expensive , it is still one of the best places I can recommend you go .

Besides , with a shop that is five storeys high , dedicated completely to your keen toy buyer , how could you resist ? <h> 3 . Buckingham Palace <p> The stunning building with great scenery is home of the Queen . You can look around and wander the Mall , all the while seeing a beautifully quiet and luxurious area of London . Take a walk through Green Park whilst there and you 'll be stunned by the beauty a city can hold . Walk up onto Park Lane and you 're back into the central scene of London . <h> 4 . Covent Garden <p> This is for those who fancy a venture on the . A small and fancy Victorian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun and artistic things . Convent Garden is also one of the places to go at Christmas time , with it featuring great displays and a Christmas market . <h> 5 . Notting Hill <p> Londons Beverly hills . Although most can not afford to live there , and one would see no reason to go unless you 're the type who enjoys looking at grand houses and walking clean streets , for those Americans who view the British drinking tea from China cups and living in white Georgian terraces , this is the place to view for their stereotypical Britain . <h> 6 . The Tower of London <p> We all love a bit of gore and a bit of history . The oldest surviving building in London is the notably famous Tower of London . A great piece of 11th century architecture , built by William the Conqueror and used for centuries to hold the Royal family and more famously as a prison and torture house , the more famous residents of the tower include the likes of Anne Boleyn , Jane Grey , Charles I and Elizabeth I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reign of Elizabeth I , the globe theatre is a clever invention of William Shakespeare and is well worth the visit of any keen actor or enthusiast of English literature . <h> 8 . Houses of Parliament ( Westminster ) <p> Well worth a visit even if you 're not English . Tours are sometimes offered around the House of Commons and you can have the opportunity to see a great piece of Victorian work . A stunning building with a stunning purpose . <h> 9 . St Paul 's Cathedral <p> Whether you 're religious or not , the cathedral is a stunning building . However , the entry price is expensive which can cause most to run off , but to enjoy the cathedral you need not pay for much of its beauty is outside , though the inside is beautiful too . <h> 10 .

It 's a wonderful place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , history entertainment and a reason to change their trousers half way through the day . <p> Of course there are many other places in London to visit , but these are just my favourite places . When visiting London always do your research and plan your visit carefully ; its easy to get lost and waste an entire day finding something when a bit of planning could have prevented the waste . Remember that London is busy so travel with a friend and make sure you use public transport . It is among one of the best cities in the world and certainly one of my favourite places .

Write For Yourself <p> It 's hard , especially on writing sites , to complete this task . I know that you want to have comments that say that people love your story , that they want you to update more , and that they will " definitely be subscribing , " but it 's not really about them . Of course , comments and criticism is important ; but that does n't mean that you write to please them , or to please yourself because of their comments . <p> Writing for yourself means that you write because you love to do it , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yourself means that you write because you feel like you 're having fun , you get pleasure out of it , or whatever the reason is. <h> 2 . Add Details and Descriptions <p> That 's one of my biggest problems in some of the stories I read--lack of detail and description . I want to know what it looks like , what you , as the author , think of it , and how you visualize it ( because it 's your story ) . Now , I 'm also very specific on how much description you put into your story . <p> Put enough detail so that we , as the readers , can get an image in our mind of what you 're talking about . But , do n't put tons of specific detail , because the readers also want to put a little imagination when they imagine the scenes . <p> For example , if I do n't like the looks of a character in a story , I visualize them in a different way because it makes me more comfortable when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exact , detailed image stuck in my mind and I can barely change it . <h> 3 . Pour Emotion Into What You Write <p> Sometimes I 'm sad , sometimes I 'm overjoyed , and sometimes I 'm worried . I have different emotions and thoughts every day , and you do , too . Pour your emotion into the story . <p> But , there 's also another remedy to this : pour the character 's emotion into the story--if you think you know the character well enough , which you should . If the character just got over with the loss of her brother 's death , then do n't make the next chapter delightful and happy and full of rainbows . Put in thoughts of the character , and how she still has those faint memories of her and her brother playing in the snow when they were younger . <h> 4 . Add a Themed Layout <p> This is a big problem in some of the stories I read . The layout in your story has to fit the theme and the atmosphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would n't put yellow , pink , light green , light blue , or even light orange . Any of those happy-go-lucky colors probably would n't make the reader as comfortable in the story , and will make the story less likable . <p> Also , pay attention to your story area . If you think it may hurt some of your readers ' eyes , then change it so that it fits the eye level and a good color that the reader can read your story comfortably . <p> It will also help if the layout banner ( if there is one ) has colors that correspond to the colors in the rest of the layout . <h> 5 . Avoid Mary Sue . <p> Again , I see this a lot , and I am even guilty of it--but do n't make your character a Mary Sue . In case you do n't know , a Mary Sue is a character that seems just a little too perfect . <p> You need to add realistic flaws to your character--to all the characters .

Its especially hard on a site like Mibba where there are hundreds of thousands of stories floating around . The title is the first thing people notice about your story , so it is important to have a good one ! But , having a good story title is easier said than done . It is hard to think of a good , creative story title that is n't already taken , but hopefully these tips will help ! <h> Title Ideas <p> Its important to remember that , with the millions of stories that have been written , chances are your title has already been taken by someone , somewhere . Even though originality is fantastic , do n't  be put off if your title is already being used . Check to see what the story is about , and if it is n't similar to yours , feel free to use it . Unless there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chances are there is already more than one story with that title . For example , I found four pages of stories with the title Forget About It . The important thing to remember is that you do n't  want your story confused with someone elses , so try to make sure the stories are about different topics or are in different fandoms . <h> Theme <p> A good first step in coming up with a storys title is to think about the storys theme . If you are writing a story about abuse , you may want the title to be dark . If you are writing a love story , you will want the title to reflect that , as well . It is very important that your title follows this theme . <h> Quotes <p> A good way to think of a title for you story is to look through it for promising quotes . If one of your characters lines is " our relationship is falling apart " , Falling Apart might be a good title for that story . Remember , you want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one scene , your character wants to go to the toy store and says , " were like kids in a toy store " , even though Kids in a Toy Store might sound like a great title , if the rest of your story is about her running from a ghost in a cemetery , you may not want to make that your title . Following the theme is very important . <h> Word Play <p> Making your title a play on words is always a good idea . It adds a unique element to your title and makes your story seem more interesting . If your story is about a pianist who is trying to discover the truth about his parents old home , Keys might be a good title for your story . The title plays on the pianist character , because there are keys on a piano , and plays on the secrets , as well . <h> Nouns as Titles <p> Another idea for a story title is to use a noun from your story as the title , whether it is a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , titled Milk , takes a noun from the story that is central to the plot and uses it as the title . If your story is about a football player , Field Goal might be a good title for your story . Or , if your story is about a rock star , Set List might be a good title . You could also make the story 's title one of your character 's names or the town that they live in . <h> Plot as a Title <p> Another way to come up with a title is to make one that plays up on the plot of your story . A good example of this is The Lion King .

@@23757305 @3757305/ <h> Top Twenty Things To Do After Being Accepted Into University : <p> This is not a checklist , this is arranged in order of importance . Enjoy : ) <p> 20 . Buy a school sweater and wear it with pride : Hey ! You got in ! Be proud ! <p> 19 . Plan a garage sale : As you grow older , you old stuff just accumulates dust . Do yourself and your parents a favour and give it away . Have a garage sale where all the proceeds goes to your education . You can get family members to donate items of their own and they will be happy to help ( especially your parents ) Make signs , advertise like crazy ! If certain things do n't sell , you can sell them to a thrift store ( if their valuable ) or give them to charity . It 's all good in the end . <p> 18 . Sell your prom dress to a buy and sell thrift store/ebay : If your like me , you spend a lot more than you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really going to wear it again . I am , because it was super expensive and I 'm going to a wedding this summer , but other wo n't . Do yourself and your education a favour and sell the thing . Make a girl who would n't have been able to afford such a nice dress really happy and you walk away with additional university money . <p> 17 . Ikea catalogue browse : Time to start planning for residence ( if your in residence ) Ikea has really cool things for very cheap and great organization tools to help you with your first year on your own . Take a gander and budget . <p> 16 . Check regularly for due fees : Do you want to be suspended on your first year because your payments did n't get in on time ? Do you want to have no place to stay for the first semester ? Do you want to have no money for food on campus for the first 2 weeks ? Did n't think so ... so just check regularly and save yourself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bar situation near campus : If you abstain for alcohol , I feel terrible for you . People are going to peer pressure you like crazy . Do n't worry , perservere . For the rest of you , I 'm not condoning any illegal activities just do what you have to do to have a good time ... <p> 14 . Look up a tourist map of the surrounding area around campus and get acquainted : It 's nice to have a sense of where your going before you get there , especially if you plan on living there for months at a time . <p> 13 . Two weeks before starting school , review campus map : You 'll still get lost but it just decreases you chances of being embarrassingly late for everything the first few days . Maybe on the first week ( orientation ) during free time , walk around campus and take a dry run of your schedule . It 's not silly , it 's being proactive . <p> 12 . Look up note taking programs and note sharing websites : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . The difference is that it comes with notesolution , a program where you can take notes , add slides from powerpoints and pages from pdfs into your notes , highlights and sticky notes you notes , all in one easy to use program . A similar mac alternative is circus pony . I 've tried to download it for free but you need to buy it so you can buy it online for 50 dollars or look for other alternatives . <p> 11 . Sign up online for online help or early orientation for first years : Some universities offer online video chats on courses or first year information that 's useful . That transition will be difficult so try to make it as smooth as possible . Also some campuses have orientation sessions in the summer where they talk to students and parents directly about payments , obtaining student I 'd as well as academic tips like avoiding plagiarism and student services that are available . <p> 10 . Post that you got accepted on facebook or other social networking sites : This might not seem so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a certain university and that you accepted might get people who are also going to that university to notice and talk to you . In high school , you ca n't know where everyone is going but if someone on facebook in your grade is going too , you can find people you can meet up with on orientation week to lessen the stress of being alone and making new friends . <p> 9 . Review your choices of universities , pick for best potential experience : A lot of people make the mistake of choosing universities for prestige rather than program and experience . I am telling you not to make this mistake . Review your options . If you are certain that you will have a good time there , accept . If you only know about the academics of the school and not about the campus and professors of your specific program , then you should look before you leap . My mom is one of the many people who dropped out of prestigious universities because she found it was too competitive , too lonely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the US that problem is rare because prestigious school usually have really good student lives but in Canada that is n't always the case . Remember : you can go to prestigious schools for grad school if you want . <p> 8 . Find a good seasonal job : You need to find a job so you can start paying for your education . But I say seasonal because it 's your first year . You do n't want to be worrying about a job and adjusting to a completely new experience for you . Get a job in the summer for the summer in your hometown . If you like it , you can return after school is done that year and work there summers . Then you 'll have good recommendations for next year for the same employer or a new one . You can continue to work seasonally or get a job next year in you university town/city too , no pressure . A great way to work in university is to be a school tour guide or work at one of the services provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay in you town/city after the semester is over and you can get a seasonal job in Toronto . You will also become more involved in the school which may help for recommendations for further education . If you do n't find a job right away or at all , do n't stress out . Just apply really early next year and apply to more places . You ca n't over apply but you can over commit . Overcommitting is a no-no ! ( good example of a seasonal job that you can get anywhere : life guard , camp counselor ) <p> 7 . Sign up for courses asap : The sooner you sign up for courses , the more you can make your schedule most convenient to you . If you wait too late you may be stuck with crappy elective and night classes or early morning classes every day ! It will also give you the opportunity on doing the next tip below because there will be space in courses for you to flip around . Also it 's really hard to sort out conflicts when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your scheduled professors and change schedule accordingly : Rate my prof is a great tool . Just look up the profs your scheduled with and it will give you student ratings and the courses they teach . If you are n't happy with it , if you followed the above tip , yo can still try to get another professor if possible . Remember : Always check the alternative professor before changing your schedule . After fixing all the conflicts and changing the prof , you may realize the new one was worse than the first and have to undo everything . Do n't make yourself go through that pain . <p> 5 . Volunteer at a suitable location : If you can find a job , do n't sit around all summer moping , get active . Universities love active students . If you a science student , working in a lab , a hospital or with people is a great way of gain experience that might be useful when applying to get into internships and thesis courses with professors . It might get you into volunteering with might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually land you an actual paying job ! <p> 4 . Look up bursaries , scholarships and government financial help and apply : You 'd be surprised how many scholarships are out there . One 's for people of portuguese decent . In Canada they get 2,000 dollars . Orphans get 5,000 - 10,000 dollars , People with lots of volunteer hours ( see #5 ) get a lot of money as well . Do your homework . You may be eligible . I know in Ontario the government will pay for any student to go to university in loans so no worries about not having the money . You just need to have the means of paying it back . Average people however wo n't have their entire education paid for so even government funding programs need to be supplemented either by you parents or scholarships , bursaries or your own pocket . <p> 3 . Try to find a used/co-op bookstore : From reading number four , all this money talk is getting scary . Decrease you spending a little by looking up used university bookstores or co-op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally cheaper books and used books . U of T has at least one used book store but because it 's set in toronto , it probably has more . US : I would think the ones in big cities would definitely offer used books but I 'm not sure how Ivy League school rate on that specifically . Why this is important , you ask ? Getting used books will cut you cost and also giving back your books after the semester will help pay for next semesters books . How awesome ! <p> 2 . Sign up for residence : Most first year students are guaranteed residence but you need to sign up by a certain date . Also applications for the most part a re first come first serve . Sign up for a program here you live with others in your program . That will encourage success for next year . <p> 1 . Visit campus : If you have n't even been there , how can you know your making the right decision . I think feeling at home and comfortable with the location of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So visit . If you go on an open house day , you can talk to professors , other students , get residence tours and facilities tours . So definitely go and visit . If it 's too far , some websites have pictures and virtual tours you can look for . <p> I hope this helped in the slightest bit ! Remember , you 're not alone and godspeed : )

Whatever the problem happens to be , here are some tips to help keep your beautiful hair as healthy as possible ! <h> Be Gentle <p> You want to feel the wind blowing through your hair and feel as sexy and confident as possible ! Almost like that dress in your closet you 're keeping for a special occassion . Think of it as just that . Something silky , soothing , soft . Something that needs to be handled gently for it 's much more fragile than we expect it to be . <p> After taking a shower or washing your hair , pat it down with a towel instead of scrubbing away or wringing it . It 's best to let it air dry itself . <p> I have started to use a comb after the recent visit to the hair saloon . Using brushes to break through matted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something you do n't want ! Any comb will do and remember , be gentle when wrestling with tangles . <h> Lower The Use Of Heat Styling Devices <p> I personally have had a great problem lowering the use of straightners and curlers . Only recently did I find how much damage it truly causes . I even realized that it is n't always just your straightener or curler , it could also be your hair dryer . Unless it 's for a special occassion , do n't use it ! The more heat you use against your hair , the more it 'll damage , fray , and dry itself out . <p> It 's always best to let your hair air dry after a shower , but if you truly need to use it , put your blow dryer on a lower or cooler setting . This way , the heat is n't as intense . <p> We 'll all be using heat styling devices for those great occassions ! When those days do come around , make sure to use a protective serum for your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mart . <h> Avoid Damaging Treatments <p> We 're all suckers for the beautiful hair commercials that we see on TV . While they convince you of great results , some of these hair care products hold ingredients that leave our hair limp or even more dry than it was before . When noticing this , you will find much greater results when switching your products with something much more natural . <p> The majority of shampoos hold a great amount of sulfate that can leave your hair frizzy or frayed . Of course , everyone 's hair is different and most cases will be much more severe than others . If you are one who deals with dry , limp , or frizzy hair , then choose a shampoo with cleansing oils or herbs . <p> Avoid styling products that contain chemicals you have never even heard of or can pronounce . Those are usually not the best for you ! <p> Look for conditioners that have more aloe , coconut oil , or shea butter . These are great for mosturizing your hair to the fullest and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Stay Away From Dyes ! <p> Now , I 'm not saying that we should never , ever , ever dye our hair . Last year was the first time I ever did anything special with my hair and the least it was , was nothing more than an ombre . But if you are one of those people who continously fight over which radical color will fit you , heed my words ! If dye or other treatments like blowouts , chemical straightners and curlers , are used too often , they can seriously harm your hair and leave you with a result that is unfit and unhealthy . <h> Give Your Hair Oil Treatments <p> I 've started to pick this up quite frequently now . I am one to suffer excruciatingly from dryness and it 's quite a horrendous thing since I do n't see the typical shine and sparkle my hair is supposed to have . Oil will have a lasting affect ! Start them at your roots and keep them in place . Of course , you do n't have to do this everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's always on a Saturday . Make it a ritual . <p> Once every week ( or few weeks ) , give yourself one of these treatments . <p> Use olive oil or almond oil . <p> It 's a simple start . Make sure to start from your roots and then massage down fully to your tips . Do n't leave a bit of your hair uncovered by this process ! <p> You can let this oil sit in your hair for two hours or you can use a shower cap to keep it overnight . Either choice you make gives you the same results ! <p> After you rinse your hair a few times , shampoo and condition normally . <h> Make Some Healthy Choices ! <p> We 've all seen that one girl who has the most beautiful , thick , long hair and naturally envied her for it . Well , here are some choices we could all make to be like that girl ! We can start by nurtrients and eating right . Maybe a well balanced diet with enough protein , vitamin-B , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make sure to eat plenty of fruits , vegetables and nuts ! <p> For iron and protein , eat beef , chicken , pork , and fish ! <p> For omega 3-s , you can always consume salmons , avacados , and walnuts !

Hair also works this way . If you do n't sheild it from outside influence , it 'll get brittle over time . <p> During the summer when the sun is normally at it 's hottest peak , wear a hat to sheild your hair from getting burned . <p> Do n't go outside in the winter with wet hair ! It can freeze and then fray itself . <p> For all you swimmers , wear a swim cap . Chlorine can have serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrible time keeping up with this . I 'm so keen on growing it out that I do n't believe in trimming , but this is obviously a wrong statement ! Do n't be like me ! Take care of your hair !

@@23757307 @3757307/ <h> Control : The Centre to Human Nature <p> We all love having a small portion of control , and in every situation our levels of control and power will vary . Yet , there are times when it is inevitable that as a person , we will feel as though we have no control and indeed are completely powerless . No one likes this feeling , for it is of course the least pleasant of feelings . It can lead to depression , anxiety , anger and even more physical down feelings . So how does one go from being powerless in one situation to being completely in control in another situation ? <p> The answer is one of relative simplicity . It involves one 's cognitive functions , thus their brain ability and their intelligence . According to thinkers such as Gardner ( 1983 ) we have multiple intelligences , and so we will naturally excel at some things , but not others . Consequently , some may be better at emotional thinking ( or have a higher level of emotional intelligence , see Goleman 1995 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . <p> For example , when having a conversation with a friend , they say to you that they have split up with their partner .

Thus , you will likely understand what they are going through . This is a form of emotional intelligence . However , should one be lacking in such emotional intelligence and/or essential social skills , this situation may prove more difficult .

By this I mean your ultimate goal would be to stop the friend being upset - if indeed they are upset but that is another story . <p> Without such empathic skills however , this would not be likely to happen .

As likely as not you would not wish to discuss the topic for it evades your intelligence , thus you would have lost control of the situation due to a lack of emotional intelligence .

I 've been ahead sinc the beginning , and I am going to share the three steps I take to keep ahead of the rising word count goal . <h> Step One : <p> I do my own Word Sprints . I downloaded the 60 day trial version of Microsoft Office ( which includes Excel , Word , Power Point , and One Note 2010. ) , and on Excel I made a spreadsheet that looks kind of like this . I try to do three word sprints a day , usually for 30-15 minutes each sprint . This makes NaNoWriMo a lot easier and you 'll watch your word count rise all day . You could even win in a day ! <p> If you do n't know how to do a word sprint , all you do is set a time and for that time you write as much as possible . Pretty simple . <h> Step Two : <p> Have a thourough outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 chapter outline with a vague description of each chapter . But , I recently decided to revise my outline and make each description a bit more despritive . Now , I 'm writing chapters that are around 2,000 words each . I was writing chapters that were around 500 words each . ( That 's a 1,500 word gap , in case you ca n't math . ) <h> Step Three : <p> The third step is one I 'm not a fan of ... which helps . This step is more of a push to actually get your words up . If I do n't get my words done one day , or I start procrastinating , I punish myself with physical activities . I do 10-20 sit-ups or push-ups . This will work better if you actuall stay true to your word and keep going with the punishment . It will also work better if the punishment is something you fear , like no chocolate or coffee/tea for a week/day/hour . <h> A Tip : <p> I have a Kindle Fir , which is like a iPad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . And , since I spend 7hrs at school , I bring it with me . I have this app called ' Color Note ' , which is free . On the app you can add different notes and color-code them for the story .

She would have hated herself forever for not fighting to save her father . She may have been so depressed that she might have married Gaston who would have been a sexist husband that could have ended up abusing her . The Beast would have eventually died along with everyone in his castle . And Maurice would die alone in the dungeon . <p> If Jasmine had listened to her father , she would have been forced to marry Jafar who may have killed her in order to get her to shut up after he killed her father .

Streaming now through iTunes just a short week from its release , it seems as though the boys are anxious to see their fans reaction , delivering their first album without the aide of Jimmy ' The Rev ' Sullivan , who tragically passed away in 2009 , and with the addition of the newest member , Arin Illejay . And despite the fan 's intial reactions to the prospect of change in the classic Avenged sound , the Huntington Beach natives return with an explosion of a brand new album . <h> Shepherd 's Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , an ominous bell echoes out across your eardrums , a distorted guitar riff roared out by Synyster Gates leads the group firmly into the introductory track of the album .

Simplicity seems to be the key with this particular track , with the drums quickly joining the lead before the rhythm and bass comes leaping in , laying down the foundations for Shadows to quickly threat Watch your tongue/Ill have it cut from your head . Amidst the musical influence from the likes of Pantera , Metallica , Guns N Roses , Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath , a clear Game of Thrones theme of war , military and monarchy is brought through on this track , paired with the newly released music video , depicting images of an almost medieval nature . <p> With a roaring solo that is always expected of Syn , he incorporates a blues feel to a metal piece on top of a punching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more simplistic than most A7X fans are used to .

Shadows laughter and spoken word at the beginning of the track brings back a flavour of their self-titled effort , as well as mixing in elements of classic Pantera tracks Cowboys From Hell ( were taking over this town ) and This Love ( I 'd kill you for myself ) , especially with the slight twang of his accent .

Doing Time defiantly has all of the elements of the big anthems in rock and roll , even incorporating elements from a slightly softer/poppier side of rock and then incorporating those themes into metal music , which is pretty hard to do . Matts lower vocals can be compared to Axl Rose in this track , containing the same edge to it and yet managing to show off an almost bluesy vocal tone , something that is a refreshing change from the constant roar that A7X fans might be used to of the frontman with lungs of steel . <h> This Means War <p> The opening has the infamous guitar duelling returning for first time more prominently than the first three tracks , however , it completely throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . As a few ghostly drum beats lead you into an explosion of noise , the familiar twang of the guitar riff that was first given to fans via the bands website when their first teaser was released , echoes through , along with pounding drums that are not only reminiscent of Lars Ulrich , but carry a familiar flavour of previous Avenged drum tracks . Again , I adore the groove to this one , purely because it reminds me of people going to war and of marching soldiers , affirmed by Shadows as he cries out I cant go on this way/not as I am today . <p> This Means War is probably the most bad ass sounding track on the whole record , purely because its got that kind of rhythm that makes you bang your head and tap your foot at the same time . Much like the verse of Welcome To The Family and the riff of AC/DCs Back In Black , the song merely makes you want to walk as sinisterly as you can through a deserted street . As they 've been absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with a vengeance and they sound as amazing as ever , supporting Matts vocals as well as standing out amongst them . Personally , I think this has the most powerful lyrics , almost as though were slaves to the earth and were being lead to war by this track . The guys really tackle the issue head on with an anthem this big . <h> Requiem <p> This in particular was one of the few tracks that I was extremely excited to hear , especially after Syn described each track during an interview . The Latin chanting choir at the beginning really sets the scene , and though the melody sounds slightly like O Fortuna , it certainly increases the dramatic tension in the track , dragging the listener firmly by the throat into what feels like the middle of a war zone . Almost as soon as the guitars come rolling in after the chanting , the classical influences suddenly come roaring into the record , something that it has been stripped of for the first four tracks . If anything , the melody is also an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Zacky 's meaty animal of a guitar riff . <p> I like to think that it reminds me of some kind of warped waltz , especially with the + timing . In each track so far there 's been a sense of war and anger , bringing you closer to an inevitable fight , however Requiem shows off a slightly more fearful side , with Shadows lyrics becoming almost religious as he pleads Oh One , save me/Caress my weary eyes before he seems to pray to a higher deity , Darkest Lord/Your mercy shall I gain/Strike the match/Engulf the earth in flames . Though there is no clarification whether he is speaking to God or to another deity , Shadows vocals are the most powerful element of the song , as the rest of the band are almost overshadowed by the racing orchestra . Though the use of the choir is something that Avenged have used before , the deep vocals of prayer and promise during the bridge , that again are reminiscent of Pantera , and the orchestra almost make it like a moment of vulnerability in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shadows is to be commended for his vocal work , a particular highlight of this song . <h> Crimson Day <p> Firstly , I love the baritone guitar at the beginning , a feat that certainly reminds of the introductions to One and Enter Sandman . I was extremely excited to hear this , especially with Syn explaining that it was about his nephew during a similar interview . The sun came out and brought you through immediately affirms that during the slow beginning of the track . If anything , the hint of Syns backing vocals echoing with the slightly softer lead vocals from Shadows , adds a whole new dynamic to the track that has n't quite been explored before . As with Requiem , this seems to be an ode towards family and the vulnerability of Shadows and perhaps some of the other band members . <p> With the rest of the tracks leading up to this particular moment in the record being rather heavy and forward , Crimson Day brings the tone right back down again into an almost lullaby of a track , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The solo work as always , is incredible , and I have to commend both Syn and Zacky on this track in particular for their guitar work , which is especially creative on this particular track . Matts vocals , also known as quite gritty and heavy , come back down to a weakness that weve only ever heard on tracks like ' Tonight The World Dies ' , ' Fiction ' , ' Gunslinger ' and many others in the bands repertoire . The strings add quite the dramatic touch to the piece , much as they did with many of the tracks in the bands back catalogue , however it is the guitar work that stands out the most , heralding all of the traits to carry a classic anthem to the masses . <h> Heretic <p> As the slight weakness of Heretics predecessor fades away , the thick licks of guitar are suddenly brushed through into another powerful track , bringing the atmosphere to a whole new level . This track brings the tone right up with another groove packed beat , leaving Arins steady , bouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Matt on the verses , letting the guitars take a back seat for the most part in order to let the rhythm section get their well-deserved moment in the spotlight . The silence of the guitars is almost welcomed rather than missed , very much enunciating their philosophy of stripping the music down . There 's less of a wall of noise and more of a carefully crafted song where each part of the clog has been considered and written with . <p> The lyrics clearly have a theme of death and apocalyptic nature within them , with Shadows describing a mystery group of people who are baying for blood , the singer becoming the protagonist of the song as he tells of how My flesh will feed the demon , no trial no case for reason/I been chosen to pay with my life . Merely an innocent man being sent to his death . The addition of an acoustic guitar in the bridge also brings back the classical influences , but I think it adds a new level of dimension to it . With Syns pounding solo , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sheer insanity , the harmonic guitars that take you all the way back to City Of Evil with their riffing and the ever present showmanship of the group as a whole , the track shows a little of the old A7X in a brand new format . <h> Coming Home <p> The one thing that probably put me off slightly at the beginning was the reverb with the guitar , but I can look past it . It slightly ruined the effect that the piece was trying to create , but as soon as it had disappeared , the song clambered back up to its high standard . Upon glancing at the title , I had expected to hear a track somewhere along the lines of Dear God , a lament of the times that the band themselves spent travelling the world , taking them away from their families . And that itself can be taken into account when listening to the lyrics , but unlike the flowing cutesy country chords of the aforementioned track , Coming Home deals with the slightly negative side of that kind of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses a sign of that as he tells of searching for a reason , another purpose to find I 've sailed the seas , fought my many demons , perhaps a nod towards dealing with the passing of The Rev and the sinister side of touring without having him there . <p> Arin in particular has to be commended for his drum work in particular on this track , especially with his use of the cymbals in the beginning . I 'm not a drummer myself , but I know a good rhythm when I hear one . With the direction of the four long lasting members of Avenged directing him , Arin has certainly stepped up to the plate when it comes to performing for this particular record and though he will not be quite the same as Jimmy was , he is certainly creating an amazing sound . I think personally this was probably my least favourite track on the record , purely because it does n't  quite have the same kind of punch in the face attitude that the earlier tracks possessed . Despite that , it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripping guitar solo that Syn seems intent on providing on every single track and the spiky lyrics of dealing with personal demons , something many people can connect to . <h> Planets <p> Now I understand where the Star Wars references were coming from . Almost immediately , the sound of power in Zackys rhythm guitar and joined by Arins artillery drums and an almost Bullet For My Valentine-esque riff from Syn , backed up by strings to slowly build up the tension of the song until the rhythm explodes with changing keys until it reaches the point of the vocal entry . There seems to be a recurring sense of a war zone amongst each track and I believe that Planets would be the fight itself , especially with the lyrics of destruction and anarchy described over the pounding guitars . Snippets of the bridges harmonics , layered with Mr Bungle-esque brass and dramatic strings to fit in with the guitars triplets have another nod towards The Imperial March with the battle cry of Planets collide ! that ends each chorus . <p> Through his lyrics , Shadows seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning to the world , growling that mother of all , your time is coming . As the keys swiftly change from one to the other throughout the song , there is an increasing sense of urgency as the tracks move forward , accentuated by the orchestra , almost as though the world is crumbling around us . One of the many things I love about this album is its ability to take you on a complete journey of a story in just ten tracks , something that Planets does extremely well . The orchestral influence , as much as it was on Requiem , has a huge impact on the feel of the song and as the metal of the guitars , drums and bass are infused with the orchestral brass , woodwind and strings , it creates a new kind of balance between the two genres that has rarely been seen by other groups . <h> Acid Rain <p> As a closer , the piano at the beginning certainly brings to mind a flavour of Elton John , and sets up the scene for the piece as almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight inversion of the minor key setting the mood for the final track . As for the sound of wind blowing , it brings about a sense of complete destruction , the post-war aftermath . With the orchestra building up the main rhythm , the simple waltz-drums and Syns solo guitar , it creates a beautiful ending to an amazing album . Personally , this track has to be my favourite out of the whole album , purely because of its mixture of elements all colliding together to create a beautiful piece of music . <h> So do n't  shed a tear now/be thankful for the time ' . <p> Matts vocals are sensitive and yet powerful at the same time , almost a farewell to the album that they have created . Beneath the lyrics , I like to think that there is some kind of personal meaning to all of them , seeing as theyve all had to say goodbye to the genius that was Jimmy Sullivan in 2009 . ' We 've come so far , Shadows sings and as he promises you will always be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen hero , or perhaps to his family . Not even stars last forever . What I particularly adore about this song is that the guitars take a back seat once again and it is very much an orchestral piece with military drums and a gorgeous vocal line that really shows off the richness and tone of Matts voice . I have to say , Syns solo here is the most melodic , much like the ending of Danger Line , he takes the notes and turns them into something almost soothing . These men certainly know how to craft a song to end an album and personally , this is one of my favourites , ending with the same rain and wind sounds that the beginning echoed . It brought tears to my eyes to hear this track and it has already proved to me that Avenged Sevenfold have possibly made one of the best albums of their career . <p> Always known for their experimental , take no prisoners and have no fear attitudes towards creating albums , Avenged Sevenfolds Hail To The King was always going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fans who would continue to pine for the Waking The Fallen days , for the complexities of City Of Evil to be brought right back into 2013 . However , in this writers opinion , Avenged Sevenfold have grown for the better . <p> With the pounding kick in the teeth of Doing Time and This Means War reflected with the vulnerable cries for help in Requiem and Acid Rain , they make the perfect balance between destruction and revolution . The Avenged Sevenfold fanbase are often divided on many subjects , whether it be certain band members choice of haircut or the brand new sound they are boasting , but this writer has a feeling that this record might just be the thing to unite us as a family once again . <p> Hail To The King will be released on August 25th in Australia and Europe , August 26th in the United Kingdom and August 27th in the US .

There is a good amount of comedy in it , mostly provided by the character Fred , but there is also a good storyline to it . I really liked how we were lead to believe that it was just a basic supervillain but then found out that he was actually after revenge for his daughter 's supposed death all along .

I have n't posted in awhile because I was in South Korea recently ! I had a really good time and here 's some things about my experience ! <p> First of all I went to South Korea because my older brother teaches English over there.He 's lived there for the past year and a half and he 's coming back to the states in six months , so if I wanted to visit him over there it was really now or never . <p> This was my first time out of the country and it was my first time flying alone.On the way over there I had a 12 hour non-stop flight to Incheon airport.Luckily I got the aisle seat and I sat next to a mom and her two well behaved sons.It was about 6 P.M. there , my flight had been delayed , the transit train to the KTX gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running on close to 24 hours since I can not sleep on planes.My brother and I finally got on the KTX and I tried to mentally prepare myself for a 2 hour train , which I ended up sleeping through most of.I woke up and then we had to get on the bus for an hour.Let me tell you something guys . That bus which I found out was very normal was so crowded . The bus was FULL they were still letting people on . I had to stand up for an hour while I was half asleep . They drive so crazy that I was practically falling down . I was already bitter because it smelled bad in a way I was not used to so that did n't help.We were finally off the bus and then I found out we still had another 10 minute taxi ride.All I could think was " Really ? " That 's when I found out how jet lag treated me.I almost puked in the back of the cab . Right before it came up the cab stopped and we were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day.I ended up going to my brother 's school , but before it actually started I did puke and so I walked back to his apartment.I skyped my mom and dad when I got there . That was probably the hardest thing for me . I just wanted my momma there to give me a hug and make me some soup . Skyping them I almost cried , but I ended up sleeping for a long time.I ended up puking three more times that day and had to chug some bad tasting medicine . <p> The next two days were fun.It was market day at his school.So what market day is , is if students do good they get stickers , and then they cash their stickers in for fake money . They can then spend the fake money on various things in their market like food , drinks , stationary.I also got to go to their movie day where they took all the students to see Epic.After the movie there was a teachers dinner.So all the korean teachers took the foreign teachers.I had the worst meal of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cucumber shavings is the best thing on earth.I do n't think so.I do n't think so at all.But luckily that evening my brother and Marty took pity on me and took me to get chicken strips . <p> The rest of my time was seeing where he lived.I went shopping with some of the girls.We saw a movie on the imax.Lots of food was ate . <p> My brother and I are very much the same.We like being lazy.So we would stay in the house until like 4 and then venture out.It was hard to go outside because it was so damn hot.It was like Minnesota 's heat , but hotter.The humidity sucked . <p> I got to go to a Nura Bong though so that was fun.It 's a room you rent by the hour with all your friends and you sing karaoke.It was actually really pretty fun . <p> My last couple of days i went into Seoul.We went to Meyong dong which is like a shopping district.We went to the Tower of Seoul and to the Teddy Bear museum.Yes a Teddy Bear Museum.South Korea 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to the DMZ ( De-Militarized Zone ) That was really cool because you got as close to North Korea as you can go.I learned that there was a train from South Korea that took you into North Korea that took you in to China which then took you into every asian country , some of Europe , and parts of Aftica.Can we reflect on how truly amazing that is.You could travel to three different continents by TRAIN.but since North Korea and South Korea had the war they shut down the track going from their two countries , messing everything up.We also got to go in this tunnel that North Korea had blew going into South Korea.That was really astounding because a guy from North Korea had told South Korea about it.North Korea had dug 30 tunnels , but South Korea has only found four.They said that with these tunnels North Korea could invade in 1 hour without anybody knowing.If that does happen they have a line of tanks that should hold them back for 30 minutes.So technically Seoul , the biggest city in South Korea , would only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnels was that South Korea went to court basically and told them .

The tour guide said all in the forest on the side of the road were landmines that was dropped during the war . They do n't know exactly where they are but they know their in that area . So technically if our bus had tipped over we might 've been screwed.The most powerful thing of all though would 've been the freedom bridge .

Once you 've decided what colours you want , you can start to glue down your crayons . <h> Step Three <p> Arrange your crayons into the order you want them before you stick them down .

When hearing the names Sigmund Freud , Carl Jung , Alfred Adler , and William James , one thinks of the founding fathers of psychology . They are the most well-known pioneers and early founders who contributed their endeavors of better understanding to the psychological frailties . Each of them dedicated their lives to studying and learning about the human mind . They were the contributors to the modern science of psychology each with similar ideas as well as different ideas too . However , not everyone will agree with each philosopher but his perspectives and approaches are still considered in todays world of psychology . These men have provided a foundation for psychology that will never go unnoticed even if people fail to agree with their ideology . <h> Sigmund Freud <p> Sigmund Freud considered himself as a scientist first attempting to extend the compass of the human knowledge . He studied biology for the next six years , doing research in physiology with the scientist Ernst Br++cke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up work as a doctor at Vienna general hospital . Once his sixth child Anna was born , Freud set up a private practice of the treatments within physiological disorders . Freud was impressed by the work of the French neurologist Jean Charcot , who was using hypnotism to treat hysteria and other abnormal mental conditions . Freud also experimented with hypnosis but found that its beneficial effects did not last . He then decided to take on a method suggested by the work of a colleague and friend Josef Breuer , who had discovered that when he stimulated a hysterical patient to talk openly about the earliest incidences of the symptoms . Freud articulated and advanced the idea that many psychoses phobias like hysterical paralysis and pains had their origins in deeply traumatic experiences that had occurred in the patients past and were now hidden from consciousness ( Stephen P. Thornton ) . The treatment was enabled to the patient to recall the experience of the consciousness , to confront it in a deep way both intellectually and emotionally , therefore discharging it and remove the underlying psychological causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jung learned a lot from Freud , which helped him to identify with his later theories . Carl Jung learned from Freud about the unconscious mind but was more fascinated with the human mind through dreams , myth , art , and philosophy . Jung and Freud were close counterparts until Jung started to deviate from Freuds views . Jung came to his own conclusion about human personality theory in which he believed religion played a part . Jung formed his own theory called Analytical Psychology . After much evaluation his own subconscious and recording his results in an unpublished book , he concluded the human psyche has three parts : the ego ( conscious mind ) , the personal unconscious , and the collective unconscious . However , Jung believed the process of individuation was crucial in order to be a complete and entirely established person . Individuation is complete once a person can use both the conscious and unconscious mind . <h> William James <p> William James born January 11 , 1842 was highly known as an original thinker and one of the greatest multidisciplinary minds in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sr. of New York , James was described by his mother as " an emotional individual who must express every fluctuation of feelings . " At the age of 19 , James decided to attend Harvard University to study chemistry and soon transitioned into medicine to learn the science that went with it . William James helped establish psychology in the United States and became an instant classic . He was considered Americas greatest philosopher in addition to being the father of American psychology . Jamess main contribution to the psychology world focused on emotions and introduced the James-Lang theory . The theory proposed that " the physiological change is primary , and emotion is then experienced when the brain reacts to the information received via the body 's nervous system . " In his book The Principles of Psychology , James stated that " Common says we lose our fortune , are sorry and weep ; we meet a bear , are frightened and run ; are insulted by a rival , are angry and strike . The hypothesis here to be defended says that the order of sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry because we strike , afraid because we tremble " ( pp. 1065-1066 ) . James whole emphasis was that emotion is nothing without the body and that it has evolutionary purpose and believed that we first respond to a situation and then experience an emotion . <h> Alfred Adler <p> When discussing theories Alfred Adler implemented into his work , it is important to note his most well known theory simply named as the Alderian Theory . The Alderian Theory suggests individuals have a need to want to feel noticed and appreciated . In achieving this , one must obtain a balanced and well-adjusted lifestyle through socialization with the world , family interaction , and setting goals in order to feel content ( Corey , " Alderian therapy , " 2005 ) . An individual has to be encouraged in order to feel they have a purpose . Adler believed a person must have a healthy childhood to express positive behavior socially and with themselves . It is important to discard feelings of insecurity and discover a purposeful self . <h> Differences and Similarities <p> Between Sigmund Freud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories of discovering psychological functioning in human behavior . For example , Adler did not agree with Freuds theory of sexual trauma in the early stages of childhood development being a cause of mental disorders . A more in-depth example of their differences would involve Freuds 5 Stages of Psychosexual Development theory . Adler would view a mother and infants relationship as loving and necessary in the way that the infant would be satisfied through hunger and the mother desires for the breast milk to be relieved . Freud would simply suggest the infant is acting out through the first stage , oral , in a cannibalistic manner ( " Adler , Alfred " , 2013 ) . <p> According to Feist and Feist ( 2009 ) , Carl Jung theorized that individuals are not only motivated through subdued experiences , but attitudes and personality are inherited through ancestry Chapter 4 ) . This is what Jung calls the collective unconscious . Jung goes on to explain how individually , people are each introverted as well as extroverted , male and female , conscious and unconscious . He believed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adler would agree with the connection between traits of personality and family . <p> Much like Alfred Adler , William James was interested in discovering oneself . James made it an important point that each individual does self-examination through the mind . <h> Conclusion <p> Many years ago Freud , Jung , Adler , and James all formed theories of psychology . Each man had his own perspective and theory but one thing lives on , the foundation of psychology that reinforces modern science . While each man did not agree between theorists , there was some common ground between them . These men paved the way for what psychology is today and even though there will be more psychological discoveries , one thing is for sure , these four mens theories will continue to lead psychology today .

@@23757324 @3757324/ <h> How to Write a Resume <p> A resume is a summary of your experiences and skills relevant to the field you are interested in . It is designed so that you can highlight your accomplishments , your past work experience , your skills and strengths , your volunteer work , and your educational background . Of course , this is not to be mistaken for an autobiography ; one must take into consideration what are you aiming for by submitting the resume . <p> Sooner or later , you will require submitting one in order to pitch an interview with a future employee , score a scholarship , or get into a college program . In order to have a successful resume , you must keep in mind the initial purpose of the resume and tailor it to fit each field . <h> How to Start ? <p> An easy way to start writing your resume is to create a list of the skills , strengths , activities , experiences , and education over the years . This will help you take notice of the things useful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each point you make , write why this would be important to the field that you are applying for . <p> Before writing your resume , you must first establish a font . 1 " margins all over , a readable size ( I usually use 12 font ) for the body ; headings and subheadings should vary in size in order to note the different sections ( headings you can use font 16 and subheadings font 14 ) . Use a standard font ( Times New Roman is a good example , Arial , Georgia , etc. ) to look professional . Do not use " fun " fonts ; it will make you look unprofessional and might make it harder for the reviewer to read ( I once had a freshmen student reviewing his resume with me and had a cursive font all over the resume , which made it very difficult to read ) , which may prompt them to not reading it at all . <p> The heading should include your name , address , contact information , and can be centered or justified . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume layout . Chronological resumes focus on experience rather than education and are best used by those who have been working on the same field for a while , so it wont be a good idea for a freshman college student using this format for their first job . Functional Resumes focus on experience and skills , best suited for people without a steady career ; in this case , a freshmen student can use this type of resume to highlight skills and experience on different areas , rather than just the focus on a steady career . Finally , you can use a combination of the previous ones , which helps people to highlight specific skills and how they were acquired . Although it is a good idea to have a layout in order to keep track of what you are writing , I highly recommend building your own layout , since each person has different experiences , skills , objectives , and education . <p> To do this , I present below the different sections that you can include into your resume . <h> Objective <p> The Objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be visible , right under your name , and this will let the reviewer know what your goals are and how you would benefit the employer . Do not write vague statements ; this section is to note the specific goal you have for the particular place you are applying to . <p> Remember to sell yourself out ; this is your pitch to the people reviewing your applications and this will define whether you have anything new to offer that places you in an advantageous position as compared to any other applicant . <h> Skills <p> The purpose of writing about your skills and strengths is to let the employer or the committee reviewing your resume know what you are capable of . Skills vary depending on the job , but most of them translate easily onto one another . <p> Here is an example of a list of skills aimed at creating a resume tailoring a potential employer : <p> Fluent in English and Spanish both written and spoken languages <p> Proficient in the use of MS excel , word , powerpoint , and publisher <p> Proficient in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . <p> Excellent at finishing assigned tasks in an organized and timely manner <p> Capable of assuming leadership positions and have individual initiative <p> Good communication skills <p> Good at working in teams to achieve goals in an efficient and timely manner . <p> The skills highlighted on your resume will allow the employer , school board , or any person reviewing your application know what your general skills are and whether these are suitable for what you are applying to . <h> Qualifications <p> The Qualifications section of your resume should be the first best way to showcase the qualities that make you a good candidate for whatever is it that you are applying for . Under this section you can show whether you have years of experience on the field , achievements , and a resume of your skills . This can also be named the Achievements section . <p> Aside from showcasing you , this section allows for you to quantify your achievements , show progress , and demonstrate what assets you can bring into the position , school , or program you are applying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken , certifications , honors you have received , scholarships you have won , achievements you have accomplished in your job , academic life , or volunteering , and specific skills that would be tailored to the specific thing you are applying to . <p> Here is an example that I used for my application for a graduate program : <p> Bachelor of Arts in Psychology <p> Background in Psychology and Sociology upper level courses such as : <p> Seminar in Psychology : Criminal Behavior <p> Psychobiology <p> Health Psychology <p> Independent Research <p> Advanced Statistics <p> Research Methods <p> Excellent academic writing skills . <p> Strong , two-year background in academic research with background in collecting and analyzing data . <h> Education <p> The placement of the Education section and the Work Experience section varies accordingly with your own experiences . If you have recently graduated college , for example , and have no experience on the field , the best would be to place Education first in order to highlight that your inexperience on the field is due to your experience on the academic part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of experience on , let 's say business administration , and this is an important part of your application , then it is best to place Work Experience first in order to highlight this . <p> On the Education content you will be listing from most recent to oldest all of your educational career or degrees . In this section you will name the institution that you attended , the degree you earned ( or are still working on earning ) , your graduation date ( or anticipated graduation date ) , GPA , and if you were part of any honors society . You can also list any related coursework that might prove useful for what you are applying to . <p> If you did not complete a degree , you can list the credit hours that you reached and the date , solely to focus on the Work Experience field . <h> Work Experiences and Volunteer Experiences <p> After you have finished writing down the skills you find necessary for the job or setting you are submitting your resume to , listing your qualifications , and completing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past work experience . If you are a student , either aiming for a job or a college , keep in mind that you might not have a lot of work experience ; however , if you feel that your job experience is little , it is always useful to list your volunteer work or extracurricular activities that you find relevant to the field , also small jobs , like baby-sitting , will help you in letting the person who views your resume know that you have some experience and that you are willing to learn more . <p> To write down your work experience , start by the latest one and move on to the oldest one . Remember that if you were a babysitter at age , let 's say , 14 and you are currently 20 , that job experience will not be as relevant as your current one . <p> By listing your job experiences it is important to have an established format . You will be listing the employer , your position , and the start and ending date of this position . <p> I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have an idea on how it would look . <p> Writing a resume is not an easy task ; however , it is an important asset to turn in alongside with any application in order for the people reviewing your file to know whether or not you 'll be a good candidate for any position , scholarship , grant , or program . The template provided here is a general template that covers basic information that is necessary for a complete and useful resume ; however , it may vary accordingly with what you are applying to . <p> To look for more specific questions regarding resume-writing , here is a list of some good resources for tips , templates , and examples : 
@@23757325 @3757325/ <h> Assassin 's Creed : A Tribute to the End <p> From the beginning we loved the Assassins Creed franchise and very little has changed as we reach revelations . As we followed young Altair Ibn-La'Ahad in Masyaf , the holy land we began our journey down the assassins path . Assassins Creed was a rather amazing game all on its own , I do n't  think anyone predicted anything more out of the game , but Ubisoft always find a way to surprise us . The storylines seem to get better and better as the games advance . <h> The Nine Templars <p> Killing the Nine Templars for the master of the assassins was a slow job and often took a few tries to perfect but the storyline and reasoning behind these deaths was flawless and very well written . Naturally we have all ended a game when we are betrayed by the person we trust most ( just look at the Grand Theft auto franchise if you do n't  believe me ) but the betrayal of the grand master of the assassins left me in shock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message , well I suppose all of them do but Assassins Creed is where it all began . Every good game gives the player the moral of the story : Power corrupts the greatest of men . The apple of Eden simply serves as the symbol of power and as in the bible Temptation , Templar Temptation . <p> The new revamped Assassins Creed was a breath of fresh air to the Assassins Creed fan and indeed players who did not like Assassins Creed 2s predecessor . Assassins Creed 2 is a story of betrayal and heartache from the very beginning , a story of mystery and hidden secrets which are centuries old . Assassins Creed 2 gives the player an inclusive new story which is easier than the first . The difficulty and pace of the game is which put many players off the game . The player is given Ezio Auditore Da Firenze , a cocky young man whose life is snatched away from him when his family are betrayed and sent to the rope . Ezio must become an assassin to avenge his father Ezio admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't  choose the life of an assassin it chose him . Auditore sees the life of an assassin as a responsibility . <h> The Borgias <p> The villainy in Assassins Creed 2 and Assassins Creed Brotherhood all lead to The Borgias ( an aristocratic influential family who lived in Renaissance Italy in the 1600s ) From Ceasere Borgia to Roderigo Borgia , the incestuous , murderous insane family must be eliminated one by one . Assassins Creed is a great way to learn about the story of the Borgias , a story which is seldom told today . <h> Leonardo Da Vinci and Originality <p> Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood included Leonardo Da Vinci as a protagonist . Da Vinci served as an inventor and a creator in the game and of course a good friend to Ezio . As the player progresses through the games Da Vinci constructs Ezio weapons such as dual hidden blades , poison blade , hidden gun etc . The player is also exposed to exciting missions which involve Leonardo Da Vincis inventions . In Brotherhood the player has to destroy Da Vincis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the flying machine . <p> Assassins Creed has always held brilliant originality with weapons and costumes . A fair few gamers will know who Altair or Ezio are if shown a picture , you do n't  really need to be a fan to recognise the cloaks for what they really are . Weapons such as the hidden blades and hidden gun are so very original that they must belong to Assassins Creed . From a writers perspective I can tell the reader that creating an original idea is such a very difficult thing to do . <h> Revelations <p> So we have reached the end of the series . I can not describe how disappointed I am that I will never play a new Assassins Creed game . Revelations was a more than adequate final game . Yes the game had a few errors , no it was not good to play as Desmond , his missions were dire if you were not good at puzzles , but Ezio Ezios missions were amazing . Seeing Ezio as an old man shows how the assassin matured , much like Altair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who thinks what he thinks is God , to a man who has actually lived the assassins life and learned what was right . Altairs journey ends in revelations too , I can not express how brilliant his story was . Ezios final days as an assassin blew my mind , he did everything for a reason and ended knowing that his job was done . I need to also express to the reader how odd it is for Ezio to say " Desmond . " All I will say to the people who have n't played it yet is the game ends on a high and we can say goodbye to Ezio , a legend of a video game character along with Altair , revelations ties up the stories so neatly it is almost like art . Goodbye Assassins Creed , thank you for enriching gaming history . <p> Ezio Auditore will be making an appearance in Soul Calibur V ( 2012 ) for one last look at the legend .

Jones has been a part of the bands Waking Ashland and We Shot the Moon , as well as pursuing a solo career , releasing three albums . In total , this is his eleventh studio recording . McAllister was discovered by Tyler Ward and released a nine song EP . Since then , she has made her name known on Youtube , both covering songs and posting original ones . Old Daisy is the duo 's name , as well as the EP 's . Throughout the album , we also find them mentioning the word " daisy . " Their style can be considered singer/songwriter , acoustic or indie .

Overall , I find it like the previous song : a good beat , nice harmonies but not the type of lyrics I think I could fall in love with . The instruments in this song are pretty similar to the last track , so I ca n't say it was surprising or especially outstanding . <h> To Fall In Love With You <p> To Fall In Love With You is the first single , with an eclectic music video which you can view here . I think it was well-chosen to be the first single because it really stands out in the EP . Not only is it catchy and fun , but the lyrics are sweet and easy to sing along to . I also love how this song has a banjo in it . Katy 's vocals also stand out , but not because she sings much more , but because her voice sounds especially silvery . <h> Without Me <p> The chorus of this track is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing to the ear and meaningful . The lyrics are a bit sad , but the melody is n't , which provides an optimistic look on a bittersweet event . <h> Special K <p> I 'm still stumped as to why this song is called Special K. It talks about being " friends till the end " so my best guess is that Jones wrote this song for Katy , hence the K. Regardless of the song title , this is one of the best songs on Old Daisy . The snapping fingers noise heard throughout the track makes it even catchier and more likeable . <h> Marcus <p> The softest song on the EP , Marcus talks about a love that was n't meant to be . It is a bit of a heartbreaking way to close off such a cheery album , but it definitely makes you want to listen to it another time to experience the emotional rollercoaster all over again .

Most people have something they 'd like to change about themselves , whether it 's a crooked tooth , hair type or colour , or your weight . For most adults , the option to change themselves is more widely available ( able to pay for dental work , have their hair done at a salon and join a gym with full use of equipment ) but for teenagers , and teenage girls especially , body hang-ups are not as easily addressed and this can have a big impact on your life . It can affect the way you dress , the way you hold yourself and the confidence you have to go out and live your life . Confidence is key to many things in life - getting a job , romantic relationships and maintaining/creating friendships .

@@23757334 @3757334/ <h> The History Of Vampires <p> In recent years , the new ' vampire has taken over the world , leaving people with little imagination , or information on the true root of these demons . <p> Vampires are an immortal species , a fact that is still consistent in our literature today . However , how did vampires come into existence ? The true origin of the vampire species is unknown , with theories enough to cloud the head of the most logical among us . Some speak of the anomaly being spawned from hell ; others say they are the spawn of demonic creatures . One statement has always been regarded as fact , however ; Vampires have been around as long as the human race . <p> In the book of Genesis in the Holy Bible , a woman who once shared Eden with Adam is spoken of . Her name is believed to be Lilith , though her name is only mentioned once in the bible ( Isaiah 34:14 ) , and she is spoken of once in the Jewish Torah . Originally , Lilith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam , rather she was created as an equal of Adam 's , and was given free will in Eden . Lilith and Adam argued frequently , and Lilith refused to make love with Adam , who demanded her lay on her back during intercourse . For this , Adam became angry with God , and demanded a woman created in his likeness . God punished Lilith for her disobedience by forbidding her and any offspring that should come of her from eating from the Tree Of Knowledge . Enraged after a time , Lilith began to eat from the tree again . By the time God had sent Adam to punish her , Lilith had escaped the Garden of Eden . Once out of the garden , she took up the habit of sleeping with a different man every night . <p> When Lilith heard of Adam 's new wife Eve , she became fearful that if they had offspring , Adam would send them to seek revenge . Lilith became paranoid , and quite fearful of children . Due to this phobia , she resorted to cannibalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins turned her into a horrible winged monster . This story is believe to be the explanation as to why women are cursed ' with monthly bloodletting ; hence many believe the myths of vampires were born from this legend , as well as that of Cain , the son of Adam who murdered his brother Abel . <p> In Ancient Egypt , Vampires were a prevalent and highly regarded part of Ancient Egyptian beliefs , held in the same regard as cat people and werewolves . They were treated as gods , their power visible through their fearsome features . Osiris was by far the most popular of the Vampires in their system of beliefs , as was his brother Set . They were abandoned by their parents , who were also vampires . The people who took in the two brothers practiced magic . They had two human daughters , Isis and Nephytus . Osiris married Isis , and when he became king he used the magic he 'd been taught to teach the people of Egypt to work the land , and from him they gained incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set began feeding on humans , creating more vampires to overtake his brother and gain his position of power . He and the new vampires murdered Osiris , making Set the pharaoh . <p> Horus , the son of Isis and Osiris , worked with a sorcerer called Ra , and placed a curse on Set and his vampire minions . They could not go into the sunlight , or they would be destroyed . This is where the myth of vampires being nocturnal originated . When Isis managed to bring Osiris back , he was bound to the netherworld , and known as the Lord of the Underworld amongst humans . <p> In Greek history , the vampires of old are assumed to have taken on different forms , and some were mistaken as Gods . It is believed that Hades was truly Osiris , Cain was known as Cronus ( also spelt Kronos ) , and Lilith went by Circe . Hades , as many of you may know was the God of the Underworld in Greek mythology . Cronus was the Titan God of time and ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that his children would overthrow him , so he ate his offspring . Zeus was saved , and when he grew up , he defeated Kronos , saved his brother Poseidon and Hades , and sent the Titans , his father included , to Tartaros , ruled by the Goddess Hecate . <p> Circe was a minor goddess in Greek mythology , most known for her presence in the epic Odyssey , by Homer . She was often coined a sorceress , though she was truly and simply the Goddess of Magic . She invited Odysseus ' crew into her lavish home , a mansion amongst dense woods , and fed them well . She did , however , lace their wine with a magic potion , and once they had indulged , they were all turned into swine . She was known to do this to all her enemies , and all who opposed her . In Indian lore , it was a well known fact that Circe had a habit of eating the animals into which she 'd transformed men . <p> Moving on through history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in a day , nor was it built by humans . Romulus and Remus were werewolves , who founded the empire of Rome via conquest . A vampire known as Scorn appeared at this time , becoming involved in the wars of Rome . Scorn was often mistaken as the incarnation of Roman God Mars ( Greek : Ares ) due to his war-like attitude . Scorn conquered many lands , and an alliance with many other vampires , was formed . These fiends terrorized the humans , until a powerful and nameless human began to weaken the vampires , and condemned them to a life of exile , while other terrified people began to follow his lead . The Roman Catholic Church comes into play now , as the force that kept the vampires exiled , and the city safe . In ancient days , being a vampire tended to mean you were murderous , ate flesh , and/or drank blood . Often , the people were perceived as undead , but depending on the lore and the person telling it , sometimes that tidbit of information has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many myths that came in part with the original legend of the Vampire species . Now , let it be known that not all vampires are the ones we think of today . Most every culture has their own form of vampire , some of which do not even take human form . I will discuss some of them now . <p> Two of the most well known types of vampires are the Incubus and the Succubus , both of European origin . Both are sexual beings , the Incubus the male , and Succubus the female . The Incubus is known to visit women nightly , and drain them of life and strength . It is said that if an Incubus should visit you , it will haunt your dreams . Incubus vampires can father children . Succubus vampires are female , who visit men nightly for sexual relations , and haunt their dreams , rendering a victim totally exhausted . <p> The Talamaur is a living form of the vampire , originating in Australia . It is said the Talamaur can communicate and summon spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh corpse by eating the flesh . <p> The Strigoii is by far the most famous vampire , of Romanian descent . It is dead , and feeds on the blood of the living , often participating in sexual acts with human females . While many books and movies have captured the essence of the original vampire lore , for instance Anne Rice 's Vampire Chronicles , and Bram Stoker 's Dracula , many also skewer the myths and have created their own breed of vampire , one who does n't adhere to the previously well publicized and understood myths . Darwin 's theory of Natural Selection seems to have stepped in ; we play out one breed of vampire , ( and well , it took centuries ) and another is born .

A lot of children create imaginary companions for all sorts of reasons ( I 'm almost positive I had one but I had a short attention span so I probably ' destroyed ' him/her very quickly ) but I 'm curious as to whether any adults or teens on this site still have imaginary friends from their childhood or new ones they have created . The questions I have include : <p> - How old are you ? Male or female ? - How many imaginary friends do you have ? - How old were you when you remember creating your imaginary friend(s) ? - How old is/are your imaginary friend(s) ? - Are they male or female ? Are they human , animal , etc ? - Do you ever interact with them in public ? - Does your interaction with your imaginary friend(s) disrupt your life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle and their story with me will get an acknowledgement in the book , but feel free to post anonymously , either on here or you can message me privately if you like .

Usually one , but it can increase if I 'm feeling more lonely than usual.3 . I 've had ' imaginary friends ' for as long as I can remember , though they 've changed over the years . I 'd say around 5 years old.4 . I do n't know . They do n't really have ages I guess.5 . Many are female , some are male . They 're all human.6 . Only in my head , I would n't dare actually speak to any of them in public.7 . No .

The other ones come and go as they please , they 're only around at certain times . The more lonely or depressed I 'm feeling , the more imaginary friends I 'll have to interact with . I keep hold of imaginary friends because it makes me feel less lonely . I have a big problem with feeling scared of social interactions and have isolated myself for years , so I began creating imaginary friends for myself to make myself feel a little less lonely and make the isolation I was purposely putting myself through more bearable . It was easier to handle having someone to talk to , even if I knew deep down that they did n't really exist . It just feels nice to have someone around I guess . <p> You can just put me down as Airi if you want to , but you can do it anonymously as well .

I refer to them as minor characters because they 're not interactive as much . I have two current ones. - I 'm pretty sure about 4 years old . I have one imaginary friend who I 'd called my conscience . I created him when I was 12. - The ones I created around 4 or 5 are the same age as me . My ' conscience ' is almost timeless but I picture him as in his mid 20's. - Males and females . Most are human but one from my early childhood is a vampire . I also had another one who had light blue skin and dark blue hair . He was kind of similar to Edward Scissorhands. - When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean I know they 're not real , but they keep me company . <p> I 've made two recent imaginary friends in the past two years . I based them off of two guys that are in a band . My conscience is a more sinister , prankster version of Shawn Milke from Alesana . I have scenarios in my head where he tries to give me advice , but is always playing tricks on me.The other friend is a sweet , emotional version of Allan Cotterill from Snow White 's Poison Bite.I 've imagined my old imaginary friends getting angry with me sometimes . They get jealous I 'd say , but I created them so they 'd know I could kill them any second , but I 've chosen not to . <p> How old are you ? Male or female ? 24/female-How many imaginary friends do you have ? Too many to name . But I stick with just two named Veronykah and Joey . The ' others ' live back in Maine , but I still talk about them.How old were you when you remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created when I was about 12 ? My first imaginary friend was named Elmo and I was probably between 1 and 5 . I 'm not sure how long he continued . I tried to bring him back , but it was n't the same as when i had him as a child . Elmo originated from my obsession with Elmo lol . Give me a break , I was five . XD The second set of imaginary friends were created from my love of trains . I would name certain trains by their number . But eventually , they evolved from those trains and became human . <p> I used to have imaginary friends I created from inanimate objects . I do that now with my plushies Axel and Kaito , pretending they are talking to me and stuff.How old is/are your imaginary friend(s) ?

There have been times when I mouth things to them , but others times I can communicate telepathically with them if I 'm feeling embarrassed that they ' exist ' . Does your interaction with your imaginary friend(s) disrupt your life in any way ? Not really . They 've actually helped build my social skills . In fact , since I have no friends in real life , it fills in that gap . I can keep them a secret among the friends I do have without anyone knowing I actually have them . It pretty much fills the gap of me not having any real life friends , so I find them to be quite relieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attachment to Joey and Veronykah .

They help me through things aside from filling the gaps I have for not having rl friends . I do have my online friends , but it 's still really hard because I 'm attached to them . I think of them as my very best friends , despite them not actually being real . I know they are n't real . I know they are just a pigment of my imagination . They are merely the only thing I have as far as ' real life ' friends . I tell them everything because they help calm my nerves . They provide me with comfort of my mind and such . <p> This is the first time I 've ever told anyone in public about them .

They all stay constantly the same age , more or less ( once they had an established age , it did n't change ) . Jeremy 's around 2,000 ( I 'll explain in a minute ) and Masky 's around 25/305 .

I do hallucinate if I wake up in the middle of the night , and they 'll often be in my room doing random things , or they be the ' one who woke me up ' because they were bored . <p> Jeremy actually came about because when my mom would text me to see how things were going with my brothers , I would respond with some joke about there being a serial killer named Jeremy in the house . Jeremy became this running joke , and his personality and characteristics mellowed out with time .

Previously ( when my friends had forced me to watch Marble Hornets ) Masky had terrified me , and I had several nightmares involving him . A few months passed , and the fear of him was gone . I suddenly started getting night terrors ( and sleeping horribly ) , and my mind compensated by creating for itself a ' protector ' of sorts.Then when I would ' awake ' to a night terror , or from a bad dream , Masky would be in my room guarding me .

My imaginary friends are sixteen and have always been exactly one day younger than me , as I dubbed their birthdate to be the day after mine.5 . Mathew and Changey are female humans.6 . I interact with them in public more often than I 'd like to admit . I speak out loud to them and look in the direction I imagine them to be in , although I ca n't actually see them . I often voice their responses in a whisper to myself . I assume most people do n't think I 'm talking to an imaginary person , though I do n't think I 'd mind if they did.7 . I often go to my imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be going on in my life . They each have their own opinions that often differ from my own .

She 's a pretty blonde-haired , blue-eyed girl . She is flirty , colorful , and fun . Mathew will voice exactly what she is thinking whenever she wants . Sometimes she 'll pop up in front of me ( figuratively ) and tell me that my actions were in the wrong . Although , I typically see her as the evil one of the two . She 's the one that usually introduces me to other imaginary people . She is also the one that tries to give me more spontaneous ideas.Changey is different . She 's not fond of socializing with others and rarely encourages me to talk to " real " people .

The entire time they have been away , I have seemed to be lost . My attitude has immensely changed without having my closest friends around . They are a part of me . When I wake up from nightmares , they are there to comfort me . When I 've had a bad day , I can talk to them about it . If I ever make a mistake , they help me fix it .

He is always there if we 're going out though , and if I do , I am normally talking to him in whispers so I do n't look , well , crazy. -no , in fact quite the contary . I think both of my imaginary friends have benefitted me . They have helped me deal with loneliness and depression . <p> I have these friends as a way of escaping reality . And having someone to talk to . If it makes any difference , I have been diagnosed with Asperger 's although I do n't think I am typical to the syndrome , I am unique . I also never really had that many friends and I never go to parties or anything that often , and even less now that I have moved away from my only friend who is also my best friend I ever had . We 've recently moved to Cornwall which as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small village that is occupied by just a few old people and the tumbleweed . I was taken out of school in year eight because of severe bullying and was home schooled from then on , and now I attend a full time college course with animals . But although I do have friends there , none of them really live up to my imaginary friends . So I created them to fill a void , because without them , I constantly feel incomplete , I am missing something.Also I am learning Japanese and have been for about 3 years and never had anyone to speak to in Japanese . My best friend has a friend who is half Japanese half Scottish who I 've never met and so really I was envious because she 's not learning Japanese . Everyone around me was n't so supportive of my Japanese studies , and when I was at my nan 's I was telling her about it and she said " we do n't speak Japanese here , we speak English . " Then my brother starts learning it cos he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't get to go in the end . Everybody gave him credit for it when I was learning it first and my mum even told my friend 's mum that he was learning it , but did n't even mention that I was learning it . So it 's nice to have someone to speak to in Japanese.Yukiyashi is not really based off of anyone . I made the name Yukiyashi Sakagawa up . I do n't know if it 's a real name or not or where I got it from , but that 's what he 's called . He 's got dark black hair that is sort of emo-ish . It 's kind of like L 's hair from Death Note . It looks messy most of the time except when he takes the time to style it . He has fairly pale skin , almost the same as me . He has big , almond shaped eyes that always look like he 's smiling . And he wears amazing clothes . He likes wearing shirts that have funny motifs on them or quirky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kawaii designs or anime characters , or Japanese writing . Other than that he wears a plain t shirt or smart/casual outfits . His personality is very shy and non confrontational . He 's not that talkative although will answer questions and we will have good , intelligent conversations when he 's in a cheerful mood . Sometimes he even gives me advice . But he is always there for me when I need him . He makes me smile when I 'm happy , and cheers me up when I 'm sad . He always listens . He does n't just talk about himself all the time and go on and on and on about stupid things . He always listens to my problems and helps me through them . Sometimes we have full converstaions in Japanese , but most of the time it 's in English . He moved to Cornwall when he was 10 because his dad moved his job over here , but now his dad has kicked him out of the house because he does n't have a job and now he stays here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years now and has told me about how his dad was never there for him even when he was young . He has nowhere else to go so I said he could stay here as long as he was nice . He sleeps in my bed because he would either have to sleep in the wardrobe which is full of spiders or the floor which is hard , and we do n't have a spare bedroom . I do n't mind . He is very smart and he seems to know a lot about the world yet still regain his childlike attitude . A bit like me in a lot of ways . His favourite food is ice cream , pie , and Japanese food like sushi and ramen . He likes anime and we watch it together . He likes playing video games and he is obsessed with pacman for some reason and old school mario on the game boy . He is also afraid of the dark and of spiders . I guess , he is also kind of like an invisible boyfriend , although it has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with him or anything . But I have never had a boyfriend , and I have never met a guy like him . Most guys I know are loud , rude , cocky and show-offs and although these types of guys are funny , they are not desirable for a boyfriend . Yukiyashi is filling a void that can not be filled . He is actually quite mysterious shy and intelligent , but none of the guys at college are like that . I have pretty high standards when it comes to guys , because I am not like most girls my age who just waste their time breaking up with guys and I do n't want to deal with all that drama . I want my first boyfriend to be my last , and I want it to be a mutual bond . I 've been asked out by a guy who is nice and all , but there just is n't that " spark " . So I said we could just remain friends . But I do n't want to go out with someone just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want it to be love , that special someone who makes me feel that way . None of the guys I know make me feel that way . Yukiyashi is just like a substitute.His sister Naoki comes over sometimes from her dad 's house . She is 14 and so is n't old enough to get a job . Sometimes she gets the bus over here . She is pretty hyper and bubbly most of the time , but can be easily hurt and is also sensitive . She loves everything kawaii and cute . She always wears cute skirts and pretty shoes and pink bows in her hair . She wears shirts with Hello Kitty as well . She ca n't get enough Hello Kitty . She often borrows my clothes when she runs out of clean things to wear . She always brings them back though . She is so innocent and childlike that it brings me up on a down day . She likes cooking and drawing and reading manga . She has OCD though and ca n't touch anything dirty when she has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again after she has touched the door handle or a public train thing or something . She also is claustrophobic , vegetarian ( like me ) and she loves brocolli and carrots but she hates sprouts and garlic . She loves Jpop and she also likes Lady Gaga and stuff like that and she loves to dance . He also gets hyper on sugar which is why I think she has ADHD but she said she does n't think so that 's just the way she is and she does n't want to have any more problems . A bit like me being labelled as having " Aspergers " . I have always talked to myself out loud . I have never really been close enough to anyone to tell them absolutely anything . But when I 'm alone or even in public I 'll catch myself talking to myself out loud and sometimes do n't even realise I was doing it . Until someone points it out . I always have talked to myself . Especially in bed . I just need to get all my thoughts out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I invented my friends as a way to get those thoughts out of my head and into the open , without anyone to respond negatively . It 's like I am in control . But I guess my " friends " will be sticking around for a while unless I find someone who is at least a little like Yukiyashi , which wo n't happen where I am now . But one day I want to travel to Japan , it 's my lifelong dream , and I wo n't let anyone hold me back from my dreams . I have been told I have an overactive imagination . It 's not like I can see them but I can picture them in my mind . Anyway thanks for taking the time to read this extra long post . I did n't know that it would be this long sorry . I always get a bit carried away when I am doing creative writing . I get lost in my imagination and for one small moment , I am in control in this crazy , mad world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 31 year old female- How many imaginary friends do you have ? about 7- How old were you when you remember creating your imaginary friend(s) ? 9- How old is/are your imaginary friend(s) ? who knows ? - Are they male or female ?

These friends had helped me cope with my issues , yet they cost me many years of my life and missed opportunities to make some real friends . <p> Something I would like to toss out there since this involves the creation of imaginary friends and things . If any of you are not familiar with the terms Maladaptive Daydream , you might want to look into it . <p> It involves losing a lot of time , and even being disrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Personally , I find the creation of imaginary friends very fascinating .

For the sake of overcoming that critical voice in my head , at least . Lol <p> 1 . 17 year old male.2. 4 . Their initials are K , B , M , and N.3 . I 've had IF 's for as long as I can remember . The ones I have now came on 1/2/13 , 8/15/13 , and 12/26/13.4 . K 's 9 , B and M are 6 , and N is 10.5 . K and N are boys , and B and M are twin girls.6 . Not in a way that others can see.7 . No . <p> I 've made up a ton of information about them ; it 's as if they were real . Birthday , birth time , height , weight , BMI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handedness , personality , strengths , weaknesses ... you get the picture . I 've gone so far as to secure pictures of clothing and shoes so I could build a wardrobe for each one , and chronicle what they 're wearing each day . As you can tell , I like micromanagement . And again , they DO NOT interfere with my real life , and I never talk out loud to them , as that seems a little weird . I know , of course , that they are not real , but the more I think about that , the less real they become to me . So I try to not think about it.Everything has to be as realistic as possible for me , so every piece of info I have on them would hold up in real life . I 've complied backstories about how they came to my house , and those could also happen for real , right down to the amount of time in between events . Before I accept something as true , it must be possible in real life- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to school . The school they go to , by the way , is real , and they leave and get home at around the same time as kids who really go there.I 'm not lonely , depressed , or anything like that . I have a great family and great friends . I 've never felt alone . But I 've always had a great imagination , and ca n't stand to think of living without my imaginary siblings . <p> I came across your post and decided to give a reply.I am currently 29 years old . Female- I have one imaginary friend , but I have invented several characters whom I do not interact with . I am a short story writer with a vivid imagination. - I was 10 years old when I created my imaginary friend. - Not sure how old she is . I would take a guess at 30 . She has n't aged at all in the time that I 've known her. - Female . Human . Her name is Gracie. - I interact with her in public , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to say. - My interaction with my imaginary friend does not interrupt my life in any way . It does embarrass me if someone overhears me speaking out loud . Then I have to explain that I am only thinking out loud . <p> Here is some information just in case you want to use any for your book . I created Gracie as a result of my boredom and loneliness at school . I did not have many friends at school . If I made friends with anyone , they were usually younger . I also am the eldest of four children , and I did not get much attention growing up . My mom raised my siblings and me as a single mother . She did not talk to me or interact with me much . I was always looking for a mother figure . I invented Gracie as a result . I could speak to her anytime . She does not judge me for my faults . She openly listens . She does not speak . She communicates through emotion . She smiles if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... etc . When I was in middle school , other kids would notice me speaking to myself . They would ask about it . I was so embarrassed about it that I told them that I got tired of my imaginary friend and threw her in the trash can . From then on , I was careful only to whisper or write down my thoughts . <p> Now Gracie is there when I am alone in my bed room or driving to and from work . I talk to her almost everyday . She is not as animated now , but she still listens . Maybe one day she will disappear . Sometimes I get frustrated that she is always watching me . I tell her that she is a f***ing idiot and she needs to go away . Then I laugh about it and give her the silent treatment . <p> - How old are you ? Male or female ? 25 and female- How many imaginary friends do you have ? 2- How old were you when you remember creating your imaginary friend(s) ? 3 to 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 18 and Veronykah is 20- Are they male or female ? Are they human , animal , etc ? Both human . Joey is male and Veronykah is female. - Do you ever interact with them in public ? Sometimes , but it 's usually through telepathy. - Does your interaction with your imaginary friend(s) disrupt your life in any way ? Not really . It 's helped my social skills some and also helps my autism by providing me with ' friends ' . I ca n't really explain them very easily since it 's something I like to keep to myself . &gt;&lt; <p> I just came across this , and I guess one can say this is the first time that I have considered my companions as imaginary friends . I never really considered them as imaginary friends , only extensions of my characters or my conscience . I guess I do n't think I was ready to admit it even to myself for fear of being discovered and ostracized by those close to me . <p> Here 's goes . For the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . How old are you ? Male or female ? 30 and female2 . How many IF do you have ? I have one constant ( Griffin ) , one pet ( Wolf ) , two when I was 6 y/o , and a few on temporary rotation.3 . How old were you when you remember creating your IF ? Griffin has been around since my pre-teens . As a child I had 2 , twin brother and sisters ( Lela and Moneno . I was six , do n't judge me lol ) During the years I have had rotating ones , but they have faded as I stopped needing for them . Griffin is my constant.4 . Are they male or female ? Are they human , animal , etc ? Griffin , my constant , is a male human . As far as his age goes , I guess he 's my age . We age/grow up together . My wolf is older than I , but I do not know his name . He is secretive and stoic . The wolf finds me when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but we do not talk , although he senses my feelings.5 . Do you interact with them in public ? Only through telepathy . When at home alone I allow myself to speak out loud to Griffin , but in public I noticed I often regard him with my eyes , but catch myself.6 . Does your interaction with you imaginary friend(s) disrupt your daily life in any way ? No , not really . Sometimes I feel like I have to pull away from people so that I can be alone with him and he can help me sort me thoughts . I realize now I have made allowances for him . I recently told my husband about him , and he said that it made sense that I would have one , given the loneliness I suffered as a child .

From too much CO2 to throwing away things that can be recycled , we need to change our ways a little bit . So , here are six simple ways to be a lot more green . <p> You probably recycle already , and nearly half of Americans do . But you can take it up a notch . You can recycle your clothes , books , etc. to places that need it . Do you have some old children's/tween books you outgrew ? Give them to your local library , to a Boys and Girls Clubnear you , or a second-hand bookstore/Bookin ' It ( they just might pay you ! ) . Old clothes can go to the Salvation Army , Goodwill , or any other stores . Not too willing to give up your duds ? You can go to a Plato 's Closet to get paid for your name brands , or go to Clothing Swap to switch clothes with a friend , neighbor , or stranger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be healthy . Healthy AND Eco friendly ? Become a vegetarian or a vegan . I know what you may be thinking . You 're thinking it 's too hard , it will take to much time , etc . So , start off slow . Replace steak with fish or ( if you 're not allergic ) chicken , or some sort of white meat . Since livestock production makes up 20% of the world 's greenhouse gases , so by cutting down on meat you 're cutting down how much CO2 is produced by you . <p> liSince we 've gone into a healthy mode , have another breakthrough : go organic . It 's much easier than becoming vegetarian or a vegan ... but it can be expensive at times . BUT do not worry : there are ways to convert without coughing up the cash . Where you shop matters .

It does n't even need to be a lot of time , five or ten minutes are more than enough . This routine should start by cleaning your skin . <h> Keep it clean ! <p> For this you will need rose water , water , a cotton ball and a clean towel .

@@23757345 @3757345/ <h> Phantom of the Beast <p> " Oh , its no use . Shes so beautiful , and I 'm Well , look at me ! " - Beast , Beauty and the Beast <p> The romanticism of love triangles has always been the driving force in many forms of literature . In modern books , such as Twilight , two opposites love the same girl . The vampire , Edward Cullen , and the werewolf , Jacob Black , are drawn to Bella , a neutral force in the story . That is how most love triangles work . There is a neutral party ( the girl ) , a light side ( the handsome man ) , and the darkness ( the beast ) . Two of the most famous pieces of literature that contain love triangles are , in fact , extremely similar . These spellbinding pieces are Beauty and the Beast and Phantom of the Opera . <p> Before comparing the traits that are similar and different in the story plot , it is essential to know a little about the characters involved . In Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beast , and Gaston . Belle is a unique girl during the time frame in which she is portrayed . She is gorgeous and captivates most men , but she prefers spending her time reading a book than becoming a proper lady and wife . This is apparent throughout the French film . Even without subtitles , the strong emotions are still obvious . <p> Gaston is an easy character to describe . He is the " perfect man " ; the " pretty boy . " He is the man that all the girls want to marry , but he sets his eyes on the girl who plays hard to get . He drinks , shoots , and hunts , everything a man was expected to do at this time . His goal is to " tame " Belle so she will be a diligent housewife , when that is exactly what Belle does n't  want . However , Gaston is secure financially , good-looking , and well-respected . He is desirable , but his ego is what truly makes him ugly . <p> Beast personifies darkness . Likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite of Gaston : ugly on the outside , beautiful on the inside . In fact , Beast was turned into an ugly beast because at one point he was similar to Gaston . As time goes on , Beast believes he will be a beast forever . When Belle enters his castle , he hopes that she will love him , but his anger clouds his manners and his judgment . He falls deeply in love with Belle , but Gaston , who also wants Belle , plans to stop him . In Phantom of the Opera , the three characters that form the love triangle are Christine , Raoul , and Phantom . Christine is a girl with a fatherless past . When her father passed away , he sent her to an opera house , promising her he would send an " angel of music . " She waited , and soon a man came and taught her to sing ; she believed he was her angel of music . Soon her singing was amazing , but she still had no idea who the man was or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phantom , who wanted to be near her because he loved her . After her first solo in front of an audience , she finds her lost love and childhood friend , Raoul . Phantom , who is jealous , finally reveals himself , wearing a mask to cover his face . <p> Raoul is the light in this musical . In fact , many of the lyrics reference him as so . He is perfect , good-looking , rich , and everything else that is desirable in a man . Christine has always loved him and was happy when he decided to donate to the opera house . In the middle of all the action , he proposes to Christine , and they plan to wed . Phantom , on countless occasions , tries to kill the young lover but is unsuccessful . <p> Phantom is , of course , the darkness . He had been tortured as a child and believes that humans , in general , are evil . Once he escaped to the opera house , he made it his " artistic domain , " writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lived for the day when Christine , his only love , would sing one of the songs he wrote . He hides himself from her , hoping she will fall in love with his voice . <p> There are a few differences in the plots of the stories . In Phantom of the Opera , Phantoms singing adds to the character of Phantom . In Beauty and the Beast , there is no significant singing . In Phantom of the Opera , Phantom was born with permanent scars and hides his face throughout the musical until the end . Phantom is forced , whether he likes it or not , to live with those scars for the rest of his life . In Beauty and the Beast , Beast looks the way he does because of a magic spell , and he shows himself to Belle in the beginning . Once Belle kisses Beast , he becomes a prince again , and the ugliness disappears . While Raoul and Gaston are very similar , Raoul is compassionate and truly cares for Christine . Gaston , however , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck at home . Nevertheless , the biggest difference is the choice that the girl makes . In Phantom of the Opera , Christine chooses Raoul . In Beauty and the Beast , Belle chooses Beast . <p> As for the similarities , the characters are almost identical . The girls , Christine and Belle , are both drawn to the darkness . They love the fact that darkness is mysterious . They both learn to look past ugliness and see something beautiful . They are both portrayed as being sensual and sexy . They draw both sides of the spectrum to them : the dark side and the light side . They are equally ambitious . Christine strives for a singing career , which is helped by Phantoms musical talent . Belle does not wish to be like the other girls but prefers striving to be an educated women rather than becoming a stay-at-home mother . She discovers she can be herself when around Beast . Both girls do not really have the choice to leave until the " beast " gives them permission to do so . Christine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , Belle also fears her life , but she must serve beast as a " prisoner . " <p> The men , Raoul and Gaston , are also similar . They are handsome and have a lot of money . They both offer whatever the girl may want . They both personify light . They both fight for the girl they love and want to have her to themselves . They are quite jealous of Phantom and Beast and try to kill them on countless occasions . <p> The beasts , Phantom and Beast , are practically the same person . They both have a horrible past , filled with pain . They hide from civilization , one in a castle and one under an opera house , both of which are under their control . They both personify darkness . Phantom , in fact , sings about it in many of the musical pieces performed throughout the musical . They both love the girl from the moment they first lay their eyes on their pure and innocent faces . However , it takes them quite a while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place is because of the girls father . When Christines father dies , and she is sent to the opera house , she first hears Phantoms voice . When Belles father tries to find refuge in the castle , he is thrown into the dungeon . Belle saves him , but sacrifices herself in his place . <p> Another important similarity is the role of the rose . In Phantom of the Opera , Phantom gives Christine the rose as a sign that she had a wonderful performance . In the end , there is a rose on her grave with the engagement ring attached to it . In Beauty and the Beast , the rose is enchanted and is key to the entire plot of the story because it determines Beasts fate . If Belle falls in love with him before the last petal of the rose has fallen , than Beast will become human again . <p> An additional key similarity , once the story has ended , is the moral that the beasts learn . Christine and Belle teach them identical lessons : something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It just requires the beholder to look deeper .

@@23757356 @3757356/ <h> DSM-V : the New Way to Mental Health <p> This year , the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) released a new book , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Illness , the 5th Edition ( DSM-V ) to assist psychologists and psychiatrists all over the world in their complex process of diagnosing mental illnesses in their clients and patients . Perhaps it was harsh that before the manual had a chance , before it had been published even it received high criticism , even ridicule , from those involved in the Psychological world , and even some outside of it . <p> It was in May of this year that The Saturday Times allowed an article comparing the DSM V to another book on mental illness , saying that the DSM was an irrelevant factor that would simply not compare . The argument being that the DSM-IV-TR was sufficient for the job and what could a 5th edition to this book do . It then quite surprised me when the book was released that the reviews of the manual were indeed worse than the predictions before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers that the process for diagnosing any mental illness is complicated and measured rarely on physiological factors , signs and symptoms of mental illness can be completely ignored and so a diagnosis may not be made , or one may be made inaccurately . I do question how we can judge people on their differences in reactions when we measure their health purely on the word of mouth and the opinions of a man or woman with a certificate or five . <p> Before the publishing of the DSM V I heard rumours that the manual would render everyone as having a mental illness , and that it would severely affect those who had previously been diagnosed . An article by Michael Berger drew my attention this week . He writes about the DSM . It seems I am not alone in my view of mental illness and the diagnostic process when he describes it as a process of " inherent problems with existing systems of psychiatric classifications " and believes that we are making diagnoses in the absence of " identifiable physiological abnormalities. " , and so it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatric diagnoses . <p> However , Berger goes on to complain about the new groupings in the DSM V , including the grouping of Schizophrenia ( an arguably biological problem ) with things such as conduct disorder ( an arguable excuse ) , yet it seems that Berger seems to be arguing for a more physiological approach to mental health assessment , claiming that we can listen to symptoms of people but where do we cross the line from normality ? Should we just listen to the symptoms people tell us we could beneficially limit it down to a singular mental illness as the boundaries between one another would be crossed in just moments . Thus Berger ( and I ) would argue for a more biological approach . <p> In an article by Boyle on the biological determination of schizophrenia , she failed to find proof of it only being life experience which causes such an illness . When it is mentioned that things such as childhood abuse have played huge parts in the diagnosis of personality and mood disorders , plus just about every other mental health problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? And so perhaps Berger is right to argue for a more wholly identifiable way of approaching the diagnosis of mental illness and maybe we should put aside our guides for the symptoms of mental illness and consider more research into the use of more modern technology such as fMRI or CAT scanning to see if we can find at least a correlation between mental illness and the physiological effects it may have .

Sadly it took so long for the door staff to let people into the venue that I missed most of Flor 's set , but from the couple of songs I did catch , they had a sweet , mellow sound and I might check them out soon . As for BORNS , truthfully , he was very boring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to really get the crowd excited , and he did n't speak to the audience much . In my experience , a support act that interacts with the audience more than just playing music , reaches out beyond the music -- they get the best reactions . And that bodes well for both the audience and the band , and for the main act . <p> I was bored throughout BORNS ' set , so I was glad when he left the stage . Halsey took to the stage at approximately twenty minutes past nine , and the crowd truly lost it . Lot of teenage girls screaming . But it was nice to see ; the strong female following for a girl not much older than all of us in the audience . <p> Sweetly , a song or two into the set , she stated how the show was dedicated to Kesha , after the recent happenings in her legal battle . The girl power was truly radiating from all corners . <p> The setlist was as follows : <p> " Gasoline " <p> " Hold Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Haunting " <p> " Roman Holiday " <p> " Control " <p> " Drive " <p> " Ghost " <p> " Is There Somewhere ?

Last night was no exception . She made her way onto the stage wearing thigh-high suede boots , high-waisted glittery black shorts , and what looked to be a crop-top sweater . It was baggy and figure-hiding , but about three songs in , she left the stage again , and returned with the sweater gone -- wearing only a white bralette . The outfit felt like a statement to match the theme of her concept album , of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backdrop was something a little different .

There was also the inclusion of galaxies at some points . It was something different , and if Halsey gets to perform bigger venues in the UK at some point , it 's certainly an idea that could be expanded to be even better . But for the theme of Badlands , it blended very well , giving the visualisations needed for Halsey 's make-believe society . <p> Possibly my favourite portion of the show was the Scottish chant .

It followed her stating she could n't believe she was playing a show in Scotland , in her enchanting New Jersey accent . <p> There were moments during the show when Halsey would stop to show her gratitude , telling the crowd that she was scared a day would come when her fans think she does n't tell them she loves them enough , so she was going to tell us " every f*cking day . " <p> She also made a touching speech about people asking how she does n't get sick of the same thing every day -- getting up , going to the venue , playing a show , going to bed , repeat , and about how she has days where she feels ugly or exhausted or that she ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onstage and does n't understand how anybody could ever get sick of it . <p> I do n't see how anyone could get sick of it either , and I can see big things happening for Halsey .

The suitors are willing to atone for their sins , but that 's not enough for Odysseus . He wants revenge ; and he wants them all dead .

They pollute the air and water sources in many ways while also abusing the animals that they have there . Factory farms are farms that are similar to factories . They produce a high amount of low quality food in a short amount of time . Many animals are held in an area close together with little room for natural behavior . This also causes much waste to be condensed in one area so that it pollutes the air with a foul odor , emitting airborne dung particles , greenhouse gasses , and contaminating water recourses with toxins that can be deadly . And that is where most of Americas beef , poultry , milk , and eggs come from . <p> Factory farms also have negative affects on small farm communities . Many towns like I was born and raised in depend on family ran farms . They supply a food source and many jobs for the people living in the town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced out of business . Every week 330 farmers leave their land because of major factory farming corporations . This causes rural economies and towns to slowly fall and areas to industrialize . <p> Factory farms may have animals such as chickens , cows , and pigs . As I previously mentioned , these animals are usually all packed into a small metal room with no access to vegetation or natural light . This causes many animals to die from sickness or be smothered and trampled . A " downed animal " is an animal that is so diseased or injured that they can not stand or move on their own . These animals are not put to sleep or medically helped in any way . That would cost the company money and not make them money . While an animal can be dragged , pushed or prodded onto into the slaughterhouse , money can be made . <p> Pigs are confined in small metal or concrete cages without any bedding on the ground , sometimes these are individual , small cages that allow no room for movement .

This is where animal mutilation comes in the picture . Some factory farm employees cut off the tails of pigs so that they may not bite one anothers tails off . This is a quite painful procedure for the animal and no numbing medication is used in the process . Chickens are also sometimes mutilated in the same painful manner , but instead their beak is removed . This is so the chickens can not peck at one another or any of the factory farm operators . Naturally chickens would not harm one another or a person without being in a stressful environment or situation . <p> Now imagine being one of these poor animals .

Everyday you get up before sunrise and drive down to the industrial buildings that thousands of farm animals inhabit . You have a low wage and mean nothing to the corporation you work for . You push and prod injured animals into a slaughterhouse where their fate will be sealed . If you do n't  like this scenario either then you ought to be happy with this one . <p> You 're an average American . Every day you eat of course . And every day you fill your body with harmful chemicals found in products that are produced in factory farms . These chemicals and useless additives in the food you eat cause your calorie intake and carbohydrate intake to be sky-high . They also cause may cause you to be more tired than you should be .

When grocery shopping , make sure to have them pick up eggs that have the label " free-range " or " cage-free " eggs . These eggs are not from factory farm chickens .

@@23757377 @3757377/ <p> Soap and many store-bought products are harsh on your face , and makeup removers can be expensive and irritate the skin , often without you even realizing it . Learn how to use natural plant-based oils to remove makeup , cleanse your skin , and moisturize your face . Your skin will thank you , I promise . <h> Oil on my skin ? ! Is n't that what we 're supposed to avoid ? <p> Yes , using oil on your skin on purpose--all-natural , plant-based oils specifically . Contrary to popular belief , oil is not bad for your skin ( yes , even if your skin type is oily ) and most oils , such as olive , sunflower , and castor oil , are not inherently comedogenic ( the fancy word for " pore-clogging " ) . Imbalance of oil , however , is , and it is this imbalance which leads to unsightly skin , no matter which side of the dry/oily spectrum you fall on . <p> Your own natural oils ( also known as sebum ) are produced by what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proper working order , producing sebum without producing too much or too little , your skin is happy . But when your sebaceous glands are overactive or underactive , you end up with overly oily or overly dry skin , respectively . Many things can contribute to this imbalance , from the weather to your hormones and everything in-between , but most often the primary culprit are all those beloved skincare products we blow our money on , promising us celebrity-worthy skin in a brightly packaged bottle but never quite delivering the miracle we hoped for . <p> Often we find ourselves using these products to fight our natural oil production , leaving us with irritated , thirsty skin and causing your sebaceous glands to go into overdrive to try to compensate for all the oil we 've just stripped ( similar to how our bodies go into " starvation mood " while on a diet in an attempt to hold onto every possible nutrient ) . Our skin is subsequently even oilier than before and we get stuck in a vicious cycle . Think of your hair--when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not strip it bone-dry , and you always hear women going on about how they " do n't want to strip my hair 's natural oils " . So why do n't we want the same for our skin ? Why are we so afraid of oil when it 's on our face but not in our hair ? Let go of that fear and realize that oil is good for your skin . <h> Okay , oil does n't sound so scary anymore . But where do I start ? <p> Again , our goal is to balance our natural oil production , leading to clear , healthy skin . For those with oily skin , oil dissolves oil without stripping that which you need . For those with dry skin ( such as myself ) , oil replenishes natural moisture without clogging pores . And for those who fall somewhere in-between , using oil on your skin is still a fantastic way to remove makeup and make your skin even more beautiful and glowing . <p> Now that we got all the technical backstory out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to choose which oil you want to use . I like to use extra virgin olive oil because it 's easy to find and I 've always got some on hand for cooking anyway . A couple times a week I 'll add in a few drops of castor oil for an ultra-moisturizing but highly effective cleanser . ( Note : you do n't want to use castor oil or other super-rich oils by themselves . They 're much too thick and , ironically , can actually dry out the skin . ) Other possibilities include sunflower oil , jojoba oil , grapeseed oil , avocado oil , and many more . <p> Be aware that some oils work better for different things ( e.g. tea tree oil is great for acne , coconut oil works as a rich mositurizer , avocado oil is ideal for aging or super-irritated skin , and so on ) , so it 's good to do a little research . You can also mix and match oils to create a luxurious blend customized for your individual needs ( like how I mentioned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of oils are not comedogenic or irritating , there are a few to be avoided , namely peanut oil and wheat germ oil . And remember that if you ca n't get your hands on the more " exotic " oils or are weary about trying new things , you can never go wrong with classic extra virgin olive oil ! <h> I 've got my oil(s) picked out . What do I do now ? <p> Now that you 've got your oil , pour a very small amount of it in a small bowl , about a tablespoon . I like to heat my oil in the microwave for a short amount of time to optimize the benefits , but this is n't necessary . Next , pull your hair back and gently massage the oil into your skin with your fingertips for two minutes . Let it sit on your face for a little while ( I usually wait about twenty minutes ) . <p> After you 've let the oil soak in for a while , wash your face with very warm water , massaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To remove eye makeup , use some of the leftover oil from earlier ( because trust me , there will likely be some left over ) and massage it into closed eyes .

If the former , gently pat your skin dry ( do not rub ! ) with a clean hand towel or paper towel . If the latter , then splash your face with a little warm water and grab your favorite gentle ( or better yet , homemade ) cleanser . Wash your face as usual , being careful to gently massage your cleanser into your skin . You do not want to furiously rub it in because , as we discussed earlier , this is harsh and irritating on the skin , plus the oil has already thoroughly cleansed and exfoliated for you . Rinse your face , pat dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , massage a tiny bit of your oil into your skin . It works as not only a cleanser and exfoliater , but also as a toner and moisturizer ! ( Amazing , right ? ) <p> Your skin will be silky to the touch and instantly more clear and glowing . Replacing your usual skincare routine with this method at least once a day will give you that perfect celebrity-worthy skin , and in the long-term will also help prevent signs of aging and other unsightly skin problems . Oil can also be used on the hair and skin ( I use a coconut/castor oil blend as a full-body lotion every night ) , so do n't be afraid to explore the truly endless possibilities for a more beautiful you !

If you feel like you 're wearing the same hairstyle every single day and want to easily and quickly change that , here are five suggestions . They do n't  require any sort of skill , like knowing how to do a complicated braid , and you only need basic hair accessories to do them . Though I will refer to ponytails a lot , you can achieve most of these looks while having short hair too . All of these ideas are very simple and do n't  take much effort or time to do , but will still give you a different and nice look . <h> The Fringe Bob <p> All you need to create this look ( pictured on the left ) are two bobby pins .

You can do anything from twisting lots of small sections of hair to twisting just one large section . Try spicing up a ponytail or bun by twisting some small sections on the side to help your hair look not so flat . Again , you may need to experiment a bit before you know how much hair being twisted looks good , and how much is too much . <h> The Accessory <p> It can be quite cheap to accessorise your hair . Invest in a simple headband ( no huge bows or flowers ) that goes with most of the colours you wear so you can frequently put it on and make your hairstyle a little different .

You could even try a zigzag part to give your hairstyle some edge and see if you suit it . Another good change to do is to sweep all of your hair back off your face , creating no part . This may require some sort of product to hold it in place if you do n't  usually style your hair like this . <h> The Face Clip-Back <p> If you have issues with hair always falling across your face , then you can stylishly clip it back .

While earlier emo acts focused on darker and painful topics , Carrabba focused more on love , love lost , and angst . While this newer music was " emotional " , it drew far more attention from teenagers . Major labels looking to captialize on the sucess of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional , began seeking out similar bands to sell under the " emo " term . <p> At the same time , the word emo inexplicably expanded beyond a music genre , to mean strong displays of emotion .

With all the confusion and , yes , emotion that surrounds the word , it is hard to tell where it will end up next . As is evident everywhere , the term has been bastardized and turned into a false label , associated with young people who glamorize issues such as death and depression , and a uniformed fasion sense . <p> You can pick an " emo " out of a crowd of people , but you 'd be hard pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . There is no such thing as an emo person , and this is all just a passing fad . As with all fads , this one will die out .

@@23757394 @3757394/ <h> The History of Rock n ' Roll <h> Origin <p> Rock ' n ' roll did n't  just emerge out of an abyss of awesome- it has its roots like any other musical genre . Starting in the late 1940s , the upbeat Chicago style blues began to fuse with African American R&amp;B rhythms to create something totally new and provacative . Some of the earliest rock artists did n't  write their own songs at first , they covered old blues songs and added their own special rock touches to them . The term " rock ' n ' roll " actually came into being a few decades before the music . The phrase was first used in a song by Trixie Smith , titled " My Baby Rocks Me With One Steady Roll . " It was slang at the time for dancing , and " roll " was used as a verb that was synonymous with sex . <p> At first , rock was an underground attraction , fairly exclusive to African Americans . A disc jockey from Cleveland , Ohio helped to change this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , white teenagers were frequently buying African American rhythm and blues albums in record stores . He began to market this music as rock n roll on the radio . Not only did he knock down racial blockades , but he also helped rock achieve mainstream success that it had n't  seen before . Freed was also responsible for setting up some of the first rock concerts . <h> Rock in the 1950s <p> Depending on your source , what the first rock record actually was will vary . Regardless of what the first album was , the 1950s was the decade that rock 's popularity soared . Racial discrimination issues were becoming apparent in the United States more than ever during the 1950s , and rock was defying the separation . It mixed multiple cultures , and there was a strong demand for it . <p> Rock had a major social impact on the world during the 1950s . Rock lyrics were much more suggestive and politically charged than other genres , and the teenage population couldnt get enough of it . The music motivated them to rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental view that " children should be seen and not heard " . Rock 's ambitious attitude offended some parents , and caused them to view it as something dangerous . Hollywood culture used this generation gap to their advantage , and created documents " exposing " rock music . It captured the interests of teenagers , while at the same time shocking parents . <p> Almost as soon as rock music emerged , it broke apart and became stylized . Rockabilly was a popular style of rock during the 1950s . Rockabilly has its roots in country , blues , and swing , essentially all the genres popular before rock . Country music has always been closely associated with blues , especially during the 1950s . So when rockabilly began to appear as a musical style its no surprise that it appealed to many country fans and helped with the negative image rock music developed . At first the term " rockabilly " was viewed as a derogatory term , however it began to gain respect throughout the 1950s . This particular genre tended to appeal to a wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would later go on to influence the surf rockers of the 1960s . <p> One well known rockabilly artist was Elvis Presley , now known as " the King " of rock . He brought the style of ambitious guitar mixed in with the twang of slapped bass rhythms to the mainstream , and it was the new rage . Elviss style of singing and dancing energized his fans and kept the rock movement growing . When Elvis 's first single , " Thats All Right , " was released by Sun Studios in July of 1954 , radio stations around the Memphis began to circulate the song , and it became an instant hit locally . By December , it was being played all over the country , and Elvis became an icon . Elvis then went on in his career to explore many genres outside of rockabilly and became the most popular rock artist of his time . <h> Rock in the 1960s <p> Drugs , sex , and rock n roll often get associated with each other , and we can credit that to 1960s rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in the 1950s , but that was largely unknown to the public until the 1960s . It was then , due partly to the growing press surrounding rock music that musicians drug and alcohol use became public . Band groupies began to break onto the rock scene , and wild stories would fly around in gossip columns about the crazy encounters they had with rock stars . <p> Garage rock began to creep onto charts during the 1960s . The genre was noted for having low quality recordings and simple production . It also tended to be a more underground genre , which makes it difficult to pinpoint an exact starting time . Some garage rock did make charting positions ; one of the first was the single " Tall Cool One " by The Wailers in 1959 . From then on , garage rock began to develop all over the nation in many cities . Paul Revere and the Raiders were one of the first in a series of 60s garage bands to have successful hits . Garage rock is often credited for setting the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a key role in molding the sound of garage rock . Bands like the Kinks , The Yardbirds , and the Rolling Stones all had a more defined rock sound , yet still with a hint of blues that greatly appealed to the garage rockers . As the decade progressed on , more and more garage bands began to form . It was a short lived explosion however , and by early 1968 the genre had left mainstream charts . New genres had entered the scene . <p> Perhaps one of the most memorable events of rock during the 1960s was Woodstock 1969 . The atmosphere of the rock festival is a very good representation of the 1960s hippie culture . Over 500,000 people were in attendance . The overall attitude of the festival was very bohemian , particularly the clothing . All kinds of monumental artists played including The Grateful Dead ( who experienced technical issues while they performed ) , The Who , Jimi Hendrix , and Sha-Na-Na . <p> Drug use also seemed to be a big part of 60s rock , and that trend never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bands as a musical enhancement . It was said that if you were ever at a Grateful Dead concert where you could not easily access LSD , then something was terribly wrong . Psychedelic rock went as far as to try and imitate the effect of drugs . Lyrics typically revolve around something that is n't tangible , like dreams or feelings . Psychedelic rock also used the latest technology to alter sounds with different distorting methods . Keyboards were used a lot more in this type of rock than in others . Album covers often tended to be more creative and abstract than other genres , where a simple band name and album title was sufficient . The famous LP cover for Sgt Peppers Lonely Heart Club Band by the Beatles revolutionized artwork in the music industry , giving way to the exciting artwork we see on albums today . <p> Cannabis was soon to follow the psychedelic drugs , and when the Beatles acknowledged they used it , the stigma attached to marijuana seemingly vanished from the rock community . Drugs and rock by the late 1960s seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It still was n't acceptable to the older generation , and the youth was still overwhelmed with it . However , when the drugs began to take a toll on many rock stars awareness rose of how dangerous they could be . <h> 27 Club <p> Of all clubs for a rock star to be a member of , this is not one you would want to end up in . The age 27 seems to be jinxed for rock stars . A series of deaths among prominent rock stars have occurred at the age of 27 . The cause of death varies from person to person , however drug use seems to be a factor affecting the majority of those involved . The 5 most famous members are Brain Jones , Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin , Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain . The series of deaths starting with Jimi Hendrix and ending with Kurt Cobain made some rock stars rethink their destructive lifestyles , but obviously not all of them . <p> Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones was only 27 when he died on July 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming pool , and the cause of death was stated as " Death by Misadventure " . His liver and heart were severely enlarged and damaged by heavy drug and alcohol abuse . <p> Jimi Hendrix was another tragic loss for rock , who died on September 18 , 1970 . His destructive lifestyle during the 1960s also lead to his death at the young age of 27 . The circumstances of his death are not completely understood . However , the popular theory states that after consuming 9 sleeping pills , he passed out and asphyxiated on his own vomit . <p> Janis Joplin was one of the most influential female rockstars in history , and her influence is still felt today . She was the lead singer of the band Big Brother and the Holding Company , and she also had a solo career . She was found dead in a hotel room in Hollywood on October 4 , 1970 . The cause of death was a heroin overdose mixed with whiskey . <p> Jim Morrison is known all over the world for the sensational and monumental work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jim had used and abused illegal substances before . What makes his death especially sad is that during his stay in Paris he was attempting to become clean , and get rid of his addictions . However , his plan was n't working out and he was dealing with depression . All of these factors contributed to his death on July 3 , 1971 . The official cause of death was heart failure . Drug use is often speculated as a factor by fans . <p> One of the more recent additions to the 27 Club is Kurt Cobain . Kurt was more than famous for his work with Nirvana , which is one reason for his death . Those close to Cobain speculate he never enjoyed all of the fame that the mainstream success Nirvana created . Prior to his death , he had been confronted about his hardcore drug abuse , and had agreed to attend a rehab program . However , he left the rehab facility and went missing . He was found April 8 , 1994 . The autopsy report cites the cause of death as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated date of death is April 5 , 1994 . <h> Rock in the 1970s <p> The staple sound of the mainstream 1970s was arena rock , pioneered by bands like the Rolling Stones and the Beatles . Arena rock typically was a little harder than other genres of rock , but it certainly was n't heavy metal . Vocals werent as aggressive as the actual music of the songs were , but the juxtoposition worked well together . The Beatles performance at Shea Stadium in 1965 was the beginning of the stadium show era , which would eventually become a part of casual , mainstream rock culture . Arena rock continued to grow out of the 1960s and into the 1970s at a rapid pace . Progressive rock and metals increased popularity were selling out more and more venues . <p> Heavy metal also reached the mainstream rock scene during the 1970s . Heavy metal originated from blues and psychedelic rock , though it can be hard to see those roots because of the dramatic variation . Bands like Black Sabbath , Judas Priest , and Led Zeppelin paved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a successful genre . The media was critical of this new style , often degrading it and not even considering " that noise " to be music . During the late 1970s , heavy metal record sales began to go down , with new genres like punk and disco taking over the charts . However , it did n't  disappear entirely , and it influenced many people who would form glam bands during the 1980s . <p> In an initially underground environment , punk rock also saw its beginning during the 1970s ; however protopunk had been developing since the late 1960s with bands like MC5 , and other bands in Britain . The driving force behind punk rock has always been rebellion . Some of the pioneers of the genre have stated that what motivated them was the desire to be different than the typical rock band of the 1960s , and wanted to go back to more of a garage rock style . With bands like the Clash , The Sex Pistols , and The Ramones coming over from Britain , the underground rush in America was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intended for a totally different style of music ( CBGB stands for " Country , Blue Grass and Blues ) , but it quickly became the hot spot for punk acts to play . Punk started out as an East coast sensation in the United States , but when the Sex Pistols toured the United States , they spread their music . This lead to the California punk scene being created , spawning bands like the Dead Kennedys and Black Flag . <p> From punk rock came the new wave sensation . Unlike punk bands , the new waves bands tended to have more success with radio hits , probably because the punk bands really did n't  care to make their songs radio-friendly . Record label executives loved bands like this , because they did not oppose being successful , and they had punk rock roots . Bands like the Police fronted the new wave movement . During the 1980s , the new wave movement began to shift in another direction . The term began to apply to bands that were more the synthetic-pop genre , and not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided a great market for the more popish bands , while the new wave rock bands began to fall into other genres . <h> Rock in the 1980s and Onwards <p> During the 1980s , rock began to split into many different genres ; and they were all popular , causing the rock scene to faction . Prior to the 80s , it seemed genres raised and fell in popularity . When something new came along , the old left . That was n't the case in the 1980s . Old artists were examined again , and new ones were everywhere . The development of music oriented media helped this , as there was more room in the spotlight for variety . <p> One of the biggest phenomenons of the 80s were the glam metal , hair bands . M+tley Cr++e was a fronting band of the new glam scene and one of the first to get mainstream success . Glam bands were famous for their image ; sky high teased hair , make up and eye catching clothing . MTV couldnt get enough of bands like this , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocative videos lured in many viewers to watch them . Some of the early glam metal albums like Twisted Sisters Stay Hungry and Quiet Riots Metal health molded and set the stage for what music would be like throughout all the 80s . Even the older heavy metal bands began to use characteristics of this genre in their music . During the mid 80s , to major types of glam metal existed . The " pop " metal , with bands like Europe and their hit " The Final Countdown " . The LA based metal scene formed the other genre , with bands like Poison successfully emerging from the popular metal clubs on Sunset Strip . Europe also experienced a glam metal sensation , later in the 1980s , with bands like The Cult getting heavy MTV rotation and radio airplay . <p> Alternative rock was an alternative to glam metal in the 1980s , and there really was no way to define this style of music . Any band that did n't  fit into other mainstream genres could be classified as alternative rock . Bands like R.E.M . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainstream , and it became particularly popular in the 1990s , with the rising popularity of grunge . Grunge originated from the northwestern coast of the United States , mainly in the Seattle region . Influences of the genre vary from band to band . Bands like Pearl Jam cite punk rock as an inspiration , while bands like Soundgarden were influenced quite a bit by metal . Grunge would hit the mainstream when Nirvanas album Nevermind was released in 1991 . <p> With the death of Kurt Cobain , grunge began to lose its appeal to some people , and a new genre was needed to satisfy their musical cravings . This provided a great opportunity for pop punk to rise to the mainstream . Mixing elements of underground punk rock with a lighter mainstream pop sound proved to be a favorite among rock fans and the genre quickly became popular . 1994 was the defining year for this genre , with the release of the albums Smash by the Offspring , and Dookie by Green Day . Capitalizing on those bands ' popularity , many other smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as NOFX , Rancid and the Smoking Popes . <p> Grunge did n't  die entirely like some people assumed that it did , post grunge bands kept it alive . Post grunge tended to be more suited for radio airplay than other previous grunge music , known for its somewhat basic guitar riffs and powerful vocals . One of the earlier , mostsuccessful post-grunge albums was the Foo Fighters self titled album . This was when the term " post-grunge " began being used . This is partly because 2 members of the Foo Fighters had been involved with Nirvana , so the term post-grunge seemed appropriate . Many female artists were popular in the post-grunge scene , including Alanis Morrisette and Fiona Apple . <p> The 1990s also saw nu metal begin to reach popularity with bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers ( who would explore multiple genres throughout their career ) , Korn and Kid Rock . Musically , the guitar in nu metal is similar to that of thrash metal , focusing on rhythmic beats without the use of complicated patterns of chords . The drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tool has been sited by many bands as a vocal influence . The genre began to widen as it grew in popularity , allowing an alternative metal movement in music to occur . Ross Robinson was a pioneer of nu metal , and later in his career he became involved with the post-hardcore movement , which gave rise to current bands such as Falling Reverse and Pierce the Veil . <p> Recently , a garage rock revival movement has been underway . Back to basics rock began to make a comeback with bands like the White Stripes , the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Jet producing popular radio singles . A more dramatic , emotional style of music has hit the mainstream , although the genres name is often disputed . Emo tends to be the popular term , however certain people find this to be a degrading phrase . Emotional hardcore is another acceptable name . This genres roots can be traced back to the late 1980s , originating in the Washington D.C. music scene , and in New Jersey as well . However , not many bands ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands like Sunny Day Real Estate during the late 1990s helped to reintroduce the genre . Bands such as Samiam began to use the DC scene style in California , which influenced many modern bands like Taking Back Sunday . The term emo is thrown around a lot when labeling bands , and the actual definition of the genre varies based on what your source is and your geographic area . Bands that sound absolutely nothing alike all somehow seem to end being grouped together , which is a result of the musical faction phenomenon beginning in the 1980s . According to some , the lyrical content or fashion defines the genre . This really is n't a very logical way to categorize music , but it seems to be how its working for this genre . <p> As long as musicians exist who want to challenge social standards , create unique songs , and alter music as we know it , rock will continue to grow , develop and expand as it has done in the past . From the earliest , practically ancient pioneers of the late 1940s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or group has done something to allow this eccentric genre to keep its place in the history of music , and influence devoted fans all over the world .

@@23757417 @3757417/ <h> Da Vinci To Be Exhumed <p> Scientists and historians of Italy 's National Committee for Culture and Heritage are appealing to the French government to exhume the remains of Renaissance man Leonardo da Vinci in order to determine whether or not his famous Mona Lisa is in fact a self-portrait in disguise . <p> The appeal to French cultural officials and the owners of the Amboise Chateau , da Vinci 's final resting place , has received preliminary permission and is expected to get the final go-ahead by summer . <p> The Italian team will use miniature cameras and electro-magnetic ground-penetrating radar to produce images of the underground space to confirm the presence of bones . After that , says Silvano Vincenti , head of the Italian team , the first step of the project will be to ensure that the bones are truly da Vinci 's . A sign next to the tomb informs that the remains are only " presumed " to be those of the artist . Carbon dating and DNA samples of the bones and teeth compared to male descendants of those in Bologna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's skull still in tact so that a virtual , and eventually a physical , reconstruction of his face may be created . The recreation is to be done by Francesco Mallegni , an anthropology professor specializing in reconstruction , who has reconstructed many other famous Italian faces , including Dante ( Dante 's Inferno ) . <p> The exhumation will also reveal the cause of da Vinci 's death . " There are n't any clues in history books " , Vincenti stated , " but we 'll be able to find out if Leonardo died of a disease such as syphilis or tuberculosis , because that shows up in the bones . " The bones could also establish whether da Vinci died of lead poisoning due to exposure to toxic pigments , as many painters of the time did . <p> The theory that inspired the appeal came from American art expert Dr. Lillian Schwartz , who found similarities between the Mona Lisa and and 1515 self-portrait of the artist . After superimposing the two , Schwartz found that the facial features aligned perfectly . The true identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but scholars enthusiastic about the find , presume that da Vinci 's suspected homosexuality and love of riddles led him to paint himself in drag . <p> Scholars not swayed by the new theory have concurred that the sitter for the Mona Lisa was Lisa Gherardini , wife of rich Florentine silk merchant Francesco Giocondo . When one looks at the Mona Lisa 's real name , La Gioconda , this seems likely . Da Vinci 's mother and an androgynous lover were also presented as possible sitters . <p> Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci died May 2 , 1519 at the age of 67 , after becoming " first painter " to King Francis I of France . The monarch ordered the painter to be buried in the church of his summer retreat , Saint Florentine at Amboise Castle in France 's Liore Valley . After the destruction of Saint Florentine during the French Revolution of 1789 , da Vinci was moved to the castle 's smaller chapel , Saint Hubert , where he lies today .

@@23757422 @3757422/ <h> How to Write Contractions Properly <p> It is easy to make a mistake when writing contractions , and quite a few users on Mibba seem to not know how to write them correctly . There is an easy way to remember it , though . If there is an apostrophe , you have to be able to break the word up into two words . Also keep in mind that programs like Word wont always correct you properly , so its much better to just know what word means what so you can fix it yourself . So , here are some examples that people tend to get confused about to further clarify how to use contractions . Remember , just because they sound the same , does n't  mean they mean the same thing . <h> Its or Its ? <p> " Its " is a possessive word . For example , " The cat licked its paw. " the paw belongs to the cat . If you can replace the " its " with " his/her " , then you 're using the right form . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , " Its time to feed the cat . " which can also be written as " It is time to feed the cat . " This " its " can not be replaced by other possession words ( like his/her ) because they mean something different . <h> Your or Youre ? <p> " Your " is the possessive word , just like " its " was in the sentences above . For example , " Your cat licked its paw. " the cat belongs to you . <p> " Youre " means " you are " . For example , " Youre feeding the cat today . " which can also be written as " You are feeding the cat today . " Note how this one can be expanded ( because of the apostrophe ) , but the sentence above can not . <h> Let 's or Let 's ? <p> " Let 's " is a form of the verb " to let " , as in " he/she/it let 's " . Therefore , it is used as " John let 's his cat sleep on his bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's " means " let us " . For example , " Let 's go and pat the cat . " which can also be written as " Let us go and pat the cat . " Note how these two formations of the verb " to let " are not interchangeable . <p> Take some time to think when you 're writing and proofreading . You would n't miss out the apostrophe for " I 'm " , would you ? " Im " would just be weird . Just remember this one simple rule : if you can expand the word into two separate words , put an apostrophe in . <h> Author 's Note : If you have any other grammar points youd like to be cleared up , post a comment ( on this tutorial or on my profile ) and I 'll do a tutorial on it .

Try to fix this ! " <p> Here 's an example of destructive criticism : " This story is really awful . You do n't even know how to use correct sentences ! " <p> Do you see the difference ? If not , let me try and explain . Constructive criticism is still criticism ; do n't expect it to be all happy and make you smile . But it is meant to help you as an author and fix your writing mistakes . Embrace it , because it 'll help you ! Destructive criticism is different because whoever is dishing it out has no intention to help you improve whatsoever .

Listen to constructive criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet , even if you know the differences between the two , and even if you know not to listen to destructive criticism , you will need to listen to constructive criticism . So ... how do you deal with it ? What should you do ? How should you feel ? <p> Here are the steps to dealing with constructive criticism : <h> Step One <p> Do n't close up or get defensive when you see a comment that contains constructive criticism . Ponder over what they have to say . Check your writing and see whether you agree with what they 've pointed out or not . Do n't become angry or stubborn to change your writing ! It may simply be an honest mistake on your part . In the end , you 'll be glad that they pointed it out . <h> Step Two <p> Figure out what they are telling you to fix or change . If it 's just a grammatical error , simply change it and move on . But if it 's something you are unsure whether to change or leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple sources . Is the commenter correct , or are you ? Once you find out , you 'll have a better idea on how to fix your mistake and why you made it in the first place . <h> Step Three <p> Fix the mistake(s) to your best ability . Make sure everything is grammatically correct and sounds good , then re-post the chapter . If you 're still unsure about whether you changed it correctly or not , contact a fellow writer or friend and have them look it over for you . Be confident about your changes ! <h> Step Four <p> But what if your mistake is n't just something you can change without causing problems ? Say you receive a comment about how your character is unoriginal or that your plot is cliche . You ca n't just change it easily like a spelling error ! One thing you can do if this occurs is to message the commenter who pointed out this flaw . Ask them how they would fix it . They 're the one who noticed , after all , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are still unsatisfied and worried about your story , do n't panic . Just keep writing . You do n't have to go back and change everything if you 're too far along , but if you 're only a couple chapters in ... then sure , go for it ! Do what you think is best . <h> Step Five <p> Be thankful for the constructive criticism . Some people believe that it is a negative thing . Although it points out flaws , constructive criticism is not negative ! If you never receive any constructive criticism , your writing will not improve . Or it will improve much much more slowly . Thank the commenter for their thoughts and the time they took to help you out . Be pleasant about it , because they 've done you a favor , not a misdeed.

Whichever reason they 're in your stories , however , they should all conform to some basic concepts , as described below . <h> Children Talking Like Children <p> This may be just me , but if I 'm reading a story that has a kid who is speaking in a way that seems too advanced , I assume that I 'm either reading a parody , the child speaking is a genius , or it 's some half-human/half-vampire creature in a certain teen vampire romance novel . If it 's none of the preceding , or not intentional , then you need to make sure the child speaking sounds like a child . Most kids do n't usually have very advanced vocabularies or speak using very complex sentence structure . It 's important that the child 's way of speaking matches their age or level of education . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's age not the same as you , the writer . You did n't sound the same when you were five or three , and neither should the children in your stories . When writing dialogue for your child characters , try to think of children you 've encountered in real life or on television . Think about how they form sentences and the level of words they use . A little research , if you 're unfamiliar with children , can go a very long way . <h> Children Being Knowledgable as Children <p> Similar to vocabulary and how your young character speaks , the age of your character should have some sort of effect on how much they know . Think of what you knew at that age ( the age of your characters ) , especially when dealing with character 's thoughts in narration and conclusions your young character may draw from the words and actions of others . While a three year old may notice that their parents are acting differently , a three year old may not be able to discern exactly why that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb down your character either . A ten year old may be more attuned to the actions of their parents than you might think . An eleven year old would n't be completely clueless about more " adult " topics like sex or even drugs . When deciding on what your young character should and should n't know , try to draw from real life and your past experience of a child that age . It 'll help your story be much more realistic and believable . <h> Children Behaving Like Children <p> Once you 've mastered dialogue , you have to attack mannerisms . There are , quite simply , things kids like and do not like doing . For example : children under five are very prone to tantrums . Consistently writing a child who is quiet , never complains , and always does what they are told , leads me to hope that you have some brilliant subplot about them being a robot or similar being . Otherwise , something is wrong .

If a child is in the room , it is n't likely that they are just standing in the background quietly . They play with toys or friends , they play pretend , they make noise , they knock into things or knock things over , they scream and they sometimes cry . The presence of a child can rarely go unnoticed , especially by a parent . Even when a child may not be the point of focus , if you make them present in the scene , be sure to acknowledge them more than once with a mention ( even if it is a small one ) . <p> The final check in the behavior of children is physical action . In a normal situation , children do not outrun cars . They do n't cook three course meals on their own .

On Mibba the most common way to write dialogue is by using quotation marks ( " " ) but it is also alright to write dialogue in script form if the entire story is in script form . <p> Dialogue in script form would be : <p> Anna : I 'm really angry with her . <p> Unless writing a script , this method should not be used , and instead it should be : <p> " I 'm really angry with her , " Anna said . <p> When writing dialogue which is followed by tags ( he/she said , etc ) a period is not used , but instead switched out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , but the following sentence is NOT capitalized .

@@23757433 @3757433/ <p> I think that after doing all of this , I have that much more respect for Pokemon hackers , especially ones who redesign the entire game like the makers of the Ruby Destiny series did . Hacking Pokemon games is definitely not an easy task at all , but it sure is awfully fun . Or , at least , I 'm finding it awfully fun . I started to learn how to do this last night when I was taking to someone about the program Advance Map and they recommended I try it out , especially since I have a habit of playing Pokemon hacks and get lost during a lot of them . Eventually I 'm planning to write a blog about all of the Pokemon roms I 've played but I need to complete them first off . <p> So I looked up a tutorial on Youtube just to figure out exactly what Advance Map was and what it was used for , I found out it was a hacking program . Advance Map , in the simplest terms I can think of , allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can alter towns and routes , you can even alter the inside of buildings . You can add events and take away events . You can add or change the wild Pokemon that appear in said area . It 's really interesting . I 'll show you screen shots of my " renovations " in a bit , but be warned that they are very terrible . I 'm not a good designing of Pokemon if I do say so myself . <p> After downloading Advanced Map and playing around with it for a while , I decided to look into more hacking tools for Pokemon . I came across a program called Advanced Starter . Advanced Starter is a fairly easy program and much less complicated than Advanced Map . What Advanced Starter does is allow you to change your starter and the rival 's starter . But I guess it only changes your rival 's starter for your first battle , because the second time I battled him , he did n't have the Luvdisc I assigned him anymore . But you get to keep your starter when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that below . <p> After figuring out Advanced Starter , I downloaded a third program called Advanced Trainer . Advanced Trainer is like the middle difficulty . It 's harder than Advanced Starter but much easier than Advanced Map . What Advanced Trainer does is allow you to control and manipulate the trainers in the game , I 've been told you can even add new trainers but I have yet to figure out how to do that . You can change the trainers ' names , class , Pokemon , their Pokemon moves , how much they pay you , their sprite , etc .. You can change everything about the trainer if you want to . Again , I 'll show you screen shots of those changes later . <p> This is a lot of fun , though I 'm probably having way too much fun with doing this but whatever . I 'm enjoying this . I learned how to use those three programs all in like three hours last night when I could n't sleep , I did all of this at like 3am because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go looking for more hacking tools ( because I know for a fact there are more ) tonight . I really want to find a good scripting program so I change what people say . I downloaded PokeScript but every time I try to load a rom into it , PokeScript freezes up on me so I think I need a different scripting program than that one . <p> Before I go on , I want to stress three things if any of you decide to try Pokemon hacking .... 1 . always have a back up of your rom . Something could go wrong that is unfixable and you 'll want to have a back up for the rom you hacked so you wo n't lose all your data.2 . Scan everything you download . If you were n't aware , the Internet is a dangerous place and fraught with viruses . Everything I have downloaded has been safe , but I ca n't guarantee you will get the downloads from where I did . So scan them first and make sure they do n't have a virus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only get out when you open the file . Do n't be stupid and open a file from the Internet you did n't scan first , scan everything . Better safe than sorry . If you do n't have a virus protector , then download at your own risk . It 's your own fault if you get a virus.3 . Periodically save your hack changes . It 's like writing a story on Microsoft Word , something could go wrong with the program and if you 're not periodically saving , you will lose all your work . So make sure to save every few minutes . <p> Let 's show screen shots now , shall we ? I 've only played up to Dewford Town but I 'll only use screen shots up until Rustboro just to prevent this blog from getting too long . <p> That is one of the first things I altered , which explains why it looks so awful . It 's May 's room . I originally put in pink carpet , but the pink carpet looked real tacky . So does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . But yes , May 's room looked awful after I got through with it . Moving on to ... Littleroot Town ! <p> I covered it in flowers , grass , and gave it a puddle . ( n+p+-p+- ) It lacked in the " green " department , it needed more flowers . But I think I may have went overboard with the flowers . n+n+p+n+n+ There is no Pokemon in the grass , I was going to go back and add some but I thought it would glitch the game . And , as I promised , I 'll show a screen shot of what I did with Advanced Starter . As I said , Advanced Starter is a very simple program that does n't do much . I changed the starters to as following ... <p> Mareep , Eevee , and Beldum . As I mentioned , I gave my rival a Luvdisc just because Luvdisc sucks and I thought it 'd be funny for him to get stuck with one . I ended up choosing Mareep because I want to see what Ampharos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do love Ampharos . By the way , if you 're wondering why the Pokemon look like little girls , it 's because I hacked a hack . The hack I hacked is called " Moemon Emerald " , it replaces the Pokemon sprites with little anime girl sprites known as " moes " . <p> This is Petalburg , covered in tall grass . No Pokemon though , this was before I learned how to add wild Pokemon to the grass . Not much to say about Petalburg other than I found it funny . <p> I made it snow in Rustboro and put kids in the fountain . Kids in the fountain was actually very unintentional , I did n't even know there were sprites meant to be standing there when I built a fountain over there . But it was a pretty nice outcome . I also added grass where you can find the Eeveelutions .... But no Eevee . I forgot to add Eevee . Oops . Now , if you go to Route 4 ( the route before Rustboro ) you will see ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty much all . Now let 's get into some screen shots for Advanced Trainer . For this , I used Roxanne and altered her . I changed her sprite , name , how much money you can earn , and her Pokemon . Instead of just three , she now has six Rock-types . Most are level 12 or 13 except for her Nosepass which is 14 . <p> There is Roxanne , now as a little girl named Roxie with six Pokemon . I also took away the two potions she had and took away the Oran Berry her Nosepass held just because I did n't want to deal with that crap . I really only edited Roxanne just to show you guys what Advanced Trainer can do . <p> I almost want to write tutorials on how to hack Pokemon games , but I do n't know if the admins would appreciate that or that 's even allowed . I do n't know , would it be okay to write a tutorial on hacking ? There 's not a specific rule against it but ... I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After I finish figuring out how to hack GBA games , I plan to try and see if there is a way to hack DS games because it 'd be fun to fuck around with Johto , Sinnoh , and Unova .

It depends on the person who has the disorder . <p> Information on this subject has still yet to grow . Hopefully , more people get informed on what self-injury really means , and not just the more ' popular ' forms of it . Most people tend to be hypocritical about self-injury and not give a care to the people and their families who suffer from this disorder . But this disorder is a metal disorder . Just like autism , phobias , bipolar disorder , dementia , OCD , and substance related disorders . It 's a disorder that is not being taken seriously because of the media coverage and is slowly worsening .

@@23757443 @3757443/ <h> Is it Right to Hit Children as Punishment ? <p> After watching an episode of Supernanny ( USA ) , my mother and I discussed the parental spankings and whether or not it was okay for parents to hit their children as a form of discipline . The programme ( Supernanny ) features professional nanny Jo Frost , who devotes each episode to helping struggling families , in which the parents have difficulty with child rearing . In the particular episode I watched , the parents of four children had resorted to corporal punishment . Frost is strictly opposed to corporal punishment especially spanking and noticed during her observation that the mother was giving mixed messages , while the father had trouble controlling the children . <p> In the United Kingdom , corporal punishment is only prohibited in schools and not in the home . As a punishment for something as small as answering back to a teacher to something large as skipping school , children used to receive the cane , slipper , belt and possibly whatever a teacher could get their hands on ( as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head for not being able to play the recorder , due to a disability ) . A child would be struck either across the hand , buttocks or the seat of the trousers . This was outlawed by Parliament in 1987 , but was n't banned in private schools until 1999 in England and Wales , 2000 in Scotland , and 2003 in Northern Ireland . <p> The issue that I feel there is with hitting children is that they may be given the wrong message from their parents . Referring back to that episode of Supernanny , the parent may tell the child that they love them , hit them , and then tell them that they love them then again . This may confuse the child , as they may think that they may be able to disobey their parents again but know that they will be punished for their actions . <p> Many people feel that corporal punishment is cruel and see it as a form of child abuse , resulting in different methods of punishment being used , i.e. time outs and being sat upon the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may be because parents despair to see their children hurt and would not want to hurt them themselves . <p> However , others feel that corporal punishment is necessary to an extent as it teaches children the different between right and wrong . Also , children learn from their experiences and may learn to not defy their parents commands after being spanked . <p> In conclusion , I personally think that parents should not use corporal punishment in their household and should enforce different methods of discipline . However , I also feel that corporal punishment should be used to an extent , for example , only when a child is still learning how to behave , rather than when the child is in their teenage years . This is a subject that will continue to be questioned and debated , with many people having different opinions .

@@23757452 @3757452/ <p> Right now is one of those rare moments that I am just completely ashamed with a decision my city has made . Before I explain what happened , let me explain what California law on spanking is . According to State law , spanking is legal as long as you do n't seriously injure your child physically or mentally . So yes , spanking is legal here as long as you do n't actually injure your child too badly . <p> In San Francisco back in April , a father was arrested on suspicions that he abused his daughter . His daughter had been stealing from her teacher and in response to her actions , her father beat her with a belt so hard that he left bruises on her . The next day , she went to school and confided in a teacher about what her father did . The teacher did exactly what they should have , which was calling the police and reporting it . After getting the call , the police arrested the girl 's father and he went to court for child abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't abuse his daughter and was just being a " good dad " when he beat her with a belt . The father did confess to hitting his child with a belt for stealing and did admit he bruised his child . <p> What the jury did really does make me feel ashamed . I ca n't even believe a jury from this city would say it 's okay for a person to beat their child as a form of discipline . I ca n't even believe a jury from this city would stand by corporal punishment at all . With how extremely liberal and progressive this city is , one would think corporal punishment would be very frowned upon here , if not completely illegal . But it 's sadly not , people in San Francisco are like the majority of Americans when it comes to physically disciplining your child . They think hitting your child is an acceptable form of punishment and that it 's a " parents right " to hit their child . Corporal punishment is one of the very rare cases where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What makes me most furious about this case is the jury attempted to excuse the fathers actions by saying all he did was spank his child . I do n't know about you guys , but I do n't consider belting a child to be spanking a child . To me , spanking is when a parent **25;454;TOOLONG you wish to call it a child with their hand . Not with an object like a belt . I do n't considering belting to be spanking just as I would not consider smacking your child with something like a rod to be spanking . Hitting your child with a belt is not spanking them , that 's beating them . That is bordering on child abuse . <p> Now my views on spanking are very unpopular among the majority of people it seems . I disagree completely with spanking and any corporal punishment . I do think America needs stricter laws when it comes to physically disciplining your child . The only time I may even slightly agree with spanking a child is when it is being used as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in spanking being used any sooner than a complete last resort . If you use spanking as a first resort , I will question your skills and competency as a parent if you think hitting your child should be the first thing you turn to . <p> My views on spanking are very largely intertwined with my pacifistic views . I am a pacifist , meaning I do n't believe in using violence to solve our problems . I am not an extreme pacifist though , I will use violence when it 's absolutely necessary . But violence , for me , is a complete last resort and I will use all my other options before even thinking of being violent as a solution . And yes , spanking is violence . You are hitting a child , that is violence . Hitting , spanking , tapping , smacking , whatever . Call it what you want , it 's all the same . Changing it 's name does not change what it does , you are still physically harming a child which is constituted as violence . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is about belting your child . I do view belting as child abuse as well , especially if you 're doing it hard enough to leave markings on your kid . I know personally how much it hurts to be whipped with a belt , my grandfather did it to me a time or two as a child . When my grandparents would be babysitting me and my sister , we would be physically disciplined if we did something that was " wrong " . It was a first resort for my grandparents . They are old-fashioned in the sense they believe in physical punishment . They are also strict Christians who believe in the " spare the rod , spoil the child " part of the Bible . My grandfather would hit us and my grandmother would calm us down . She 'd come in and explain to us why we had been hit , my grandfather never bothered to explain it to us . My grandma is usually a very sweet person most of the time . My grandfather .... Not so much . I love my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I also feel a lot of dislike for him . <p> Most of the time , my grandfather would resort to spanking but there was a few times either me or my sister would do something that made him so angry that he would hall off and hit us with his belt . I ca n't remember much of what I or she did to make him angry , but I do remember one time we did something that made him really angry . He grabbed both me and my sister , took us to one of the back rooms , and proceeded to beat us with a belt for whatever it was . To further the punishment , he locked the two of us in that room for hours until he decided we 'd been thoroughly " punished " . My grandfather is a rough man . Being belted hurts and honestly , it 's pretty humiliating too because when you 're being belted , you 're essentially not being treated as a human . It 's very degrading . <p> And you know what ? Being belted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't teach me much about " right from wrong " . The only thing it taught me was to fear my grandfather . It taught me that he was bigger and stronger than me .

Now , I do n't respect him because he 's sexist , racist , and homophobic . I 've forgiven him for what he did to me as a child . I ca n't tell you if being belted has contributed to the mental issues I have today , because I do n't honestly know if that is something that has contributed to how I 've turned out . <p> I do n't agree with belting a child .

The most common stereotypes , though , are channelled to middle or high school guards . In middle school , maybe , kids are just trying to find themselves and will melt to appease the mold of extra-curriculars . <p> For example , kids from my middle school would assume that kids in art classes were either super shy but snotty .

That a small part of their broken soul remains on this small part of the broken universe . I 've always sort of liked that . The idea that people are never really gone . It 's comforting at the very least . I 'm not sure if I believe it . I 'm not sure if I believe you 're dead either . A part of me still thinks this is all some stupid Jackson McGregor prank . But I guess that for the sake of making things easier we 'll say you 're dead . Not gone , no not all the way . But technically dead . So you 're dead jack . Kind of weird writing that out . Almost as weird as saying it . but I guess that 's just how things work . People are born , people live ( or rather merely exist in most cases ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not exactly a pleasant thought , but then again who said this would be pleasant ? I 've been writing these letters for a while Jack . Hoping for closure , I suppose . I think this is the closest I 'll get to it . This is the last letter I 'm going to write . A final goodbye . I 'm closing the book ; or maybe just turning the page . Before I go though , I wanted to say thank you . Thank for being my friend above all else . I 'll always remember the day we met ; my twelfth birthday . Seems so far away now , does n't it ? I 'll always remember that day . We were so happy back then . I always try to think of that when I think of you . Not what followed in later years . The smell of burning wood and the feeling of thick smoke choking us a faraway thought . The amber sky streaked with gray and black and death never crossing my mind . The stench of alcohol on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all I want to remember when I hear your name . Because that 's what you are Jackson . Kind and innocent and so afraid of everything . But that 's okay , because so am I. So maybe in a few years I 'll move to the city like we always said we would and I 'll rent out a hole in the wall apartment and go to school and keep learning and keep growing . In the meantime I still have to get through high school but I have a plan Jackson McGregor . I always do after all . I 'll miss you Jack , thanks for sticking around . <p> Your best friend , Rosalie Willows <p> ? ? ? <p> I had to write a small narrative for my English class . I 'm not really sure about this . CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM IS HIGHLY ENCOURAGED . I WANT TO IMPROVE . Also , my apologies for the spelling errors . I 'm on a tight schedule tonight .

A Fever You Ca n't Sweat Out was more of an alternative , ' emo ' sounding album . The leap they took to change their sound into Pretty.Odd helped the band grow as artists . The new album features Panic 's spin on classic rock , blending their old sound with new . My first few words to describe the tracks on the album when I first heard the songs were " different " , " classic rock-esque " , and " revolutionary " for the year of 2008 . Artists in this decade have a sound that stays the same , but Panic at the Disco broke this streak . <p> Although most bands stick to the sound that made them famous , Panic at the Disco took the risk to change the way their music sounded . I find it more interesting to listen to different sounding songs , not music that I ca n't figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to other songs . Panic has changed my view on the music scene going on now . <p> It is almost impossible to compare Panic at the Disco 's two CDs because of how different they are .

If a person is into all types of rock , classic included , than comparing Pretty.Odd and A Fever You Ca n't Sweat Out is a task that is very difficult . The sounds have changed on both albums , showing that Panic has grown in the music business . <p> There are some similarities to the old album , however . A few would be that the lyrics are still as deep as before , the words are something you have to analyze to understand the true meaning of .

The way Panic 's lyrics are written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex than most of the music we hear today . The instrumentals in the songs are still as great as before , maybe even a bit better . On A Fever You Ca n't Sweat Out there were many instrumentals that I thought sounded like circus music . Do n't get me wrong , I love the ' circus ' sounding instrumentals in the old CD . The same is to say about the new album by Panic at the Disco . <p> My overall review of Pretty.Odd by Panic at the Disco is that the music is different , but it is a positive change from how they sounded before .

I really wish I could stop , but I do n't have anything else to cope and I 'm addicted .... <p> openess online is easy . no one knows who i am. no one can confront me in person about what I post , because I 'll never confront any of you . openess online gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a shame that you have to be so negative . : / <p> Though I completely understand what you mean about how openness online is easy , after looking at your profile it does seem a little odd that the first things you really say about yourself are that you 're a cutter with an eating disorder .

Just saying ... <p> Also , I think there 's already a cutting thread , though I 'm not 100% sure whether or not it 's in the " personal " forum or not . Maybe try searching for it and posting this in there ? <p> i stopped a while back but get crazy urges to do so .

I wanted to make her look at me differently after she had forced me to look at myself differently , and I got that . <p> The first time was scissors , but I used pencil sharpener blades for the most part .

Having someone you care so deeply for hurting themselves can be one of the hardest things in life to deal with . It 's never an easy thing to deal with .

The best thing you may be able to do for Jacq right now is to either talk to her about it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to a trusted adult who you think could help you help her . I wish the both of you the best of luck in this , it 's a hard situation to have to go through . Towards the topic ... <p> I have had self-harm habits since I was a small child but I did n't begin cutting myself until I was fourteen . The bullying I was going through at the time played a big part in why I began resorting to it . I hated everything about myself , I felt like I deserved it . The bullying only contributed to making me feel like I deserved it . And I still do feel that way . While I use cutting as a way to cope from time to time , it 's most often used as a " punishment " of sorts for myself . When I get upset with myself for whatever reason , I get urges to hurt myself in some way . I hate myself so much and I often get upset with myself , even if it may be over small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I deserve nothing less than this . There are times when I feel like I deserve more than what I already put myself through . <p> I have tried to stop cutting many times and I have relapsed many times . The most I 've gone is six months but back in March , I relapsed again and have been unable to gain control back . But I 'm lucky to have recently found a wonderful person who is standing by my side and is helping me recover from this . I wo n't say what I 've used to cut myself with though because I do n't feel comfortable saying that . I do n't want to give anyone any ideas on things they could use . <p> It was seventh grade and shit ( can I say that ? ) was really hard . I did n't know what to do anymore , so I started rubbing an eraser on my inner arm as hard as I possibly could . That was n't enough , though , so I started cutting with a pencil.Four years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pencils , safety pins , and paper clips . I now use a box cutter.I do n't like cutting , but it 's the only escape I have.I would go more in depth about what was happening , but this is the internet and everything , so I 'd rather not . <p> Meh . I started cutting when I was about 12 , 13 , something like that . Stuff was really difficult . I 've struggled with depression since I was about 10 ; started self harming when I was 11 , by burning myself with an eraser ( which really freaking hurts , and leaves a nasty wound ) . <p> My addiction only worsened when my parents , my school , and my therapist found out I cut , when I was 14 . A lot of people at my school called me ' emo ' , my teachers pitied me , and my parents made fun of me . I did n't trust my therapist , and I never talked to her about stuff . She just assumed that since I talked to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day everyone found out , I 'd automatically trust her . <p> I used scissors the first time I cut , and from then on it was sometimes scissors , but usually a blade from a razor , or a knife . <p> I do n't cut anymore ; for the last year , I 've been trying to stop . I have n't cut in about a month and a half . I 'd like to say I do n't self harm anymore at all , but if I get filled with a bunch of self loathe , which happens sometimes , I 'll punch things , with only the intent of hurting myself , or if I get a bruise or something , I make it way worse . I ca n't control that , it scares me . <p> I was 11 . I had a problem with the fact that I existed . If I had died very literally almost no one on this planet would have cared . I had no friends . Not a single one . I still cut . I 'm working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like that I exist though . <p> I started out by scratching very violently with my nails at my forearm . Then I moved on to kitchen knives and razor blades . <p> I was 12 when I started , mainly because of all the stress at home . I have a junkie for a dad , and a mom who does n't give a shit about me . I had no one other than my grandma . I started cutting in the fall of 7th grade . <p> When I met my now-ex , David , I stopped cutting . I was doing really good , too ! One whole year of not taking a blade to my wrists , legs , sides , etc . It was short-lived , though , sadly . David abused me throughout our relationship , cheated on me , four times , and made my life hell after we broke up . I started back up again . This was last year in 2011 . <p> As of right now , I am two months cut-free . I feel great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They remind me of how I overcame everything . I 'm stronger . <p> I started cutting in the 8th grade not long after my break up from my first boyfriend . At first I used a pin but then moved on to a pencil . I never made myself bleed , though , because I live in Florida and I could n't constantly wear long-sleeved shirts , so I do n't have any physical scars . I relapsed my 9th grade year and it took me a while to stop . The worse that year was when I got caught for skipping a class . It seemed trivial but at the moment it was like the final straw to all my dismay . I grabbed a stick from outside and stuffed it in my bag . Instead of going to the discipline building I took a detour to the bathroom . Once there I sliced both of my forearms so badly that all I could see was red . After my friend took to cutting , however , I promised myself that I would stop and help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but once I made the cut I thought to myself , ' What the hell am I doing ? ' I have n't done it since then but every once in a great while I still get those urges . I just have to remind myself that I 'm stronger than the voices . <p> I do n't have the best reason for cutting , I guess you could say . I thought ( I knew ) I was ugly and chubby , my grades were poor and I thought no one cared . It was kinda the same for my relapses but I had more pressure to succeed in school and do good . 
@@23757462 @3757462/ <h> How to Get Over a Break-Up <p> Break-ups are tough and there is no fail-safe way to get over one . Here are four steps that are sure to ease some of that emotional damage . <p> Step One : Accept <p> The first crucial part of getting over a break-up is accepting that it is actually over . You broke up for a reason . Whether it was mutual or one-sided , the break-up is still for the best . After all , who wants to be with someone who does n't  really want to be with them ? In order to accept that a relationship is over , you need to realize all the reasons why it did n't  work . A good way to do this is make a list . Mine usually look something like this : <p> My cats do n't  like him . <p> We fought too much . <p> He does n't  like Harry Potter . <p> His eyes are too far apart . <p> He did n't  get me that diamond necklace for my birthday . <p> After you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many reasons your relationship ended , but realizing why it ended does n't  make all the pain go away . That 's where the next step comes in . <p> Step Two : Cry <p> Obviously , crying is an essential part of the break up process . Your former boyfriend or girlfriend was a big part of your life , and if you were willing to take the next step and form a relationship with that person , you must have cared about them . It is normal to grieve for the loss of the relationship . Even though you may be able to remain friends , it will never be what it once was , but that 's okay . After your cry session , you 're sure to realize that you 're better off without him/her and you already realized he/she was ugly anyway . <p> Step Three : Be Self-Centered <p> Let 's face it , you 're a pretty great person and you deserve the best . So , its time to act like it ! Go out and get your nails done or color your hair . Go get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better way to prove to a guy how great you are then showing off your tight new booty ( this works for guys , too ) . Doing something for yourself is a great reminder that your happiness comes first . Once you focus on yourself , the next step will come naturally . <p> Step Four : Move On <p> The last and most important part of getting over a break up is the actual process of moving on . Unfortunately , no amount of fake tanning and ice cream will make this happen . It will happen on its own . Through your strength and motivation , you will be able to get over losing your significant other , and if strength and motivation do n't  work , you can always adopt another cat ! Either way , the wounds of the break-up will heal over time . <p> You 'll know you 've moved on when you no longer ask yourself : Have I moved on ? 
@@23757463 @3757463/ <h> Agents of Social Control <p> To understand social control is to not only distinguish its purpose but also the means through which it is achieved . Social control can take two different , though related , forms : externalized and internalized . The individual experiences constant contact from outside forces that influence their behavioreven before they are born . These outside forces are known as " agents of social control " that are roles , positions , and institutions which " provide positive models for how to do something " ( Clemens and Cook 445 ) as well as what is right , or normal . Although there are several agents of social control , we will examine the forces of Politics , Religion , and Education . <h> Externalized control <p> Externalized control enforces socially appropriate behavior through outside agents such as the judicial system , priests , professors , politicians , police officers , etc. , in order to " constrain action , define opportunity , and facilitate patterns of interaction " ( Clemens and Cook 445 ) . <h> Internalized control <p> Internalized control is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through conformity to norms or standards .

Research suggests that social control is attained , though not exclusively , through politics , religion , and education . <h> Politics <p> Politics is the response to natural social living in which disputes and problems arise that call for attention and resolution , an element of social control that refers to the cultural norms , ideas and values that moderate how people interact with each other in an orderly fashion . Politics can be identified as a form of externalized control by , though not exclusively , large-scale institutions and political leaders . The institution of Congress has the power to declare war , raise armies , coin money , make rules for the government , etc.all of which constitute control because they directly affect society as a whole by deciding on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Political leaders such as the President of the United States have the advantage of influencing others because of their authoritative position , ability to persuade , and have the power to appoint Officers of the United States like ambassadors and public ministers , make treaties with other nations , and veto a bill . These powers also constitute control as they affect society by deciding who it is led by and what it is limited to . Clemens and Cook observe that " political scientists have tended to adopt this sense of institution as external constraint , as a schema massively embedded in resources for social control " ( 445 ) . The intent of these institutions and leaders is to regulate a society that perverse itself and is not prone to conflict or " some sort of ex- ogenous shock that disrupts an established order " ( Clemens and Cook 442 ) . As humans are born into and enculturated into this system of governance they intrinsically believe that what is done or what decision is made must be rightthey do what the political bodies want them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved not only with politics ; society has long been moderated by religion , a system which provides society with guidance and direction for human behavior , whether they are explicit and formal or implicit and informal . Religion moderates society in many different ways , in the form of both externalized control and internalized control : it instills fear , establishes unity among individuals , enforces adherence to law and authority , and avoidance of immoral behavior . Welch , Tittle and Grasmick observe " religious individuals are constrained toward obedience by fear of supernatural consequences that might be experienced while alive or anticipated for the afterlife " ( 1605 ) . Religion affects society in more ways than establishing fear in order to create conformity ; it provides a sense of shared identity among individuals , creating a collective conscience that enforces social control in that it creates a stronger sense of ones own beliefs . Welch , Tittle , and Grasmick also realize that " religious experience brings people together within networks of believers who mutually exercise informal social control and whose collective activities reduce the opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " group mind " creates a stronger force of control . Misbehavior can be defined as anything deemed immoral , such as defying law and authority . Some of the explicit rules of different religions state that this behavior is a violation to its nature , further enforcing a sense of conformity by emphasizing that defying the law is an act of individual gratification , that " low self-control is , for all intents and purposes , the individual-level cause of crime " ( Welch , Tittle and Grasmick 1606 ) . The constitution of rules that religion provides establishes social control in that it defines what is morally wrong in terms of obeying and defying authority . Religion extends to avoidance of immoral behavior much like it expresses the importance of adhering to the law ; in many religions , immoral behavior can be exemplified as sexual misconduct , drug use , etc.all of which challenge the stability of a harmoniously living society .

With these two examples , religion both explicates and implicates the guidelines to behaving morally . <h> Education <p> While politics and religion both heavily enforce social control , there is a third median through which order is maintained : education . This factor can be identified as a form of internalized control , and it has proven to contribute to social order by self-control and power . A well-educated individual is more informed on the nature of society , how it works , and the relation between it and their own behavior . Education can be reasonably defined " as one of the potentially important socioeconomic conditions that increase personal control " ( Schieman and Plickert 154 ) . In other words , education instills a sense of self-control in individuals , decreasing the opportunity for misbehavior or crime and instead encouraging conformity . In relation the ability to self-control that accompanies an education , individuals increasingly obtain more power in the sense that they " are more likely to participate in the labor force , have higher levels of occupational status , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faster ascendancy through the occupational ranks " ( Schieman and Plickert 155 ) and " tend to enjoy greater schedule control , greater job authority , and more challenging , interesting , and enriching work " ( Schieman and Plickert 156 ) . The well-educated reap the benefits of better opportunities and rewards that allow them a better grasp of self-control and to secure a place in society that gives them power over different aspects of their lives . While this is essentially an individuals advantage , it is just as so for society as a whole ; education divides people into the different classes that make up the web of socioeconomic status , authority , occupational status , etc. , that heavily influence the level of over-all control in a society . <p> Like all species , humans can not maintain social harmony without some system of governance ; it is imperative that human society preserve and restrain itself in order to maintain order .

The first three medians of control , politics , is the web of cultural norms , ideas , and values that regulate how individuals interact with each other . Politics is a governing entity that , more often than not , consummates control over society by both large-scale institutions and political leaders . The second of the three medians , religion , provides society with guidance and rules for human behavior through both externalized and internalized control while implementing control through fear , unity , adherence to law , and avoidance of immoral behavior .

You may have to adjust the makeup a little bit to match your eye color , but you will not be disappointed as long as you have the proper experience . No matter if you buy expensive or cheap makeup , you should find that the smoky eye is easier than some are lead to believe . <p> Note : You will have to have makeup that will suit your eye color and skin tone for this to turn out perfectly .

Shades of grey , brown , orange , taupe , purple , violet , and silver also look brilliant on someone with blue eyes . Dark colors will make light eyes pop so keep that in mind . You can use either dark grey , black , or dark blue for your main color in your smoky eye . <h> Green Eyes <p> People with green eyes really have to pay attention to their skin to make most of their decisions with makeup , unfortunately .

I always do it at night . Also , do not blow dry them . They curl more because of how long they 're in place .

With ringlets , you do n't have to do exactly that , but you want the rolls closer together . <p> Those two things are vital to making the curls the way you want them .

Our breath is crystallising in front of our faces , celebrations are underway to see out the year and were tucking into our fair share of warm drinks . However , winter also brings with it a daunting thought : the dreaded winter illness . Whether you get stuck with the flu , a cold or just a scratchy throat , almost everyone has developed some form of winter illness when the cold snap strikes ! This weeks Ten Ways is all about helping you to avoid those illnesses ! <h> 1 . Protect Your Throat <p> There is nothing worse than losing your voice and catching a sore throat during the festive season . While everyone you know is singing Mistletoe and Wine and scarfing down all of the Christmas chocolate they can humanly consume , you 're stuck with a croaky voice and a throat too sore to eat chocolate ( with which is no fun at all ! ) . A handy tip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold weather wear a scarf if you can , as this will keep your neck and throat at a consistent temperature . <h> 2 . Avoid Going From Extreme Heat to Extreme Cold <p> Running to put the bins out or to take the dog on a quick walk ? Wrap up , even if you 're going to be quick ! Putting your body through extreme temperature changes can reduce the effectiveness of your immune system and may allow viruses that cause many winter illnesses to settle . So resist the urge to grab that hoodie and brave the five-minute walk to the bus stop grab a proper jacket and a hat ! <h> 3 . Wash Your Hands Often <p> One of the most direct forms of contact with the viruses and germs that cause winter illness is through touch . Were taught from a young age to cover our mouths when sneezing or coughing , but if you do n't  wash your hands afterwards , the next thing you touch is left covered in your germs . Similarly , if someone with the cold has just touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to be exposed to the illness . Combat this by washing your hands as often as possible with soap or , if there is n't a basin or running water around to use , an antibacterial hand-gel. <h> 4 . Get a Good Nights Sleep <p> Our bodies are amazing . Even when were sleeping , they are working hard to ensure that we remain healthy . The importance of a good nights sleep is simple studies have shown that your immune function grows stronger when you sleep for close to the recommended 8 hours per day . Use this excuse to get a good nights sleep and perhaps a cheeky lie in . You 'll feel better for it ! <h> 5 . Exercise <p> Much like the above tip , this one revolves around strengthening your immune system . It has been shown in the past that exercise can boost immune system function and when winter rolls around , that boosted immune system may very well prevent you from catching the pesky illnesses that catch like wildfire ! <h> 6 . Avoid Crowds <p> A good one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid large groups of people as much as possible if you 're trying to avoid illness . In close quarters , the germs and viruses causing illness can spread exceptionally quickly and this is something that , unless you absolutely have to , you want to avoid at all costs . So choose a quiet day for your Christmas shopping . Your immune system will thank you for it ! <h> 7 . Invest in a Humidifier <p> When the winter rolls around , we spend a lot of our time in houses where the heating system makes the air exceptionally dry . Couple that with the high amount of usage of heating systems and you end up drying out the protective precautions your body puts in place . Investing in a humidifier will allow you to add moisture back into the air , which will allow your nasal passages to breathe properly again and may save you from a painful dry nose ! <h> 8 . Avoid Sharing <p> We all know how tempting it is to just avoid a glass and swig juice directly from the bottle , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can be a breeding ground for illnesses . If you 're i 'll , or someone you know is i 'll , avoid sharing cartons of juice or food as much as possible , just in case someone else has left germs on the container . Similarly , avoid using other peoples pillows , quilt covers and jackets . <h> 9 . Sneeze and Cough Into Elbows or Tissues , Not Hands ! <p> As was said above , sneezing into your hand can cause a spread of mucus and nasty bacteria that cause illness . If you can , always advise anyone you know to sneeze or cough into a tissue and dispose of it as soon as possible or , if a tissue is not available , into the crook of your elbow . Human contact is less likely in this area and it will limit the spread . If you find yourself coughing and spluttering , follow this rule too . After all , colds and flu cycle around and there 's a chance that someone you infect might infect you back once you 're better ! <h> 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , speak to a medical professional . Many inoculations exist to combat things like flu and these can be the first line of defence when attempting to fend away illness during the winter months . If these exist and your health plan covers them , get them ! After all , they would n't exist if they were n't helpful and your doctor will know better than anyone whether you need them or whether theyll help you to beat the pesky illnesses that attempt to ruin winter !

This box has nothing special about it , except that on the outside of this box there is a little sticker that says 0x1 . This means one , the first box . It could say anything , " teddy " or " rawr " or " I 'm a box " , it 's just a reference . Now . If you were to see that box , you 'd know it , but you may not know what 's inside of it , right ? Imagine variables this way : A variable is the box , with something ( anything ) inside of it . To find out , you simply open the box ( call the variable ) , and then you 'll know . The best thing is , you are usually the one doing the assigning ( placing the things in the box ) , so you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to see what 's inside . Why did I give the box a name ? Well , what if you did n't have just one box , but 2 to the power of 32 boxes ? That 's roughly around four billion , if my math 's not off . Do you really want to search through 4,000,000,000 unmarked boxes ? Did n't think so . <p> So , in python , to assign a variable , you do : <p> variablename = foobar <p> variablename can be anything without spaces , without symbols ( $ , , * , @ , etc , are symbols ) , and it has to start with a letter . Python is case sensitive , so the variable Rawr is different than rawr . That 's important to remember . <p> Now , foobar is simply a programmer 's placeholder text , if you will . What can replace foobar with lots of things , but for now , we 'll go into strings and integers . Integers are numbers . You can do math with them . For instance : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this example , numberthree is using the values of numberone and numbertwo , and adding them together . It 's kind of like a simple calculator . <p> Strings , on the other hand , are text , like you 're reading . A string is represented by quotes , either single or double . ( But they must remain consistent , I usually only use double quotes for strings , which I 'll explain later . ) A string is assigned as such : <p> firstnameofperson = " Bob " lastnameofperson = " Smith " <p> The reason I use double quotes the most is because Python reads the first quote as the start of a string , and the next quote it hits as the end of one . So what about this : <p> sentence = ' You all ca n't see the reason . ' <p> That will error , as Python will believe that the first string is ' You all can ' , and then the next , unfinished string starts right after ' reason ' .

Now this can get a little confusing , but you can easily do math within print lines , even strings . <p> rawr = " rawr " moo = " moo " rawrmoo = rawr + moo <p> rawrmoo will now return " rawrmoo " when called .

I 've tried many , many times laying out in my backyard tanning , but it just takes way too long . I do n't know what 's up with my skin , but it just does n't tan like it used to for whatever reason . Maybe because I 've locked myself in my house the past four years so my skin 's just completely forgotten what sun is , I do n't know . Either way , I 've taken matters into my own hands after getting over my Final Destination 3 related fears of being trapped inside the tanning bed and burning to a crisp . <p> Now , I 'm a little claustrophobic to begin with . I do n't like tight spaces at all - I get all panicky and my heart races and just have mini heart attacks whenever I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater good of not blinding anyone with my legs , I went for it . The first time was a nightmare because I got in the bed with my little tanning goggles or whatever they 're called , I closed the lid and instantly tensed up because it was just so bright and the fan near my head was so loud and I just wanted to get out of there . But I prospered ( I was only in there six minutes because my skin is so naturally pale that the lady said I could n't handle more than that my first few times ) and everything was well . The next two times I was a little uncomfortable , but eventually I got over it and it was easy as pie . <p> Today when I went in , my mom and I had set up appointments for the Hydration Station which basically hydrates your skin and gives it vitamins and preps it for tanning .

But this time ? Man oh man . <p> But anyways , after the Hydration Station I decided to do a stand up tanning booth instead . It 's supposed to be helpful to switch off from the booth to the bed like every two times because the bulbs in the booth are stronger than the ones in the beds ( which means you do n't have to be in there as long , thank God ) and it kind of makes sure your skin does n't get used to the bulbs in one of them and you stop tanning as well .

I asked her if it would make me feel claustrophobic and she said it was a pretty open space and that I would n't have anything to worry about . <p> I really should n't have taken her word for it because I 'm just naturally more paranoid than she is . I walked in there and it 's like the width of a porta potty . No , probably smaller than that . There 's handles at the top where the fan is that you hold on to so the undersides of your arms tan and everything . I turned it on , stepped inside , closed the door and just lost it . I had to tell myself that I was alright , that I was n't going to be in there long and that I could easily open the door if I needed to .

My tan lines were really prominent and my chest ( which is the hardest skin to tan , I swear - my arms and stomach and legs could be bronze and my chest will still be white .

@@23757486 @3757486/ <h> Benefits to the Legalization of Polygamy <p> I am a believer in human diversity . I believe that all people are individuals and should have the right to make decisions that benefit them as individuals , even if those decisions would not please everyone where they applied to society as a whole . To enter into a polygamist relationship is a personal decision that one should have the right to make . Not only does it not encroach on the rights others outside the relationship , but a degree of polygamy could have beneficial effects on society and the general human genome , and it is legally sanctioned by the first amendment of the Constitution . Polygamy is not an appealing practice to every individual , but those who wish to participate in it should have the right to do so . For these reasons , I ask you to please introduce a bill to legalize polygamist marriage in Missouri . <p> It was once said by Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr . " The right to swing my fist ends where the other man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fist swinging in the air . Polygamy is defined by Websters dictionary as " Marriage in which a spouse of either sex may have more than one mate at the same time . " This definition covers " polygyny " , where a man has multiple wives , " polyandry " where a woman has multiple husbands , and " group marriage " , where a family unit is formed by some combination of both multiple men and multiple women . According to Ron J. Hammonds text book , Intro to Psychology , polygyny is the most common form of polygamy . Some may argue that men having multiple wives would encroach upon the right of other men to have at least one wife , because the ratio of men to women is around fifty percent to fifty percent in this country . However we have to consider that no one is actually entitled to a relationship , and that women are not a commodity but human beings who make decisions . This problem exists outside of the controversy of polygamy . Consider the football jock in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the geek who gets turned down by every girl he asks out . Even if the football jock is being faithful to his girl of the week , the other girls still will not want to date the geek . Though this may seem unfair to the geek , it would not be fair to force one of the girls to date him , either . Though a society that outlaws polygamy may not force women to marry men they do not wish to marry , the basis of the gender ratio argument assumes that if not allowed to marry the man she would , were polygamy allowed , that she will marry another man as second choice . If a woman decides to marry a man who already has a wife , though this mathematically leaves a man single , it is her right to marry into the relationship with the man and his wife , if all involved are in approval of the arrangement , but it is not the right of the single to marry the woman who preferred to marry someone else . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship with a nonconsensual partner . <p> There is fear that the legalization of polygamy could lead to the legalization of bestiality , pedophilic , and other nonconsensual relationships , as any change in law often leads to " Slippery slope " arguments . This fear is unfounded because animals and children do not have the power to consent to sex or legal contracts , but groups of adults do . There is no fuzzy line between taking advantage of an animal or child and a group of persons over eighteen agreeing on a lifestyle to live together . There is also fear that legalizing polygamy will lead to an increase in sex slavery and human trafficking because of the association of some religious cults that support polygamy and abuse of religious power , specifically Warren Jeffers the president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who allegedly arranged marriages between the men of his church and underage girls , and was convicted of the sexual assault of two underage girls .

Likewise , polygamy should not be outlawed because it has been associated with human trafficking , because it is the human trafficking that is harmful , not the polygamy itself . <p> A polygamous family is not inferior to some legal situations in which children are often raised , and some forms of polygamy even offer benefits to a family unit beyond what a traditional " One man one woman " marriage does . It has been pointed out that a mother and/or father in a nuclear family unit can give all of their attention to the offspring of their singular spouse ; one parent in a polygamous marriage may have their attention spilt between the offspring of their various spouses .

In theory when one of two biological parents of a child is absent or unfit , the child falls into the care of the next spouse in the " chain " . This network could be a safety net of social responsibility for those who choose to participate . <p> Genetically , a society that includes family structures besides the traditional nuclear family could be beneficial .

This would create more children with " desirable " traits , but would also make the general population more genetically homogenous , which is scientifically looked at as a disadvantage for a species . The genetic homogeny resulting from the disproportion of polygyny to polyandry would likely be balanced out , however , by the introduction of group marriages .

Jailing people for crimes that do not harm anyone , such as polygamy , is not only unfair to the persons jailed , but eats government time and funding . Though I could not find the records of government money spent on prosecuting polygamists in Missouri , a governement does not create laws it has no plans to enforce , and any money that could potentially be spent on this issue would be a waste .

The first amendment of the constitution states " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ... " to outlaw polygamy , as it is a benign religious practice , is therefore unconstitutional . <p> Polygamous relationships are the choice of an individual , create legitimate family structures , are beneficial to the gene pool , and in some cases are a religious practice . It is unconstitutional to bar people from these forms of marriage , and our government is wasting valuable time any money prosecuting people for a victimless crimes .

It would be such a fucking understatement that the man would of probably laughed in your face if you asked if he was having a " rough " day . It started when he left his wife . Logically it was for the best . Their marriage had become so fucking toxic , no trust , screaming matches , until Zachary just did n't know why they stayed together . The divorce had been nasty ; Gena promising to do what she could to make his life miserable including taking a sizable amount of his bank statement with her . They guys had all been supportive as possible , but frankly Zachary had just been in a foul mood , his drinking increased , he spent most nights high and sometimes someone warming his bed . Though he never let them linger around . Then he met Meagan , and fucking hell he was happy . <p> He 'd laughed for the first time in months , and instead of drowning a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends seemed to like her well enough and the blonde was always encouraging of whatever it was Zacky wanted to do . New music , touring- whatever . Than of course his old green-eyed monster reared it 's head when she 'd left her Facebook on his laptop open , and it showed she 'd been messaging her ex . There was nothing incriminating , it just looked like they were catching up from the two messages he 'd glimpsed at ; but it was enough for Zachary to egg Megs into a fight . A fight which landed him in Vegas spending most of boozed up to point he could n't remember his own name , and when he finally found himself back on his planeride home sobering up ; he could vaguely recall a girl . Of course he panicked but waved it off as nothing . Even in his drunken state he thought he still loved Megan . <p> He 'd asked his friends if anything had happened and while they were n't sure ; they did n't think so . So Zachary had gone home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she liked that kind of crap ) and the two had made up . Vegas was gone from his mind by dinner as he 'd lost himself in Megan . You could imagine his surprise when he got a phone call from his lawyer informing Zacky he needed to get his ass down to office as there was a problem . That tone left little room for negotiation , so he 'd bid farewell to his girlfriend before driving to the lawyer 's office ; wondering what the fuck was going on . His question was answered as soon as he walked through the door . A curvy blonde was sitting with his lawyer in the waiting room , her eyes large and unsure . Opening his mouth to greet her , Zacky had promptly snapped it back shut again as memories came pouring back to him . <p> That chance meeting , bumping into her quite literally at the bar . Zacky had bought her drinks , complimented her , opened up and spilled himself to her . And they ... They had gotten married ? The meeting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had both expressed wants to get divorced ; and so with that Zacky thought it would be clear sailing . His lawyer had managed to squeeze them in that day to get everything finalized , and that 's when life absolutely fucked him over .

He 'd gotten a big lecture after the judge found out he 'd been recently divorced , and received a lecture about the sanction of marriage . He then refused to let this girl he hardly knew , to divorce him . <p> Six months . Seeing a marriage therapist . And if Zacky did n't comply not only could this girl , he found out her name was Laney , take half of his money and file for alimony on the house , but could also additionally fine him and hold him in contempt of court .

It felt like shit and he would never do that to another human being- but Laney did n't love him . At least he did n't think so . He was just a stupid , drunken mistake . That had been two weeks ago ; today found Zachary sprawled out on the porch swing waiting for her to pull up . He 'd hired moving things to move some of her shit into the house so they could at least attempt to " have a marriage " but so far she had yet to show . <p> It had been four long years since she 'd been in this neighborhood . Four years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock . There had been reason she stayed away from him , and the reason came after he tried to convince her to stay ; made love to her , promised and pleaded he would do anything to have Wynter stay . He had told her that New York was n't impossible ; just inconvenient and that he 'd be with her even if she chose to leave . Brian fucking Haner would chase after her . But being born to parents , absent in every sense of the word except for physically , had shaped Wynter in not relying on people . To never put herself in a situation where she could depend on someone . Which is why she had fled when he 'd fallen asleep , his grip loose about her hips . Brian had n't stirred as she dressed , slipping one of his hoodies over clothing as a small keepsake before letting herself out into the night . <p> It had been the hardest thing she 'd ever done , leaving him .

They were two beings that should of never mixed ; and when they did the two spent more time tip-toeing around each other . Trying so hard to balance whatever they had , this back and forth love that had slowly eaten her up . And for the first couple months it had been torture . Her numbers had been changed , her Facebook deactivated , and email changed . There was no way for Brian to contact her unless he knew her address which she 'd given him a false one . On the other side of the city in fact . <p> She 'd gotten a job as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her well . Well enough so that when two months later she discovered she was pregnant , had been able to choose that she was well enough to raise a child by herself . There was n't a moment she did n't miss those soulful brown eyes , and that devil-may-care grin Brian had mastered . She of course kept up with Avenged , they did well enough she did n't have to worry ; and for years she did well . Wynter had a son , a boy with his eyes and nose , but her ears . It almost hurt how much her son looked like his father . She 'd chosen Nikolai for her son 's name , though called him Niko for short . The only friends that knew of his existence were her New York friends ; namely her neighbor Leanne . With each passing day she watched as Niko grew into toddler . It was his third birthday when Leanne had sat her down and had a talk with her about how Brian should know his son . <p> Her son was nearly four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " vacation .

Turbulence made her sick more than once and Leanne , who 'd offered to come spent the trip alternating between calming Niko , to calming his mother . They landed , and Leanne promised to go check into the hotel while Wynter was n't to waste any time and go straight to Brian 's with Nikolai . After making sure the taxi would take the fretting mother to the intended destination ; Wynter was on her own with Nikolai . The ride was about an hour , and Niko had fussed for half of it until she gave him a few snacks . <p> Paying her fare when they arrived and stepping out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taking her stroller from the trunk of the cab , flipping the hood up and buckling her son inside so he would n't get heatstroke , she began what felt like the longest journey up his driveway .

The overbearing sun had begun to burn her skin , and Nikolai had fallen asleep a while back when a familiar car pulled up . Her stomach began to toss nervously as she pictured the worst scenarios . Brian flat-out telling her to get lost with their baby , denying the baby was his , or just ignoring her . But she was doing this for Nikolai . He deserved to have a relationship with his father , and Brian deserved to know that he was a father ... even if it was a little late . Getting to her feet , preparing what she 'd say as the door open , Wynter was greeted by the sound of a slamming door as she kept her head down pushing the stroller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on her as he inhaled , sharply enough to hear it a couple feet away .

Fearing her heartbeat loud enough for him to hear it Wynter managed to choke out , " I ... I think we have a lot of catching up to do . " He was teetering between so many emotions ; she honestly had no idea how he 'd react . She just shut her her mouth and hoped for the best .

But for the younger generation , therell only be one prominent figure from those times : Marilyn Monroe . <p> Most label Miss Monroe as a sex symbol and screen siren . Though the real Marilyn was more than skin deep , people still insist on viewing her as a vapid moneymaker . Some still have the gall to present her as the tramp that tried stealing the husband of first lady Jackie O. <p> Let 's look at the most conspicuous facts . She died one of the most conspiracy-ridden deaths a celebrity could , was star of the most famous film scene of all time and remains the most beautiful , underrated actress Hollywood ever had the pleasure to employ . <p> Yet , sadly , people fail to swim to the deep end . As well as being famed for the obvious things , Marilyn possessed a library of over 400 books , an IQ higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feminist uprising in the Sixties . Championing civil rights , Marilyn used her fame as a platform for advocating support . 1950s America saw extreme segregation , and black musicians were often faced with the brunt of it . Ella Fitzgerald , one such lady , found difficulty reeling in gigs to play in the late fifties . Marilyn called the club Ella wanted to play , saying if they hired Fitzgerald she would watch every night . Just a dumb blonde ? I think not . <p> In her younger years , Marilyn was sexually assaulted . While being passed exasperatingly around the fourteen foster homes she had to endure , she was forced into a pious , Christian family ; perfectly common in 1930s California . A church-working boarder assaulted her when she was just the innocent eight-year-old Norma Jean . When she told her chauvinistic guardians , she was caned for lying about a " good Christian " . However , on skyrocketing to superstar heights she became the first celebrity to publicly speak about sexual abuse , and was revolutionary as victims felt they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that abuse rarely actually happened . <p> Marilyn Monroes impact on women is revolutionary . Its little known that she was the first woman in Hollywood to walk out on executives wanting to cast her in the same roles ( blonde hunting for a financially well endowed hubby ) and create her own production company . It allowed Marilyn to explore different characters and express herself as a real actress - not just a corporate puppet though sadly her best roles are often overlooked in favour of the stereotypical Lorelei Lee . <p> Popular belief among fools is that she slept her way to fame . Strictly false . Marilyn was one of the few women who refused to bed bosses in exchange for parts . Marilyns modelling also bred negativity . The star only did three topless shoots that were in no way derogatory . Unfortunately , her celluloid stunts stirred the belief she was a bimbo in a prudish world . However , Marilyns career was an early taster of third-wave feminism , which was most notable in the nineties . It emphasizes that sexualizing women is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This makes Marilyn what 's known as a proto-feminist , as she pre-empted the feminist revolution that happened in the 1960s ; even before the word feminist existed ! <p> Ignorance can be bliss , but I suspect Miss Monroe would be putting that famous Marilyn wiggle into action in her crypt at Westwood Memorial Cemetery , if she heard the stupidity in todays society . Now when people ask What did Marilyn Monroe do ? you can force feed them all of this . 
@@23757492 @3757492/ <h> How-To Halloween : Homemade Zombie Costume <p> Halloween can be an expensive time of year , especially when it comes to costumes . Store-bought costumes can leave you out of pocket for quite a large amount , particularly costumes designed for adults . If you 're looking for a cheaper alternative to the store-bought costumes , creating your own is perfect . Not only can it often save you money , but you can have a lot of fun in the process ! <p> One of the most simple and impressive-looking homemade costumes is the traditional zombie costume . Made using a few spare pieces from around your house and a minimal amount of bought supplies , creating your own zombie look can be extremely easy to do ! <h> You Will Need : <p> Old clothes <p> Scissors <p> Fake blood <p> Large paintbrush <p> Newspaper <p> Lighter ( optional ) <p> Mud ( optional ) <h> Method : <p> Firstly , choose your base clothing . As you 'll be destroying the clothes , it is best to either choose old clothing or clothes bought from a charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose anything you want a dress , a skirt , jeans , a shirt , old school uniform the possibilities are endless ! Set these out on a bed of newspaper as things are going to get messy . <p> Next , take your scissors and make a few very small cuts in the material . Zombies struggle to move well and constantly cut themselves and catch their clothes , so try to strategically place these cuts on the arms / legs of your clothing . Once you have made these small cuts , get your hands in there and start tearing ! This will fray the material and create a more natural look than the straight cuts that simply using scissors would create . You can also do this with the hems of shirts and skirts . <p> At this stage , you can also use a lighter to create singe marks in the material . For this , ensure that you have water nearby and be very careful . Hold the lighter as far away as possible , but still have the flame touching the material . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned area straight into some water to cool it down . This works best on white items of clothing . <p> Once you are happy with the cuts and any singe marks you have created , start on the fake blood . Taking your large paintbrush , load it up with a fake blood of your choice . Apply this firstly to the neck of your shirt think about where blood would drip if you were to eat a person ! A good pattern to follow for this is to create a V shape starting from halfway across your collarbones on the shirt . Do n't  worry about this being perfect or tidy -- the messier , the better ! After this is done , take the paintbrush , load it up with some fresh fake blood and flick it at the shirt . This will create a blood spatter pattern . <p> At this stage , you may want to think about what your zombie has been doing . Zombies virtually never have a chance to shower so you 'll want to look muddy , and your clothes will too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub mud into certain areas of the clothing , or to just put everything on and roll around in some mud . This will cake the mud to certain areas of the shirt and although it looks strange when you 're creating the costume , is a quick and effective way of making your clothes look grimy . <p> For your shoes , stamp around in some mud to make them look grimy . If you can , add some tears to these as well . Using canvas shoes such as Converse can be particularly effective , as old Converse shoes can be easily torn . <p> Add any finishing touches that you want if you have the cash , white or red coloured contacts can be a brilliant addition and get your face ready . A simple pale or greyish face can suffice , or if you want to go all out , you can create a full face of zombie makeup . Throw some fake blood on your face , perfect your best gormless face and go out and eat some brains ! <h> Tips <p> Do n't  forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing your hair on the day you choose to wear your costume . Roughly backcombing your hair can also add to your costume , as it gives your hair a crazed , non-brushed look . <p> You may want to add some fake blood around the tears in the material of your costume . This will appear as if your zombie character has cut themselves and torn their clothes by catching on something painful . <p> Do n't  restrict fake blood to just your face ! Add some under your nails , on your hands and even in the bare skin areas of your costume . A mix of fake blood and mud under your nails will make your zombie character look as if they have been digging around for victims . <p> Do n't  forget that any exposed areas of skin will have to be paled to create that unhealthy , i 'll look . This can be done easily by applying liberal amounts of talcum powder to your skin . This affects your natural skin colour , but does not look as if you 've just painted yourself white .

These are several things you could do to help eliminate the clutter . <h> Organize Your Space <p> " Space " could simply mean your car , bedroom or your work environment . It is much easier when you want something and can find it easily , right ? Tidying up your personal space , even if it is for work or school , could be a lifesaver .

If there are things that take up space without use , you must de-clutter to make space for them . By de-cluttering regularly , you make space for what you have , and avoid buying things you already own . Asking yourself questions about what you are throwing away , such as " would I ever use this again ? " or " how important is this in my life ?

Getting a calendar is great for some people . A calendar is one of the most organized tools on the market . There are millions of places to keep a calendar , but make sure it is in a place you would check regularly . Calendars are wonderful because everything you need to know that you personally write down is right in front of you . This helps with planning and scheduling , so that something like an event is not missed or that something is not scheduled on the same day . Calendars will hopefully remind you to be on time , and that is another factor of planning carefully . <p> The most convenient or easily accessible type of calendar is a day planner . Planners are highly useful for days where you would have many events scheduled and you are on the go , where a wall calendar would not be as useful here . Planners are normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

If it is not a calendar or planner , it is a phone that someone personally has on them twenty-four hours , seven days a week . People are constantly looking up something through their phones , so this would be stunning . Everything you needs is in the palms of your hands , literally . It is great because smartphones automatically remind you of events ; it is a personal assistant at your fingertips because everything is so searchable and always with you , everywhere you go . <h> Keep to the Schedule <p> Nobody is perfect , but keeping to the plan would make your life easier .

Tumblr allows you to post text , quotes , links , music and videos . Your blogs can and may say more about you than you think , but even though Tumblr is a neat site for the ages , it at times is hard to decipher and take concept of its layout . I will help with that and create a walk-through of how to set up an account . Follow the blogs you 've been hearing about . Share the things that you love . Tumblr let 's you effortlessly share anything . <h> The Set Up <p> Like all websites , you 're going to need an e-mail ( make sure its valid because there will be a confirmation link sent ) , username and a password to get started . A Tumblr username can only contain letters , numbers and dashes . If one does n't  seem to work , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can change later . After that , you 're going to have to put in your age , accept to the terms and conditions ( no one reads those ) and then select done ! <p> The next screen you 'll see will be the " follow five . " You have to follow at least five blogs before you can start posting to your own . The motto of Tumblr is , " Follow the blogs you 've been hearing about . Share the things that you love . " I will randomly pick five to get things going . Once you 've done that , a blue button at the top right will show , which will prompt you to the next step . <h> Customize Your Blog <p> Customize your blog . Give it a name and a picture . Tell the Tumblr community what you 're about ; this step here can be done at any time . Customizing never ends when it comes to your blog ! For now , I 'm going to move to the next process . Since Tumblr is worldwide and one of the leading social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating platform that you 're on or have does n't  matter : IOS , Android even Windows will allow you to take this opportunity and get it on one of those , phone or tablet ( you can do this later as well ) . <p> So , by this time , you 'll be able to see your dashboard . The dashboard is your newsfeed and shows whatever the blogs that you follow ( or the five I picked earlier ) pictures display here . This is where you can change the settings or go back and do what you have missed earlier during the new member process . <h> The Dash <p> I color coded some of the important things to help make your Tumblr or blog neat and easy to use . The image circled in red is where your avatar will be located . That is changeable at any time and can be anything you want . So , to clarify something , your dash is n't your blog , however it does show what you post as well for other users to see . If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green box , but I will get there soon enough . The yellow oval is where you pick what type of media you want to display . All these links are self-explanatory , but the most important two that are used a lot will be TEXT and PHOTO . <p> This is what the TEXT form looks like . Majority of the Tumblr users use this to post thoughts or notes . You can add links and photos in this portion as well , even though those actions have separate icons . <p> The photo icon looks like this and is where you can add multiple photos . Here , you can add wording , links and quotes , too . <p> The green box is where all the information pertaining to your blog is located . Toward the top is where the name of your blogs title is at and that as well can be changed at any time you feel like doing so . And underneath your title is the link to your blog , as I said before . Your blog will look differently than your dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post is counted and displayed in the green box as well as how many blogs you follow , just to keep track of what you 're doing and who you 're following . <p> This is what my blog looks like now ( the one I created with you ) , its bare and there are no posts . Toward the top right is where you can pick a theme in the customize tab to make your blog colorful or whatever the case maybe . <p> Here are the five icons that are entrapped within the red rectangle which is where you can return to your dash ( the home ) , check your messages from followers ( the envelope ) , have any questions or need further assistance ( the question mark ) , see account information ( the tool wheel ) and log-out ( the power button ) is at . <p> Tumblr is a place where you can be you and follow others who have similar interests . Youll have fun and hopefully this walk through will make it worthwhile .

It has turned into a controversy where someone has to take the blame when a fan or concert goer is seriously hurt or even worse - pronounced dead . <p> Some bands have taken stances against moshing after these tragedies occurred at their very own concerts : <p> 1996 , The Smashing Pumkins performed in Dublin , where Bernadette O'Brien , only 17 years old , lost her life after being crushed in the Mosh pit ; <p> 2007 , The Smashing Pumkins performed in Vancouver , Canada , a 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later died after trying to be revived . <p> Frontman of The Smashing Pumkins , Billy Billy Corgan , publicly took a stance against moshing , explaining that he had enough of the fans not understanding the environment they were in and that others were being injured . <p> Also , bands such as Pearl Jam had prohibited moshing by having a rule that if any member of the audience were found moshing , they would be forced to exit the area without reentry . <p> Concern over moshing also took place in Australia after another disaster had taken its place in the history of the popular Australia festival , The Big Day Out . <p> In Sydney , 2001 , prior the tragedy ; popular rock Band , At The Drive In , were about to perform , but before playing , the band 's lead singer , Cedric Bixler-Zavala , had asked the crowd to follow to safety rules . Ten minutes into their performance , they stopped and Cedric Bixler-Zavala started to mock the crowd by calling them robots and sheep , telling them : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you can express yourself is by slam-dancing ! " and continued to baa like a sheep to them . They canceled the rest of their performance . <p> The same day , the big hype for the festival Limp Bizkit were performing , a crowd surge had occurred and punters were being dragged out by a limited amount of Guards . One , Jessica Michalik , was taken out from the crowd surge . 5 days later , she had died in hospital . <p> This incident had caused large amount of concern as media poured over the tragedy . Some sharing their opinions saying that it was the Festival Organizers ' fault for not placing a T barricade ( a run way type barricade coming out from the middle of the stage ) after Fred Durst had demanded one be place prior , to cut the crowd in half . But , Organizers refused saying that it would create more pressure points which would need more Guards to monitor . Some of the Big Day Out audience and parents blamed it on the crowd with reports of rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some have placed the blame on the band , saying that there were n't enough comments made to try and calm the crowd down . Others blame it on the Guards , saying that they were not doing their job properly . <p> Prevention was then aim to stop tragedies such as those from according again : there was a D barricade placed , ( A D shape barricade coming out from the the front of the stage placed to cut the crowd in half ) giving access to Guards to the middle half of the crowd and minimizing the risk of an intense crowd crush . The age limit was raised to insure those who were too young to handle an the mosh pit were denied access . The Performers and concert goers were more aware and and responsible for their audience and fellow goers , in fact having a one minute of silence during the days after the knowledge of Jessica Michalik 's ; which turned into one minute of noise . The day after Michalik 's passing , At The Drive In had asked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mosh . <p> Moshing can seem like it has an extremely dangerous nature with these examples , although it has had its tragedies , prevention of these will make the experience for all those involved a much more enjoyable one . So , if you plan on going to your first concert and mosh pit , be sure to take care of yourself by only going where you can handle it , drinking water , wearing the proper lace up shoes and clothing , taking care of others around as much as you would take care of yourself and having fun . If you respect the safety rules , it will be a night you will place number one on your night of nights list .

@@23757509 @3757509/ <h> How to Stop Self-Harming <p> Notice : This tutorial is meant for those who wish to give up self-harm , yet still struggle recovering from their cope addiction . It is not meant for those who do not have an open mind to this subject or those who do not wish to stop their self-harming . These methods may not work for everyone , I understand . <h> Best Chosen Method <p> Gather up all of the objects you have ever used to intentionally hurt yourself with . If you have self-harmed with an object that you no longer have access to or can not gather up , find a picture of it or take a picture of it . If your form of self-harming is not physical , but mental , emotional , or spiritual ... write down all the thoughts or feelings you 've had that you intentionally hurt yourself with . Place the object(s) in a box of some kind . Seal the box with a lid , rope , string , tape , glue , etc . The more you seal it the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will help you recognize that these items and the way you use them are going to become things of the past . Heck , you could even label the box " Thing(s) of the Past . " Whenever you feel the urge to self-harm , write down that word or phrase that you used to label the box on a small piece of paper . You can come up with new ones if you want . Then paste the paper on the box again . If you continue to feel the urge , start sealing up the box even more . Keep some tape nearby . Every time you think about self-harming , add another piece of tape to seal the box . <h> For Those With Anger <p> If you 're one of those individuals who self-harm because you feel anger , frustration , hatred , etc. then here is a list of things you can try . <p> Get a red pen and paper ( or a paintbrush , red paint , and canvas . ) Hold the pen or paintbrush over the left side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the paper if you are left-handed . Close your eyes . Now try to depict what you are feeling onto the paper , without looking , starting at your designated side and moving over to the opposite side . When you are finished , do not look at the paper . Simply fold it up into a small square ( without looking . ) Now tape or tie the square closed . Place the secured square on top of a table or even just on the floor . Sit down facing the square and inhale deeply . Turn around so that your back is facing the square . Now exhale deeply . Do not move your shoulders when you breathe , but use your diaphragm so that your stomach pushes out when you inhale and then sinks back in when you exhale . Repeat this until you feel calm . Then throw the square away . <p> If you are angry at a particular person , do not come in contact with this person . Go to a place where you feel secure , you are alone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in the room . The more light the better . If you want , put on some soothing classical music , traditional Japanese or Celtic music . Get a deck of cards and sit cross-legged on the floor . Make sure the cards are shuffled and place them in one pile in front of you . For every reason that you are angry at the particular person , take one card off the top of the deck and place it in a separate pile behind the first one . When you run out of reasons , turn over the top two cards in each of the piles . The one on top of the pile closest to you , the first pile , will symbolize LOVE ( even if it is n't a heart . ) The one in the pile furthest away from you , the second pile , will symbolize HATE . Now take the second card from the top of the second pile and hold it in your hand . This card will symbolize the reason you are most angry at the particular person . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and number of your card , and the reason you are most angry . Next , write down at least three different ways you can fix or get past this reason without being violent towards yourself or others . Fold the paper and put it in your pocket until you accomplish the things on your list . If you do n't want to carry around the paper for fear that someone will see it , simply put the card in your pocket instead . Now do the same process for the third card in the second pile , the fourth card , the fifth , etc. until the only card left is the one that was facing up the whole time . Flip it over now and put it somewhere in the middle of the first pile ; you have successfully gotten past your anger . <p> Take off your shoes and socks . Do some of your favorite stretches or yoga poses ; look some up first if you do n't know any . Make sure that your movements are very slow and match your breathing ; deep breaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , go stand in the corner of an open room . Place your left foot so that it is facing the direction of the wall that trails out to your left . Place your right foot so that it is facing the direction of the wall to your right . Your feet should now be making somewhat of a 90 degree angle . Without moving your feet from where they are , start dancing with the upper half of your body . Play some music if it helps you , but preferably cheerful music . After a couple minutes of dancing , reposition your feet so that they are at ease and relaxed in front of you . Now stretch out your left arm so that it is pointed down the direction of the wall to your left . Stretch out your right arm down the wall to your right . Make sure that your fingers are spread out evenly so they are n't touching . Now , without moving your arms or hands , start dancing with the lower half of your body . Hopefully these exercises will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense anger . <h> For Those With Depression <p> If you self-harm because you feel depression , sadness , helplessness , etc. then here is a list of things you can try . <p> Go outside for a walk in the neighborhood . If you want , drive to a park , field , or forest if any of these places would be more comfortable . DO NOT take any objects you have used to self-harm with you . As you are walking , do not look down at your feet . Keep your head straight , your shoulders relaxed , and your gaze directed towards the horizon . Focus on things that are happening in the distance . Try to think about things that are happening as you walk , not anything that was happening before your walk or anything that will happen after your walk . Admire the scenery , wave and smile to any people you pass by , and just enjoy the fresh air . Try to take one of these walks at least once a day , or whenever you 're feeling especially despaired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you know it you 'll be enjoying and savoring them . <p> There are some yoga exercises that help tame depression and heal the mind . You can watch this video to learn more about them and how to perform them . Whenever you 're doing yoga , be sure to put your mind and being into it . Focus on your movements and on each breath , not much else . Let them energize you ; just taking thirty minutes out of your day to do yoga will make up for itself tenfold . Yoga makes our minds and bodies much more productive , something that battles against depression and self-harm . <p> Those with depression are not narrow-minded , but much more often than not they are narrow-passioned . This is a term I like to use to describe it when someone has only one or two things that they enjoy doing in life . For example , let 's say the only two things I enjoy are writing and reading . This does not mean that writing and reading are bad things . It simply means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two things . The fact that most of the time writing and reading are done ALONE is why this becomes a bit of a problem . Isolation is like poison for our minds ; it slowly drains us until we do n't know what to do to fix it . It makes it even more of a problem that these two things are done while being inactive . Inactivity is also like poison , but for our bodies as well as our minds . The point I 'm trying to make by saying this is that we must have balance . The wider our passions and enjoyments are , the more balance we will have in our lives and the less our minds and bodies will be poisoned . Explore through the possibilities of new hobbies and activities . You can start small if you want , but the more you expand your passions , and the more people you associate your passions with , the healthier and happier you will be . Say goodbye to depression ! Say goodbye to self-harm ! <h> For Those With Anxiety <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. then here is a list of things you can try . <p> If you use self-harm to take your mind off of your anxiety or to get rid of your anxiety ... then you need new and better ways to soothe your anxiety , do n't you ? A good way to start is by watching this video about reducing stress . You can also check out this thread about coping with anxiety disorders and panic attacks . <p> There are many natural herbs and remedies that can help anxiety ; no need to take medications . Mint and ginger are great ( and tasty ) plants that help mild anxiety and come in the form of candies and snacks , but are best eaten in their raw form . Lavender is another soothing herb . There 's all kinds of lavender soaps , perfumes , bath washes , and bath salts . You can even grow some lavender yourself and keep it in your windowsill . Try herb teas as well ! Rose tea , chamomile tea , vanilla tea , and lemon balm tea are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find it , valerian root extract is also great for more severe levels of anxiety . Try growing other calming plants like catnip , St. John 's Wort , and bugleweed as well . <p> Art and music therapy are other great options . For art therapy , I would recommend using acrylic paints on white canvas . Take your time with your painting and be sure to focus on it . Sometimes it 's best to do this alone . Be proud of your work , and do n't shy away from painting or drawing certain things because you think they 're " too hard " or that you 're especially bad at them . If you mess up , do n't sweat it . Just paint over it or continue with your work . Art therapy is extremely relaxing and is a great way to socialize yourself if you experience a form of social anxiety . Try joining an art club or painting class ! For music therapy , I would recommend listening to classical music , traditional Japanese music , or traditional Celtic music . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ode to Joy , Spring by Vivaldi , Nightingale by Yanni , Silk Road by Kitaro , and A Place to Dream by Llewellyn . Make sure that you have a nice pair of headphones ( not ear-buds . ) Sit down in a comfortable lounge chair or couch . Make sure that your back is straight , yet relaxed and set at a comfortable angle . Keep your neck and shoulders relaxed . Fold your hands over your belly button or lay them relaxed at your sides . Close your eyes . Keep them closed . When you breathe , do not move your shoulders . Push your diaphragm outward as you inhale and inward as you exhale . When you inhale , spread your fingers apart on each hand . When you exhale , move your fingers back together . Focus on this until you can do it without feeling awkward . Relax all parts of your body , starting from your head down to your feet . If you come across a spot that feels particularly stressed , focus on breathing into that spot . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly fade away . Feel the music and try not to think about anything besides what is happening in the moment . <h> Other solutions <p> If you use your nails to self-harm , try keeping a pair of light gloves handy to put on when you feel like you need them . <p> Sip at a fresh glass of water or tea whenever you feel the urge to self-harm . <p> Try reading a good book that you know will capture your attention and keep your attention . <p> Work-out on a daily basis to relieve stress , anger , and lift depression . <p> Having the right diet is extremely important . Try getting allergy tested or muscle tested for food sensitivities . Eat healthy , keep a balanced diet , and eat at around the same times every day . Never eat too much or too little . <p> Spend time with pets when you feel the urge to self harm . <p> Watch a relaxing TV show or movie that you know will cheer you up . <p> Write uplifting poetry or a story that keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dance , jog , play a sport , or do some other form of activity . <p> Meditate on the now and find your balanced center being . <p> When you feel a very intense urge to self-harm ( as I know you may sometimes experience ) that seems impossible to ignore , the very best thing you can do is surround yourself with people . Invite a friend over if you have to . Go help your mom clean the house if you have to . Just do n't let yourself be alone . Avoid the place(s) that you have self-harmed in the past , and try to keep your body relaxed . You can get past it .

@@23757511 @3757511/ <h> New Right And The Family <p> New Right ( 1979-1997 ) is a group led by Functionalists and Conservative leaders and thinkers , like Charles Murray . The 1950 's are considered the Golden Age ' of family , where every family was a traditional , nuclear family . This idea was broken in the 60 's and 70 's by a permissive society , which attacked ' family values . <p> Hippies and mini-skirts and pot-smoking was rife , and this permissive society abolished previous norms and values that society had put on a pedestal for so long ; ideals that the Conservative party still hold onto today . Because of new laws , things started to change in society . New families were born and new ideas were unleashed . It happened way back when ... <p> Around the 60 's : <p> Abortions were legalized <p> The contraceptive pill became free <p> Homosexuality was decriminalized <p> The homosexual age of consent was lowered <p> The first two points gave women the freedom to control their bodies and their fertility .

Some example of these Acts are : <p> Sex Discrimination Act 1975 <p> Equal Pay Act 1970 <p> Equal Opportunities Act 1995 <p> Divorce Reform Act 1969 <p> New Right says that these Laws and Acts took women away from their natural roles , e.g. housewife and mother . Also , because of these Acts and Laws , there are a lot higher divorce rates and a lot more lone-parents families around today . <p> Because there exists lone-parent families , New Right and Functionalists believe that they are to blame for society 's negatives . They believe lone-parent families are incredibly bad for the individual , and cause problematic areas in society such as : <p> They cause social problems <p> Children lack both role models <p> They have financial problems and therefore live off Government Benefits <p> They are responsible for crime <p> They underachieve <p> They 're more susceptible to drug and alcohol abuse <p> They 're more likely to live in poverty <p> New Right and Functionalists do not like them because they believe that lone-parent families are responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that society is an absolute positive thing . <h> New Right and Functionalists - Their Familial Ideology <p> New Right and Functionalists believe that the best and only type of family is the traditional , nuclear family .

A lot of the time , they are unequal , as the man has the instrumental role of the breadwinner ( the person bringing home the money ) , whereas women have to have the emotional role of the domestics , such as housewife and mother .

This problem persisted until September 2nd , when the 404 pages and redirects finally disappeared . <p> But for how long ? <p> All the stories that were lost were never recovered . Which left Quizillians wondering : What if it happens again ? This is why many long-time users are finally giving up all together on the monster once called Quizilla , and are abandoning it for new , better-managed sites . <p> One of the " new sites " that has become the destination of many online immigrants is Mibba.com . However Mibba is n't the only refuge for these lost writers . <p> FictionPress.com and FanFiction.net were both created long before Quizilla , and are popular sources of online stories . However the massive size of these sites and the lack of customization leaves many feeling that the atmosphere is too impersonal and lacks the closer-knit sense of community found on smaller sites . <p> StoryWrite and FicWad are both slightly less-polished versions of FictionPress , but worth checking out for the writer still caught in between sites . <p> DeviantArt.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on multiple topics and not just writing , writers often feel their work goes unnoticed . The sites are not without positive aspects , however . They also hold a tighter sense of community ( if the user is willing to do enough searching for it ) and boast original fiction , fanfiction , poetry , and more . There are virtually limitless possibilities . <p> WritersCafe , on the other hand , is a more serious site that is still in between big and small , and focuses mainly on original fiction and poetry : a target that some users find difficult to pinpoint other places . <p> An ex-Quizillian does n't necessarily have to venture far from Quizilla , however , to find a new refuge . The Quizilla Forums , although taken off the main site , are still active . The forum is far enough removed from the main site to still host a close and generally enjoyable community . The forum 's story sections ( both Original and Fanfiction ) are noticeably slow , but still active . The rest of the forums are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politics , and are posted in on a daily basis . For Quizillians looking to achieve a more writer-focused community while still remaining moderately close to the original Quizilla standards , there 's user-created forums . <p> Trivium , a new writing-based forum created by ex-Quizillians , has been advertising itself across Quizilla , trying to garner new members . The site , powered by InvisionFree , describes itself as " An online community for people who enjoy fiction , fantasy , friendly discussions , and fantastic things . Without really awful corporate ownage . " The forum 's set-up is vaguely reminiscent of the original Quizilla forums mixed with the Ultimate Storylist forums , allowing users to post their stories and receive feedback while still having a large section of non-writing related topics . The design is clean and organized , and the set-up promises what may turn into a more relaxed alternative to Quizilla . <p> The Ultimate Storylist , considered one of the original Quizilla offshoots , originated back in 2007 , and although relatively small ( only 750 registered members ) it enjoyed a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become sadly abandoned . The main website is still open , and still lists a collection of online stories deemed " the best " of Quizilla . However updates have become a rare occurrence . <p> These are only a fraction of alternative writing sites . New sites and communities are popping up every day . A former Quizilla member even claims to be in the process of building what will eventually become a " new " kind of Quizilla , but much better . So what line of action should displaced ex-Quizillians take ? Will there ever be a substitute for the site they grew to love ? Or is there something even better waiting out there ? Only some online adventuring will answer that . With so many options , though , finding a new site should n't be a difficult task at all .

Our teeth allow us to chew through some of our favourite treats , so why would we mistreat them ? Healthy teeth are incredibly easy to attain , and every smile looks better with a full mouth of pearly whites ! This weeks Ten Ways article focuses in on how to keep your teeth healthy , no matter how old you happen to be ! <h> Swap Carbonated Drinks for Water <p> It has been well-documented over the years that carbonated drinks are full of sugar . This sugar can stick to your teeth and when it does , plaque present in your mouth can transform sugar into acid . This acid can erode your teeth gradually over time , which can be a death sentence for your mouth . To avoid this , try swapping out carbonated drinks with water or your favourite sugar-free alternative . Save the pint-glass of Coca Cola for a special occasion ! <h> Brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , but it is one of the most important things that you should do to keep your teeth healthy ! When you eat , drink or even chew gum , plaque builds up on your teeth and can cause serious problems if left to its own devices . Brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride-based toothpaste will stop plaque from building up into a problem . <h> Clean Out Your Mouth With Mouthwash <p> While brushing can remove most of the problematic bacteria from your mouth , using a mouthwash afterwards can get to those difficult-to-reach places where bacteria may lurk and cause issues later on in life . Using an alcohol-free mouthwash can further prevent problems related to your teeth and gums , such as gum disease or enamel erosion . <h> Floss Regularly <p> There is nothing more embarrassing than having a conversation with someone , just to realise that you 've had a toast crumb from your breakfast stuck in between your front teeth , there for all to see . Flossing not only prevents these embarrassing moments from happening , but will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Chew Gum <p> It may sound counter-productive but chewing gum can actually help your teeth . As long as you choose a sugar-free gum , you will do no harm to your teeth . In fact , the production of saliva that happens when you chew gum allows your mouth to neutralise acids produced after eating a meal . It is n't a tried and tested method and by no means should it be used as a substitute for brushing your teeth regularly , but if you 're a regular chewer , itll be good news that you can keep chewing gum without worrying about the long-term effects on your teeth ! <h> Avoid Cigarettes <p> Everyone has their vices , and some people smoke . Its a fact accepted by many , but it can be damaging to your teeth . If you can , avoid cigarettes at all costs as the combination of chemicals and substances in a cigarette can build up on your teeth and cause serious problems , not to mention yellow your teeth . If you 're a smoker and are n't  quite ready to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for getting rid of these chemicals on your teeth . <h> Do n't  Open Things With Your Teeth <p> Take it from someone who managed to chip their front tooth whilst attempting to get a mouthpiece out of a trumpet using your teeth for anything other than chewing food is dangerous and can cause serious problems with your teeth in later life . Even ripping open packets or pulling a needle through thread with your teeth is a potential risk , as the smallest chip can turn into a dental issue later on in life . <h> Protect Your Teeth in Potentially Dangerous Situations <p> There 's a reason why boxers wear mouth guards whilst fighting . Even one blow to the mouth can knock a tooth out and this can be problematic for several reasons . If you 're going to be doing anything where you could potentially cause injury to your face , invest in a mouth guard and use it . It may seem a little overboard , but being safer is better than spending the evening having your mouth examined in the local accident &amp; emergency department ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , this is speaking from personal experience . Any injuries , fissures , chips or cracks to your teeth should be checked out as soon as possible to avoid a more serious problem in the future . A small chip may seem like nothing to begin with , but over the years you may find that it continues to crumble and becomes quite a serious and noticeable chip . Similarly , small cracks may extend across the surface of the tooth and cause quite a lot of pain . Any issues with your teeth should be seen to as soon as possible by a dental professional . <h> Get Regular Check-Ups <p> And finally , regular check-ups are a must . Although you may think everything with your teeth are fine , a dental professional may be able to spot things that you did n't  notice . Whether its just being told to clean your teeth more thoroughly or finding that you have a cavity that needs fixing , your dentist will be able to tell you how best to care for your teeth .

With minor differences to storyline and a huge addition of sex appeal , its what the average moviegoer should be expecting , if he or she is expecting a teenage drama with excessive dancing and heartbreaking relationships . <p> The premise remains the same , with Boston cityboy Ren McCormack ( Kenny Wormald ) moving to the small town of Bomont , Georgia .

The dance sequences are fun , and well filmed by Brewer . Modernizing the film was a major challenge , given that it is especially hard to justify in a modern setting , since parents now have to worry about much more than dancing and loud music . <p> Brewers Footloose may not live up to its precedent , but its still a pretty good remake . Its sincere , humorous , enjoyable , and worth a watch . For those wanting a teenage heartthrob dance filled drama , then Footloose ( 2011 ) may be the movie for you .

So , you go into the exam hall and do the paper to the best of your ability . When you get out , you ponder over how you did . Was the question that seemed easy really that easy or was it just you trying to kid yourself ? The more you think about it , the more you become anxious to know how you did . But one set back : results do n't get in until August . <p> When I took my final GCSE exam in June , I felt a weight lift off of my shoulders . I was free from school and my exams , never to have to sit another compulsory maths exam again . However , that weight soon came crashing down again after the moment of relief had passed .

So how have I managed so far ? <p> I tried not to worry about it . It 's not easy . Trust me , I know , but it 's better to not think about the results than it is to worry constantly about whether or not you 're going to fail . I have days where I spend hours fretting about whether I 'm going to make the grades I need for Sixth Form , but for the majority of the time , I try not to think about it . <p> How well prepared did you go into your exams ?

Spend time with your friends , go on holiday , go camping , dye your hair , anything ! Personally , I 've been trying to occupy myself by participating in JulNo and Camp NaNo , the former of which did n't go so well and the latter that I 'm determined to win . It keeps my thoughts occupied so I do n't have time to fret about whether or not I failed all my exams . <p> Do n't count down the days until you can pick up your results .

I stopped after my Prom , something that I had been counting down to , and it ended up being less than pleasing .

So , it 's best to just not think about it , and whether or not there 's over a month until you can collect them , or whether it 's just under a month .

@@23757541 @3757541/ <h> How to Solve a Linear Equation with One Variable <p> In most upper level mathematics courses , you will , at one point or another , be asked to solve a linear equation . In fact , solving linear equations is often the first step to other problems , like graphing lines , and is the basis for many word problems in math . Linear equations can be scary at first , but if you have the right math skills and are taught some nice tricks , solving them can be easier than you think . There are many different ways to solve linear equations , this is just the way I do it . <p> When solving linear equations with one variable , you want the variable by itself . The first step in getting the variable by itself is to move all the constants to one side . I tend to try to keep my variable on the left , so I will always move my constants to the right side of the equation . To move a constant , you have to do the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to subtract it , and vice versa . <p> 5x+10=25 <p> To move the constant , 10 , to the opposite of the variable , you have to subtract 10 from both sides , because the opposite of addition is subtraction . <p> 5x+10-10=25-10 5x=15 <p> This leaves our 5x by itself . Unfortunately , that x still is n't alone , so we have to get rid of the 5 . Again , you have to do the opposite operation to move the 5 to the other side of the equation . Because the 5 is being multiplied , we will have to divide it . <p> 5x/5=15/5 x=3 <p> According to our answer , our variable , x , is equal to 3 ! <p> It is always a good idea to check that your answer is right . To check your answer , you will want to replace the variable you began with , with the number you got as your final answer . <p> 5x+10=25 5(3)+10=25 15+10=25 25=25 <p> It looks like our answer is right !

@@23757551 @3757551/ <p> Thistle and dead grass crunched beneath Scott 's feet as he set off into the woods . Tonight was a full moon , and it could potentially change everything . Not even two days ago had a new family moved in ; wolves . Whether it be sheer balls or ignorance they had moved in near the Argents . And Chris seemed to know every wolf in this area ; and while he may not at first of liked Allison siding with a bunch of " monsters " he had come around these past few months . That alone had n't been enough to save their relationship , ultimately they wanted different things- and about a month ago she 'd been sleeping in Issac 's arms . Deep down , Scott accepted it . She was n't meant for him , and he had become his own anchor ; something the rest of the pack was learning to do . They were shaky , at times dangerous pups as he 'd affectionately come to call them were beginning to learn to run on their own . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Hale house , and together Scott and Derek would keep a close eye on the bunch . They would usually rough house with each other , Scott himself sometimes stepping in to play . <p> Derek had informed Scott this was a critical bonding thing for the pack , let them first trust each other , while also figuring out their " ranks " . Scott would be lying if he said that they did n't have a hierarchy . He atop of it , and Derek just beneath him ; offering experience and intimate knowledge where he was green . Peter came and went as he pleased ; and so much as he did n't stir up trouble , Scott did n't mind . He 'd proven himself helpful when Jackson most needed someone ; and in Scott 's eyes he 'd earned the right to come and forth without fight so long as he did n't piss anyone off . At any rate , this night was going as well as it normally did ; until Derek paused his head swiveling towards the east . Towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in territorial aggression , he felt a low grumble take up this throat , and that 's when he heard it . The most eerie howl 's floating into the clear night , and not far at all from where Scott 's pack was camped out , a few miles from the Hale 's home , where Peter and Derek were restoring it . It was coming along nicely and soon it 'd be livable if what the alpha heard was true . As the pack sensed Scott 's panicked instinct to chase off who ever was far too close to their land , they bristled as well ; their fangs beginning to bare towards the intruders . <p> As the howls dwindled down into silence , Scott was curious- had they moved on ? Around him the night air seemed stagnant and hot , the possibility of a brawl nearing . He 'd fought Derek when he was only a beta , and we was n't scared of another pack- but his more logical and human brain whispered for him to think . There were very few howls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were here the doe-eyed teen would tell Scott that wolves use howls to signal their location . He was hesitant on what to do . " They 're summoning you . " Derek informed . Sometimes it was like the moon did n't effect him ; Scott knew better , the man affectionately nicknamed Sourwolf just had been born into a pack , and all the tricks to master the moon . They were summoning him ? Was it a good idea to leave the wolves on their own ? But if he did n't go find out what was going on ; would there be consequences . " It 's not unusual for a neighboring pack to call a meeting . Wolves are at their peak during the moon , so it 's not usual to meet now . " Derek informed him , making the young alpha grit his teeth with frustration . <p> His pack , picking up on his unease had paused , Issac getting a tad too rough with Jackson and throwing him down hard enough to the ground to make the lacrosse co-captain snarl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll watch them . " Ever the pack-pleaser the curly haired wolf mumbled around his shifted mouth and deeper tone . It would have to do . The longer Scott put off meeting them the longer it would take to find out what they wanted . " Fine , if anything happens- " Issac cut him off with a nod . " I 'll howl . " It was a good enough answer so he jerked his head for Derek to follow . What were these wolves like ? Chris had only said that he knew they were an old clan , powerful and very , very set in tradition . But overall quiet , not too many had to be put down from their family . Another howl , this one sounding more demanding and impatient split the night ; to which Scott growled under his breath . He was coming , though figuring it polite the alpha tipped his head back , his howls seemingly rattling the very trees . That ought a let them know he was coming . <p> Breaking out into a four-legged lope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the strange scent of new wolves . Trees flashed by Scott as achingly familiar scenery whipped by him , he was close to the place where his story had began ; where Peter had bit him . Dead leaves that littered the ground gave way to slightly more rocky terrain , until he reached the familiar cliffs overlooking the city of Beacon hills . The only thing that changed , was four figures , varying in shapes and sizes . He could instantly make out a man , by figure and scent , an older women- the man 's mate most likely ; and then two younger females . Straightening , retracting his claws though not his alpha gaze nor fangs , the man stepped into the silvery moonlight . It was clear he was important , the salt-and-peppered hair somehow managing to lay flat and orderly . His eyes too glowed red , and when he smiled there was the smallest glimmer of white fang . The moonlight that was pouring down from above was making his head feel muddled and his temper flare slightly . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack . And Derek Hale , I thought your pack was gone . " Was he supposed to shake this man 's hand ? And Scott 's pack did n't really have an official name , they were kind of just Scott 's pack . <p> At the mention of Derek 's previous pack Scott bit back a snarl . Was that a dig at his quiet beta ? He was n't given a chance to figure out as the man with the silvery tone continued . " My name is Sterling Ramos . This is my wife Elowise Ramos . My heir Lyra , and our youngest , Charlotte . " There seemed to be a note of genuine stress beneath this Sterling man 's voice which in and of itself was ironic as Sterling was silver and all that lore jazz . One girl , seemed confident sauntered forward while the other one hung back , only stepping forward enough to be seen . The elder one , the heir , was delicate looking and smelled ... Funny . Like heat , sand , and plains . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolves . Her hair was long , silvery blonde beneath the moonlight while her eyes thrummed a tell-tale yellow . It would appear she was n't an alpha yet . However , Scott 's attention was caught by the younger one . She seemed the least aggressive , and about as unsure of this " meeting " as he . " Is a reason you 're doing this ? That you 're here ? " <p> Lyra was n't pleased that her father had moved half her pack from their ancestral home in Upstate New York , to move across the country to California . All because he 'd heard rumors of a true alpha . His reasoning had been that this was a near once in a lifetime event , and since she was an alpha yet- which at this point was on the rocks . She may actually have to fight for her birthright , which would be the first time in over a hundred years since the Ramos pack would witness such an event . All because her shift was different . The Ramos were infamous for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the ability to shift from man to wolf . It was a requirement to be alpha of the pack . Lyra by all accounts could shift faster than her cousins and were stronger than the lot of them put together . But the one thing she was not ? A wolf . Instead her shift was a large striped hyena , which some had even accused her mother of infidelity which was nearly unheard of . And stupid since she had most Ramos trademarks- save for being a wolf . <p> But her father curious to see what this young alpha was doing with himself , and seeking potential alliances for the Ramos pack . There were always turf wars going on , and you did n't want to get yourself caught up in one of those . So , her immediate family had been packed up- where they pulled some sway to find homes close to one another in Beacon Hills . The main family was moving in first however , as they would have to introduce themselves to the current alpha . Thankfully she would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would never happen . She detested her bestial form . Charlotte had n't been thrilled about moving here either ; but for her it was just school complaints . And of course it had n't escaped either of them that this could backfire . That they could very well make an enemy out of Scott McCall and his pack . Their things had all been moved in and set up before the family arrived , the day before the full moon of course . Her father had informed her mother and sister they were going to summon Scott to introduce themselves as that 's normally what a pack did when moving onto an already existing pack 's territory . So when the next night came , her father had lead ' em up a spot close to Scott 's pack and let forth his alpha cry to meet . <p> And from there ... Sterling had been his usual self . Showing off the strength and tradition of a blood-pack , rather a bitten one . But what could she do ? If she disagreed with her alpha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to next in line shakier . Scott McCall was nothing what she 'd pictured . Lyra had seen him more ... Like her father . Instead she was shocked when after answering their summons a boy actually younger than her , likely her sister 's age , stepped from the shadows and onto the overlook . He seemed clueless , defensive even . What she had n't been expecting was to see the Hale had joined with Scott 's pack . Her father had great respect for Talia , they 'd met a few times , so she was surprised when he made that off-color remark about him being one of the last of his born pack . The true alpha , Scott was terribly green and wet behind the ears .. The moon was still agitating him , and his face was as open as a bar on a Friday night . What really amused Lyra was when he asked what their reason for summoning him was- and their reasoning for being there . She wanted to chuckle , though kept her lips pressed firmly together . Oh he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's customary . Would you rather we not make our presence known ? " Feeling that it was best if she took over , her father could be a bit ... intense she raised a slender eyebrow . " We 're here to inform you of our intent to settle for an indeterminable amount of time . A true Alpha is a rare thing . We wanted to see , this place ... Is also good for wolves . " There was a lot of ancient magic here , it was like it breathed in the earth and trees of this place . Also , summoning out Scott 's pack or at least a part of it in a non-hostile way gave her pack a decent observation of him ad weaknesses . In case it came to that in a fight ; and if Scott was any kind of smart he 'd be doing the same . " So , Alpha . I guess the question arises . Are you going to let us settle in peacefully ? Or not ? " She was tired of this song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 'd be doing . Trying to co-exist or ... The bloodier alternative . It was then she flickered her gaze to Scott 's companion , Derek if she recalled . She knew he was sizing them up by the way he remained , quiet , arms crossed over his broad chest . She 'd admit he was handsome , but now was not the time nor place to be in her father 's words , fraternize with someone who could very easily become a foe to the pack . <p> Derek had followed Scott to where the new wolves were waiting , he stood slightly off to the left and behind Scott but still close enough if the Alpha needed his help . He was weary going into this meeting although he knew it was custom for meetings to be called like this , something he never thought to mention to Scott as he had n't expected a new pack to rush to Beacon Hills . But he did understand why , a true Alpha was extremely rare and he himself would travel to meet a true Alpha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes stayed the bright and vibrant blue that shone under the moonlight , his muscular arms staying crossed over his broad chest as his eyes slowly moved over the four wolves that stood before him . It was obvious that Sterling meant business , although a low growl has formed deep in Derek 's throat when the older man mentioned his pack but he kept his cool and did n't lash out even if he wanted to . As of right now , he had no idea how many wolves were in the Ramos pack . He knew it was n't just the four of them , the Ramos pack was much like the Hale 's . It was a pack filled with only family and he had a feeling in his gut , the Ramos family would be of decent size . <p> A pack that if pushed too far , could easily win any fight . Something that Derek was certain of , was that the Ramos family were strong and very powerful . A pack that he did n't want to end up fighting , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved onto the oldest Ramos daughter , her blonde locks were loosely curled and were delicately around her shoulders . She held herself confidently which she would need when the time came for her to take over from her father , but as Derek inhaled something did n't smell right to him .

He could sense a bit of wolf on her which made no sense to him at all , it only put him on his guard even more but this was their territory and the Ramos pack would need to tread carefully if they wanted to stay in the small town for any period of time . All packs knew better about pushing themselves onto another pack 's territory , which is why this meeting was being held in the first place . <p> Glancing over , Derek looked at Scott who was clearing thinking about what was being asked of him . Meeting the familiar red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the other know that it would be better if he agreed to having them stay peacefully in Beacon Hills . " I suppose so , yes you can settle in peacefully . You wo n't be bothered by my pack , of course unless you cause any trouble for anyone in this town then we will be having another meeting . This is our home and we will protect it , " Scott spoke with as much force in his voice as he could , Derek would normally make fun of him for it because it was n't how he was . Scott was caring and would do anything for the people he loved , but when he tried to appear more like an Alpha was hilarious to Derek . " Are we understood ? " Derek asked although his eyes lingered a little too long on the oldest blonde before he quickly turned his glowing eyes over to Sterling , it was actually nice to see wolves that could control themselves against the full moon . He was helping the others and Scott as they have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control themselves since they could walk and talk . " How many are going to be arriving ? " He asked as it was better to know the size of any pack , it would be safer for them in the long run.Charlotte Ramos The Human <p> Charlotte did n't want to move from her home and friends in New York , she did n't want to start at a new school where she did n't know anyone . She did n't want to be the new girl . But she did n't have any say in the big move , she also did n't have a choice when it came to attending the meeting that her father howled for . So she just stood back behind her family and let them all speak , although her brows did raise when her eyes landed on the true Alpha . He was her age , he was still a teenager and he was the true Alpha that all werewolves had heard about . She had not been expecting someone so young that it truly shocked her , he was also attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her father would n't have a bar of it if she developed a crush on a wolf that could quickly become a foe to the family , a small part of her wished that Scott would tell them to leave . Although she knew her father , he would n't just pack the family up again and go back home to Upstate New York . He would stay as the stubborn trait ran through the entire family , she did n't need this to be happening . <p> When Elowise was pregnant with Charlotte , in the months leading up to the awaited birth . Something happened to both mother and child , Charlotte had been attacked by some bacteria which had made them both i 'll . However Charlotte 's werewolf genes kicked in early and fought the bacteria that was weakening her little growing body , the last month of Elowise 's pregnancy ran smoothly as if nothing had happened at all . When Charlotte was born , it was clear to the family that she was different . Her body used her wolf genes so much in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was mostly human now , her senses were still better than an actual human but she was no where near being a werewolf . She could n't shift at all and she had tried to for most of her life , simply nothing happened and once the family found out about her . Tension arisen between Sterling and his siblings , they never said anything in front of Charlotte but she was n't stupid . <p> Charlotte watched the back of her sister when she stepped forward to speak instead of their father , and then Scott agreed to give them space to settle into the town . " A handful or so , we really wo n't bother you or your pack dear . " Elowise finally spoke in her soft but strong voice , her long blonde locks were pulled into a slick formal bun which hardly ever changed . Their family was larger than a handful but it was easier to say that , than to go through how many where in the family and in their pack . " We have more than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alpha to know , she did n't want him to get angry because he had n't been expecting as many wolves to arrive in his hometown . She did n't want a bloody fight to break out , if it did then she would need to hide because she would be killed in a split second . She could fight and defend herself , but against an angry pack of werewolves would end with her dead body laying on the ground and she did n't want to die just yet . <p> Scott shifted when the older blonde informed him they wanted to settle down , his instincts cautioning against it . But this family had n't done anything , and while the father may of come off like a callous ass , that was n't dangerous per say . What caught his attention was the girl , the one that smelled of sand and sun , prairie and open air , informed the young alpha they had been drawn because of him . Sure he was rare , but why travel to meet him ? He was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that soft voice that did n't need to be raised to hear the power drumming beneath it , " Scott McCall your lands are a perfect storm so to speak . A true alpha , a place of old power , supernatural activity- would make any wolf curious . " So it was n't just him then . It was him and everything else about this place ; and Scott supposed she was right . A kanima turned wolf , gobs of hunters and more wolves- most recently an alpha pack . Deucalion was gone though , the Darach had been chased off , and the alpha pack was in ruins . <p> Glancing to Derek for guidance he could sense his Beta 's sharp , tangy anger Scott figured it was that Hale comment , and a more subtle scent of curiosity . His gaze was lingering on the to-be alpha before switching to the younger one ; which Scott followed . He appreciated her honesty , and for a moment he said nothing taking her features in . She was beautiful that much was certain and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see that . Her nose was small , a tad buttoned which suited her . Like the other Ramos ' there was an air of pride which was n't as in-your-face as the parents . Hair that was turned silver by the moonbeams reaching beneath her shoulders . Large eyes , seas of green and blue were watching with reserve as Scott tried to remind himself , it probably was n't wise to check-out an alpha 's daughter in front of him . Clearing his throat he nodded . " I would like to meet them . I need to know if they are capable of keeping this town ignorant to werewolves , and restraining themselves from killing innocents . " <p> Also Scott would know who exactly was in his territory . They would be outnumbered likely even with their human and non-wolf packmates . His body was tight with tension as Sterling nodded , a careless shrug . " We 'll be throwing a welcome dinner in two days time . It 's supposed to be family only ... But I do n't see the harm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be pleasantly surprised by my family 's ability to conduct themselves properly . " The moon had long ago reached it 's apex in the sky , and Scott nodded . " We 'll be there . " It was getting late , and he did n't want to leave his pack unattended for so long . Sensing his anxiety to close the meeting Sterling smiled . " Well that concludes our meeting . We will see you in two days time- although I do have another small favor to ask . " Scott narrowed his eyes , if Sterling thought he and his pack would bend over backwards to- " My youngest , Charlotte is starting at the high school tomorrow . You 'd be so kind as to help her get around would you ? " His eyes flickered over to the younger one , who looked more than a little embarrassed ; which brought a small smile to his lips . " Sure . " That Scott could do . Also it would give him time to figure out what the hell she and her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with that Sterling nodded , turning his his family " Come . " the three women nodded , and with that they were heading back to the Eastern part of town , probably their home leaving Scott and Derek alone in the clearing . Turning back wordlessly Scott took his sweet time getting back ; he had questions he wanted Derek to answer . When Scott was sure they were far enough away that Sterling would n't hear , nor the pack he stopped Derek mimicking him . " What do you think ? " Scott did n't trust the current alpha and his mate as far as he could throw them- figuratively speaking . Listening to his beta 's input he nodded , that feeling of something off with the family just beneath his skin . " There 's something up with the daughters . They are not wolves . " It was n't a question but a statement , as Scott tilted his head up towards the sky heaving off a sigh . " They seemed really proud about the name Ramos . Chris might know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alpha had a feeling that it would be a long , long time before this town had any sort of peace and quiet They chatted a bit about who to bring with them to the Ramos ' pack dinner thing , and maybe Scott should start doing that though settled for Issac and Jackson . The others could stay with the main pack in case this was some sort of trap , though both alpha and beta doubted it would . <p> His wolves had been waiting quietly in the clearing their eyes wide as they glanced their alpha over . He bore no signs of a fight , though he did n't look entirely thrilled . Questions were fired rapidly , Issac already shifted back as the moon had nearly sunk behind the treeline . Shit , Scott had n't realized how long he 'd been gone . " What are they like ? Are they friendly ? They 're not gon na start giving us a hard time right ? " At this Jackson , still very much wolfed out growled as if daring them to . Erica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's no need to get worked up . They only asked if they could move into Beacon Hills . " At this Erica 's brow furrowed . " They have to ask you ? " Letting Derek answer that one as Scott was n't entirely sure himself ; he shrugged . " The big thing is they 're having a dinner to greet the rest of their pack . Which apparently is decent in size . " This held his pack 's attention as they seemed to hold their breath . " Issac and Boyd will come with me and Derek . " There was a small ripple of outcry from Erica and Boyd , though it was silenced under Derek 's icy stare . <p> " I think dress nice ? We 'll talk about it tomorrow though . For now get in the house , the moon 's passed . " While he was n't planning on wearing a tux or anything , a clean pair of jeans and a button up would do nicely . The moon 's pull had all but worn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livable enough for them to have brought sleeping bags . When Scott woke the next morning in the middle of the newly done living room , Derek had specifically told whoever was doing this to start with that room , his back was a tad sore and glancing at his watch grumbled . By the time that he was up and out , Scott barely had enough time to get home shower , get dressed and head out to school . The meeting last night was never far from his mind , and it was n't until he was already entering the doors of Beacon high , did he recall that he had promised Sterling to help show his daughter around . It was a wise move , diplomatic and would give Scott to get to know her a little better and hopefully her family . So with a sense of determination Scott made his way keeping an eye for the new wolf , he was pretty sure her name was Charlotte ; and if luck would have it ; she may even be in a few of his classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of pack she came from . <p> About to cut in herself that they were n't just a handful , Charlotte beat her to it and Lyra sent her younger sister a small , fleeting smile of approval . Deception would breed resentment and make the initial moving into Beacon Hills much harder . The werecreature , raised a slim blonde eyebrow at Scott 's request to meet the pack- it 's full numbers . Perhaps he was a tad more wise than she originally thought . She could sense her father 's surprise and a thorn of annoyance ; as if shocked that Scott did n't trust him right of the bat . However he nodded , his face never breaking from that poker stare that used to unsettle her so much as a child . . " We 'll be throwing a welcome dinner in two days time . It 's supposed to be family only ... But I do n't see the harm of letting you an packmates stop by . I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised by my family 's ability to conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consented ; shocking Lyra though she tried not to let on . He was going to let a bitten pack to his family 's first run ? It had been ages since they had one , just a night where everyone explored the territory and caught up with one another . Did n't sound as grand as the title made it out to be . <p> Apparently she was n't the only tradition her father was keen on breaking , as he simply referred to it as a pack dinner . Her more stiff and rigid uncles and aunt would likely be pissed ; and that would be a whole ' nother family row to settle . Honestly that seemed like what most her job as leading the Ramos pack would be ; settling petty squabbles and playing referee between cousins and family . The moon overhead had begun to slowly begin is descent from the sky , and the heightened sense of power that she felt subdued in to a restless need to shift . As the young alpha shot a glance towards the stoic Hale , who ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be there . " Chancing a glance at her mother Lyra noted her smile was stiff and Lyra could tell she did n't like the idea of outsiders at a family dinner . Ironic as most her family did n't like the fact that she or Charlotte was allowed to attend pack meetings and dinners . But she supposed that Elowise fought for her daughters , and these were near-strangers . As her father announced that concluded their meeting , and then told the girls to run along Lyra lingered for a moment , though turned around to follow her family into the brush . <p> " Charlotte , I would like you to gather a little more information on Scott McCall . " Sterling said , there was no malice just curiosity though Lyra could see how that would easily backfire on not only her younger sister but the entire pack . " Or if he 's not a bully Charlotte could be friends with him . " Lyra suggested under her breath , earning a laugh out of her younger sister . " Friends are all good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of alpha young Scott is . And if his intentions of letting us settle without incident is honest . " Lyra wanted to roll her eyes . If anything Scott should be questioning the Ramos ' intention to settle without incident . " You may run . Be careful . " Since Lyra was still young , she needed to shift during the full moon and with relief she nodded , nudging Charlotte and murmuring quietly enough so her parents would n't overhear . <p> " Do n't worry about dad . You socialize with whoever you want . " And with that Lyra turned from her parents , disappearing a good enough distance to shift . The run was great , there were animals to chase and by the time the sun came up , Lyra had made her way back to the home her large , oddly colored shift melting to a reveal a dirt-streaked Lyra as she made her way to her room . She collapsed with exhaustion . Too soon her mother was shaking her , asking her to give Charlotte a lift to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother tossed a fresh dress and jacket at Lyra . " She needs to be there in twenty Lyra . " Charlotte was perfectly capable of getting to and from school on her own- but since her wolf-genes were n't as ... potent as their 's her mother and father were far more overprotective over Lottie than Lyra . So when Lyra had thrown the dress on , dragged a brush through her hair only to throw it into a messy bun , she jogged down the stairs of the spacious home , grabbing her keys off the rack by the door . <p> " Charlotte ! Come on I 'm getting in the car ! " Lyra hollered , only for her sister to poke her head from around the doorway . The drive was quiet , both girls lost in thought as Lyra listened to the GPS on her phone . While she thought Charlotte more capable than her parents gave her credit for , the elder Ramos worried about her as well . Charlotte was far more laid back than she was ; and terribly shy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make friends well enough- she did n't want her to feel pushed to befriend anyone . Namely Scott 's pack . They were pulling up when she turned her GPS down and shot a glance at her younger sister from the corner of her eyes . " Same deal as last year . If anyone gives you a hard time you call me , I 'll deal with it and we wo n't mention it to mom or dad . " As they approached the school , and the line of cars of parents dropping kids off she added . " Smile kid . No need to be nervous , you 're a Ramos after all . " It was the pep talk that was used on her and her sister when their mother would drop them off in grade school . " Besides , you 'll be the coolest kid in the grade . You 're related to me and all that . " Lyra joked , as they inched further and further up in line . Finally they were at the front and ' Lottie was hopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which was for the best , she had a few errands to run ; namely grocery shopping for the dinner tomorrow night . " Knock ' em dead . " Lyra sighed to the empty car after her sister as she pulled away , deciding to park downtown and just wander around until she found a grocery store . <p> Derek had to admit that he had n't expected to be invited to the Ramos pack family dinner , honestly he did n't know how to feel about it . Both packs were still strangers and knew nothing about each other , although he supposed this would be a good way for them to all meet each other and talk . But he still felt uneasy about it as he knew he would need to go along with Scott and whoever else he decided to bring , Derek had n't been to anything formal like this since before the fire that killed most of the Hale family . He tried to hide his emotions as much as he could as he stood there , he was still very curious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had traveled so far to be there . Not only was Scott a true Alpha but Beacon Hills held such old power , if he had n't been born into the town then he would eventually want to see it all for himself as well . <p> Once Scott agreed to attend this dinner , Derek let his gaze fall onto the oldest daughter . Lyra may not give off the usual wolf scent , but her beauty surely glowed even in the dark night . The blonde tones in her curled hair reflected against the moonlight , and only made her big blue eyes seem brighter . From where he was standing , he could see the different blue hues that streaked through Lyra 's eyes and it was obvious how much emotion was expressed through those eyes on a daily basis . But he knew better than to stare at her even if he did find her beautiful , simply staring could end with Sterling calling for a war because Lyra was his daughter . He came across like he would be extremely overprotective of his family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could very well be exactly the same . Even if the younger wolves in Scott 's pack , he may seem like this moody guy who does n't care but he does . He wants the young wolves to succeed and grow as people , which is why he often became angry if anything happened to them and he would do anything he needed to to make sure the pack was kept protected from everything . <p> " We 'll keep an eye on the entire family , this is our town and we 'll protect it from any danger . " Derek quickly assured Scott as he could smell how tense the other was , but he knew there would have been even more tension in the air if the Ramos family had n't howled for a meeting . At least now they knew what they were getting in to and who they may need to fight as some point , " We can talk to Chris about them tomorrow . After school so try to relax , you still need to be a somewhat normal teenager . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting good grades , he always made sure that Scott and the pack kept up with their studies and homework . Just because they were werewolves does n't mean they ca n't have a semi normal life after they graduate . <p> Once they made it back to where the pack were waiting , he let Scott explain about the dinner and sent an icy glare to both Boyd and Erica . They could n't take the whole pack as it would only cause trouble , and that is n't something they needed with a family that was going to be sticking around for a while . Let 's get inside , " Derek spoke clearly to the pack as they all needed sleep before school in the morning , something that he was glad that he did n't have to go through anymore . The house was no where near being done but he and Peter had gotten a lot done considering it was just them redoing the house that held so many memories , he left the pack sleep wherever they could while he went upstairs to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls were still holding strong and the floor seemed to hold his weight as he slept there for the night . The next morning , Derek was awake early like most mornings and he waited until the pack all rushed home to get themselves ready for school before he climbed into his black Chevrolet Camaro before he drove down the dirt driveway . He needed to visit the local hardware store as he needed more supplies for the house , he also had to stock up on more food as the pups really did eat him out of house and home but he would n't change it for a single thing . <p> Pulling into a parking space he killed the engine and climbed out , locking the doors of his car he begun walking towards the hardware store when a breeze of air rushed past him . His attention was captured when the scent from last night filled his nose , the fresh scent of Lyra surrounded his senses as his eyes searched for her . He glanced back over his shoulder to see the girl was climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the grin that formed across his face , " Fancy seeing you again . " He watched as she moved gracefully , the breeze brushed down a few strands of her blonde hair that fell around her beautiful face . Now that he could see her in the natural light of day , he could see her naturally rosy pink lips that curved smoothly and he would bet that her smile would light up any room.Charlotte Ramos The Human <p> Charlotte felt heat rush to her cheeks as she listened to what her father asked the true Alpha , she could n't have been any more embarrassed then she was now . She did n't need anyone to show her around the high school , she wanted to curl up and hid under a rock . But she just waited until the meeting was finished , she quickly turned around so she could head home but looked at her older sister . " Thanks , " She whispered to Lyra before watching her run off deeper into the woods so she could shift and go for a run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Even if Lyra was n't a wolf when she shifted , at least she was still a werecreature because that was more than what Charlotte was . Knowing that he father was n't being malicious about wanting her to get to know Scott McCall , she still did n't feel right about talking to the Alpha and reporting back to her family . It made her feel uncomfortable just thinking about it but she would give it a go , for her families sake although she was n't sure what she could possibly find out . <p> Making her way back into the new family home , she bid her parents goodnight before going upstairs to her bedroom . She got herself ready and crawled into her bed before sleep overtook her body , in the morning she was woken up by the sun light breaking through the curtains and by her alarm clock that was beeping at her . Groaning softly she turned her alarm clock off and dragged herself out of her bed , she ran her fingers through her blonde locks as she opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her clothes she stepped into the bathroom that she shared with Lyra and took a warm shower , it did n't take her all that long to get ready and she was back in her room making sure she had everything she would need in her backpack . She walked downstairs dropping her bag by the front door as she wanted to get herself some breakfast , while her mom had the task of waking Lyra up so she could take Charlotte to school even though she was perfectly capable of getting to school herself . <p> " I 'm coming , " Charlotte finished off her toast and rushed outside to her sister 's car , the drive was a quiet one but it gave Charlotte time to think about everything that dared to enter her mind . " I 'll call you if anything happens , but I 'm sure I 'll be fine . And me being cool has nothing to do with being related to you , I 'm not even going to tell anyone about you . " Charlotte teased her older sister as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's car placing her bag over her shoulders before she ventured into the high school . She knew her family worried about her but Lyra always gave her more space and a chance for her to be the person she was , unlike their parents would could baby her as they think that 's going to keep her safe . She did glance over her shoulder to see Lyra was already driving away , it was to late to turn back now so she pushed a door open and stepped inside . She held herself proud like a Ramos and walked at a steady pace , she found the principle 's office and stepped inside so she could get her locker and class room schedule . " Thank you , sir . " She left the office and hurried to her locker , she emptied her backpack which was heavy even to her as she had brought all her text books which her father had made sure was waiting for her . <p> She had n't seen Scott yet and was beginning to wonder if he had forgotten or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she glanced around the hallway her eyes landed on him . She felt slight relief wash over her as she was more nervous than she realised , she could feel eyes focused on her and she hated the attention that she was getting because she was the new girl . All she wanted was her big sister to be there with her , so she would n't feel so damn alone and she always felt like she could take on the world when Lyra was by her side . " Hi ... Look I know you told my dad that you 'd show me around , but if you 're busy than I 'll be fine on my own . " Charlotte told Scott even though she was supposed to get to know him , she did n't want to be a burden or have him feel like she was thrown at him . <p> He 'd been on the way to his locker when he saw her , standing off to the side gazing around wide-eyed at everything ; she was obviously new . He knew his pack was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was hard for Scott to focus on a bond further away . As he approached , he was a little taken aback by how quickly she denounced her father 's request to help her acquaint herself with the high school . " Ah , right let me check my pressing time schedule . " He joked , glancing down at his watch before humming . " Well , Ms. Ramos as it seems I 'm free ; I 'm yours until about homeroom . " He found humor was the best way of getting people to relax . He could see it working as her face softened a little , and those Aegean and emerald depths sparkled . " So , do you mind if I see your classes ? Give me a better idea where I 'm going . " He was n't a natural born leader for nothing . Scott 's voice which had been firm and stiff last night was relaxed and soothing . A sort of dopey smile was carelessly blooming on his face . There was something sweet about her , so normal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much into pack politics as the rest of her family which was probably good because Scott knew pretty much nothing about how a blood pack works , or differs from a bitten . That was something Derek would know but since it would bring it up memories of his original pack and family Scott had never asked him . After looking Charlotte 's classes over he nodded . They actually had a fair amount together , they only thing they were different in was math as that was Scott 's weakest subject and she seemed to be bright enough to be in a higher level . " Call it luck or misfortune but the only time you get a break from me is math . Third period . " Lydia would likely be in that level as it was a higher one , and the banshee was a straight up genius that could keep up with even Stiles . He was aware there were still stares in their direction but it did n't bother him all that much . Since he 'd gotten the bite the young alpha was totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit- the beautiful blonde was a little shy , and self-aware . To which Scott was actually unsure of why . <p> She was smart and kind ; she 'd proven that last night . There was an inherent gentleness about her that kind of drew Scott in . Then there was the whole mystery about what she was . Because Derek was right ; neither of them smelled like wolf . Well Lyra did n't smell like a wolf at all . Charlotte smelled so faintly of a wolf that Scott would of thought it just a secondary scent picked up from those around her by her housemates and family . True to his word he had n't brought up the pack or the meeting or anything pack-like he was thinking . In fact , as they walked about Scott pointed out the best places to find a quiet place to study or think , the places to go if you wanted to be alone or skip class and where the history class would be ; as it was also their homeroom . The almost overpowering scent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he blinked wearily . " So , tell me about your home ? I 've lived here all my life . Always thought it would be cool to get out and travel . Guess that 's not happening so much these days . " <p> As he listened to what she had to say about her homeland , turned out to be New York , he raised an eyebrow in shock . That was a long way to travel , and he could imagine Charlotte may be feeling a little isolated from her normal friends- which prompted Scott 's next line of thinking . " Since New York is far , if you want to you can always feel free to meet the rest of my pack , and hang out with us as you 'd like . Could be fun . " There was something about her that made Scott want to get to know her , and not just for the beneficial nature a strong relationship would have . Thoughts of her father and whatever trouble they may or may not be bringing to Beacon Hills was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in getting to learn more about the youngest Ramos . Around them chatter filled the room , and he was a little surprised to find it nearly first block and yet no one had shown up yet . Normally Issac and Stiles were here by now ; but Scott figured they either slept in or Stiles jeep had broken down . After a pack meeting Issac either went to Scott 's or Stiles , and since Issac had n't come back with him that morning , it left Stiles to be toting them about . <p> Luck seemed to be in her favor as there had been a near empty hardware lot to park in . She 'd only gotten out of the drivers side of her G35 , slamming the door and locking it before glancing around . So far was just a few shops , a pizzaia and a movie store which she was unsure of whether to question or be impressed by the fact a video store was still around , a Chinese food place , and of course the hardware store . There had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which made her miss New York even more by giving off the feeling it was isolated . The wind was gusting about scattering dead leaves about and the aroma of take-out saturated the city air , leaving Lyra unsure of which way to head . Frowning to herself , Lyra had turned to look across the street see if there was any hints she could find , when she heard someone call out to her . Frowning , surely it was too early for hunters to begin harassing her Lyra turned her lips pressed together ; though that frown melted into a subtle smile as a familiar Hale . <p> " You following me Hale ? " There was a light , airy tease in Lyra 's voice as she playfully raised an eyebrow ; a clear evident of how she was only playing . " You think they 'd have better ways for an alpha in training to spend her days rather than going on a grocery run . " Somewhere along the line into this conversation she 'd casually slip in that it would be great to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get home faster for some Netflix and chill before the cousins arrived . Oh that would be mayhem . For a moment she let her gaze wander over him , and his striking hazel orbs seemed far less guarded than he had last night . Understandably , Sterling had the effect of polarizing people about him . Speaking of ... " So I hope you did n't take offense to the whole Hale remark last night . My dad ... He 's a tough person to get along with but he 's just doing his best to protect the uh- family . " Figuring that it would be wise not to mention pack in public she lightly danced around the word . The petite blonde knew that coming from a Ramos it may be a weak apology ; but she could n't exactly tell a near stranger about the inner-conflict the Ramos pack was having . <p> Relieved when he announced he was going food shopping as well , her morphling eyes of color lit up with relief . " So you know where the grocery store is ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a little city ; but enough room to comfortably still reside in the ancestral home of her pack without fear of hunter or exposal . The fall air was crisp and chilly , though she tended to run hotter than a normal person ; so it was n't unbearable to stand out in the parking lot and talk to him . After all , while Sterling may be more interested in getting to know Scott and his pack , she was far more concerned with getting to know the town and the surrounding threat level . While there was undoubtedly powerful things at work here in Beacon Hills , there was also dangers . She knew for a fact that an Argent hunter and his daughter lived on her street . But since the daughter was one of Scott 's she figured that as long as she did n't do anything stupid there would be no danger . <p> There was the small problem of the Argents being like the Ramos ' or the Hale 's to the hunting circles . They were old , revered , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were likely to follow . Especially young and foolish ones hearing of the many supernaturals that had passed through in the past couple years . It was like a hotspot and Lyra was going to need to learn how to navigate this town pretty quickly . While she was trying to keep this from everyone but her parents as it was their decision ; soon Sterling would pass down the rite of alpha onto Lyra . Then the striking blonde would become the head of the family . She 'd be urged to find a mate , and honestly she was terrified of that . Her blood was comprised of warriors and alphas , the stuff that had the potential to be one of the great 's in their family . But finding a mate ? Settling down ? Nope . That Lyra was terrified of . Shaking her head of these thoughts she fixed Derek with her best " pity-on-the-newbie " expression and a hesitant smile . " If you 're going shopping I do n't suppose I could tag along ? I wo n't bore you with pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derek did n't stop himself checking out Lyra 's car , he had always been a car guy and enjoyed working on his whenever he got the chance . " Excuse me , I was here before you . So you 're clearly following me , " He shot a tease right back at her as the charming grin never left his face as his eyes stayed focused on the blonde , meeting her last night he never would have taken her as someone who would joke or tease someone . But it actually put Derek at ease to know that she could soften and be light hearted , it was the complete opposite of how her parents were but it made Derek want to get to know her more . Not because it would benefit the pack of knowing the alpha in training , but because he wanted to know her and find out what makes her laugh and tick and cry . " Well someone needs to go grocery shopping , once you are the alpha then you can make someone else do the grocery shopping . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he mentioned the word alpha , although there were n't many people wandering around the streets but he could smell that there were people in all the stores that littered the street . <p> " Do n't worry about it , I 've heard a lot worse than what your father said . I 'm a big boy , I can handle it darling . " He assured her as he had lots of time to get used to what people said about his family , which he should n't have to handle but people were n't going to stop being shitty so he just had to deal with it . " I 'm the same , I 'd do anything to keep my family safe and protected . It 's just what we have to do , " It took Derek some time before he agreed to join Scott and be his beta , he got used to being the alpha and he did enjoy the power that came with it but he was ready to step aside and give Scott his chance to be great . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boyd , Erica and even Stiles were his family . They never gave up on him , no matter how many times he pushed them away from him so they would n't get too close to him as everyone tended to leave him and he was tired of getting hurt . <p> Derek chuckled softly to himself and nodded his head , " Yeah . You can tag along with me , I always do enjoy helping out a damsel in distress . " Derek sent a cheeky wink at Lyra which was n't like him at all , he could get cheeky and charming but not with someone that he hardly knew . Saying that , there was something about the beautiful blonde that put Derek at ease . He was always so tense that it felt nice to be able to joke with someone , be around someone that was closer to his age as he was always surrounded by high school students . Which he did n't mind but it could get tiring at times . <p> " This way , " He motioned with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a little further down the street but still not that far from where their cars were parked . Turning he walked along the sidewalk , " Keep up girly . I 'm not waiting , " He called out over his shoulder to her as he heard her footsteps quickly catch up with him , the grocery store was fairly big for such a small town and the shelves held a wide range of products . Within a few seconds he was letting Lyra grab a shopping trolley before he got his own , he pulled out the piece of paper that had Erica 's writing on it as she always wrote the food shopping list which was good because Derek was terribly at shopping . So he needed a list to follow.Charlotte Ramos The Human <p> Charlotte could n't help but smile when Scott checked his watch and still wanted to show her around the school , he was different from how he came across last night but he probably thought the same thing about her . " Well I 'm glad that your schedule is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to find my classes on my own . " She was n't usually someone who would ask for help even if she needed it , she was a Ramos and they were known for being stubborn . She nodded her head lightly as she handed him her class schedule which caused some of her straight blonde hair to fall into her face , her fingers tucking the strands behind her ear as she looked at the true alpha that was standing in front of her . The dopey smile that was on his face really suited him and Charlotte wished that she would continue to see that smile on his face , " I would n't say that 's lucky . " She teased him but it had come out of nowhere , she had n't thought about what she was saying and it was already too late to take back . <p> She had never thought of herself as a smart person , she did well with her grades and liked going to school but being smart never crossed her mind . When Scott asked about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make her eyes shine from within . " Kingston is where Lyra and I were born and raised , it 's a fairly large town so coming to Beacon Hills seems tiny to me . It 's laid back and people know each other , I have two best friends that I 've known since I was seven years old . I miss it , being here does n't feel right . From what I 've seen it 's beautiful here , but it 's not home . " She told Scott as they walked through the school hallways , she took in everything that he pointed out to her especially where her classrooms were located in hopes that she 'd remember . She was n't used to being in such a small town , she did n't want to leave home and it was all new and scary to her . <p> " You can travel when you graduate , just because your a true alpha does n't mean you ca n't live your life . " Charlotte told him quietly so no one else would overhear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they wanted . Then Scott mentioned that she could meet his pack and hang out with them , it took her off guard and her footsteps stumbled slightly which she regained her balance swiftly . " Really ? I 'd really like that , Scott . " Her eyes moved over his handsome face as she really did appreciate that he was helping her out so much , he did n't even need to but he was willingly . What her father said to her last night about getting to know Scott , had n't once crossed her mind as they had been talking . In fact it was her sister 's annoyingly right voice that was stuck in her mind , that she could talk to whoever she wanted to . Her eyes scanned the room that Scott guided her into before she sat down beside him , her attention was captured when the teacher stepped up to the front but was interrupted by two boys running through the door . <p> " Sorry ... My Jeep would n't start , " Stiles wheezed out as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run from the car park to the history class room , Charlotte watched the two boys as they headed straight towards Scott . Both faulting slightly when they saw that she was sitting beside Scott , a new girl that was probably taking up their usual places . Issac could n't help himself as he inhaled the air deeply and picked up on the faint scent of wolf , he knew Scott 's scent off by heart and this scent was different and weak and was coming from the new girl . Although Charlotte had already done the same thing , to her it was obvious that one boy was a wolf and the other was a human . " I 'll move , " She whispered almost to herself as she did n't want to get off on a bad foot with anyone on her first day , especially not with anyone in Scott 's pack . <p> He just smiled when Charlotte tried to tell him that being a true alpha did n't mean he could n't live his life . " I 'm just paranoid the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which would mean probably traveling with them ; and after you meet them you 'll understand why I think it 's in the public 's best interest we not all be stuck on a plane or in a car together . " Scott joked . It was honestly something he worried about . Sure Derek could probably hold fort down , but there was that small " What if " that really made Scott nervous . This pack was his family ; for some of them the pack was all they had . They looked to Scott to look after them , to lead them ; and if he failed them ... Scott had no idea what he would do . He was rather pleased as she agreed to hang out with the pack ; for no other reason than to make her feel welcomed . " That 's great . They 'll love to get to know a new face . " Scott promised , though was cut off by the sound of familiar steps pounding down the hallway . Perking his head up , furrowing his brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stiles and his piece of shit jeep . <p> Stiles of course was quick to defend his " baby " though they both shut up as they burst through the doors Stiles huffing and puffing , red in the cheeks while Isaac , looked torn between amusement at Stiles ' state , and annoyed with being late . The two got on like cats and dogs , probably because Isaac had once tried to eat Stiles , though Scott knew they actually did like and care for each other . Like the rest of the pack . They may bicker nearly constantly sometimes , but it was like siblings . There was no actual real bite beneath the words , and in an instant the pack was ready to lay down their lives for each other . It did n't take long for Stiles and Isaac to head to their usual seats , though his very human best friend faltered upon seeing a rather new and delicate looking girl in his seat in conversation with Scott . Was this the new wolf that Isaac had been talking about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was glowing with a self-confidence that honestly it was way too early for , figured this girl was not a threat . She did n't look like the other werewolves he 'd encountered . There was some innate soft gentleness that did n't make him feel like he could easily be snapped in half . <p> Hearing her offering to move Stiles just shook his head , " It 's fine . " Watching as his best friend turned to Danny he offered a wide , goofy grin . " Danny , you never answered me , Am I attractive to gay guys ? " Scott frowned as Danny groaned and got up , moving to sit near the windows with a few other lacrosse players . With a seat now secured near Scott , next to the new wolf Stiles plopped down leaving him to glance at Scott . " Right ! Isaac , Stiles- this is Charlotte Ramos . Derek and I met her uh- last night . " Lowering his voice a little to the point Stiles had to lean forward to catch the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed for a moment ; a sort of hesitant curiosity . " Welcome to Beacon Hills Charlotte . " Finally chirped after a moment , Isaac offering a quiet greeting as well . Relieved Scott sat back and let her chat with his packmates for awhile before Coach Finstock cleared his throat . " Alright everyone shut up , we 've got a new student Charlotte Ramos . " He stated sweeping his hand towards her . The rest of the class was spent in a surprising lull . Usually classes were spent trying to figure out plans on how not to die . Instead Scott found himself actually able to pay attention- for the most part . <p> Classes came and went and by the time that Scott walked Charlotte to her third class she 'd met a good deal of his pack including , Lydia , Boyd , and Erica . Lydia was her usual self , giving a skeptical glance over before a terse hello , Erica and Boyd exchanged a glance of amusement that was lost on the alpha as Erica purred a silky hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised that he 'd pick her up and take her to the lunch room . As he walked away towards math he could n't help but feel that maybe ... just maybe after the utter shit-storm the past couple years had been that things were beginning to look up . Math passed infuriatingly slow , the only friend in that class was Isaac , who was whispering under his breath the whole time about the dinner fretting . " What if they do n't like us . What if it 's a trap . Charlotte is nice but who knows about the rest of the family ? What is she ? She 's wolf but not . " <p> Finally Scott had fixed him with a stern gaze and ordered him to just drop the subject of the Ramos ' . That he would take care of it , and okay maybe Scott wanted his pack to like Charlotte more than just a little . Finally it was time for lunch , and with a promise to meet Scott in at their normal table Isaac was scurrying off . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gently as possible out into the halls he was also admittedly curious of what Charlotte was . But that was n't important enough to him to just flat-out ask . All the alpha cared about was she was a good person ; with no intentions to harm his pack . Nearing the classroom he 'd dropped her off at he nodded to her , waving to get her attention . As the blonde walked over he tilted his head . " How was your LONG ... <p> Lyra Ramos The Outcast Heir <p> She had n't expected the Hale beta to be charming ; yet Lyra found herself blushing as he spoke . Business and politics she could breeze through , fighting and defending pack was like breathing ; but these subtle flirtations ? If they could be called that ? Lyra was out of depth there . There was hardly ever a time that Lyra was shocked into silence- now was one of those times though as she stared after his retreating figure . As Derek made a casual comment about damsels and whatnot it gave her pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurry up that Lyra shook herself out of her reverie . The moss-and-stone-eyed beta was likely just being kind . After all it would make further interactions much easier if they all got along . " Aye , Aye captain . " Lyra rather saucily saluted him , sauntering after the onyx-haired wolf . She called after being told he was n't waiting up for her ; though she could hear the playfulness beneath his words . <p> The store was better than what she was expecting , and likely she would n't have to make any other stops to get the food her mom had asked for . As the two strolled into the store , and Lyra grabbed a cart from the corner of her eye she noted Derek pulling a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket . It was clearly a shopping list which made the corner of her eyes crinkle up with a gleeful smile . It was just so ... Domestic that Lyra had kind of expected him to grab a few hunks of meat and call it a day . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are things in Beacon hills in terms of hunters ? " There were little ones in her pack that was migrating here ; and not all of them wolves . It was easy enough to drill into the human children they were not to go out on a full moon , nor near the woods . But if hunters were going to give them a problem than it would be wise to move the children back to Upstate New York . No sense in risking lives . The other wolves , well Lyra was sure that they could handle themselves . <p> Listening to his response as they made their way first to the snack section , she nodded . Problems with hunters in the past , though on good terms now ? She could work with that . It would be one of those ongoing things that Lyra would keep an eye on . Pausing , snatching up some different flavors of chips and and some salsa from further down the isle Lyra was trying to calculate just how much she 'd need for the dinner tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all there were about thirteen cousins , and five more spouses . Then there would be her grandparents , grand-uncle and grand-aunt ; then Scott 's pack . And that was just a small sliver of the Ramos pack . Her least favorite people would be her Uncle Levi and his family . He and his family had made it well known that their oldest , Elijah deserved the alpha position and had n't been shy about letting Lyra know this . " He 's older than you , a real wolf and a real alpha male . Why would n't he ascend to alpha position ? " Arlene , Elijah 's mother asked her the last time they saw each other . <p> There would be a lot of play-fighting and Lyra knew that it would hold a deeper meaning . Frowning lost in thought the bright-eyed woman decided that six bags of chips would be enough before tossing them into her cart . Her mood was slightly dampened by her thoughts as she pushed her cart next to Derek 's before glancing over at him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting , making Lyra furrow her brows together . " I 'm not the biggest glutton you 've ever met ; this is for tomorrow and spoiler alert , everyone 's going home with some leftovers . " She was curious to know if he was going , though since she 'd sworn off talking about pack politics she refrained from asking . " What 's next on your list ? " She asked , nodding towards it . Luckily on the way to his next item they passed by the meat section . Lyra ended up tossing the best looking steaks and pork roasts into the cart to probably feed a small army . Like the Ramos pack . Overhead soft music was playing , some sugary pop-beat of which was no interest to Lyra . She 'd always preferred rock and roll type music . " So , what is there to do in Beacon Hills ? Besides clean out the grocery store ? " Her voice was quiet , never losing that musical lit of confidence . <p> Derek did n't want to glance over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew exactly how he looked and did n't need to hear anything from her about it . It was n't manly but it was better than him grabbing a cart full of junk food and taking that home , Erica and Boyd still lived with their family but often stayed at the Hale house with Issac and himself . So the food was mostly for himself and Issac who did n't have any family left apart from the pack , but Erica had told Derek off several times about not having healthy food at the house which is why she always made sure to write him a shopping list so he does n't have any excuses . His feet carried him down the aisle and he grabbed several packets of chips and dropped them into his own cart , " We have the Argent 's here . Chris has recently decided to side with us , his family have been hunters for centuries and they did cause us trouble . Some members were more ruthless then others , but you can trust Chris . Sterling may still want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to bring up what Kate Argent did to him or his family , he might tell Lyra one day if he trusted her enough but right now she did n't need to know what happened . <p> Pausing briefly he grabbing a couple of packets of cookies as he did have a sweet tooth , not that many people knew that from his rough exterior . He raised a thick brow when he noticed that Lyra was getting more food than he was , " I was n't going to say anything about it . But I will admit that I love left-overs , " He told her as he would take as much left-over food as he could , it would save him from having to food anything and that was good in his eyes . He would n't say that he was looking forward to the dinner , well actually he was because he loved food and he loved eating but he was n't looking forward to meeting more of the Ramos family . He was n't the most open person when it came to meeting new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if someone pushed his buttons then he would push back even more . He never let anyone walk over him or use him , he learnt that from when Kate Argent used him and since then he 's become more closed off and protects his heart from being broken . <p> " I need to get some meat and bread , some drinks as well . " Derek glanced down at his list before he stopped at the cold display where the meats were , he grabbed a few different sandwich meats and some steaks and chickens as they were easiest to cook when it was just him and Issac at home . He moved onto a few more aisles so they could finish shopping as quickly as they could , Derek never liked spending time shopping as he did n't enjoy it but it was a task that needed to be done . " There 's plenty to do here , probably not as much as you 're used to but we still have an ice rink , a movie theater , a bowling alley , a few clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places that Beacon Hills had to offer , he was n't sure what Lyra was looking for but there were places to go and hang out when she wanted to get away.Charlotte Ramos The Human <p> Charlotte did understand why Scott was worried about leaving his pack , she did n't completely understand why as she was n't an alpha so she did n't have the pressure or responsibilities of looking after a pack of werewolves . So she just gave Scott a warm smile in the hopes that would reassure him , " I ca n't wait to meet them . " Although Charlotte hoped that his pack would like her , she knew that she did n't smell strongly of a wolf and that she would be asked about it which she was n't excited about because it has always been a touchy subject for her . Anything that reminded her that she was n't a werewolf hurt her deeply , she had learnt to deal with the pain and hide it from her sister and parents but it was still hard on her . Especially when her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying that she was a disgrace to the family and not wanting her at pack meetings . She sent both the boys a bright smile before hearing the comment that was made to another boy that was sitting on a chair close to Charlotte , she watched as the boy left and the chair to be filled with a boy called Stiles . " Thank you , it 's nice to meet you both . " She spoke softly and sweetly as she wanted to make a good first impression on them . <p> Her attention was captured by the teacher who pointed her out to the class but did n't make any fuss which she was thankful for , the classes went by as usual and Charlotte soon felt herself getting back into the swing of things even if she was still receiving stares from many other students . As the day went on she met more of Scott 's friends and pack members , she was friendly to them all even if a few were skeptical about her which she had been expecting . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single pack out there has gone through hard times and Scott 's pack would n't be any different . " I 'll see you after class then , " She smiled when he dropped her off at her maths class , stepping into the classroom she suddenly felt lost again like she did that morning before Scott found her at her locker . He was n't there with her , she could n't sit beside him and ask him any questions if she needed help . She noticed Lydia was already sitting at a desk and although the red head had n't given her a warm welcome , Charlotte would rather sit beside her than on her own for at least her first day . <p> So she stepped over to the desk and placed her books and pencil case down onto the wooden surface , sitting on the plastic chair she gave Lydia a small ' hello ' before they both focused on the work that the teacher was giving out . For Charlotte , the maths class went by quickly and the ringing bell hit her ears just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . Packing up her books she made her way out of the class room and watched as Lydia wandered off without saying a word , she 'd just give the girl some more time to get used to her . Seeing Scott waving at her , Charlotte walked over to him and chuckled softly . " It was really good , the time flew by though . What ? " She asked when he gave her a look , an expression she used on her older sister a lot when Lyra wanted to do something that Charlotte was uncertain about . It was the ' are you crazy ' expression . <p> " Stop it , I 'm not crazy . " She laughed for the first time since arriving in Beacon Hills , her eyes crinkled and her face just lit up . Lyra would give her that look whenever Charlotte willingly did extra school work , she shook her head lightly as she turned towards the direction that she thought the cafeteria was in . " I 'm starving , let 's go before I get grumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy herself in this town , she was still homesick and wanted to see her friends again but maybe Beacon Hills was n't as horrible as she made it out to be . <p> Scott winced when she said the class went well before making a ludic face . " I think you might have to tutor me in math . " It was no secret that was one of his weakest subjects ; and science but that was also partially because Harrison hated him . As they leisurely strolled down the halls he snorted at her next words . " A grumpy Charlotte ? Sounds as terrifying as intriguing . " The main flood of students rushing towards the lunchrooms had trickled out , though a few stragglers were still out and about . " So I 'll see you tomorrow night right ? " It 'd be nice knowing there was going to be at least one friendly face . To be honest he was terrified about going . He had no idea what to expect , what her family was like and what their pack dynamics were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already brewing in the Ramos pack . What he did know was they were a big family as Charlotte had informed him last night ; and all born wolves . <p> Apparently that meant something to them as Sterling had almost sneered the word bitten- as if it were a bad thing . Sure he was n't born into a pack that knew already how to control themselves ; but he was learning and teaching . Which was the important thing . But did the rest of the Ramos pack hold the same belief that bitten wolves were beneath blood ones ? He supposed he 'd find out tomorrow ; and just hoped he would n't make an ass of himself . For those going to the meeting tomorrow night would head to Derek 's tomorrow so he could introduce them to the world of wolf politics . Reaching the lunchroom , pointing out bits of the school along the way Scott was recanting the story of how he 'd met the wolf who 'd turned him here face to face for the first time . Of course he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become fractured after that , they thought Derek had died- though Scott left all that out . <p> " When I was first bitten , it was pure luck . The guy who bit me was , is ? Kind of crazy . Was homicidal back then- it was a revenge thing , but see those windows ? " Pointing to the one in the back he chuckled awkwardly " All new . The insurance on this place must be astronomical . " Finishing his story as he led her to the table where his wolves were already waiting for him he could feel seven pairs of eyes shift towards him . Scott figured the more he opened up about himself , would show he had nothing to hide . " So you 've met Lydia , Boyd , Erica , Isaac and Stiles . " at the mention of their names each greeted her in their small ways . Stiles grinned , his whiskey depths lighting up happily , Issac dipped his head respectfully while Erica grinned and Boyd greeted her in a small voice . Lydia just tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just her nature , nothing was meant by it so Scott did n't say anything . " And the last members of the pack are Jackson , and Allison . " His ex was holding Isaac 's hand , her head resting on his shoulder while she smiled wearily up at Lottie . <p> The ever present , bitter scent of wolfsbane clung to her clothes and awkwardly Scott glanced away . It was n't so much that he was still cut up about the end of their relationship- it was just that it was a little soon to see her with someone else . And he did n't want the pack being broken up because of stupid teenage drama . Jackson gave his signature cocky smile and wink ; causing Scott to hold back an annoyed huff . The alpha knew he would n't ever do anything to hurt Lydia , but it still got under his skin . " I actually think we live on the same street . " Allison spoke up , trying to be welcoming . Her transformation since coming to Beacon Hills had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was determined to hunt down Derek and his pack when the beta had been alpha . Now tensions had mellowed out between hunter and wolf . That was n't to say Chris was pleased she was dating another werewolf ; though was warming up to his curly haired friend . <p> Other than his pack mates watching Charlotte with a curiosity reminiscent of their bestial counterpart , things went pretty smoothly . Even Lydia was being kind , chiming in about their English teacher with an eye-roll and a small rant about the " menial " reading they 'd been assigned which was n't in the least challenging and over-used as a curriculum piece . The alpha had thought it was pretty challenging though his summer had been a tad preoccupied with trying to survive so he had n't spent a lot of time reading the book . Then , lunch was winding down and it was time for Scott 's gym class . He had Allison in this class and Jackson ; though no one else . And after checking classes with Charlotte realized that he had no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class he 'd cut a bit early to bring Charlotte to her next room ; before rushing to his . And then her first day was over . On his way out he noticed her heading towards a sleek looking candy-apple colored car and sent her a wave . <p> If the Ramos ' were like Charlotte , than he thought that everything would be fine . Then it was off to his house with Isaac . He would often alternate between staying with Derek and " His creepy uncle " and staying with Scott and Melissa . Once the two wolves got through the door , dropping their things down before thundering up to his room while Melissa shouted for them to do their homework before doing their " Wolfy " things . His mother was an honest saint . Which reminded him to tell her he 'd be gone tomorrow and would n't be back until either late Saturday or Sunday . They had finished their homework , and then just relaxed . Isaac had been in one of his moods where he 'd mostly just stared off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was n't much Scott could do but if his packmate wanted to talk than he 'd be happy to listen . They finally passed out on the floor of Scott 's living room around one , the world outside cast with gloom and night . Scott 's dreams were filled with echos of howls upon howls , and he awoke with a sense of panic late the next day . Night had long since bled into day and day melting to afternoon . Shit , of course this would be the day that Scott overslept . Swearing under his breath the alpha took the steps two at a time until he reached his bathroom , showering quickly and wrapping a towel around his waist as he made his way to his room to pick something out . <p> He 'd been ready to settle for his black and white checkered button up and a pair of newer looking jeans that was n't stained with dirt from his many nights out in the woods when he heard a quiet knocking on the door . " What 's going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering if he woke her Scott shrugged . " New family moved into Beacon Hills . Werewolves ; they 've got a daughter my age so I 'm going to meet them all . Make sure they 're all safe . " A slow smile touched on his mother 's lips as she crossed her arms . " Well I hope they 're kind . We do n't need anymore bodies at the morgue . " Nodding Scott , buttoned up his last button before striding over to his mother to hold her wrists . " I 'm gon na keep everyone safe . " Melissa just reached out , patting her son 's cheek . " I know . Go on , go get ' em alpha . " Since coming around to what he was ; Melissa had adjusted incredibly well . " I 'll be home tomorrow . The moon 's passed for the month and we 'll settle pack things later . " Sometimes Scott just felt bad for leaving his mother alone so often . <p> If someone wanted to hurt him ; the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he knew that she was good friends with the Sheriff and if Scott needed he could him come check on his mother . Isaac had showered and dressed while he and Melissa were chatting , clearing his throat as he came into the room . " So we should get going . Sorry Scott 's mom . " Sometimes Isaac had a habit of still referring to Melissa as Scott 's mom , though she did n't particularly mind . " You two protect each other . Understand ? " Isaac snorted , running a hand through his hair . " We 're not going to war . " Rolling her eyes Scott 's mother cuffed the back of his head lightly before setting off through the house mumbling about finally she could take a peaceful nap . They boys were quick to head downstairs , Scott grabbing the keys off the rack . The drive to Derek 's was quiet , and when they pulled up Scott could sense Erica and Boyd already there along with Derek . Hopefully the beta 's lecture would n't be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derek listed off the things to do around here she sighed with relief . " Good , looks like there 'll be some places for me to sneak out to . Sitting around with bickering cousins can be a little agitating . " Leaving out what exactly most family fights were about she had finally a nearly overflowing cart of food , and decided that the dinner would completely taken care of . Derek 's cart was n't looking too shabby either as they made their way towards the checkout line . Soon ingredients and snacks alike were scanned and checked out by sleepy looking employees . As Lyra paid , she waited a moment for Derek figuring they could at least walk back to their cars together . She 'd fallen quiet again , her face sobered by her own thoughts . Derek , did n't press her and for that she was thankful . If Lyra was honest she enjoyed his company . Finally they were back in front of the hardware store and Lyra scuffled her feet against the dead leaves before speaking up . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you maybe tomorrow night ? And if not than I 'll make sure your pack is okay . Alpha 's promise . " <p> She could only imagine how important pack was to the mossy eyed man . After all , pack was naturally something wolves protected with their dying breaths ; but after losing your entire family ... Lyra imagined that he 'd get antsy if they went without him . She would be late to pick up her sister so glancing over her shoulder once more she reminded herself she was an alpha to be , so there was no reason for the butterflies in her stomach as he smiled at her . Pulling out of the parking lot Lyra ignored pretty much every stop sign in Beacon Hills as she pulled up to the house wrinkling her nose . Derek was right , Chris Argent certainly was a hunter as their whole block had a subtle scent of wolfsbane . It was something she really had to focus to sniff out so it was n't a huge deal . Dropping the grocery bags off on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With that done it was back to the school to pick up her sister . There was an ungodly long line of people waiting to pick up their kids . Relishing in the solitude as she listened to her music it was n't too long before the bell was ringing and kids were charging out in search of their cars . <p> As the flood of kids trickled into just a small stream of them , she spotted Charlotte with Scott , and an amused grin pulled up Lyra 's lips . She was so teasing her about it . What made her brows furrow together was the look that Scott sent her sister , something mixed with a breathless elation and just ... happiness . Apparently the two had really hit it off . Shaking it off as Charlotte slid into the passenger seat , Lyra turned her music down and chuckled as they pulled off . " You two looked cozy . Do n't tell dad or he 'll really have a problem . " Watching her fragile looking sister flush she broke off into peals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting a subtle gloom upon the town as the eldest Ramos pulled into the driveway noting the groceries from earlier were already put away . Tonight and tomorrow would be devoted to begin cooking desserts and then tomorrow the actual main meal . " So how many friends you 'd make ? " <p> As Charlotte began talking rather animatedly about Scott 's pack , Lyra relaxed . It would appear that she did n't have to worry about her sister being teased or harassed which was a huge relief . Since she was n't a high school student anymore thank god Lyra always kind of worried that her sweet sister would have a bit of a hard time making friends . As the girls waltzed through the door of their house , Sterling could be heard calling " Charlotte , how was your first day ? Also , Lyra we must speak . " That sounded serious and paling wondering if he had scented Derek and had a problem with it she just nodded stiffly . " Yes father . " While Sterling and Charlotte spoke about her day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch as her mother had bowls set out , and what smelled like cake already in the oven . " Can we put wolfsbane in Elijah 's food ? " Lyra asked innocently while Elowise shot her a stern look ; though it was obvious she found it funny . <p> Elowise did n't care for Uncle Levi 's family either , as he had been the one to raise questions about the legitimacy of Lyra 's parentage . " Someone 's feeling cheeky today . " Shrugging , leaving out she met Derek again- her parents could be weird about socializing with other packs she did as her mother asked , mixing things and getting what she could ready before Sterling meandered into the room . " Lyra , I think that it 's time you became alpha . Your mother and I discussed it today- and we think it 's wise . Here is a fresh start , and a young pack that may relate better to a young face such as yourself . " Her father , never one for wasting words made Lyra nearly choke on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been groomed for this since birth , though her father simply shook his head . " I 've already called grandpa . He 's agreed . It will be announced tomorrow night . And next full moon is when your ceremony will take place . " There was n't much that Lyra could do but nod , sending her blonde locks bouncing about her face . " Yes father . " <p> The rest of that night was spent preparing , and the next day cleaning the home furiously . The house smelled heavenly as strong aromas of heady meat drifted about . Lyra hardly noticed it . Since hearing the news she 'd soon become alpha the curvy blonde had been lost in her thoughts . It would come as a surprise to Charlotte , so she was n't really allowed to tell her younger sister what was bothering her when asked . So the eldest sister had merely said she was dreading Uncle Levi 's arrival which was n't exactly a lie . By noon everything was pretty much cooked , food being kept warm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grandparents arrived . Soon after them cousins and aunts and uncles came pouring into the Ramos home . She was greeted with varying degrees of respect , and when Uncle Levi had come he 'd barely so much as glanced at her . It was infurating . But as the family began to spill out towards the backyard where things where large hedges obstructed any view of neighbors . <p> She was enjoying a hard cider when she heard a familiar voice , " Little Hyena what 're you doing ? Pack wants to play with you . " Holding back a dark growl she turned her gaze onto Elijah . He 'd gotten far more muscular and she knew what he wanted . It was customary for wolves to play-fight with each other ; though in Lyra 's case it was more like she was proving herself . And Elijah was her first challenge . " You 'll show me respect Elijah . My name is Lyra to you . " Her voice had lost that warm note it usually carried , and glancing around she noted Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unease . He could step in and tell Elijah that he needed to back off ; but that would reflect poorly . Her dark haired cousin simply glowered as wolves had subconsciously cleared a space in the middle of the yard for the pair . Tipping back her cider and finishing it off she shed her leather jacket , placing it on the table while she put her hair up . Elijah had growled with anticipation to prove to the family he was a better alpha than Lyra , and soon his human features had shifted revealing the wolf . <p> Lyra had shifted as well , not to her full form , but her claws and fangs had come out to play . At first the two circled each other restlessly before Elijah made the first lunge ; but he was slow and stepping aside Lyra brought her foot up to kick him literally in the ass sending him stumbling forward . " Four months and this is the best you can do ? " She taunted hoping to work him up into a blind rage . It worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of her eye she was distracted by a couple familiar faces . Scott and Derek . The music that was playing in the backyard covered up the growls from the two wolves . Her distraction proved a mistake as Elijah had shoved her had , bringing her down . His gasp was tight as Lyra landed with a groan . She hated family dinners . <p> Making enough room to throw her elbow back she felt a sickening crack as her cousin 's nose was broken . He let out a snarl of pain ; momentarily stunned . It 'd heal but for now it gave her enough of an opportunity to knee him . Lyra never said she 'd fight fairly . While he was writhing in pain she got to her feet , placing one foot against his throat . For a moment he gazed up , furious before gritting out he submitted and shifting back . That would be enough roughhousing for now as Lyra had proven she was still a capable fighter . The reactions were mixed ; Charlotte looked thoroughly amused though that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat horrified at what he 'd just seen . Her father was beaming , very clearly proud while her mother looked smug and her grandfather gave her a nod of approval . <p> The music was once again covered by noise as people resumed their chats , sprawling back out as the fight which had been furious in intensity though short-lived if Lyra wanted to she could of dragged that out . Going back to her previous spot she was stopped by her Aunt Lin . " Are there bitten wolves here ? " There was a note of confusion and a bit of odium in her voice as Lyra nodded . " Dad invited them . " Her aunt nodded , distantly congratulated her on the win before disappearing . As she approached the cooler , bending down to pick up another cider the woman felt a presence behind her and turning around came face to face with mossy depths . " Hey . Drink ? " She was a little mortified that he 'd seen that . What the Ramos pack called roughhousing , was n't done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation to prove themselves and figure out ranks and hierarchy without actually hurting each other as you were n't supposed to use claws or fangs . The blonde was all too aware of the stares that he was getting ; outsiders were not always welcomed at the Ramos ' home . <p> Derek knew exactly what it 's like to be surrounded by family , when he was younger he would constantly sneak away because it could be irritating but now he missed those moments and wished for nothing but to have his family alive again . " If you need some company when sneaking away , just ask . " He told her kindly as he meant what he said , moving to a new town would be hard and he wanted Lyra to be comfortable there . " Oh I 'll be there , I 'd never miss out on a free meal . " He told her with a cheeky grin as they walked back towards their cars , he watched as she drove off before he went into the hardware store . He picked up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drove himself home , he carried all the bags inside and worked through putting all the groceries away . He had made sure that the kitchen was semi working , there was a working fridge and freezer although he had n't connected the stove yet . So anything that he wanted cooked was done outside on the barbeque , which was easier than connecting the stove as he had no idea how to actually do that and did n't want to burn down the rest of the damaged house . <p> He had the night to himself as Issac was over at Scott 's house , so he did a lot more work on the house as he was n't getting distracted very two seconds by the younger betas ' . It kept him calm for the most part and he 'd take a break whenever he needed it , once the sun faded and the sky slowly turned dark . He cooked himself something to eat before going on a little jog and then he fell into his bed , sleep overtaking his relaxed body within seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after eating a large breakfast he set onto the rest of the kitchen as it was a large room and would take him time before he would be happy with the finished product . He lost track of time as afternoon rolled around and he checked the time on a wall clock , he went into a downstairs bathroom to shower all the sweat and dirt from his skin . He had found a pair of black jeans and a black button up shirt , he got himself dressed and pulled on his trusty leather jacket while he wanted for Scott to arrive with Issac as he could hear Jackson parking his own car outside . <p> He knew it would be Scott and Issac that would be the late ones , but he waited with Jackson for the two wolves to arrive . " Great impression this will be , " He snarled at Scott and Issac although he honestly did n't really care , it was still early enough that they would n't be terribly late to the dinner and if they were than he 'd blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed into Derek 's car before he drove off through the town towards the Ramos house , he parked on the street and climbed out while giving the house a one over glance . " Sounds like everyone is already here , " He murmured to the boys as he locked his car and had a bad feeling about this dinner , although he ignored those feelings and walked down a side path that lead to the backyard where everyone was . Both of his thick brows raised instantly as he watched Lyra play fight with a guy who Derek assumed was a cousin , once it was over he stepped over to Lyra . " Yeah thanks , that 's one way to welcome us . " Derek could n't stop the smile that settled on his lips , he could feel eyes on him but his attention was all on Lyra . He knew outsiders were n't welcome as he could feel that , but they had been invited so everyone else could deal with the pack being there . He had done a little bit of play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was something the younger wolves to for fun honestly . Well it was for fun in his family as the meaning behind it , changed for every family and pack.Charlotte Ramos The Human <p> The school day finally ended and Charlotte was glad to get her backpack and leave , classes seemed to drag when she was n't sitting beside Scott although she 'd never mention that to anyone . She gave Scott a small wave as they walked outside and headed off into two different directions , she slid into Lyra 's car seconds before her comment and a flush to settle across her cheeks . " No , we did n't . You 're beginning to see things again , " She told her sister even though the redness on her cheeks was a dead giveaway , " He 's really nice . That 's all , he showed me around for the whole day so I would n't get lost . " She always panicked when she got lost so she was glad that Scott was there to help her , " I made seven friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I like them . They were unsure but they still welcomed me , " She explained as she would n't call any of them friends right now , although Scott and Stiles were pretty warm and amazing for making her feel like she belonged there . As she followed her sister into their house , she set her bag down by the stairs before she walked into the living room and sat on the couch beside Sterling . <p> " It was really good , I met Scott 's pack and I like them Dad . I doubt that we 'd have any problems with them , their all really just normal teenagers . " She reassured her Dad before she went off and told him how her classes were and what she did for lunch , a little bit more about how nice Scott was to her as Sterling sat there listening to every word his youngest daughter said to him . " That 's wonderful , darling . How about you go get your homework done , tomorrow is going to be busy . " Sterling smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her run off upstairs to her room , it did n't take Charlotte that long to finish the work that the teachers had given her in class . So once she was finished she headed back downstairs to help her mom and sister in the kitchen , they finished all the prepping before Charlotte tucked herself into her bed and got some sleep before the busy day that was ahead of them . <p> Charlotte cleaned all the rooms that needed to , although nothing was dirty but it gave her something to do before she helped Elowise in the kitchen as she enjoyed cooking with her mom . She smiled widely when her grandparents arrived and gave them both a long hug , they had always been there for both Charlotte and Lyra . They did n't seem to care that both girls were different , their love for their granddaughters would never change . Charlotte greeted all their family members as they arrived , of course some were simply given a quick ' hello ' while others received warm hugs as the girls wanted them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink of soda and stood with her father who was talking to Uncle Theo , Theo was Sterling 's younger brother and has never said or thought a bad thing about his niece 's . In fact he married a human woman and had many non-wolf children , so a little difference in the family was something he liked . <p> It did n't take long before Elijah decided to start something with Lyra , she watched concerned for her older sister and went to step in although Sterling stopped her . Told her to let Lyra handle it as they stood there watching , Charlotte was amused when Lyra won the fight which she knew her sister would . Elijah really was all talk about wanting to become Alpha , the family would fall apart if Elijah did become the next Alpha once Sterling felt like stepping aside . She smiled when she noticed Scott had arrived , she walked over to him , Issac and Jackson . " Welcome to our home , do you want a drink ? " She asked them and took them over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them pick out a drink . " Sorry about that , I did n't think Elijah would be so quick to start . They were just playing , we 're not meant to hurt anyone . " She explained as they still seemed a little freaked out and she did n't blame them , they were all bitten besides Derek so they would n't know about how some families could play fight . She could feel the stares coming from her family but knew her dad would speak up about why Scott and his pack were there , once dinner actually started . Charlotte had decided to wear her blonde hair up in a messy bun , she wore a nice navy dress that flared out slightly around her waist and tights covered her legs to keep her somewhat warm . <p> Derek was antsy about getting there when he and Isaac arrived ; grumbling about being late . " Why you got ta date ? " Erica taunted , though quickly shut up under his stare . The ride there was Derek pretty much just going over etiquette on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramos business , do n't insult anyone , try not to get into any fights though there may be playfighting which if asked was okay to engage in ; and for the love of god do n't get on their bad side . It seemed easy enough but as they pulled up Scott paused , his nose flaring . There was some warning bell in his head that something was going to happen , but he could n't quite place his finger on it . " Should we have brought something ? " Scott pondered aloud while Jackson snorted . " Like what , here 's a deer , uncooked and still kicking . Welcome to Beacon Hills . " Scouring Scott shut up , in time for his delicate ears to pick up the sounds of growls and snarls . And then he heard a crash as if someone had fallen to the ground . Curious Scott noticed a few things as they entered the backyard . <p> The first and foremost was that Charlotte was standing with her father and some unknown men , and Scott would admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had formed in the middle of the yard and pushing to the front , god there were a lot of people , Scott found a familiar looking alpha to be and a dark haired man . They were snarling at each other , shifted out already but it was hidden beneath the music to human ears . Holy . Shit . They had n't even gotten there and already there were people going at each other 's throats . Blinking as Jackson whispered " My money 's on the blonde . " Scott rolled his eyes and whispered back " That 's the gon na be the Ramos ' alpha someday . Try not to piss her off okay ? " As he spoke , Charlotte had noticed him and was making her way over . " You 've got a really nice home . " Scott complimented trying not to look too freaked out about Lyra absolutely destroying what he assumed was a cousin . Jackson said a quick hello to Charlotte , though was distracted as a horde of children swamped about the co-captian 's legs screeching " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory . " <p> It was clearly a game , as a couple half shifted children snapped at Jackson 's legs , and the human ones squealed with delight as they followed suit . Was this what it was like for Derek growing up ? Glancing over to the stoic beta he felt a stir of sorrow . Scott had never realized how close family packs had been . Was there truly a difference than being bitten into a pack ? Jackson , deciding to let Scott be had playfully peeled one of the children off his leg to hoist her over his shoulder growling " I 'll eat you all up ! " and set about chasing them . As Charlotte apologized for the fight Scott held his hands up . " Do n't worry , your sister kicks some serious ass . Remind me not to piss your family off . " There was small flirtation in his grin , and they had n't been chatting long when an arm slid around Charlotte 's shoulder ; which belonged to Sterling . " Young alpha McCall . Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't scared you off us . " In a way there was something about Sterling that reminded the alpha of Chris Argent . <p> " No sir , I think it 's really neat to see how a pack by family interacts with each other . Usually I got ta hide phones if I want people to socialize with each other . " Scott joked , over exaggerating that part . He had noticed more than a few dirty stares , especially from an older man , around the same age as Sterling if Scott had to guess who was in quiet conversation with the man named Elijah . " Go around and feel free to talk to whom you like . I think you 'll find we 're not savage beasts that the Argent 's were concerned we 'd be . " The other alpha had already talked to Argent ? Nodding he glanced at Charlotte before wandering around talking to people as they came up to him ; mostly asking about what this town was like and how he thought they 'd settle in . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in a pack bound by blood to which he tried to answer as best as possible . To be honest Derek would of probably given a better answer . By the time had sunk behind the treeline , and mates danced about with each other by tiki lights he was feeling quite at ease ; regardless of some member 's apparent hostility . Before he could linger too long on it he caught from the corner of his eye Lyra and Derek speaking , though she was leaned up towards his ear and since Scott severely doubted she was nipping at his ear , that she was whispering something . He 'd make sure to make fun of the Sourwolf when Scott was sure his entrails would n't be ripped out . <p> Then the woman from the other night , Elowise , was announcing it was time to eat and the pack began to shuffle their way indoors . Scott was quick to weave people , and score the seat next to Charlotte , and gave her a wide grin . This was one thing that Derek stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case would be the Ramos ' grandparents . Things were going smoothly , and Scott nudged Charlotte gaining her attention halfway through his plate . " You look really nice . " There was a sort of hesitance beneath his words like he was n't sure that he could say that to her . Before she could answer though ; all hell broke lose . It started when Sterling stood up , announcing his welcome and acceptance of Scott and the pack ; and vice versa . As eyes fell on him Scott remembered Derek 's warning of staying out of family business so he nodded with a very non-threatening beam . Already he could hear someone scoffing under their breath and while frowned Scott kept his mouth shut . <p> Then came the next announcement which made his blood freeze for a moment . Sterling announcing that he was stepping down . It did n't take a genius to realize that the family was torn on looking shocked , pissed , and proud . What he was n't expecting was for the man from earlier to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is outrageous ! Dad , you ca n't possibly be considering letting Sterling pass the position onto Lyra . " The eldest daughter just looked mortified as she stared down at her lap looking like she 'd rather be anywhere else . So her shift was n't a wolf ? Was she a Kanima ? No , surely that was n't it and shooting a glance at Derek he just shrugged looking like he was torn between leaving and just trying to keep his mouth shut . As the grandparents cut in , that this was pack business and it would be discussed later Scott stood up in a rather spur of the moment thing . If these were his lands , and people looked up to him than maybe his opinion would help convince the other 's he saw the potential Lyra had to be a great alpha . " I know I 'm not family , but why should n't Lyra become alpha ? So what if her shift is n't wolf , she 's clearly capable . " Surely such a mundane statement could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions he was LONG ... <p> Lyra Ramos The Outcast Heir <p> She snorted , as she passed up a soda ; some wolves were n't big drinkers . It was n't like she could get drunk , but going through the motions of being an adult were an important part of blending in . Lyra 's cheeks were slightly flushed as she ducked her head at his welcoming comment . " If I had it my way Elijah would exiled from the pack . " She spoke quietly enough for only Derek to hear as saying that could serious offend someone . Her cousin was on the other side of the yard , talking under his breath with uncle Levi . It was clear that she was tense ; her father 's announcement was n't far off from her mind . And then the outcry would begin . Rubbing her chin with her free hand she glanced around instantly picking out the bitten pack , and her heart went out to them . " They 're so young . Yet so old have been bitten . You and Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitten pack was mingling surpringly well with her family ; A boy with cropped dark hair and stunning Aegean depths were chasing a few human and non-human children around half-shifted and gnashing his teeth while the children screamed wth delight . <p> Isaac and Erica were talking with Sterling , Theo , and her grandparents while Charlotte and Scott were n't too far from each other . " You 'd think they were born into it . Derek . " There was a soft urgency in her voice as Lyra glanced around before leaning up to whisper against his ear so not to be overheard . " Dinner is n't going to go well . Just keep your heads down and you should be fine . " Her eyes were dark with an intensity that was seldom there . She pulled back taking a nonchalant sip of her cider while she noted a stunning blonde and and the curly haired Isaac walking over . " We 'd like to formally introduce ourselves , I 'm Erica and that 's Isaac . " They were sweet looking kids , well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which made Lyra smile as she glanced over at Derek . " My sister mentioned you and your pack to father . She had nothing but kind words to say . " They chatted a little longer before Elowise and some other family members came out ; hollering it was time to eat . Here came the hard part . Smiling as she told the two kids that she 'd chat with them later Lyra turned to Derek her posture stiff and serious . " Just keep your heads down . " <p> With that she was strolling towards the french doors , mingling with family along her way . A few little ones clung to her legs shrieking for her to give them rides later . " Later . " She simply promised , making her way to the table for her spot . Lyra , her sister and parent 's would be sitting the closest to their grandparents ; the oldest and the prior alpha as it showed the line of succession . From there it was kind of a free-for-all , and the dark haired boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the spot across from her ; while Scott ahd managed to nab the seat next to Charlotte . It probably was n't a smart move as Lyra 's father was sending him barely concealed looks of trepidation , though did n't remark . As the food was passed around , a decent helping on everyone 's plate the family paused looking towards Lyra 's grandparents as they took the first bite . " It 's great Elowise . Dig in everyone . " Lyra 's grandmother bade with a kind , and wobbly smile . For awhile idle chatter filled the table until Sterling cleared his throat gaining the attention of all gathered . <p> " Today we gather as tradition dictates to celebrate the first move of the Ramos pack in a long , long time . As I 'm sure everyone knows , there have been great forces at work in Beacon Hills ; something that would be a shame to miss this is a once in a lifetime opportunity . " Sterling 's voice was grand , confident and Lyra was pretty sure she 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that everyone has taken notice of my guests of honor . Young alpha Scott McCall and the McCall pack . The true alpha , and a competent one at that . " Sterling 's praise was surpsingly warm as he continued . " He and his pack have been kind enough to host us on these lands , so old and alive with magic ancient and powerful . This is a chance to meet creatures and beings which before have existed only in our bestiary . It is my decree we will be kind and gracious to any member of the McCall pack . Bitten or not . " There was a huff of disgust from her Uncle Stephen , which made Lyra narrow her eyes . <p> " And that brings me to my next and final announcement . " Outside was dark , night had fallen and the pack held their breath as they watched Sterling . " I have weathered many years leading our pack in the best way I could . It has become clear to me that my legacy as alpha is drawing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torch on to my eldest daughter . Lyra . " For a moment every was frozen with silence as Sterling continued . " She has been groomed since birth to take over my position ; and I feel that a younger face , with fresh ideas would do our family good in the time of so many things changing . So many firsts . Lyra , my dear should you decide to accept the responsibilities of becoming alpha we will have your ceremony the next full moon . " So many eyes were on her as Lyra felt her stomach drop at some of the furious and rattled expressions of her family . " I accept . " Her words were short , though confident and sure . For a moment silence was deafening , and glancing at her sister found her to look positively shocked . " This is outrageous ! Dad , you ca n't possibly be considering letting Sterling pass the position onto Lyra . " Of course her uncle and a few others nodded their agreement while others just looked annoyed with the outburst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creaky and ancient with age was almost missed as he fixed his middle son with a challenging stare . " Because she is not a wolf . We have already welcomed her and her sister , who also has no real were abilities to speak of , into our ranks . Traditions state she has to be a wolf . Elijah was already nodding along in agreement . " My Daughters have just as much right to be in this pack as any of you ; and besides the point it is Lyra 's birth right . Regardless of what shape her shift is . Or have you already forgotten that Elijah has yet to best her in any sort of combat " Sterling 's voice was sharp , soured with anger . " You all forget your place . We have guests . This is not the time or place . " Her grandfather began to lecture when Scott stood up and Lyra wanted to tell him to sit back down . He was getting himself into a world of trouble if he spoke up . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyra become alpha ? So what if her shift is n't wolf , she 's clearly capable . " And there it was , Scott was throwing his support in and while the gesture was sweet ; it now openly declared what side he was on if things got sour there was now nothing stopping the pack from going after his pack . <p> Shrugging his shoulders lightly , Derek had his eyes focused on Lyra solely . " We 've tried our hardest , even when Scott was first bitten it was incredibly hard . I had n't needed to teach a wolf anything and I 've had to explain everything to them a few times now , it never gets any easier . " He admitted to her as it was hard on him , but it was even harder on the bitten wolves because their lives had been thrown upside down in a second and then they needed to learn everything that Derek learnt as he grew up . Control could be hard to get under control for a blood werewolf , it 's even more harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the pack of bitten werewolves the most he could . " I know , they 've all done amazingly . I 'm actually proud of them , but do n't tell them that . " He grinned at her as he watched Jackson chasing the little children around the large backyard , even Issac seemed to be fitting in well enough with the Ramos ' that actually seemed to be open to having the pack there at their family dinner . <p> Then a frown formed onto Derek 's face when Lyra told him to just keep his head down during dinner , he had told the pack that already . That they were only guests and to steer clear of any family business , he made sure that they understood that they could n't speak up no matter how badly they wanted to . But when Lyra told him something that he already knew , the bad feeling in his gut only grew stronger and he wanted to ask her about it but then the lady from last night called everyone inside to have dinner . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice chat with a man who seemed to be only a year or two older than he was , obviously another cousin to Lyra that he was glad that he got a chair between the cousin , he now knew was Kyle , and Jackson as he wanted to be fairly close to where Lyra was sitting at the table . He filled his plate with the hot delicious smelling food but waited until the Ramos grandparents took the first bites , he was currently chewing a mouthful of pork roast when Sterling stood up from his chair so he could have a speech . <p> He glanced over at Scott when he and the pack were welcomed , but as Sterling 's speech continued on Derek found himself glancing over to Lyra . He could smell the nerves coming off her and it was clearly written all over her face that something was coming up , he braced himself for anything that was going to happen and it surely did . Sterling was going to step aside and let Lyra take over as Alpha , it was happening a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the blonde yesterday made Derek know that she was ready and she would be a wonderful Alpha . His eyes narrowed in a cold glare at the uncle who had stood up from his chair , so Lyra 's shift was n't a wolf and that is where all the tension was coming from . He kept his mouth shut as he listened to everything that was being said , his eyes moving over to Lyra as he wanted to stand up for her but knew against it . However it seemed that Scott had other ideas , he wanted to tackle the Alpha to the floor to just shut him up from saying anything else.Charlotte Ramos The Human <p> Charlotte smiled at Scott and nodded her head , " I 'll remind you of that whenever you need it . Lyra would do anything for our family , " She told him as her sister really would kick anyone 's ass if her family was messed with , the sooner that Scott knew that the best and the safer he would be . A flush coated her cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped around her shoulders and her dad ruined any moment that could have been forming between her and the true Alpha . She smiled up at her father before she watched Scott walk off and mingle with her family members , most of who seemed to be fine with him . In fact some seemed pleased to finally met him and a few aunt 's held Scott back to ask him about the town and how he was after being bitten , she did n't want to interrupt so she moved around the backyard to speak with more of her family . <p> Charlotte begun to eat and was glad that Scott had been quick enough to bag the seat beside her , which would n't have pleased her father but she did n't really pay any attention to that . She smiled when her dad stood and started his speech , she always did love listening to his speeches as his voice was so powerful and smoothing . She smiled at Scott when Sterling welcomed him and the pack to their new home , but then Sterling went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock flowed through her body as she did n't even know that her dad had been thinking about letting Lyra take over so shortly . But a wide proud smile reached her eyes as she looked beside her at her older sister , she reached under the table and wrapped her fingers around Lyra 's hand to give her some reassurance and this was going to let hell break loose which Charlotte was ready for . She sat still and silent in her chair while her Uncle Levi argued about Lyra not being the right fit to be Alpha of this family , she gritted her teeth and bit her tongue as she wanted to have her own say about this . <p> Her head snapped down the table when Levi dragged her into this , she did n't want Scott or his pack to know about her yet and here her uncle was blurting it out in front of their guests . Her eyes focused on Uncle Levi as she had n't been paying attention , if she had been then she would have noticed Scott standing up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already talking before she could stop him , it was sweet that he was siding with Lyra but it was n't the right time to tell the Ramos family that . So Charlotte wrapped her fingers around his hand and pulled him back down , she shook her head slightly when he looked at her . " At least we know where the bitten pack sits , with the two abominations " Levi spat with disgust on his face and in his voice , he spoke like he had venom on his tongue and it was burning the skin . But Charlotte had more than enough at that point in time . <p> " You know what , you can say anything about me which you already do and have been doing since I was born . But do n't you dare drag my sister down when this moment is meant to a happy one for her , deal with it Uncle Levi you will never be our Alpha and neither will Elijah . So get over yourself . So what if Lyra 's shift is n't a wolf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister will be a great Alpha . " Charlotte spoke so firmly that it even surprised her because she was n't like this very often , but when someone was rude to her loved ones than she would stand up for them and she would n't back down . " How dare you speak to me like that , it seems Sterling needs to put you into place little human . " Levi sneered at his niece in a threatening tone of voice that it made Charlotte want to back down and retreat , but his words felt like a slap in the face and soon enough tears were welling up in her eyes which she tried her hardest to blink away . <p> Well this night had taken a turn he did n't expect ; but when Levi began threatening Charlotte the alpha once again opened her mouth . " Do not talk to her like that . " His voice was quiet with warning while he glared . Oh he wanted to flash his teeth , dare that asshole to come a little closer ; but he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enough ! " Lyra having her fill of Levi and his son had her eyes narrowed as she stood . " You need to leave . Now Uncle Levi . " He he opened his mouth as if to disagree , but Lyra was flashing her golden depths at him , and with a huff he jabbed a finger at Scott and Sterling . " Do not think this is over . " With that he , his wife , and son were standing up storming towards the door though stopping at their grandparents . " We need to uphold tradition , as we always have . A bitten pack siding with Lyra just shows that her reign would be disastrous . " Scott heard Jackson mutter Asshole under his breath as Levi left ; and Scott had to agree with him . Isaac was glowering while Erica looked like she was fighting to keep her mouth shut . <p> Clearly Sterling had meant for that to be a happy announcement ; but as people stared down at their plates in stony silence he figured it was anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured " Congratulations . " The blonde just glanced at him , her face set in something mixed with pity and anger . Which was understandable , if his packmates told him he was n't a good alpha because of something he could n't help like his race- than he 'd be rather disgruntled as well . " I 'm sorry you had to witness that everyone . " Sterling was uncharacteristically quiet , his eyes cast downwards while Elowise quietly captured his hand with her 's . " Your support means a lot to us young alpha . I trust we can rely on it should things go sour ? " Charlotte 's mother fixed him with an unreadable stare and glancing around at his packmates he nodded slowly . " Of course . " And there he went , breaking the rule Derek warned him against ; getting sucked into pack politics . Sterling nodded , his eyes softening as he met Scott 's gaze . " Thank you . I think it 's best everyone go home . This dinner has concluded . Except for Scott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The alpha jerked his head in Sterling 's directions . Had he done something ? He 'd only been trying to help Charlotte and her family . For Scott , he could see the reasoning behind Sterling naming Lyra so early . If the family was this split and polarized about who should lead the pack ; the sooner to announce it was for the better . It would give less time for any opposition to come up with a plan to stop Lyra from becoming an alpha . It also occurred to Scott that this was just a power play . It was n't like Sterling was leaving Beacon Hills after his daughter took over ; and he 'd be there to help her lead . While at the same time the family would learn to accept her rule . People had begun murmuring their goodbyes , and congratualations to Lyra . One man , he recalled Theodore , was helping the elderly grandparents up and out of the home . Once the last person had shuffled out , Sterling motioned for Scott to follow . Trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earful later he was sure , he quietly followed Sterling deeper within the house to a tidy looking study . " Sit . Please . " In the dim lighting of the room it showed how exhausted Sterling looked . <p> " You know , I have always known that Lyra would have a difficult time taking over for me . It was n't until recently that the alpha laws were changed in our family . Usually it was the eldest male . I have always known that it has been traditions that have helped us weather ourselves through rough waters and survive thus far . But Lyra , as a female and as you heard not a wolf is going to need all the allies she can get . Which is why I wanted to personally thank you . " Shifting in his seat feeling a little awkward Scott just nodded wordlessly . " But an alliance is a give and take ; which is why I will offer you and your pack a place every month to help learn to fully master your shifts and everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand through his stiff , gelled hair Scott was n't sure what to say for a moment . That was a big offer , and Sterling continued " And of course for those who wish to run with us may feel welcome whenever . My family is gracious and in debt to you . " Maybe the older alpha was n't such a callous asshole after all . " Wow ... That's- thank you Sterling . " <p> He just nodded gravely and motioned towards the door . " I need some time to myself . Gather your pack at your leisure . And make sure to see my wife , she will give you all leftovers . " Nodding , Scott stood biding him a good night before making his way back to the living room . The house was eerily quiet leaving Scott to try to pinpoint where everyone was . Hearing a couple voices from the living room he followed them ; finding Elowise and Charlotte talking in soft voices . They did n't notice him at first , and he paused catching the tail-end of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levi is just a bitter old man . You are not an abomination . Neither is your sister . You are two beautiful and different soul which Levi 's pathetically small brain and shriveled up heart can not accept . Your family loves you , but power can twist even blood . " Clearing his throat as he stepped into the room Elowise gave one last small smile at her daughter before gently patting her hand . " Please stay a while longer Scott . I 'll make your pack some leftovers . Most of them are roughhousing in the backyard . Probably working out some energy " With that she was leaving the room leaving Scott and Charlotte . <p> " No offense , but your uncle asshole is the one who 's an abomination . " Scott all but growled as he sat down next to Charlotte . He did n't understand how someone could call such a kind soul anything other than that . " Being a wolf is n't everything . Some of the most cherished pack-members I have are human . " Scott promised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great alpha , and once your uncle gets off his high horse he 'll see that . But do n't think that his faults and weaknesses reflect on you in anyway . " His warm soulful brown eyes were honest and fierce . The orangey glow cast strange shadows on his face as Scott leaned back against the couch . " I know it 's not like family- but you always have me and my pack . Can always count on your friends . " It was getting late , and he knew he 'd need to gather his members and head out soon ; but he did n't want to leave Charlotte distressed . He was curious about how a human could smell like a wolf if what Levi said was true ; but he was n't about to LONG ... <p> Lyra Ramos The Outcast Heir <p> Lyra kept her head down as people around her fought , with a ferocity that made her question how the hell this was going to get resolved . See , if most her family was against her taking over and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elijah was hot-headed , aggressive , and found wolves superior to anything . So likely the amount of turf wars they got into would triple , and she and her family would be excommunicated . And besides Elijah there really was n't any other candidate . When Levi referred to her and her sisters as abominations Lyra felt her heart tearing itself into tiny pieces . It was like Levi could find her most vulnerable spots and drag them out for the world to see ; but when he started in on Charlotte Lyra snarled loud enough for the table to hear . " You keep your mouth shut about my sister . Say what you want about me- I 'm the one you have a problem with but you will not disrespect the family in front of me anymore . Father had been lenient with you and I will not . " There was a soft threat beneath Lyra 's words that made Levi pale . Before anyone else cut her off , Lyra pointed towards the door . " Enough ! You and your family need to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fully trust herself not to shift then and there and teach the bitter man a lesson . Surprisingly he backed down , sensing the power and anger beneath her words . He left , but not without a jab at Scott 's pack and her family . A low growl was rumbling deep within Lyra 's throat though she paused as Scott mumbled a congratulations . He 'd been the first to say it , and trying to keep her composure nodded . " Thank you . " The sheer amount of eyes in the room felt suffocating . " Excuse me . " Lyra mumbled before hurriedly exiting the room with her head down . Her hyena was snarling in her head , furious and heartbroken all at once . What the killer was , had she been born a wolf ; her family would of praised her . There would be no rifts nor fighting ; just an acceptance she 'd be the next alpha . Almost subconsciously her legs carried her to the backyard , finally finding the solitude she needed to sort her thoughts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods and spend the night hunting . Killing deer was far more acceptable than killing people . " Lyra ? " Turning her head she found that Jackson , Isaac , and Erica had found her , standing there hesitantly . <p> Forcing a smile upon her lips she tilted her head , " Hey guys . Sorry you all to see that . " They shook their heads and finally it was Erica to speak up . " We just wanted to let you know we think you 'll do a great job . And if you ever need someone to egg his house- you know where to find us . Just do n't tell Derek . " A genuine smile broke onto her lips as she giggled into her hand . " I will keep that in mind . Thank you , really . " She 'd have to find Scott later to lecture him about throwing his support down , especially from the beginning as now everyone knew . These young wolves had so much to learn that they could n't afford to be fighting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she could to make sure that no one went after them . An alpha could refuse support ; though that did n't mean that they would n't still be targets . The three had shuffled further in the yard to roughhouse , probably getting energy out before they headed back . Still lost in thought she pulled her phone out , aimlessly browsing the internet . Sensing something behind her she whipped around to find Derek , relaxing slightly . " Sorry , I feel like now I should of warned Scott . Hindsight is 20/20 . " Lyra sighed , feeling absolutely apologetic for having the bitten back getting dragged into this . <p> She could only imagine how this would effect everything . If things got out of hand the hunters would be forced to act and the Ramos pack my face extermination ; even if Lyra 's sister , mother , and father had n't done anything . " You know , I think I may need some sneaking away before shit really hits the fan . " Lyra sighed , a bit of a shimmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And on a more serious note , I 'll do what I can to make sure no one goes after you and your pack . I ... " Her voice trailed off , and glancing down heaved off a heavy sigh . She would feel horrible if something happened . If one of those teenagers got crossed in the crosshairs of whatever this was going to be . Which hopefully it would be nothing . But there was a sinking feeling in her gut that Levi would n't submit to her rule ; and the first inner-family conflict would roll around for the first time in a century . <p> Derek felt like slapping himself in the face as he listened to Scott agree to help the Ramos ' if anything happened between family members , he had warned Scott not to get dragging into another pack 's business but he guessed that he had just been talking to himself on the drive over to the house because the Alpha surely had n't been listening to a single word Derek had spoken . However , he did n't actually blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing if he had been in Scott 's positions . But that did n't mean he would n't be giving the young Alpha a big lecture of why he needs to stay away from pack politics , it was just the type of person that Scott was and Derek loved that about the boy . He 'd do whatever he could to help anyone in this town , but now there was a great chance of a fight breaking out and if the bitten pack were n't careful than it could end with them being the ones who get hurt . His glare followed Scott as he moved through the house when Sterling asked for a word . <p> Standing up from the table , he stayed behind to help carry all the plates and dishes over to the kitchen counter . He was now the only one still in the dining room but he did n't really mind , it made sure that he did n't have to talk to anyone . He could hear soft voices in the living room which he did n't want to overhear so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard , Jackson , Erica and Issac all begun to roughhouse with each other which was good because if they did burn off some energy now than they would n't be getting much sleep that night . Once the dining table was clear he stepped out into the backyard and quietly walked over to where Lyra was standing . <p> " I did warn Scott about speaking when he should n't , it would have happened even if you did warn him to keep his mouth shut . " He assured her in hopes that she would n't feel too bad about everything that went down , " Whenever you want to sneak away just say . I 'll show you some great places around town , I 'm not that good at talking but I can listen . " He told her as his eyes softened as he gazed at her , he could n't remember the last time he talked about his feelings as that was n't the type of guy he was but he could still listen to others and just be there for them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We might be a small pack but we 've been through a lot these past years , the kids are stronger than they appear . We will be by your side if or when anything happens , " Derek promised the blonde because it was the truth , even if Scott had n't verbally agreed to side with Lyra they would have done so either way . Her uncle was an asshole and a bully which Derek has never put up with before in his life , so he was n't going to start now . If Levi and whoever else started a war than it will be them who suffer and retreat with their tails between their legs , Derek was stubborn so he was never going to back down.Charlotte Ramos The Human <p> A couple of tears rolled down Charlotte 's cheeks as she listened to her family leaving the house , she did n't really bother saying goodbye to many of them as she did n't want them to see how upset she was . Once Lyra had excused herself , Charlotte did the same thing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the couch where she let some more tears escape from her crushed blue eyes , Levi 's words constantly echoed around her mind and it was only upsetting her even more . Feeling the cushion sink slightly she smelt her mother 's perfume and looked at her , " Why has he have to be so cold hearted ? " She asked with a break in her voice , she felt Elowise 's arm engulf her which always got Charlotte to calm down whenever her emotions got the best of her . They sat on the couch talking quietly as Elowise assured Charlotte of how beautiful and amazing she was , she had wiped her tears away from her eyes not long before Scott cleared his voice and her mom rushed off to get the leftovers ready for the pack . <p> " Lyra is going to change this family , I 've always known that . But in this family , being a wolf if the most important thing . Yes , some of the children are humans but that 's because one parent is a human . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be as well . " Charlotte had n't really looked at Scott yet , she was so embarrassed that he had witnessed a family argument already . Charlotte and her family had only been there for three days and yet Scott and his pack had already been dragged into a fight which was going to be worsen , she let a heavy sigh escape through her parted lips before she turned slightly to look at the young Alpha . It was obvious that she had been crying a little bit , " I did n't want you to find out like that . I did n't want you to even know so soon ... But I had the wolf gene and I sort of still do , my Mom was seven months pregnant with me when she got sick . It attacked her body and it attacked me , I would n't have made it if my wolf genes did n't kick in and fight the illness off . " Charlotte had to stop for a moment as it was not only a lot for Scott to take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about and now she had to explain what happened to someone . <p> But she shook off how she feeling as he deserved to know , he had already agreed to be there for her family so he had a right to know about her . " Fighting the illness took everything my little body had , it took my genes away from me . I have some heightened senses but it 's nothing like a werewolf and I ca n't shift , I do n't have the teeth or claws . I guess a tiny part of me is somewhat a wolf , but I 'm mostly human which is why I do n't have much of a wolf scent . " She told him as quickly as her words would let her without getting tongue tied , she would n't tell him about Lyra as that was her sister 's place . She looked down at her lap as she did n't know what Scott would even say to that , she hoped that this did n't cause him to see her differently now . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister be the Alpha that she was born to be . Stop my uncle and cousin from bullying her , her shift is beautiful . " She would always be there for her sister and her parents , but she wished she was a more of a wolf so she could actually help . " Thank you , Scott . But I do n't want you risking yourself or your pack , " She lifted her eyes to lock onto his , she had only just met him but she already worried about something bad happening to him . " And you do n't scrub up too badly either . " She never got to thank him for his compliment on how she looked nice earlier , it was never to late to give someone a compliment . <p> Listening , nodding at her words Scott smiled . " The only shift I 've ever been terrified of is a Kanima . And that 's mostly because it was trying to kill all of us . " He did n't doubt that Lyra 's shift was unique , how could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That happy-go-lucky and kind of dopey grin as she started in on him about not wanting his pack to be in danger . " So far , we 've fought off a homicidal alpha , a kanima , hordes of crazy hunters , and an alpha pack . At this point , your family does n't scare me that much . " He did n't know Charlotte that long , but there was an undeniable want to protect her , and softening he added . " Besides , my pack would help you even if I told them not to . " He fully believed in fighting for good causes , and not having Levi or Elijah leading the Ramos ' would be a good cause . " I can consult my emissary too , see if he has any suggestions about how to help you guys . " He may not of been born into this pack ; but it was common sense that assured him it would be wisest to see the intended alpha leading . Maybe he also wanted to impress Charlotte . Just a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless and he was not looking forward to what Derek would say once they were in the car . Scott could easily just lope back but that would just be putting off the inevitable . " Charlotte , the most important thing is you 're alive . Try to remember things will pan out , and I 'll do my best to help . " Hearing her mom hurrying back from the kitchen Scott got to his feet ; exhaustion beginning to color his blood . " Here you are dear . " A shopping bag full of containers was handed to him , Scott would give this to Derek . Could probably use it more than him . " Thank you . " She just nodded and turned to Charlotte , Elowise 's expression softening . " Charlotte dear , start getting ready for bed . It 's late and you need your strength . " Charlotte dipped her head , fixing Scott with a shy goodnight to which he nodded . It was time to get going the night had long since passed into being and his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us again . " Scott mumbled beneath Elowise 's incomprehensible gaze . " Of course . We 'll see you around Scott . " With that Elowise too began to head back towards the stairwell , probably going to bed . <p> The house had fallen deathly quiet , and Scott could still smell the anger and jealousy in the air making him feel muddled . " Never a dull day . " He sighed to himself , stepping out to the backyard where Derek and Lyra were speaking . Derek was stating that they could take care of themselves , while his other three pack members jostled each other about , Erica sending Isaac flying . " Guys , are you all ready ? " Scott called , earning a few chorus of yeah , save for Isaac . " Uh ... If you do n't mind I 'm gon na go to Allison 's tonight . " Even though the pair had been dating for months now ; Isaac still sounded unsure whenever he mentioned the relationship to Scott . " Go for it man . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear a few animals caterwauling in the night , and the alpha was unsure of how to tell the rest of the pack they were potentially going to be having conflict with yet another pack . And why . In his hand was the shopping bag of food , and almost sheepishly he offered it to Derek in hopes that he would n't be too upset with him . <p> Yes Scott had ignored his rule of not getting into pack politics ; but he felt like it was right . It was for a good cause and deep down in his little stone heart , he probably wanted to help as well . Erica had given Jackson one last shove before bounding over to Lyra and giving her a quick hug . Beneath her gruff exterior something that he was convinced she got from Derek when he was her alpha she was really sweet . " Tell Charlotte that I 'll see her in school okay ? " Lyra just nodded , looking taken aback as if she were shocked that someone would be kind to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heart . Jackson sent her one if his rarer genuine smiles before biding goodbye , and together he and the blonde headed towards Derek 's car , leaving Scott to trail after them . He was already coming up with the words to defend his actions as he slid into the passenger seat . He 'd like to drive Derek 's car was fucking sweet- this he knew from the one time he 'd been able to drive it ; but Derek treated that car like his firstborn . No drinking , no eating , no feet up on seats and no one was to get behind the wheel without his permission . <p> A few minutes later Derek came sauntering from the side of the house and Scott readied himself for the stern words he 'd surely get . As Derek opened the door , sliding behind the wheel and starting the engine Scott decided to speak first . " You know that went pretty well . " Jackson from the backseat squawked with laughter and Scott glared at him from the mirror . " I mean all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no died . " It was Derek 's turn to glower as he started in about how I told you to stay out of it , nyah-nyah-nyah , do you have any idea what could happen if this pack went to war , there are other ways to support Lyra without getting involved , did you not hear a single thing I said ? At least that was the gist of it . " What would you have done if Elijah or Levi got the spot ? You know acted like we had rabies . " From the backseat Jackson chimed in once more , " Probably because that 's what he thinks of bitten wolves . So does their uncle Stephen . He told me about how he was so sorry I was bitten and this and that and how I 'd never control myself during full moons . Good stuff . " He could sense everyone 's agitiation from their pack bonds . Nudging Derek the alpha added in a small voice " C'm on Derek . Not like you did n't want to help Lyra out anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the LONG ... <p> Lyra Ramos The Outcast Heir <p> She was a little touched by his offers . And honestly they sounded great . Lyra loved her parents and sister , but she did n't want to continuously let on about how much Levi and his children got to her . In her eyes it was a weakness to allow something that was so trivial upset her . " Thank you . " Her voice was soft and quiet , and she was n't sure if she wanted to say anything else because Scott was heading out the door , looking for his pack . Derek had n't mentioned anything about her unusual shift . Had n't asked to see it or even what it was ; and for that she was grateful . " I 'll be in touch . " Lyra promised , a voice softer than she usually used before dipping her head to Scott before heading inside . " They ca n't die because of me . " Three days in Beacon Hills and she already felt the need to protect that pack like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab a glass of water when she heard quiet footsteps . " Lyra , tonight you did well . " Glancing up she saw her father looking drained and exhausted , to which she nodded . <p> " Well it was nothing less than what was expected . " Sterling sighed , his shoulders slumping as he nodded . " There 's something that could help cement your reign . " She did n't like where this conversation was going and already her beast was snapping it 's teeth with it 's strange noises which had become like a lullaby to Lyra . " Dad- " He cut her off , raising his hand . " It 's part of pack life Lyra . You 're twenty-three . You ca n't lead a pack without a suitable mate ; now I 'm not suggesting you take the next male you lay eyes on , but a werewolf would be a strategic move . You understand ? " He had a point , and Lyra felt her stomach sink . " I want to prove myself first as an alpha before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take one now if it was my soul-mate . But since those are rare I would n't hold my breath . " She hated the fact that it took an alpha pair to lead a pack , and once she accepted her position opposes and supporters alike would urge her to find someone she could lead with . <p> But she refused to settle for just anyone , and honestly in her opinion she 'd only moved here , she was young and that was n't nearly her first priority . " Other than that Lyra ; you 'd be wise to form some alliances and bonds . As I saw tonight . " Of course , everything was just one big lead-up to the shift in leadership of the Ramos pack . Taking a long swig of water , dumping the rest into the sink she was about to brush past him upstairs when Sterling reached out , gently grabbing her arm . " I have another favor to ask of you darling . McCall- I 'd like you to watch him around Charlotte . I 'm all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with a bitten werewolf . " Oh how different her world was from her younger sister . He 'd just urged her to keep an eye out for at least a suitable mate , while forbidding Charlotte from developing anything more than a friendship with McCall . " Bit early for that . " Was all Lyra said before hurrying towards the stairwell . Her steps were heavy and quick up the stairs , she was going to head for Charlotte 's room . <p> Her gentle sister had a way of soothing Lyra 's more fiery temper- and also she felt it in order to chat about today . Knocking before allowing herself into the room , finding her sister sitting by the window with the reading light on . " I 'd ask to come in- but you know I will anyway . " Lyra joked , as she waltzed in shutting the door . " How you feeling Little Sister ? " The brazen boldness in Lyra 's voice was gone , just a benevolent husk . " Your friends offered to go egg Uncle Levi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She joked , sitting down on the bed while rubbing her chin with a slender hand . " I 'm really sorry I did n't tell you before . Dad did n't want me saying anything in case everyone found out and that whole day would of been chaotic . Also , just so you know I 'll do what I can to denounce Scott 's help . Make him less of a target . Foolish boy . " For a moment Lyra 's eyes hardened though softened as she added " Kind though . I think our packs will gel nicely together . " She spoke to fill silence and chase ghosts from her head of everyone 's anger . All the things she 'd kept bottled up , was usually laid out for her sister . Charlotte had a way of letting Lyra speak her mind , without making the alpha to be feel weak and churlish . <p> Derek gave Lyra a sharp nod of his head as he followed Scott to where his car was parked , setting the bag of delicious smelling leftovers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice shortly filled his car as he told the Alpha off even though he had no idea if Scott was even listening to him or not , " It does n't matter what they think of us , we know how we are and they have the right to think whatever they want . But getting us all involved in a family of werewolves was n't a smart move , we were all put on the spot and you reacted without thinking , Scott . " Derek fired with caused Jackson to shut his mouth ever so quickly , " If you thought fighting a pack full of Alpha 's than a family is only going to be harder . It 's obvious that the dick uncle does n't want Lyra to take over being Alpha , he 's not going to stop until he gets what he wants and it wo n't matter to him if he has to fight his family . I 've seen and heard of wolves like this , the power of belonging to such a strong family has already gotten to to his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough on Lyra , she has n't even become the Alpha yet and she would already need to deal with family members that see her different shift only . They do n't see her as family or blood , she 's different and that is n't right in their eyes . <p> " I would have helped her out , but I would n't have let which side I was on in front of everyone . There were other ways , better ways of doing this Scott . But ... I suppose we 'll deal with whatever happens , " He did n't want Scott thinking that he was n't going to be there for the pack when it came time to a war , of course he would be fighting but he still wanted Scott to know that jumping in blindly was n't how a strong Alpha would do things . Derek felt like he could only teach Scott so much , everything else Scott would need to learn for himself which was harder than Derek first thought . He did n't want anything to happen to the Alpha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott like a child even though he was still technically a child . " I 'll be spending more time with Lyra and you lot will keep an eye on Charlotte , we have no idea what their uncle will plan but we need to be ready for whatever he does bring upon this town . Derek told them before he pulled over to the side and let both Jackson and Erica out as they lived close by , they could run back home to wear themselves out a little bit . <p> Derek continued driving towards the McCall house , this time there was silence as he had said everything he needed to for the moment . Scott was always learning and that would n't be stopping any time soon , he could n't be that angry with the young wolf as he did what he felt was right . If he could take it all back , Derek would n't as this made Scott who he was and he would be one of the greatest Alpha 's because of it . " Did Charlotte explain to you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she someone we have to worry about ? " He would admit that he was curious , he could still smell some wolf on her although it was weak . He did n't want to be helping the Ramos family when the youngest of Sterling 's daughter would become a hazard for them , he hoped she would n't be as she seemed nice enough and Scott liked her already which he never did often . He gave everyone a chance , but he could still be cautious of new people.Charlotte Ramos The Human <p> Charlotte had changed into her pajamas and decided to read for a little while as she knew she would n't be able to sleep , even though she was tired from how busy the day was . Scott 's voice echoed in her mind and it felt nice knowing there were more people around that would help them willingly , but she still did n't want him or his pack getting anymore involved in the family problem . Looking up she sent her older sister a small smile , " You never did wait longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how are you ? You know how green with jealously Uncle Levi is , I bet he wants to be something other than the mutt he is . " She looked at her sister as she shut her book , although that would make their family and Scott a mutt which she did n't mean , but Lyra always knew what she meant so Charlotte did n't correct herself . " Could we go egg his house ? I mean he wo n't have any proof that it was us , it 's get some anger out and Mom always told us that we ca n't hold anger inside our hearts or our hearts will die . " Her face brightened up when the thought of egging Uncle Levi 's house entered her mind , it would do them both good and it would also be fun for them . <p> Moving from the window over to her bed , Charlotte took Lyra 's hands into her own . " Please do n't feel like you need to apologize , I understand and I 'm not upset with you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm insanely proud of you . I knew this day would come and it will shortly , sooner than I thought but it 's time . Our family needs this , we 've been stuck in old traditions for far too long . " She assured her big sister while giving her hands a gentle squeeze , she could n't be prouder of Lyra even if she tried . A warm smile formed on Charlotte 's face when Scott was mentioned , " He was foolish but we would have done exactly what he did tonight . We 've never been good at standing back and watching something we believe is wrong , I do n't want his pack or himself to get hurt but it 's nice to know that there are people willingly to risk their lives for us . Even now that they know we 're different , " She looked at her sister letting go of her hands , instead she wrapped her arms around Lyra 's body . <p> " They are nice , I like them . I told Scott , about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're ready you should show them how truly beautiful you are , or maybe we could just show Derek . Mr tall , dark and mighty sexy . " Charlotte could n't hold the laugh back as she heard her sister speaking with him outside , " He could be a mate . Your babies would be perfect , " Charlotte 's voice took on a playful edge as she knew how much Lyra did n't want to search for a mate yet , it was something they 've talked about and it always made her sister uncomfortable thinking about having to settle down as she could have help being the Alpha of a large pack . Charlotte knew that Lyra did n't need a mate to lead the family , but she liked the idea of having a soul mate that would always be there for her and love her for who she was . " I still miss home , but maybe Beacon Hills is a fresh start for us and we could need that . We have n't died yet , that 's a bonus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war brewing but they had made it three days in Beacon Hills and they have survived so far . <p> He could see the sense in Derek 's words , there were different ways to do it- but Scott did n't regret it . In fact , he 'd do it again . It was n't like he expected his words to sway Levi and his son- but perhaps those on the fence . He may be a bitten abomination , but he was still a true alpha something no Ramos . Since becoming bit Scott had always led more with his heart than head ; which had in a few instances saved them . The Argents , dealing with Derek when they were n't on good terms ... For a few minutes he fell quiet his mind playing out the next month . Lyra had to become alpha , he and his pack would make sure that happened to the best of their ability , but how many people would once again get caught in their crosshairs ? To get the pack this okay had taken a toll on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his homeless wolves , due to either being orphaned or kicked out , training and leading them . All before he was an adult . <p> But , mentally Scott had matured over the past couple years . No longer was the little boy that was invisible to those around him ; he 'd become a man . A man who would lay down his life to protect those around him without hesitation . He had helped everyone around him find their places , their paths , opened his ranks to any lost or alone . Jackson was able to say I love you to Lydia , Isaac 's night terrors were n't as frequent and his wall of apathy had mostly crumbled to the pack ; even finding trust and love with Allison . Stiles no longer felt useless , had put his spark as Deaton called it to use , in terms of training with the Druid vet to become Scott 's official emissary . Lydia no longer had to hide her true self , and Erica was no one 's ghost anymore , she 'd learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open up and want to become his own person . Scott liked to think that Derek considered himself having a pack again . And Scott was prouder than anyone could know to be able to witness and help his packmates . <p> He 'd been lost in thought when Derek spoke again . Glancing up he nodded , " Sounds like a good plan . We have the best chance of helping Charlotte transitioning smoothly and whatnot . " For awhile they lapsed back into silence , the aroma of the leftovers wafting about the car . " Did Charlotte explain to you what her uncle meant ? " That ingrained sense of distrust was back in Derek 's voice and Scott 's head snapped up his eyes narrowed . " Yeah , do n't worry about it . " Scott did n't feel right telling him exactly what happened with Charlotte 's mother 's pregnancy to make her almost human . So he just kept his mouth shut . Soon however , Derek was dropping him off at the his home- the lights all off . His mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thanks man . " Saying his goodbyes the alpha slid out of the car , casting his gaze up to the blackened skies wondering what he 'd gotten himself into . It did n't take long for Scott to kick his shoes off and turn the lights on to find himself alone . He was grateful of the hours his mother worked ... but sometimes it just got lonely now being on his own . <p> " Pack meeting Monday . Chemistry room during lunch . " Scott group texted those who had n't been present for the dinner before slumping down onto the couch closing his eyes ; exhaustion rushing from behind his eyes to take him over . The rest of the weekend was uneventful , Chris had texted him once to ask if what Isaac had said about the dinner was true . Groaning Scott just texted back " Du n no what he said , but everything 's under control . Do n't heckle them . " It had taken a long time for Scott to feel like he could talk to Chris like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As long as they follow the code their business is their own . " Even Chris had come pretty far in the past couple years in coming to terms with werewolves . It was n't long after that Scott fell asleep watching some cliche horror movie . When he awoke the next day , his mother was shaking him awake , her large eyes anxious . " Well ? How 'd it go ? No one 's gon na show up in the hospital right ? " Pushing himself up onto his elbows Scott shook his head . <p> " It 's okay mom . They 're really nice . " She gave a sigh of relief and visibly relaxed . " Thank . God . We 've got too many people getting hurt in supernatural shit . " It was n't like his mother to swear , and as if she realized how that could sound clapped her hand over her mouth with a look of horror . " I did not mean you and your pack Scott . You know I support you , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gone off the rails . I just mean the Supernaturals who want to kill people . " He smiled , nodding . It was easy to understand her stance , t was the same as Stiles ' dad . After the two found out about their son 's secret lives ; they 'd taken to asking Chris Argent how he dealt with it . They had all come to the agreement that one of them must be present as school functions and sport games . Isaac stopped by Sunday night for dinner and to crash with Scott as Chris still unnerved him . Too soon Monday had rolled around and since the dinner he had n't heard much from his pack . But , as Scott and Isaac got ready , deciding to walk to school as Isaac refused to get behind Scott on his motorcycle , the alpha was looking forward to seeing Charlotte . <p> He 'd decided that he 'd give her his contact information in case something happened ; and seeing as how Sterling or Elowise had n't called out his pack Scott figured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got through the double doors Isaac informed Scott he was off to find Allison . Erica and Jackson had passed by Scott on his way to homeroom and once he got there , he found that it was quiet , Charlotte was n't there . Amounting it to just tardiness he 'd unlocked his phone when he heard a familiar voice . " Scotty ! How was the uh , dinner ? " Raising his gaze to Stiles he smiled with a shrug . " Fine , we 'll talk more later . " His shaggy haired friend nodded , slumping down into his feet . Homeroom was nearly done when Charlotte rushed in , her cheeks flushed and looking a little sheepish . As if it were reflex Scott 's gaze sought her out , while Stiles grinned sticking his hand up in a wave . He 'd taken the seat he had Friday leaving the one directly next to Scott open for her . " Rest of the weekend LONG ... <p> Lyra Ramos The Outcast Heir <p> Sometimes , alright most of the time , Lyra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emissary . " We would of helped them . " Lyra agreed , returning the hug and relaxing . Even if the world was falling about her head , Lottie would always be cheering her on . " I 'm really glad to see you 're making friends Lottie . And do n't worry about whatever dad says about Scott and his pack . " As progressive as her father was in Ramos terms ; he still had the prideful streak and conception that anyone not born into this life was dangerous . And even if you were born into it , unless you were pack material than you may as well be bitten . " A pack grounds you Lyra . How can you be grounded if you do n't share blood ? " However , at her younger sister 's next words Lyra 's face broke into a flush of red as she made a strangled noise of disagreement . " I swear Dad just had that conversation with me . And my babies will be perfect regardless . If I want any . " Lyra gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it would be expected of her was something nerve wracking for her . And should she not have a couple rugrats of her own , than she 'd be more than happy to pass the alpha position onto Charlotte 's future kids . She seemed more the nurturing type than Lyra . Still flushed to the ears from Charlotte 's Derek comment she leaned forward , pecking her sister 's temple . " Get some sleep . Lyra bade her younger sister before heading to her own room to strip off her shirt and pants before flopping down in bed . Alpha , something she 'd been trained for yet felt woefully unprepared for . Sleep never came easy for her that night , as Lyra tossed and turned . She knew there were a few things that Uncle Levi could do to prevent her from becoming alpha , one prove that Elijah or himself was the best choice , rally enough support that the pack had to choose someone else- or formally lodge a complaint . That would take awhile and would require all elder family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy to lead- or even if she fell within pack law given Lyra 's case . <p> Sunday was slow , uneventful and drove Lyra out of her mind . The blonde was agitated , her bestial side was screaming that something was going to happen . The family would be immersed in conflict and people would get hurt . What made her even more weary was the other members of her family ; did n't stop by . Which was unusual . Usually there was hardly a day where the main Ramos family could get by without visitors . It was this bone-deep knowledge that something was wrong . A war was brewing . Sterling tried to distract Lyra by taking her out to the woods for a near five hour sparing session . By the end of it her muscles were screaming with exhaustion and the woman crawled into her bed and passed out until her mother shook her awake for dinner- which she just picked at . " Lyra you need to eat . " Elowise scolded though the pale-skinned blonde was worlds away . Eventually seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing up and clearing Lyra 's plate along with her own . By the time the ten rolled around Lyra was once again tucked into her bed slumbering . <p> She had this almost uncanny ability that , if something was bothering her , she could just sleep for hours on end . So that 's why the next morning Elowise , after several attempts to wake her eldest decided it 'd be wise to just douse her with ice water . It was the rudest awakening she 'd had in a long time and it left her spluttering in bed " Mom ! " all but growled her eyes flashing with annoyance . " Lyra you have been asleep for seventeen hours , your sister needs a ride to school . Up before I get the pitcher . " Groaning she swung herself to her feet , pulling on the closest dress and throwing her hair into a messy side braid . The air outside was cool , the promise of winter 's chill on the way- though it was n't as bad as New York winters . Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked wearily and mumbled an apology for oversleeping before pulling out of the driveway . " You know Elijah 's a senior . If he gives you any problems just call me . I swear I will fuck him up . Not in the mood today . " Lyra sighed , guiding the car into the drop off line . " Uncle Theo 's wife is supposedly teaching math here though . " Before too long she was bidding goodbye to her sister and pulling out of the Beacon Hill High school parking lot . <p> The woman was unsure of where to go , she did n't quite want to go back home yet , as surely Sterling would have a list of " Must do these to ensure secure leadership " tasks that would make her only more upset . Nervously tapping her fingers against the steering wheel she decided to go to the nature preserve and just explore . Lyra really had n't been able to do much of that . It did n't take her long to find a secluded spot to she 'd her dress off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripping her clothing to shreds . Once she was in her other shift , for awhile she just wandered aimlessly . There were a few deer to chase , and quite a few spots to just bask in the sun . People must of been weary of the preserve as no one was there , and the forest hummed it 's song undisturbed . It always helped Lyra , running like this . The woman did n't know how long exactly how long she 'd been out , so she began to head back to the spot she 'd shifted when the wind shifted , and the scent of a burning long since blazed drifted towards her . Curious she tilted her broad head , ears shoved forward while the fur on her back rose . With curious paws she followed the scent for about a mile until the tree-line thinned out and there was the shell of a home ; burnt out . " What is this doing out here ? " She thought , her fur making for poor camouflage in the thick trees . <p> Derek had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Erica and Boyd visiting him for a full day of training . They were both getting much better in protecting themselves from any blow that he would send their way , he was pretty impressed by how far they had came since getting the bite from his former Alpha self . When Monday rolled around he knew the pack would be busy with school so he did n't bother them , instead he decided to get even more work done on the house which is what he did on most days when he was n't needed for anything . His dark jeans had patches of dirt stuck to the fabric and his grey vest clung to his torso as he was working up a decent amount of sweat . He was carrying tall wooden beams into the house as he wanted to secure a few more places so the burnt wood would n't fall down , he wiped beads of sweat from his brow with a rag that he stuck back into the back pocket of his jeans . He was glad no one ever came this far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anyone else seeing him and in turn asking questions . <p> Stepping through the old front door , he was about to lift more beams into his muscular arms when something caught his sight from the corner of his eyes . He scanned the trees although it was n't long before his eyes landed on a striped Hyena which caused him to do a double take as he had never seen a Hyena before , it was n't a wild animal that ever came near Beacon Hills so Derek near it was n't actually wild . Standing straight his eyes never left the beautiful creature and he stayed calm , it was a shock seeing her but he felt no fear towards her . In fact he was curious and wanted to know more , " Lyra ? Is everything alright ? " He asked from where he was standing on the front porch of the Hale house , he had n't heard anything from her family since the dinner so he hoped that nothing had happened . He was certain that Sterling would have at least informed Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texted or seen Scott over the weekend . <p> Slowly he stepped off the porch and took his time as he moved closer to Lyra , his eyes and face were soft as he meant no harm to her . He just wanted to see her in her full shift , now he understood why Levi was so set on not having her become the next Alpha . " I like your stripes , " He grinned wanting Lyra to feel comfortable , he would never push her or pressure her into doing anything she did n't want to . So if she ran off now , he would n't go after her and would n't mention it until she was ready and brought it up herself . But she surely was beautiful in her shift.Charlotte Ramos The Human <p> Charlotte had n't done much over the weekend , she spent most of her time with her Mom which was nice because Sterling was busy with Lyra . But when Monday came , she was ready to get out of the house although she was n't sure that would happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had left her blonde hair down as she wore a blouse with a nice skirt and tights , ankle booties covered her feet and she had a cardigan in her backpack in case she got cold . She stood by Lyra 's car and climbed in once her big sister had joined her , " It 's fine . " She spoke in her sweet voice , she knew how Lyra could sleep for hours when things were on her mind so she just let her sister be . She 'd ask once school was over and Lyra had a chance to actually wake up more , Charlotte sighed softly as she nodded . She was dreading this day , it would be Elijah 's first day and after what was said at dinner . She knew he 'd search for her just to make a point , " I 'll be fine . I 've dealt with him before too , I 'll go find Aunt Maria too . " She sent Lyra a confident smile as she climbed out of the car , as she rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was going to be late as she still needed to make it to her locker , so she went as fast as a human could and neatly placed her books into her locker before rushing over to her homeroom which was almost over . She apologized as her cheeks flushed with embarrassment , she quickly sat down beside Scott and regained her composure . " It was fine , boring actually . " She did n't want to tell him that none of her family had come over for a visit , which was very common for them and it did make Lottie extremely worried . Levi was quite persuasive and could have already gotten to some of her family , she would n't be surprised if he had gone around to each house and talked to them about what happened and why Lyra should n't be the next Alpha . But Charlotte could be stubborn and she would n't let Levi continue on doing this to their family , she 'd find a way to fix things as much as she possibly could . <p> She smiled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring as her 's , he was stuck at home and in his Dad 's office at the police station . It was a nice distraction for her so she was more than happy to listen to him , then they were off to their classes which filled their brains with knowledge and the day continued on as the same . She found out that her Aunt Marie was going to be teaching Scott 's maths class which Charlotte was jealous about , she would have loved her aunt to be her teacher but knew that Scott would learn even more with Marie as she was amazing at her job . Once Maths was over , Lydia went off to use the bathroom so Charlotte walked off to meet everyone in the cafeteria . During the day she had spotted Elijah a couple of times and it seemed like he had already made friends with the jocks , she had been minding her own business when she felt sharp nails press against her back . " We need to talk in private , " Elijah whispered to his younger cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her through the school and behind the lacrosse bleachers where they would n't be disturbed . <p> " My father wo n't let your filthy sister be Alpha , she does n't belong in this family . Neither of you do and when I become Alpha , I 'll be kicking you both out . She 's a disgrace to the Ramos name , I 'm ready to prove to our family that it should be me being the next Alpha . " Elijah warned his cousin as his claws turned back into normal fingernails , Charlotte stood there silently as anger boiled deep inside of her . " You 'll never be ready , Elijah . How many times has Lyra beaten you ? I 've lost count , and I dare you to threaten her again . " Her eyes narrowed at the boy in front of her , when he opened his mouth her hand went flying . Her palm made contact with Elijah 's cheek and although it was only a slap , she was still able to slap him and that was good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growl rumbled in his throat , " How dare you touch me . You pathetic weak human , " He spat as the back of his hand made hard contact with Charlotte 's cheek , the force of the hit sent her to the grassy ground as her skin sting and her blue eyes welled up with tears . Elijah stepped over her and grabbed her face with his hand , " Hey ! " Elijah glanced over and chuckled softly when he saw the bitten Alpha with a human toy beside him , " This is family business . " Elijah glared at the bitten wolf , he let Charlotte go and for something extra he let a claw scratch her cheek before he walked away .

A group of her girls around her own age had huddled around a recent Daily Prophet , whispering and giggling while stealing glances towards her . She did n't even need to look up to know that the headline was going on about the recent muggle-born controversies . She had heard enough from her own peers .

@@23757559 @3757559/ <h> How to Make a ( Simple ) Custom Profile Layout " Part II , CSS <p> There 's a lot you can do with HTML , but without CSS it 'll look pretty ugly . Read on to find out how to beautify your layout ! <p> This tutorial has been adapted from the Custom Layout Tutorial written by the lovely and fabulous lovecraft , as well as her FAQ ( updated FAQ ) . The bulk of it is her work ; I 've just updated it for New Mibba . <h> What 's CSS ? <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets , the key word being " style " . CSS works with HTML to make websites look pretty . Some of you may be used to editing the CSS on your Old Mibba default layouts , so you 'll have a headstart . Mibba no longer provides default HTML , but you can find a tutorial on making a simple HTML layout here . Now we need to create CSS to go with that HTML so that our layout does n't stay looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own separate page , but on New Mibba HTML and CSS are on the same page . All of your CSS code will go between these two lines at the top of the profile customization page : <p> &lt;style type= " text/css " &gt; <p> &lt;/style&gt; <h> Customizing Your Layout with CSS <p> We 'll start with the menu bar , which has Mibba 's navigation links . The HTML that created your menu bar is added automatically to your profile . Because we do n't have access to that HTML , we ca n't delete those links . We can , however , change the way they look with CSS . <p> The CSS code for your menu bar is this : <p> html body div #menu , html body div #menu a <p> Paste that in between the &lt;style&gt; tags of your layout . This code actually controls two elements of your menu bar : the menu bar and its text ( that 's what 's covered by html body div #menu ) and any links on the menu bar ( that 's html body div #menu a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar is links , we 're going to combine the code . The comma separates the two elements we 're changing so it 's not read as one long name . <p> Background color is controlled by this code : background-color : #hex ; . You probably recognize hex codes ; they 're a hash mark followed by six letters and/or numbers and are used to change colors in the Mibba layout makers and with BBcode on the boards and in comments . This website has a list of some common colors and their hex values . ( It also has a lot more information on HTML and CSS for when you 're ready to start exploring other ways to customize your profile ! ) You can also use a color picker like this one to find specific shades , or a website like this to generate a palette based on an image like the one in our layout , for example . <p> If we want the background of our menu bar to match the background of the rest of our page , there 's an easy way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of putting a hex code , just put : background-color : transparent ; . <p> Font is controlled by the code font-family : font name ; . We can fill in any font name we like ; however , if that font is n't installed on the computer used to view our profile , it 'll show up as a default font , which might be ugly . To avoid that happening , we 'll use a font installed on nearly every computer : font-family : Georgia ; . <p> To add a background image , we need a few codes . First , background-image : url ( direct link to image ) ; . This tells our layout where to find the image that 'll be our background . We 're going to use this image . Since our image is small , we want it to repeat all over the page . To ensure that happens , we 'll use the code background-repeat : repeat ; . There are other codes to control background images , but we do n't need them right now . Let 's add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that we have the menu bar and background image , let 's deal with the content of our layout , which is what we spent all that time making in the HTML part of the tutorial . Remember those IDs you assigned ? They 're coded in CSS with the hash mark , so &lt;div id= " container " &gt; becomes #container . <p> Our containing div is the best place to assign the width of our layout 's content . Since we have an image on top , we 're going to use its width for container . Our image is 500px wide , so the code we use is width : 500px ; . <p> Our header is close to all those menu bar links , so we 're going to move everything down with the margin code . Let 's move the container div down 25px . <p> #container width : 500px ; margin : 25 px ; <p> Here 's what our layout should look like now . We 've actually added a margin around our entire container div , although its only visible effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a margin only to the top , we would write margin-top instead of margin ( or -bottom , -right , or -left if we wanted to add or have different margins there ) . <p> Our text is a little hard to read on our background , so we 're going to add a solid color background to TDs two , three , and four . We 'll just use plain white , which is #fff . <p> Since we want TDs two , three , and four to look the same , we 're going to group them all together . Add this to your CSS : <p> #two , #three , #four background-color : #fff ; <p> This is what your layout will look like now . Notice how the text is squished up against the edges of our text areas . To fix this , we 're going to add padding : <p> #two , #three , #four background-color : #fff ; padding : 8px ; <p> That 's better , but we still have another problem : TD two is much narrower than TD three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We want them to be even , and since half of 500 is 250 , we 'll give each a width of 250px . We do n't want TD four to be 250px wide , though , so we 're going to start a new line that looks like this : <p> #two , #three width : 250px ; <p> Better , right ? Now let 's tackle the text . First we 'll deal with alignment . Let 's make TDs two and three center-aligned and TD four justified . <p> Here 's how it 'll look now . Notice how our headers in two , three , and four change with the text we have n't told headers what to look like yet , so they look the way the TD they 're in tells them to . <p> Now let 's change the font family , color , and size . You already know how to do the first two . To change font size , use font-size : #px ; . We 're going to make our text Tahoma , the same dark blue as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little nicer now , but the links are still the default orange . Link text will change font and size like normal text , but not color ; that has to be done separately . Let 's make ours green . All we need is a : <p> Our headers need some attention . Until now , they 've been inheriting the font style from their TD our header in TD one has n't received any formatting . Remember that we labeled our headers as &lt;div class= " head " &gt; . Because head is a class , it starts with a period instead of a hash mark . <p> Beneath should be the HTML created in the first part of this tutorial . <h> Personalizing Your Layout <p> You probably do n't want a layout full of filler text and links to Mibba 's homepage , so here I 'll show you how I would use this layout for myself . The most important thing you 'll need for this part is your user number . Your user number is the number associated with your account . Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> But I do n't want the top of my profile to say " Header " ; I want it to say my username . I could just type in my username , but then I 'd have to come back and change it if I changed my username . A handy trick to avoid this is to use USERNAME <p> &lt;td colspan= " 2 " id= " four " &gt; &lt;div class= " head " &gt;About Me&lt;/div&gt; My name 's &lt;b&gt;Mina&lt;/b&gt; .

@@23757560 @3757560/ <h> Salvador Dali : The Father of Surrealistic Art <p> In the history of art , most people could easily argue that Salvador Dal+ is the father of surrealistic art . " Surrealism is the stressing of subconscious or irrational significance of imagery arrived at by automatism or the exploitation of chance effects , unexpected juxtaposition , dreamlike figurines and etc . " ( Dictionary.com ) In more common terms , surrealism is the art of writing or painting unreal or unpredictable works of art using the images or words from the imaginary world . Dal+ interprets the idea of surreal art in most , if not all , of his works of art . Not only does he interpret surrealism in the majority of his pieces , he paints with his heart on the brush in all of his paintings . Any viewer would look as his work and let one thousand words flow . That being said , Salvador Dal+ is the greatest surreal artist to live . <p> Dal+s art is the definition of surrealism . Throughout his art he clearly elaborates on juxtaposition ( putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing the shape of an object ) , and morphing of objects ( ranging from melted objects dripping , to crutches holding distorted figures , to women with a head of a bouquet of flowers ) ( Goff 5 ) . <p> Dal+ would transform orbs of mysterious matter and flying snakes into the bust of a woman , as done in his piece Galatea of the Spheres . His genius use of juxtaposition in art is one of the many elements that define him as the father of surrealism ( Goff 95 ) . His painting Daddy Longlegs of the Evening-Hope ! is a good example of his technique of melting objects by drooping images of a human body , attempting to play a disfigured cello , over a tree branch ( Goff 82 ) . <p> Surrealism is the stressing of subconscious or irrational significance of imagery ( Dictionary.com ) , or in more simplistic terms , the use of dreamlike imagery . Dal+s absurd imagination has him painting pictures of figures no man would even dream of creating . One may believe him to be a lunatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many may consider it genius . The distortion on the figures that are often made into other figures is the best exemplar of surrealism . Dal+ often creates new images that are nonexistent to mankind stressing his knowledge and skill on creating surrealistic art . <p> Any great artist knows how to move the human eye throughout their artwork when one is observing their art . Dal+ knows just how to do that with not just colors , but his repetition and morphing of figures throughout his art . Dal+ is infamous for cutting blocks out of figures and placing the missing pieces in totally different places in his art . Dal+s art is similar to looking through a Pictionary game , discovering all the hidden secrets in his paintings . Something many may notice in his art is the repetition of figures through his art but changing them around to look like a new figure has been born . One good example would be in his painting Swans Reflecting Elephant where he reflects the swans in a lake and changing them slightly to look like elephants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dal+ also develops new techniques such as double images and drawers ( Goff 69 ) . The double images that he uses in his art stress his ideas of moving the eyes . Hed take two different images in symbolic clusters that come in and out of focus depending on how you look at the image . His other favorite technique drawers are used frequently through his painting . Drawers are often used in human figures transforming them into furniture . One good example of this would be in his painting The Burning Giraffe ( Goff 70 ) . <p> No matter how realistic or well done a piece is , the best pieces are always the ones that reflect personal feelings . Humans are naturally social people that communicate with each other verbally , physically , mentally and emotionally . If a work of art lacks all of the above , then its a dead piece of art that is n't as appealing to the eye . When humans can sympathize with a piece of art , it makes the work all the more great . Dal+ portrays his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . Anyone can look at his paintings and tell what his relative mood was while painting the picture . <p> One catastrophic event in Dal+s life that is a turning point in his art is the death of his mother on February 6 , 1921 . The death of his mother causes him to change his styles from painting portraits and landscapes to borrowing many other styles and began reflecting his tormented soul ( Goff 20 ) . His love for his wife is also portrayed in his painting Galarina . His feelings of depression led him to painting gloomy pictures . Although many might not know how to sympathize with the emotions Dal+ expresses in his art , those who do could probably come to an understanding of his feelings often being expressed in his paintings . <p> In all of Dal+s works he clearly defines the idea of surrealism art . All of his art could be a good exemplar of surreal art . Dal+s art could and probably has inspired many modern day artists including myself . All of these aspects make him the father of surreal art .

The idea of the game is to get rid of all of your cards on your blitz pile by making stacks of cards by suit , ace through ten . The game is best played in a circle or around a table . You have to be close enough to the other players to reach the piles of cards in the playing area . <p> Each player starts with a deck of regular playing cards . Remove the Joker and face cards . Keep the aces . <p> Shuffle your deck . <p> Lay three cards face-up in front of you . Make a forth pile of ten cards face down . This stack is known as your blitz pile .

@@23757593 @3757593/ <h> Response To Lisa Scott 's Review Of Banquo 's Son <p> Ever wondered what happened to Fleance at the end of Macbeth ? Yes - I did . And so , probably , did millions of readers of Shakespeare since the play was first published several centuries ago . This enormous audience , it would seem , does not include book reviewer Lisa Scott . <p> It appears that Ms. Scott is n't really very well read in Shakespeare - either that , or she skim-read Macbeth , a true literary crime for any of his plays . Fleance 's appearance in the play may be small , but his significance can not be shoved under the carpet . The three witches , who corrupted Macbeth into tyranny , foretold that Banquo ( cousin to Macbeth ) would not be a king , but that he would father kings , presenting him and his son as a threat to Macbeth 's reign . The biggest question that is left hanging at the end of the play is thus : What becomes of Fleance , and will he one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricately linked to the throne , he is far more of a plot shaper than one would expect for a minor character . Macbeth took pains to arrange the assassination of Banquo and Fleance in order to secure his hold on Scotland . Fleance did n't simply escape because Shakespeare hated child abuse . Macbeth could not escape the witches ' predictions , and try as she might , neither can Ms. Scott . <p> The true spirit of the story of Macbeth is preserved in Banquo 's Son . Macbeth deals with the throne of Scotland , greed and power , honour and trust , loyalty and corruption . Ms. Roxborogh deals us an identical hand with a fresh , original story that is faithful to its predecessor . This is far more deserving of praise than criticism . I would like to see Ms. Scott tackle such a daunting challenge and match the masterpiece that is Banquo 's Son , before throwing around harsh and poor judgment . <p> It is interesting to note that Ms. Scott peppers her review with scathing remarks about the theme of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hamlet , which is widely considered Shakespeare 's greatest work - again , a lack of Shakespearean education on her part , I would presume . The relationship between Fleance and Rosie is besieged by a myriad of problems that mirrors Hamlet and Ophelia in Hamlet ; Ms. Scott refers to this as it appears in Banquo 's Son as ' the rollercoaster ride ' . Both Fleance and Hamlet neglect their love interest for the need to revenge the death of their fathers , both whom appear to their sons as ghosts . <p> Fleance is plagued with the issue of nobility and marriage ( he being of royal blood , she being a peasant girl ) , and Ophelia is warned by her father to cease her relationship with the Hamlet as , being the future king , he can not marry a girl of such low status as her . Love versus honour and love versus class - these are not half baked ideas one reads on the jacket of a Mills and Boon novel , but complex , contemplative themes that flow from the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Banquo 's Son , Ms. Roxborogh writes ' Everything in life comes with a price ' . This is a universal statement that rings true throughout Shakespeare 's plays , and Ms. Roxborogh has done tremendous justice to it in her novel . <p> The New Zealand Book Month website states " Lisa Scott 's wit and smart observations will be a treat for us as we celebrate the fourth NZ Book Month " , and so far , this claim has proven to be false . I have observed no wit from Ms. Scott , nothing smart in the way of observations , and the only treat I 've received is the story enclosed in the pages of the beautiful , shiny , black book in my hand that Ms. Roxborogh has gifted the world with . New Zealand should be proud to have her as an author .

Then we have the characters that don/t quite fit either bill , the wonderful anti-heroes such as Watchmen 's Rorschach or the Hulk , characters which can either have a strange set of morals that are almost as sinister as a villains or those who lose control and can not help their actions despite having them held against them . <p> Moving away from definitions , much like everything else in society , comic book characters are subject to stereotypes .

It was here that the ever popular Watchmen , The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke were published . In more recent times we 've seen Dick Grayson , the first Robin and later Nightwing , take on the title of Batman and of course , there 's been the many comic book movies which have introduced formerly less known characters such as Iron Man into a wider audience . <p> Of course , this is only a brief overview of superheroes in the comic book genre .

@@23757610 @3757610/ <h> Writing Fanfiction Without The Internet Hating You <p> Possibly one of the most hated and feared things on the Internet is fanfiction . Those stories written by thirteen-year-old fan girls who want to get in Tom Feltons pants and havent actually played any of the Kingdom Hearts games or listened to a single song of insert your favorite bands name here . <p> So , due to its popularity and the 70% chance that the fanfic you just clicked on will make you either roll your eyes , cry , or want to troll , its no surprise that the internet makes assumptions about fanfiction and its quality . However , the other 30% of people that can write a fanfiction that actually know how stories work have been given a bad name . And if you aspire to rise from the 70 to the 30 , or just want to get it right the first time , this article might be able to point you in the right direction . Surprisingly , its not as different from original fiction as many people are led to believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Across the board , almost everyone agrees that the element that will make or break a story , particularly a fanfiction , is the characters . This is because more often than not , when we want to create fan works based off the original canon , its because we feel a deep connection to the characters , rather than the setting . So with a fanfiction , its vital to either keep the characters in-character or make plausible changes that befit the new background you give them . And besides , as Mibbian fooleish puts it , " you ca n't just take advantage of the fact that your readers likely are at least a little familiar with the source material . " In other words , you have no idea who might be reading your fanfiction , so make sure your characters are fleshed out , regardless of how big or small of a role in the canon they might play . <p> Even more difficult is the introduction of OCs , or Original Characters . Unfortunately , these have been so poorly executed over the years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue . So the key then is to have a well-rounded original character . Ask yourself : Does your OC have more powers or is more " special " than the main character of the canon ? Are their strengths , weaknesses , appearance and personality befitting and plausible in the canon ? These questions and more can help you develop an OC that will not only work as a character , but be pleasing to both you and your readers . <h> Setting and Canon <p> The second piece that makes a fanfiction a fanfiction is the world , or setting , or canon , whichever way you want to phrase it . You need to be familiar with this just like you would with the characters if you want to write something that people are n't  going to be flaming . For something like a band fiction or based off a movie/tv/book set in the real world , being familiar with the characters backstory is typically considered the canon , though this is easier to twist . But when it comes to something more complex with a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules of the universe are almost more important than the characters backgrounds . You might be able to get away with changing Harrys parentage if you do a good job of explaining everything , but the minute he comes up with an x-ray vision spell , you 're treading in dangerous waters filled with trolls , flamers , and haters . <p> Of course , canon as well can be twisted successfully , and that 's where you run into AU or Alternate Universe . This is where we find fanfiction to be truly limitless , as long as you keep logic . But keeping logic is something that you have to do with any story . If the canon characters are now all going to be hosts of TV shows , then there still needs to be an element of the canon in some form ( their personalities , for instance ) , otherwise you might as well be writing an original fiction . There 's a fine balance when it comes to writing a successful AU . <h> Anything Else ? <p> Yes , actually : Originality . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think it , it was probably done before . So you need to put an original spin on things . Maybe its tweaking the characters to fit your style . Maybe its switching the plot around a little and enjoying the results . Whatever it is , make it your own and treasure it . Make it work . As i saw sparks of Mibba says it , " the most important aspect of writing fanfiction would be having the ability to walk the line between putting your own spin on things and doing the characters justice . " In other words , originality within story logic and reason . <p> And with originality should come quality . If you 've done justice to the original material , whether you 're write canon-based or an AU , whatever you come up with should be as quality as a published book . Fanfiction to fooleish is , " just a story you 're trying to tell , whether the characters and settings are your own or not , and it should n't be of a greater or lesser quality either way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get publish . Wicked by Gergory Maguire is an example of a fanfiction that has been published , and even adapted into a Broadway musical . <p> So go out there , add some OCs , write some AU , spell-check , and create a fanfiction that is worthy of praise and not flames .

@@23757613 @3757613/ <h> Writing Sex Scenes Without Making Your Readers Cringe <p> Many people have difficulty making the transition into incorporating sex scenes into their writing . Though when it comes to smut , different people have equally diverse personal preferences , this tutorial outlines some key elements that can be crucial when approaching a sex scene . <p> Before I begin , I would like to start by saying that no one should feel the need to write sex simply in hopes of getting more readers . If you 're someone who is just uncomfortable with writing about the subject , do n't  force yourself to do it . The awkwardness that you feel will have a tendency to be mirrored in the piece . On the other hand , if you 're someone who really wants to write sex but is unsure of where to start , this tutorial may help you . <h> Character Development <p> As with any story , character development is an essential aspect , and this also holds true with smut . Readers are less likely to become fully immersed in any story if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can feel awkward and somewhat intrusive to read a sex scene between characters that are complete strangers to the reader . Who are these characters as individuals , and how would they react in the circumstances at hand ? It seems like a simple enough question , but the answers often can be complex . Spending some time getting to know your own characters as individuals can really help in this aspect , and different people have different ways of accomplishing a relationship between themselves as a writer and the characters that they create . <p> Emotions are a great way of incorporating a sense of characterization into a piece because even if a reader has never experienced first-hand the same things that a character is going through , emotions are universal . For example , though I have never been kidnapped , I have felt fear , so I would be able to relate to a character that had experienced kidnapping if the writer effectively portrayed that characters fear . <p> The same holds true while writing sex scenes . Regardless of the relationship between the characters involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions to light will only enhance the piece . From the anxious excitement that can accompany a first sexual encounter to the emotional distance between characters at the verge of breaking up , emotions can help bring characters to life and make them relatable to the reader . Even if a character is completely wasted , the feelings and sensations that accompany that drunken haze should be portrayed to the reader . <h> Relationship Development <p> Relationship development and character development often go hand-in-hand . Just as in real life , you can learn a lot about a person based on how they interact with others in their life , this concept also holds true for stories . <p> Regardless of the actual relationship between the characters , it is still something that needs to be developed , once again , in order to make both the character and the encounter feel real to the reader . Even if the sex scene portrays a one-night stand between strangers , there is a relationship there that needs to be developed and set forth for the reader . Where did they meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagery <p> Even if your style is n't the most flowery or the most descriptive , imagery is another aspect that is important both in stories in general and in sex scenes . I am , by no means , suggesting that anyone spend five paragraphs describing in detail the golden flecks in a characters eyes if that is n't the most important aspect of the story . Its all about balance , teetering on the line between bogging the reader down with details or leaving the reader with nothing to get a good grasp on . <p> One thing I 've noticed in a lot of smut pieces is that , while there is a lot of emphasis on the visuals , other sensory elements seem to fall to the wayside . While it does n't  hurt to mention a characters well-defined six-pack , there is more to sex ( and any experience , really ) than just the visuals . Taking time to incorporate scents , such as the musky stench that clings to a cheap motel room or the crisp scent of a characters cologne , can really enhance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same holds true for other sensory elements such as sounds , sensations , and flavors . <h> Avoid Awkward Phrasing <p> Though this is also a matter of personal preference , one thing that can really yank a reader out of an intimate moment is laughable or awkward terms . Though , like beauty , awkwardness is really in the eye of the beholder , there are certain terms that get a bad rap for their awkwardness , such as the terms " length " and " member " to describe a males genitalia and " heat " and " sex " to describe female genitalia . That being said , that does not mean that these terms can not be used in an effective way , depending on the phrasing and the writers personal style . Its really just another instance where the writers judgment has to come into place . <p> A good method of finding out if something is phrased awkwardly is to reread the line aloud ( or in your head , if you 're not alone ) . If the wording makes you laugh or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same reaction from readers . <p> Another instance where awkward phrasing can come into play is in dirty talk . At times , a lot of the dirty talk Ive come across in numerous stories on a wide array of websites comes across as forced , stiff , unrealistic , or not true to the character that theyve established . It really depends on the characters that you 've established as a writer and staying true to their personalities . If the characters involved in the sexual encounter you 're trying to portray are n't  the type you could visualize talking explicitly to each other , its probably a good idea to leave out the dirty talk . There 's no unspoken rule that a sex scene has to include dirty talk in order to be considered " hot . " <p> Often times , what makes a particular phrase or term sound off is not that term in itself , but because the term or phrase does not mesh well with the tone that the writer has already established . For example , if I were writing a passionate , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narration , it would stick out like a sore thumb . On the other hand , if the tone I had established had been more animalistic , that term would be fitting . <p> In conclusion , much like writing in general , there is no specific list of dos and donts when it comes to writing sex in stories . Every writers style is different , and no one should feel compelled to follow a specific formula in his or her own writing . As a reader and a writer of smut , this is simply a compilation of different elements I have noticed consistently in various pieces that stood out in my mind . As with any form of writing , it is important to use your own judgment .

Other than the abstract , dark bags under your eyes and bad hair days almost every day is a sure visual sign that you 're in exam week , or , as it 's affectionately known as : hell week . Your body takes a while for these symptoms to alleviate , so to avoid dark rings under your eyes -- and the dreaded procrastination -- follow these tips that just might help during those stressful times . <h> 1 . Do n't  rush <p> Procrastinating does n't  help you at all . You have to give yourself enough time to study so that your brain can process everything you 're trying to make it work through at once . You ca n't force two month 's worth of lessons in just a few hours . One calm hour of study every day is better than six hours of stressed-out cramming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Start studying the most difficult subject for you for example , Math or History . Then inch your way towards the less learning-based subjects such as English . <h> 2 . Focus on areas you are unsure of when studying <p> There is absolutely no point in studying the stuff you know inside-out constantly . You need to also focus on the areas that you are unsure of . A good way to discern areas to study is to use a traffic-light system . Any subjects you are completely unclear of should be labelled red - danger . These are the areas to focus on the most . Anything you are unsure of , but have a fairly good grasp on should be amber - almost there . Focus on these areas once you have focused on the red-light areas . And finally , for those areas that you are super-confident in , label them in green - good to go ! These are the areas that you could get away with reading over once or twice the day before your exam . <h> 3 . Take regular breaks when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , but the important thing to remember is that you need regular breaks . It is said that the human brain can only concentrate for so long ( +/- 20 minutes at a time ) , so a good system is to study for an hour , give yourself a 5 to 10 minute break , and then continue . During your breaks , get up and walk around . Make yourself a mug of your favourite hot beverage or fix yourself a healthy snack . You 'll feel fresher and more ready to begin again using this method . <h> 4 . Snack and drink <p> As stated at the start of the article , preparing for exams is like being pregnant ; you 're in a delicate condition and are emotionally fragile . Take advantage of this attitude ! Ask your parents to cook or buy you your favorite food so you can snack in between studying for Conics and the Elements of the Periodic Table .

Make notes <p> Sometimes trying to remember names , dates and events can be tricky . Revive your highlighters and rediscover crayons . A great method using color is to color-code the facts . Colors act as a visual mnemonic , which is an easy way for some to remember things . If you do n't  like different colors in one page , stick to one . If you do n't  like highlighters at all , try making notes . For example , to remember the conjunctions , remember FANBOYS which stands for : for , and , nor , but , or , yet , so . <h> 6 . Test yourself <p> One way to know if you really understand something is to test yourself . Embrace testing do n't  be shy or embarrassed to make mistakes . After all , you 're only human .

Some students think that during exam week , sleep is a waste of time . That 's absolutely not true at all . In fact , sleep affects your performance . Study shows that people who sleep seven hours at night do better on memory tasks than those who do not . Some people might argue about which is the " right " amount of sleep , but for students , it should be 6-8 hours . Also , try to keep a consistent sleeping pattern for the whole week so that you can save your brains memory power and energy . The effects of sleep loss last for days and it will take time for your body to recover . So in preparation for exams , you need to sleep . ( Just do n't  sleep on your books ; it might smudge the ink. ) <h> 8 . Read the question fully <p> It 's all-too-easy to go into an exam , panic and only read half of the question before answering . A recipe for disaster , this method could leave you without some important knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully , even if it seems tedious or a waste of precious time . As well as giving you time to calm yourself down , you have a better understanding of what the paper is asking you to do . <h> 9 . When you see the test , do n't panic ; stay calm and remember to breathe <p> The common reaction of students when they receive the test papers is forgetting to breathe and having a mind-block right from the start . Or worse : you realize that you missed 30 minutes of the exam and you only have another 20 to finish it . In the end , you skip some questions , give short explanations and forget to read the instructions . <p> To combat this you need to understand the following : first of all , most organisms stay alive through breathing , so try to breathe normally to avoid fainting or premature death in the middle of an exam . Second , the instructions/essay questions are your key to an effective explanation or answers . Third , write down the equations you know at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember how to solve problems just in case you forget them when you encounter those questions during the test . Lastly , correction tape or liquid is your best friend . Crossing out your mistakes makes your paper look dirty and unorganized , so use correction tape to erase those mistakes and make your paper look neater and less frantic . Lastly , and most importantly , you have to set your pace accordingly ; do n't  dwell on difficult questions . Skip them , but get back to them before the time runs out . <h> 10 . Relax ! <p> No matter what happens , you 're always going to do your best . If that 's an A , fantastic . If it 's a D , do n't worry ! We all have our strong and weak subjects . As long as you put your all into your exams , you can be proud of your results . So relax , do n't worry ! In the end , if you follow this tips , you will see results worthy of your potential !

@@23757619 @3757619/ <h> How to Pay Attention in a Lecture <p> Let 's just be honest , not every single lecturer you get is a super enthusiastic young adult who has a great topic to talk about . Quite a few of them are old men who drone on and on about seemingly nothing and make half of the class fall asleep . Here are five tips that might work for you on how to pay attention and get those notes you need for exams . <h> Ignore Other People <p> The main thing here is not talking to your friends . Not only is it super distracting to others around you , but you and your friends are missing out on what 's being said . Talk about your weekend after the lecture , not during it . There 's a time and a place for everything , and the lecture theatre is not a place for gossip . This tip also applies to the people that come in late and slam the door , or the sick people that sniff and cough really loudly . Ignore those sounds and just focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every lecture theatre has a clock , every teenager has a cell phone , and a lot of people have laptops that they type their notes on . They all tell you the time , and staring at it watching the seconds tick by , or constantly glancing at it to see only one minute has passed is not beneficial for you at all . Keep your eyes to the front and resist checking the time . Its a lot more distracting than you may realise . <h> Do n't  Browse the Internet or Play Games <p> As I just mentioned , a lot of people are using laptops these days , including myself . I often see people on Facebook or playing solitaire instead of taking notes . Just because you 're browsing the net or playing a game does n't  mean you are listening , so keep your Internet browser and your games window closed . Not minimised , closed . <h> Pick a Good Seat for You <p> Everyone will concentrate better in different places . If you need to be up the front so no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have to be there an extra five minutes early to get that spot . Maybe you are more comfortable in an aisle seat because you can stretch your legs out . It does n't  matter what your preference is , you should try and sit there for every lecture . <h> Use Optimal Note-Taking Systems <p> This is different for everybody , and you need to spend some time figuring out what is best for you . If you spend a lot of time writing long and neat notes , you might be spending less time listening and therefore will miss a lot of key information . Perhaps recording lectures would be a good option for you . And if you 're super quick at typing , then bringing along your laptop could be a good idea . Look into other ways that might work for you , and experiment until you 're as efficient as possible . <p> Keep on thinking of your own ideas on how to improve your lecture experience . Hopefully at least one of these tips was helpful and you can use it to start paying attention . Good luck for your exams !

These can be bought for relatively low prices , or you can find a range of free antivirus software online . <h> Empty the Recycle Bin <p> The recycle bin is something that many people forget exists . When you delete files for the first time , they are n't  fully deleted , but rather moved to the recycle bin where they still take up valuable space in your computers memory .

Substances such as coffee and tea are acidic and will rot into your laptop over time and cause numerous problems . The first way to stop this is simple : do n't  drink near your laptop !

It should be believable , and not a huge surprise because your plot should have been leading up to it . <p> You can also use elements such as Foreshadowing to help your plot as well . <h> How Do I Write a Good Climax ? <p> Big words and detail are the last thing you want to use when writing the climax of your story . You want to make your original conflict strong . Then as the story builds , you need two or three good attempts at resolving it . <p> Remember that a story is a " situation " - you are putting your characters in a situation and then having them work their way out of it . Unless the situation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax is some kind of a confrontation . Make it strong . Be very careful that it is realistic . Do n't  make something like guns suddenly materialize at the right place and right time , make everything flow . Remember to always make it realistic . You want to keep the main focus in tact with as little confusion as possible , best way to do this , with minimal details . You need just enough detail to get the vision and feel right and big words are n't  necessary . <p> To make your climax interesting you want situations like life or death . Keep the focus as tight as you can on the antagonist and the protagonist . Think of it as a movie if you will . In a movie , at the climax , you do n't suddenly have cuts to show you the scenery and stuff like that - the director focuses on the characters-right down to their hands . For instance , if its a war scene , they go as in depth as to who is going to shoot first ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good climax , it 's like the air is suddenly sucked out of a room and all you can hear is the ticking of a clock . Maybe . Whether it 's a dramatic one or a happy one , the idea is the same . Skip the adjectives and descriptions , eliminate the extra big words . <h> How Do I Write the Rising Action ? <p> Well , the rising action of a story are the events that lead up to your climax , they are your big events that have a huge impact on your story . The first thing you want to do is create a protagonist who is a dynamic character that changes in a significant way ( positively or negatively ) You want to place events , twists and the connections to your protagonist in a logical order so that your story is clearly understood . Using vivid and descriptive words you help the story flow towards your climax . You also want to make sure that you intensify the rising action as you go along . Have your main character be a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a struggle with loss , insecurity , insanity , love , etc . Also , put in literary elements that reflect your characters and conflicts within your story , drawing your reader into your story , making them not want to put it down . The most common types used are suspense , irony , similes and metaphors . Be sure to remember that the most intriguing stories are the ones in which a reader has to really think outside of the box , so make sure to include implications where your reader has to really read between the lines . <h> How Do I Write the Falling Action ? <p> The falling action of a story is your events leading up to the end , it is where the ties start coming together and you can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel . You want to make sure you answer any questions your reader may have had in reading your story , and make it so your ending is believable . You do n't  want to have a story lead up to a completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? Your falling action should flow nicely after your climax and provide a sense of future for your protagonist . In the closing part(s) of your story you want to provide a sense of accomplishment or perhaps failure for your protagonist and make your ending/resolution clear . <h> Writing a Good Resolution <p> Your resolution is your end of the story , the point where everything is said and done and you can either envision your characters with a bright and sunny future or weeping in a cemetery . Your resolution should make your readers jump for joy , cry with tears of sadness , or leave them hanging if you plan on writing a sequel ( though it is not recommended ) . 
@@23757626 @3757626/ <h> Things I Love About Lee Taemin <p> Hi guys , so this blog is inspired by Doritos lovely blog that she wrote earlier explaining her love towards Onew . So , I thought it would be good to write down all my feelings for Taemin in one place and share it with the world . <p> I 'll try not to ramble on , but I 'm not promising anything . <p> I first saw Taemin about 5 months , not face to face or anything but in the music video for Lucifer . It was kind of a love at first sight thing . Although not in a weird way , I guess I was just in lust with him at that point since I did n't even know his name . Slowly my addiction with SHINee developed and the way I felt towards Taemin did as well . At the time , when I first started listening to K-Pop I had a thing for guys with long hair , I still do , so since at that point Taemin had long hair I was automatically drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHINee that I really became a fan , I started to notice cute little things about each member , Taemin in particular . It started with the way he smiles , usually with his teeth on show . Although the cute , shy smile he does is incredible adorable . <p> On the subject of smiling , you get Taemin 's motto : " Never Forget To Smile . " I never use to have anything to smile for , I use to hate life and well I was basically depressed and I feel like Taemin has given me a reason to smile . He 's so brave , everyday he goes through so much . He gave up friendships to follow his dreams , he hardly ever see 's his family and yet he always smiles . His troubles and worries made me feel bad for always complaining about my life when in fact my life is n't even that bad . <p> Taemin has always been labelled at ' Taeminnie ' or ' Taebaby ' but he has matured quite a lot since their debut , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , he still has plenty of immature moments . <p> Okay , so onto what I love about his personality . <p> Firstly , I love that he 's really shy around new people . Although he has a rather bubbly personality , he is extremely shy around people he 's never talked to before . For example , when he audition for SM he wore a set of headphones so people would n't talk to him , he did n't have music playing through them , in fact he did n't even own an mp3 . He just stuck the end in his pocket , so that people would n't talk to him . <p> I love how devoted he is to his work , dancing is his passion and always has been . He 's been dancing since he was a kid and used to practice for hours each day to make himself better . If something needs to be done than he will do it the best he can and put all his effort into it . <p> Probably my favourite thing about his personality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taemin is probably going to be the first to have a child . In Hello Baby the members took the baby to get his hair cut . The kid did n't want to get his hair cut , so Taemin brought toys to distract and bribe the kid into it . It did n't work in the end , but Taemin tried his best to keep the kid from crying or being upset . Despite only being young he tried his best and worked hard at trying to be the best father possible . Sure he made mistakes along the way but he cared . ( Imagine raising a child with Taemin and he makes your son/daughter cry and then spends ages trying to calm the kid down before finally calling on you for help ... ) <p> Another thing I adore about Tae is his forgetfulness . The amount of interviews and shows I 've watched when the other members have brought up funny stories about Taemin is unbelievable . He really is a clutz . Losing things then not finding them for ages , then eventually asking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you what I love about him based off his looks . <p> He looks good with every hair colour , like I have never seen him with a bad hair colour . He 's had red , blonde , brunette , black ... etc . He just looks perfect no matter what he does to his hair . Curly , long , short , dyed . It does n't matter because it always suits him . Not I personally prefer it when it 's in a small ponytail because he looks adorable ! I mean , just look : <p> I think all Asian men look cute with their hair in a ponytail . <p> One thing I like about his looks is that he 's developing some muscles . I do n't like guys that are overly muscular but Tae has just a little bit of muscle and it looks good on him , although I am use to seeing him with a rather girly body shape . Taemin 's muscles look really nice though , I just want to meet him and hug him to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be in his arms , snuggled into his chest ... Even imagining it makes me smile . <p> Have I mentioned how beautiful he looks as a girl ? He looks really really good as a female , he 's more feminine then me ! <p> How is it possible to look that attractive ... A guy dressed as a girl that looks better than most girls ? I would go lesbian for him if he was a woman . Which I secretly think he is Who can say that they know Taemin is a man when he looks like this : <p> Seriously ? Nobody can tell me he is pure man . <p> Anyways , I should probably stop rambling about Taemin and stuff . Just , wow he 's perfect.But today was my first day at school , it went fine nobody kicked off , there was n't any arguments . It was all okay . I found out my results for my GCSE Science exams I did at the end of Year 10 and I got a C in Chemistry ! I 'm super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a really cool thing every Thursday last period the teachers are all going to teach something they 're interested in . For example : My DT teacher is going to do a lesson on Marine Animals . I can pick whatever teacher I want , so if i 'm interested in something and one of my teachers decides to give a lesson on it then I can go along and learn more about it ! Yay ! <p> Well anyways , I should probably go now I have things to do . Good bye guys : )

@@23757632 @3757632/ <h> Intelligence : The Importance of Individual Differences <p> Intelligence is one of the more active debates currently in psychology . It is one which has stemmed disagreement among professionals and laymen alike . No matter how we try , it seems no one can come to a conclusive agreement as to the definition of intelligence . It has been known to encompass almost all of the popular psychological debates ; nature vs nurture being just one . However , it was n't until recently that people started to take an interest in the differences between peoples perceptions of individual intelligence . <p> It would not take an expert to convince you that what intelligence is differs from place to place and region to region for example what is classed as intelligence is different in the Western hemisphere than the Eastern Hemisphere . This is both obvious and expected , so why am I telling you this ? Because researchers have noticed changes over recent years , in that more of the eastern oriental countries ( Korea , China and Japan ) are adopting more westernised ideals of intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals whom are not experts in the area of intelligence research and/or testing ) . In the United States , laypersons rated intelligence as the presence of the following : practical problem-solving ( this is the ability to solve everyday problems ) , verbal ability ( the ability to confidently communicate , this meaning one can solve the problem and successfully communicate the solution both confidently and clearly ) , social competence ( this would involve the person being able to confidently socialist so people having social skills is considered intelligent behaviour ) . These are the major requirements to be considered intelligence . <p> We then compare these to the eastern definitions of intelligence including : general cognitive factor of intelligence , this referring to something similar to the western ideal of problem solving , and also is related to ones cognitive ability so this refers to higher cognitive competency would lead to better ability to problem solve . Interpersonal intelligence refers to the ability to communicate with others and be adept in social situations , also being able to change from one social situation to another without difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the western ideal of intelligence and refers to ones modesty as such , for it includes ones ability to know their abilities and values to a true level and thus one 's ability to view themselves objectively .

Intellectual self-effacement which refers to the ability to be modest about intellect . <p> Yet Korean studies in 2002 suggested that Koreans are taking a more western ideal of intelligence in that they rate intelligence as the following : social competence , problem solving ability , coping with novelty , self-management ability and practical competence . Of course , intelligence differs across age ranges as well , what a child deems intelligent is different through the childhood years , and adults view one anothers intelligence as something separate for the individual your intelligence level may differ in anothers view , this depends on the situation , as our abilities differ in situations . <p> Yet , this is just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all experts on the matter of intelligence . So what happens when researchers turn to experts in topics such as various university professors on the matter of intelligence ? Not a lot . Although some may think there would be some form of agreement of what intelligence is , this was not the case , and when 38 professionals were together to discuss what intelligence was , 38 different definitions were suggested . However , this is a good thing and instead of us considering this to be an unconfirmed conclusion , we should see it in the view point that what intelligence is truly does differ between both situations and professions . For example key differences were found between the four professions of Arts , Business , Philosophy and Physics .

@@23757640 @3757640/ <h> Somebody To You <p> Olivia had just finished getting ready for her first day of work , she was so excited to be part of a blockbuster film it was n't her first but it was her first superhero movie . As she quickly pulled her hair in a tight bun she looked at the time , it was four am , she had to be on set around six in the morning . She had to get every costume ready for everyone , that included Scarlett , Sebastian , Mackie and Chris . She was shaky she 's worked with plenty of celebrities before so this should n't have to be a problem . Olivia looked over at her roommate and one of her best friend 's just sitting up trying to wake up , " come on Katie , you volunteered for this job , we have to do everything according to plan , come on " she chuckled pulling her up.Sebastian rolled over on his bed and sighed softly , it was one of the first days on set , he was excited to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big deal . It was barely four am and he was getting up and getting dressed . Rehearsal had been great and everyone always told him how amazing he was doing , Sebastian loved acting and he wanted to improve he wanted to show the world what he was made out of . As soon as he was finished he was out the door and headed for the studio . <p> Katie groaned , flopping backwards back onto her pillows . " I 'm regretting it , " she mumbled , running her hand over her face . She groaned again and forced herself to stand up . She hated getting up early , so this was borderline torturous for her . Four AM ? That was just plain cruel . She struggled slightly to get out of her pjs , not caring that Olivia was in the room , then out of her underwear . She pulled on a fresh set of panties and a new bra , then rummaged through her drawers to find something decent to wear to work . She pulled it on and moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-up ( which was n't much , just mascara ) . " I 'm gon na brush my teeth , " Katie said as she walked out of the bedroom , and into the bathroom.Chris took a drink of his coffee as he pulled onto the set , parking his car one handed . He got out , a pair of sunglasses on his head and some lines for that day in his hand . He was really early , but he 'd woken up and did n't want to go back to sleep for another half an hour and end up groggy as all balls on the set . He headed for his trailer , humming quietly to himself as he did . Filming had only started a few days ago , so he was still getting used to where everything was . But , as it did only start a few days ago , he was still excited about being filming . Even in the later stages of filming , Chris still loved coming to work every day . He worked with great people . <p> Olivia chuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean if you regret you can stay , I 'm just saying you wo n't be seeing Sebastian or Chris if you do n't show up . " Olivia tapped her foot for a moment before she watched her friend get up and walk to the bathroom . She chuckled and walked to the kitchen , " come on , I 'll buy you some coffee , it 's on me okay ? " Olivia sat on the sofa as she waited for her friend to finish up , a bag in between her legs as she took a sip of orange juice and a bite out of a bagel.Sebastian pulled up yawning as he parked his car on the spot with his name on it , perks of being a Hollywood star he supposed , it made it easier not fighting for a spot . As he got out he stretched for a bit taking a sip of his Starbucks coffee before walking towards his trailer . Who was right next to Chris ' he 'd sometimes say hello and catch up , he figured it was still too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had told him he would probably have to be lubed up for the arm . Sebastian would n't mind , it was all part of his job . <p> " Yeah yeah yeah , " Katie said , quite muffled from the toothbrush in her mouth . After a short time she was ready to go and was heading towards the front door . " It 's gon na have to be an extra large . I mean , it 's still dark out for Christ 's sake . I 'm gon na need a lot of pick me ups . " She grabbed her purse from the table by the door and pulled open the front door . She was actually really excited . She never really got star struck , she 'd met a bunch of celebrities , mostly through Olivia , before , and she never really freaked out . She 'd had a crush on Chris since Fantastic Four , though , and Sebastian since he was in the Covenant , so it was a bit of a victory for her younger self.Chris plopped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet up . He was glad he got to relax for a while before he had to go to hair and makeup and wardrobe . He was one of the lucky superheros who did n't have to spend ages in a chair getting painted , or any of that . The days where he had fight scenes were a bit more lengthy , but at least he was n't playing Mystique . That would have been hell . <p> Olivia chuckled , shaking her head at her best friend , " all right , I 'll even throw in one of those pastry things you like so much , let 's go before we 're late . " They were on their way out with excitement and lack of sleep but that did n't matter , this was a huge movie she was getting to work for and Olivia was excited . While she did n't necessarily came up with the costume designs , she usually sowed them up and put them together which is one thing she was good at and enjoyed doing , though sometimes it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's seat and pulled on her seat belt , " I 'm so nervous , I know I should n't be but I never thought I 'd meet Chris or Sebastian , I 'm giddy " she laughed.Sebastian grabbed his script and began flipping through the pages , even though he did n't have many lines he 'd figured he 'd read what he did have and the gestures and everything he had to do . It was very important for him to get into character . He grabbed his coffee and took another sip before clearing his throat looking at the time an sitting up , he wondered what scenes were they going to cover today . Bucky 's costume was n't so much work , it was mostly the left arm that was all the work . It was annoying but Sebastian knew it would be good in the end . <p> " Wo n't lie , I 'm scared I 'm going to quote the Covenant at Sebastian . This is probably a bad idea , " Katie said buckling her belt . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just met . When she started school , it was telling people she wet the bed . When she went into high school , it was about the time she crapped her pants in the eighth grade because she got the flu . In front of celebrities , it was quoting things she 'd seen them in . She tried her hardest to act normal in front of new people , but she always felt at least kinda awkward and defaulted to being a freak.It was n't long before Chris had grown bored and left his trailer . He knew that the canteen would be open early , members of the crew had been there for a few hours already , so he could grab himself a second breakfast . He put his hands in his pockets as he strolled towards where the food was , resuming his humming . He gave smiles to the few people he past , even a little wave to one woman who seemed particularly happy to see him . <p> Olivia smiled at her friend , " You know I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down to earth kind of guy , he 'll probably be impressed and find it awesome how you quote that stuff , " she nodded . Olivia pulled out once they were both well seated in the car , she made a quick stop to Starbucks and grabbed a large coffee for Katie along with some pastries , and drove to the studio . " Seriously , relax , I 'm trying to relax and it 's hard when you 're freaking out here " she chuckled.Sebastian had fallen asleep on the sofa for a good twenty minutes before his phone rang , he sat up and yawned stretching his arms and looking at it . " Hello ? " he quickly answered and was received by a crew member informing him that there was food out if he wanted any . He got up and set his script down before walking out , figured he 'd take a stroll around and maybe grab some fruit or something before getting ready . " Hey Chris , " Sebastian smiled , catching up to his co-star . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking her coffee from Olivia . Even though it was far too hot , she took a sip , effectively burning her tongue . It was a daily thing for her , so she was n't even surprised at this point . Before long they were at the studio and Katie was getting out of her friends car , coffee still in hand . " Okay , where we headed ? " Katie asked , looking around . There were trailers and buildings everywhere , Katie did n't have a damn clue where they were going.Chris turned his head in the direction of the voice who had spoke to him , a smile on his lips . " Hey Seb , how 's it going ? " Chris asked , giving Sebastian a clap on the shoulder . He was glad everyone who worked on the movie ended up being friends . It made things a lot easier . Just like they were in the movie , Chris and Sebastian had become the best of friends while filming the last one . They did n't really see each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to film this one , they fell right back into it . Chris pulled open the door to the canteen as they got there , letting Sebastian go in first before following suit . <p> Olivia shook her head , " do n't apologize it 's okay , " once she pulled out and parked , Olivia looked around at all the trailers . " Well , first we have to go to the main trailer , it 's huge because there 's so many changes of clothes and costumes and we go in there and get their costumes " she informed her . Olivia grabbed Katie 's arm pulling her into the direction they were headed , " here 's a pass with your name on it , see it says assistant to me , is n't that great ? " she giggled , putting her own pass on . " Do n't ever take it off , otherwise you get kicked out . " Sebastian smiled as he caught up to Chris , " oh not much , just reading the very few lines I do have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped though , what about you ? " Chris and Sebastian had become good friends from the first Captain America movie and they 've kept in contact . Being busy all the time they never really got to spend time together out side of the studio . Sebastian walked in and looked over at Chris , " how 's your mom doing by the way ? My mom is always asking about you , Chris this and that , she just loves you " he chuckled taking a plate and looking around at the food in front of them . <p> " Assistant to you , " Katie said in a falsely pained voice . She put the pass on , shaking her head . " What a life I live . " She really did n't mind being Olivia 's assistant . Katie much preferred being told what to do than telling people what to do , and Olivia was a good boss-type . She was always nice and did n't make Katie do crazy amounts of work . " Who 's costumes are we getting ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven hundred people today or ? " " Everyone loves me , " Chris said with a laugh , walking over to grab a plate so he could start piling food onto it . " That 's not just your mom . But no , mine 's good . Nothin ' too exciting going on there . She got a new car , so she 's excited about that . " Chris started to grab some food , just random bits of a lot of different things , and piled it onto his plate . He was probably taking a little more than he should , but he was getting pretty hungry . <p> sorry i have n't replied in a while . Went to a bachelorette party and had a long shift today <p> Olivia chuckled as they walked into the main trailer to get a rack of costumes , " I know it 's great ! It 's a Marvel movie so they have enough money to hire me an assitant I 'm so happy about that and it 's you so I wo n't have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistants she 's had were complete mess , they ogled the stars instead of working and it frustrated Olivia to no end . " They left me the list right here " she smiled and picked it up . " These are for all the agents , including Agent Sharon , Natasha , Fury , Maria and Steve himself " she grinned . " Then over here we have Bucky 's costumes , he 's got two or three and his accessories , we have to lube on his arm so .. I 'm guessing that 's what you want to help do ? " she asked teasingly.Sebastian grinned , " seems as of lately it 's mostly moms " he joked , piling food on his plate . " I suppose most moms are like that , well that 's good to hear , " he smiled and finished up grabbing some napkins and taking a bite out of a donuts he found . " Probably should n't be eating all of this but I 'll work it out later on set anyway " he laughed . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising her eyebrows . " That 's ... well . " Katie gave her head a small shake . She was glad she would never have to get her arm lubed , at least she could n't see it ever happening . She slowly started to walk through the trailer , her fingers trailing along the costumes as she walked along a rack . " This shit is so crazy . Would n't it be nice to have this kinda budget for your own wardrobe ? " " You look great , I 'm sure your donuts wo n't take too much of a toll on your abs , " Chris chuckled . " D' you want to go back to one of the trailers to eat , or do you wan na just sit here ? " Chris was n't really picky about where he ate , as long as he was sitting . He was n't the biggest fan of standing and eating breakfast foods . He had a tendency to spill scrambled eggs and they were much harder to clean when they were falling from five and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Olivia laughed and nodded , " yeah , script calls for it . Also , I 've read the Captain America comics so you know Bucky has a metal arm so they went all out , it 's pretty amazing " she nodded making sure all of the costumes were aligned and had all the accessories to go along with it . " I would love that very much , I love clothes " she chuckled.Sebastian chuckled , " Hopefully not , I 'm really into sweets it 's hard to stop eating once you start " he laughed . " I guess we can hit one of the trailers , I do n't particularly enjoy eating standing up , but whatever you want to do is fine " he finished by grabbing a couple of bottles of water and followed Chris . <p> " I know you do , " Katie said with a small chuckle . Katie put her coffee down onto a small table once she had walked back over to Olivia , putting her hands on her hips . " Okay , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have much time to dilly dally . A Marvel movie did n't really seem like the place to dilly dally.Chris nodded to Sebastian and headed back towards his trailer . He had n't locked it , so he opened up the door and headed in , leaving it open for Sebastian to follow him . Chris left his shoes on as he walked over to the little table and scooted into one of the benches , putting his food down onto the table and grabbing a plastic fork out of the bag of them he had permanently on the table . He did n't want to have to do dishes , so he just used disposable cutlery on the set . <p> Olivia tapped her foot as she looked at the costumes and grabbed the rack , " we can deliver Chris ' and Sebastian 's costumes , Steve has quite a few outfits picked out , for the film so here 's his , the main one he uses , followed by civilian clothing and the original Captain suit , so let 's take this to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can bring that one around and we 'll head for their trailers " she nodded smiling a bit.Sebastian followed Chris to his trailer and walked right on it setting the plate down in the table , " do you remember what scene they said they were doing first , they said I 'd be idle for a couple of hours , so I 'm guessing I wont ' be needed for awhile " he chuckled as he took a piece of donut and crammed it in his mouth . <p> Katie nodded , listening to what Olivia was saying . She did what she was told , grabbing the other rack . Once they were out of the trailer , holding onto the racks , Katie looked to Olivia again . " Lead the way , boss lady . " Katie felt a bit more dependent on Olivia than she really would have liked , but she knew it was because this was her first day . She would n't be bothering Olivia with a trillion questions a day once she knew what she was doing . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . " I 'm just waiting for the costume people to show up . " He had read his lines and he knew what they were filming that day , but he had no clue what order everything was going in . That was the trouble with movies . Nothing was filmed in chronological order . It made for a confusing day sometimes . <p> Olivia smiled at Katie as she pulled the racks out of the trailer and started moving them across the studio , " okay , Chris ' trailer is straight over there , let me drop this off without so much distraction " she chuckled " then we can move on to Sebastian and the big people basically then we can go from there " she nodded . The rack was full of all the outfits for the entire movie along with his shoes , accessories and everything , except the shield , they kept his shields separate for the obvious reasons . Once she was at the trailer , they could both clearly see the name ' Chris ' on the trailer door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , " relax " she said softly , though she was talking more to herself than her friend.Sebastian nodded , " well , I 'm sure I 'll have something to do before they need me , I do n't know why they called me in so early then , not a problem . I 'll hang out around the studio " he chuckled . Sebastian nodded , " oh that 's probably what it is , fitting make sure everything fits , getting my arm prepped , probably take a couple of hours . " He did n't quite understand the process of film making and why it could n't be shot in chronological order but I guess that would be easiest for them . Sebastian looked up when he heard the knock , " expecting company ? " <p> Chris looked over towards the door , giving his head a small shake when Sebastian asked if he was expecting company . " No , but it 's probably wardrobe or something . " Chris stood up and headed towards his trailer door , chewing the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look like a pig when he opened up the door . He opened it up slowly , making sure not to hit whoever was there , a smile on his face . " Good morning , ladies , " Chris said , looking form one to the other.Katie did n't reply to Olivia 's ' relax ' comment . She knew her friend was talking more to herself than to Katie . Katie was pretty okay , until Chris opened the door . She smiled and gave him a little wave when he said good morning , not opening her mouth because of the fear that she might end up squeaking . He was a lot better looking in person than he was in the movies , and Katie did n't really think that was possible . <p> Olivia cleared her throat trying not to say anything stupid , she was usually so calm and collected , she 's done some big celebrities wardrobe so she was n't sure why she was so nervous with Chris . " Good morning , brought you , your costumes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled softly . Pulling in the rack , she was trying not to crack under pressure these guys were really attractive and she could n't get herself distracted . She looked over and noticed Sebastian sitting and he waved , " hi there " he grinned . Olivia waved and set the rack somewhere it would n't get in the way . " Oh , we have yours too , we were just going to head down to your trailer " she smiled.Sebastian stood up and walked over shaking both Olivia 's and Katie 's hands , " it 's nice meeting you ladies , and I 'll probably have to go unlock it then , since I 've left my personal belongings in there " he chuckled . He looked at Chris and grinned , " well , guess I better try these on then , I 'll see you on set eventually " he chuckled and walked out the door smiling at Katie . " It 's this way , " he turned to look at Katie and smiled politely .

@@23757644 @3757644/ <h> Literary Devices : Foreshadowing <p> Foreshadowing is a literary element in which the author provides the reader with subtle hints about events to come later on in the story . Foreshadowing is one component of developing suspense , and keeps a readers interest during plot development . Several methods can be utilized to foreshadow in a story . <h> Indirect Foreshadowing <p> One method of foreshadowing involves using indirect clues to the reader that indicate changes to come . Subtle clues can include changes in the weather , mood , and uncertain reactions of characters . For example : <p> " Implacable November weather . As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth , and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus , forty feet long or so , waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill . Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots , making a soft black drizzle , with , flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes . " <p> Bleak House by Charles Dickens <p> In this opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a particular mood for his readers , which foreshadows unfortunate events to come . Beginning with nice weather would prepare the reader for a very different story . <p> What makes indirect foreshadowing so effective is the elusiveness . Readers prefer to be shown clues , rather than told . A detailed passage laced with imagery like the one above is more interesting than a blatant summary of events to come . You can achieve similar results in your story by consciously thinking about the main events and conflicts of your story , and planning out ways to provide your readers with hints relating to those events . <h> Parallel Events <p> Another method of foreshadowing involves introducing an event early on that parallels an important event to come later in the story . For example : <p> " Lennie looked sadly up at him . " They was so little , " he said apologetically . " I 'd pet em , and pretty soon they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little and then they was deadbecause they was so little . I wisht wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  so little . " <p> Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck <p> In this passage , Steinbeck uses the death of the mouse to foreshadow and hint to readers about deaths that occur later in the story . Once again , the reference is not explicitly stated , but gives readers a sense of things to come and motivates the reader to continue further into the story . The effectiveness lies in the elusiveness . You can achieve similar results in your stories by thinking about your stories main events , and then thinking of ways you can mimic those events on a smaller scale . <h> Chekhovs Gun <p> Chekhovs Gun is a particular type of foreshadowing , where something seemingly insignificant is introduced early on in the story that becomes essential by the storys end . This techniques name comes from playwright Anton Chekhov , who once said that you can not hang a rifle on a wall in chapter one if you do not intend for it to go off later on in the story . <p> The key to achieving this technique is balancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chehovs Gun is to surprise readers , without plot holes . In order to do this , your " gun " - whether it be a weapon or other item , a low key character or particular place- has to be explained to the reader with a fair amount of detail so that it is memorable by the end of the story . Additionally , you want narrative time to pass between the time you introduce the item , and the time it becomes significant . Your reader must " forget " about the gun in order for the ending to be a surprise . By introducing your gun early on in the story , you will allow plenty of narrative time to pass so that the reader is n't focused on the item . <h> Red Herring <p> A Red Herring is a type of foreshadowing most commonly used in mysteries that intentionally misleads readers . Where other types of foreshadowing preview events to come , red herrings send readers down false trails and build suspense as the real conclusion is reached . <p> To use a red herring effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have these essential parts : <p> Logic While your " clue " to the reader will be false , it still has to make sense in the context of the story so the reader will believe it . <p> An Alibi By nature , a red herring is false , and eventually your reader has to understand why . For example , if your entire story is centered around pinning a murder on a red herring character , at some point the reader has to see why that character is innocent , or your story will have a plot hole . <p> An Alternative When writing a red herring , its important to have the truth in mind , so your alternative seems viable and makes sense in the context of the story . <p> There are several ways to create a red herring , using different parts of a story . <h> Characters <p> A character is the most frequent type of red herring . When used in the context of a mystery , providing characters with motives is often the way to shape them into a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committing a crime , your reader will be engaged and interested to find out the truth . Aside from motive , placing characters in incriminating situations or providing them with opportunities can also create red herrings . <h> Objects <p> Objects can be used as red herrings in almost any type of story . When writing a scene , consider the relevance of each item you describe in the setting , and imagine the ways in which your reader will interpret them . Equally as important , think of objects you could intentionally exclude the reader may expect to build interest . Instead of finding a knife at a crime scene , you may describe cuts on a wooden table , leading your reader to anticipate a particular item to appear later that may be erroneous .

We know our economy is bad . We know our State is failing . Californians are n't idiots despite the fact a lot of people seem to think we are . But with as bad as we are , our economy is not as bad as Greece 's yet . <p> This is n't the first time Romney has belittled and insulted Californians either . He insults us a lot . A lot of Republicans insult us a lot . Romney seems to have the mentality of " if they wo n't vote for me , then fuck them " . He seems to have the mentality that , as a presidential candidate , it 's okay for him to insult those who do n't agree with and bow to him . Romney would make a awesome president , would n't he ? If you could n't tell , I am not a supporter of Romney and am hoping with all my heart he does not win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Christian male .... Romney will not benefit you . <p> Romney made a few mistakes here . Let 's go over them . First mistake : he insulted California , a State that generally has very proud citizens . Over the years , California has been the butt-end of a lot of people 's jokes and we 've become very proud people in response to those jokes . Californians do n't respond very well when someone- especially a politician - decides they 're going to talk smack about us . Romney , it is in your best interest not to come back to California because you most likely will not get a warm welcome after all the times you 've belittled us . <p> Second mistake : he also insulted Greece . Romney probably does n't care he insulted Californians , he probably does n't like us anyway even though he did just buy a mansion in La Jolla . Yeah , Romney can insult California but apparently loves us enough to buy a mansion here . Romney also insulted Greece . Greece 's financial crisis and California 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle Greece is going through right now and that is an insult to the Greek people . Nicely done , Romney . Your joke insulted an entire State and an entire country . Romney is on a roll with insulting Europeans . He also told the British they were incapable of successfully holding the Olympics ( guess they proved him wrong ) and his spokesperson told reporters in Poland to " kiss his ass " . If Romney wanted Europeans to get a bad view of Americans , then his trip to Europe was successful . Oh and let 's not forget what Romney did in Israel and the way he insulted the Palestinian people . <p> Third mistake : he made a joke at the expense of a group of people he would be taking control of if he gets presidency . Californians and people in other " blue " States , I suggest you brace for impact if Romney gets presidency because he will be hitting you hard . It would be nice to see the GOP getting a sense of humor .... If only they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP jokes , it always seems to be to insult a group of people they do n't agree with . The point is , it 's not appropriate for a presidential candidate to make a joke where he belittles people that may become his citizens . I cringe at the thought . I do n't want to be considered on of Romney 's citizens . Romney being president scares me . <p> Now mistakes aside , let me go over why Romney just made himself look even more ignorant . For starters , the governor who started our economic decline was a Republican . Contrary to what a lot of people know apparently , Arnold Schwarzenegger was not a Democrat . He was a Republican . I 've noticed a lot of people seem to assume he 's a Democrat but he really was n't . Our current Governor Jerry Brown is a Democrat though . So while the Democrats have helped our decline , it was started by the Republicans technically . So ... Ca n't blame the Democrats and liberals for our economy fully when this decline was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not allowed to keep very much money . For every one dollar we send to the federal government , we are only allowed to keep .79cents . Meanwhile , " red " States like Mississippi that Romney will probably win get about double back from the government than California does . If this was distributed equally , California 's economy would be a lot better because we 'd be getting more from the government . But most of our money is taken from us . We help keep the red States afloat but financially supporting them . Of course , Romney is just ignoring the fact his States are financially supported by us . Or maybe Romney truly does n't know that and , if that 's the case , that 's certainly not a good thing a potential president does n't know that . If you hate us so much then fine , but stop taking our money . Californian 's would gladly stop giving your State 's money and use it to benefit our own State . We subsidize the majority of State 's Romney will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because every time you open your mouth , you proceed to insert your foot . So just keep talking .

So , here , I shall present you with a few steps to prepare yourself for the month of writing . <h> Step One : <p> Make yourself a calendar and set a goal . Although NaNoWriMo is all about getting 50,000 words written , some people participating raise the bar for the months . In November I did the intial 50,000 words as my goal , but I also made a callendar for what my total word count will need to be for that day . <p> To win NaNoWriMo , all you need to do is write 1,667 words every day , but I decided to put in 1,852 words per day to finish earlier and actually finish editing my 1st draft . This method helps in more way than one . <h> ( Optional ) Step Two : <p> Tell your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your noveling , right ? Tell everyone you know that you may or may not be able to speak with them not because you 're going to be a social recluse , but because you need every minute of everyday to write . Tell everyone this . Even that homeless guy down the street . I wait . . . . . done ? Okay . <h> Step Three : <p> Figure out what you 'll be writing . In order to write a book , you absolutely need to know what you 'll be writing about . If you have n't , try brainstorming for an hour . Think of your most favorite writings and then think of what you 've been wanting to write about for a really long time . I have 2 ideas for Camp NaNo in April so far , and that 's more than what I need to write . Now if only I could choose ... <h> ( Optional ) Step Four : <p> Stalk up on coffee and sweets . Just walk to the store and buy both of these items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 cups of coffee a day . I even have a ( very faint ) scar on my hand from when I burnt myself making coffee . During NaNoWriMo , if you 're an average-speed typer and thinker , then you 'll spend more time at your computer writing than doing other stuff , and you 'll be spending a lot more if you procrastinate like me . <h> ( Optional ) Step Five : <p> If you 're like me and you have no friends who are willing to spend ( waste ? ) one monthof their lives writing a novel , then I 'd highly advise you to watch someone 's daily NaNoVlogs on YouTube , or read someone 's Daily NaNoBlogs on a blogging site such as wordpress or blogger . <p> ( I will be doing daily blogs on my blog here , and katytastic will be vlogging on YouTube sometimes throughout the month ) .

I was hoping to avoid him until the store closed but if he is always seeking me out clearly that is not going to happen . I do n't want to say it is harassment because I have not told him he is bothering me . I mean it did n't bother me much until the meeting after the one outside when he found out i never had a boyfriend . <p> But yeah ugh ! But I am proud of myself for actually doing some work today . My department is n't completely clean but it does look better . <p> My manager also wanted me to straighten up the party section and that is hell all by itself . UGH ! <p> They should condemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's schedule and I am not thrilled . I signed up to work every day eight to eight . I do n't know if they forgot , or when the closing news came about the original hire agreement went out the window , but these dumbasses have me on Sunday for five forty five in the morning to ten forty five . And yeah it is only four hours . But I told them eight is the earliest I am coming in and leaving period ! <p> But at this point I am not running behind them with this stupid mess .

@@23757654 @3757654/ <p> ( excuse any spelling errors atm , I 'm just eh lazy to fix my errors atm ) So i 'm playing a visual novel ( aka an anime dating simulation or otome game " though all three game genres/types are slightly different but I ca n't remember which is which atm ) where you play a girl who used to be considered a beauty queen of sorts ( and was popular with the guys ) at her high school until she just one day became overweight and to make matters slightly worse , five hot guys move in which prompts forces makes her to do everything she can to lose weight . Now let that sink in for a little bit . *dramatic momentary pause* ( LOL ) . <p> So we all know that us girls/women have society telling us to be this ideal weight and shit just to fit the idea of society 's perfect girl/woman and it 's constantly crammed down our throats whether it 's the media or on occasions our families . Well , I do n't what this game , Girlish Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do because the storyline is just so strange . Idk whether Japanese women have to fit the same ideal image of a woman like we do here in the west but this game , idk what to make of it . The mechanics are nice , I guess because you are playing a girl who 's trying to lose weight and be healthy . So that portion is relatable for the most part but her motivation for doing all this hard work to get into shape and lose weight is just to impress five guys that move into her family 's apartment building . Yeah what does that tell you , Mibba ? <p> Lose weight only for love , only for five hot guys to like you ! Now I know I might be reading too much into the storyline considering I 've only played the game for a few minutes , I 'm playing a fan translation of the game , and the story could be extremely different . Like maybe the girl 's family hires those five hot dudes to be the girl 's gym trainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or all of them . Idk ! I 've read mangas and seen animes where female characters were considered ugly and went out of their way to become pretty for various reasons but those were animes and mangas ( Japanese cartoons and comics ) not a video game . In anime and manga , you 're reading/watching a story unfold and witnessing stuff happening to the characters but in a visual novel/otome/dating simulation game or any video game , you are placed in the role of a character and you control that character and their outcome . Of course , visual novels and otome games give you more control over what happens to the main character whereas most regular video games ( like final fantasy or Zelda ) have a set story line where things are already predetermined , leaving very little for the player to control . <p> So yeah I do n't know how to feel about the Girlish Love Revoluton but we 'll find out when I get an ending.Well see ya guys later ! -Hinaz

Though part of me wonders if that 's really what she 's getting at . <p> There 's this theme throughout feminism of abandoning perceived feminine weaknesses . Mary Wollenstencraft , in her infamous " Vindication on the Rights of Women , " preaches intellect and its power ( considering most women in this time were not educated in the same subjects as men ) . However , as she persuades women to develop a strength of the mind and the body , she also views " soft phrases , susceptibility of the heart , and refinement of taste " as being synonymous with " epithets of weakness . " This mirrors the stereotypical mindset of third wave feminism to defy tradition as you will , but those who do n't are weak/anti-feminist and have somehow failed to reach their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality to a point of burning bras , chopping hair , and essentially reinforcing the idea that femininity is somehow not good enough . Frankly , this historical motif is ridiculous . The inherent strength of all women is easily seen through centuries of what Howard Zinn called ' intimate oppression ' ( I prefer intimate slavery ) , from the women who suffered through it in silence to those who challenged the traditional gender roles of their time . Looking through historical record , one thing is clear : feminism is not a 19th century invention ! Women have an incredibly inherent strength inside of them , lying in wait until it is needed . <p> All women should take a leaf from French feminist philosopher , Simone de Beauvoir . In her 1949 book , The Second Sex , by breaking down and analyzing the detailed history of feminine oppression , she introduces a brand of feminism inundated with some good old existentialist philosophy . Womanhood can only be defined by the individual woman -- it means nothing special to be a woman until we , as individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One aspect I 'm particularly fond of is her focus on women as ' the Other . ' Unlike those before and even after her , de Beauvoir chastises women for considering perceived feminine traits or femininity itself as somehow weak or lacking . Sure , women and men are two categories for a reason , but there is nothing ' different ' ( she says different implies somehow abnormal ) about being a woman . Everything about femininity is natural . In striving to emulate maleness as a substitute for normalcy , we betray ourselves . <p> Feminism in 21st century society , above all , should be an emphasis on choice . In bringing a unique and personal meaning to feminism means recognizing others ' right to do the exact same thing . Every woman , not just in America or civilized countries , should be able to harness this special gift and create a positive meaning of their own womanhood . Sadly , there are women around the world who are stuck in a society which does n't value them and leaves them no choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in foreign countries and even here at home . There is not enough space anywhere for all the words in my heart about feminism in general . All women should think of themselves as feminists , and all women should respect the choices of their peers in how they live their lives . <p> Me ? To be honest , I 'm not completely sure how it is I want to live my life . I do know for sure that regardless of where I am , what I 'm doing , or who I become , I will always champion not only the rights of women where I live , but also around the world . Some have criticized me in my pursuit , and some have praised me , but no words will ever sway me from my fierce determination to see that all women have a voice .

@@23757664 @3757664/ <p> So let 's talk some about Occupy , this seems like a good subject for my first blog . Around two days ago , the Oakland City Council had another one of their meetings and at this particular meeting , they were discussing a new protest law . So naturally , Occupiers showed up to the meeting to make their opinions on the new law known . The proposed law states that anything considered a ' shield ' or ' weapon ' would no longer be allowed at protests , the punishment for bringing such items can be as severe as six months in jail . <p> I am opposed to this law and I 'm happy it was not passed . The City Council adjourned their meeting before they voted on this law because apparently the Occupiers were being too loud in the chambers and City Council did n't appreciate it . Oops . Whether or not this law will come back for another vote , I do n't know . But I hope it does n't . This law , in my opinion , is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this law , pretty much anything could be considered a ' shield ' or a ' weapon ' , it leaves it up to OPD to decide what would be and would n't be considered as such . And knowing how OPD is , that is a bad idea to let them decide that . Knowing OPD , they would use this law to target people and arrest them for no reason other than they 're known Occupiers . OPD sort of hates Occupy just so you know . OPD hates anyone who does n't bow to their authority really . The idea of banning shields at all , especially with a violent police force like OPD , is a horrible idea . It has bad idea written all over it , there 's nothing good about this . <p> Shields are something that have become quite common at Occupy Oakland 's protest . They 're at almost every protest anymore . Occupy Oakland 's shields are all hand-made and usually carried by the Black Bloc . The most common types of shields at our protests are small black ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace sign on them . Here 's a picture of the smaller shields from May Day : <p> During large actions like May Day where hundreds or even thousands of people are expected to come out , some people will also bring large metal shields to better protect the protest . Here 's an example of those shields , this picture being taken on January 28 as OPD was tear gassing the protest : <p> I wonder if the image code still works on blogs ... Guess we 'll see . Moving on ... <p> As far as I know , Occupy Oakland is the only occupation to regularly use shields at protests . I think we may be the only occupation to ever use shields . Occupy Oakland is the most radical occupation , it also seems to be the most controversial one . Some Occupiers stand by us and support us , others have denounced us for being too radical and ' violent ' . The majority of Occupiers from across the world though seem to be standing by Oakland 's side through all of this , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occupy Oakland is a bit of a rough occupation , but do n't give up on us just yet . <p> Occupy Oakland does not bring shields to provoke the police nor do we do it to look for a fight . The shields are brought in an act of defense , they are used as defense and nothing more . Occupy Oakland has been attacked by the OPD numerous times . Both large and small protests have been attacked for little to no reason it often seems like . I 've been attacked by OPD a number of times myself . We have been attacked so often that we now come to protests anticipating police violence , these shields are a part of that anticipation . Shields are brought simply as a means of defense , we will not allow the police to just attack us without having a way to defend ourselves . On that note , not all Occupiers carry shields , it 's actually only a few people . I 'm not a shield-holder , I do n't think I could ever manage to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad idea , it will only bring more violence and trouble . It 'll solve nothing . For one , we wo n't stop bringing shields . Even if they are made illegal , many people will continue to bring them to protests regardless of what the law says . Many Occupiers in Oakland are not exactly good at following the law , just saying . Secondly , it may bring upon violence from the Black Bloc . Think of the Black Bloc as security for protests , they do their best to protect other protesters from the police . Here 's the thing with the Oakland Black Bloc ... If they can not defend protesters using non-offensive tactics like shields , they will use offensive tactics and resort to attacking the police . As a well respected Occupier said , if they take our shields , all we have left is the Second Amendment to defend ourselves with . The Second Amendment being the one that says we as citizens have the right to bear arms . Now I do n't agree with that at all at the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will turn to it because some most certainly will in time . <p> Oakland is a ticking time bomb really . Many of the Occupiers in this city will only take so many beatings from the police before they begin to fight back . Taking our shields may set certain protesters off into actually attempting harm to the police . So far , Occupy Oakland has not actually attempt to specifically arm any officers . Oakland is largely known as a " rebel city " , people in that city are n't afraid to stand up for themselves using force . It is actually amazing Occupy Oakland has n't used force yet after all the times we 've been attacked , Occupy Oakland has kept themselves under control very well for the most part . Honestly , there 's a good chance that if a rebellion is going to happen in the U.S , that rebellion is going to start with Oakland when protesters are finally pushed over the edge . OPD does seem to be wanting violence from protesters , they want us to give them a reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence so we 'll give them a reason to use lethal force . And no , that 's not me being " overly paranoid " . Did you know at May Day in Oakland , some of OPD were carrying assault rifles with live ammunition in them ? OPD could have killed someone on May Day if they had been given the reason to . OPD has almost killed two people , both of them have thankfully survived and are still fighting alongside Occupy . However , neither of those people were attacked on May Day . The first one was attacked on October 25 , Scott Olsen suffered a skull fracture after having been hit in the head with a rubber bullet . The second near-death happened two months after the January 28 protest . OPD beat a cancer patient on January 28 and two months later , she is was in the hospital fighting for her life because of it . <p> Anyway , the point is that Occupy Oakland does not have malicious intent behind our shields , all we have is good intent . All we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seem to want to hurt us . And that 's not an over exaggeration either . I have stood there , face to face with OPD many times before they 've attacked . Even while hiding behind their riot helmets , you can see their faces . Their expressions and emotions . Many of them want to hurt us , I have seen it in the faces of some of those officers before they 've attacked . When OPD attacks us , they are out for blood . They are out to hurt as many people as they can . They are dangerous and murderous . Do n't try to tell me I 'm being " paranoid " about it , I know I 'm not and if you stood out there too , you 'd know that as well . <p> All I can say is I hope City Council will never pass a law like this . This law asks for nothing but trouble . Now watch this video as a well respected Occupier rips City Council apart for even considering this law . Jessica spoke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of us here at Occupy Oakland are feeling because of the police . There is so much repressed pain and anger at Occupy Oakland because of the hell the police have put us through on a constant basis . Her speech is powerful .

Just watch this movie and discover the charms of this adorable beautiful movie . <p> Aishiteruze BabyIt 's been awhile since I 've watched this anime series but this one was equally adorable and sad , but it was more happy than it was sad . Still , Aishiteruze Baby is about fifteen/sixteen year old Kippei finding himself taking of his five year old cousin , Yuzuyu after her mother abandons her . this anime is a bit shrot at about 26 episodes but they 're 26 wonderful episodes .

@@23757678 @3757678/ <h> Featured : 10 Evil Creatures from Mythology <p> Legends and myths have fascinated humans since the dawn of time . They tell us the story of how the world and our culture came to be . They teach us lessons or warn us from the creatures they speak of . The creatures from these legends or myths can be separated into two categories : good and bad . The 10 Ways ... column is focusing on one category , though : on the evil creatures of the world . They come from the depths of hell or the pits of the underworld . They curse humans for fun and are omens of death . They are the Slendermans and Bloody Mary of the past , but some of them are still believed to haunt people today . <h> 1 . Aswang <p> The Aswang is a mythical creature from Filipino folklore . The term " Aswang " is used as a generic term for most mythical creatures , like witches , vampires , and monsters . The Aswang is a shape-shifter and an evil vampire-like creature . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans into terrifying monsters who eat unborn fetuses and small childrens livers and hearts . So be warned ! You never know - there might be an Aswang near you ! <h> 2 . Adlet <p> The Adlet is the Werewolf of the Inuit . They resemble the Werewolf in shape , form and behavior . It stands between six and eight feet tall and has human-like features such as hands , only with long and sharp claws . They can be found in some regions of Quebec , Labrador and some lands to the north . They are merciless killers who hunt in packs and stalk their prey . They paralyze their prey with fear , making them easier to hunt . The preys death is slow , agonizing and extremely painful ; the Adlet crushes its prey into an unrecognized pulp and then eats the guts and blood that spill out from the body . Though their intellect is of some lower primates ' , they are somewhat smarter than wolves and are capable of using some tools . The Adlet is omnivorous ; they only eat vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat - especially human flesh and blood , according to legend . Like werewolves , they heal fast and they can only be injured or killed by fire or silver . <h> 3 . Duende <p> A Duende is a fairy , goblin-like creature that comes from Iberian , Latin and Filipino folklore . There are different terms for these creatures ; the French call them lutin , the Irish call them leprechaun or far darrig , and the Swedish call them tomte . This word is the equivalent of the English word sprite and the Japanese word yokai . It is believed that they are of small stature and wear big hats . While some cultures say that the duende is mischievous and often bad , some say that they are of good nature because they help lost people find their way home . Either way , be careful not to cross them because they can use their talents to take your toes off or to cast a curse upon you . <h> 4 . Doppelganger <p> According to the dictionary , doppelganger means alter ego or a ghostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word means " double walker . " Doppelgangers are paranormal counterparts of people often representing evil or misfortune . They are perceived as a sinister form of bilocation ( when an individual or object is in two places at the same time ) and often bring bad luck . In some cultures , a doppelganger is an omen of death . <h> 5 . Kikiyaon <p> The Kikiyaon is a mythical creature that hails from Africa .

It is a deadly opponent that is capable of swooping down on its prey and surpasses or outruns humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the spirit and physical realm easily . But they are feared in both realms though there is more chance of escape in the latter realm . <h> 6 . Banshee <p> Also called as Banshi or Benshee ( in Scottish and Irish mythology ) . They are female spirits and are usually seen as an omen of death or a messenger from the Otherworld . According to legend , banshees wail if someone is about to die . The banshees can either appear as an ugly hag or a stunning woman of any age . Although they are not usually seen , they wail usually at night . They are also described as wearing white or grey with pale silver hair . <h> 7 . Tikbalang <p> The Tikbalang is a creature from Philippine mythology . It is a half-human , half-animal ( most common is a horse ) creature that is said to lurk in the mountains and forests . They scare travelers and lead them astray .

In some provinces , they believe that they can turn themselves invisible or turn into human form . Tikbalangs are usually associated with the dark , sparsely populated and dense forests .

Jinn <p> The jinn are genies of Islamic mythology . They are spirits mentioned in the Koran ( Quron or the central religious text of Islam ) . Moreover , the Jinn was also featured in Supernatural ( its Djinn in Supernatural ) .

To protect oneself from the Jinn , an amulet or talisman known as tawiz must be worn . Other methods of avoiding trouble with the Jinn are leaving them food and charcoal to keep them satisfied and happy and sprinkling salt on the floor to avoid attacks from the Jinn when you sleep . <h> 9 . Harpy <p> A harpy is a creature from Greek mythology . A harpy was one of the winged spirits who constantly stole from Phineus , the king of Thrace and the seer who appeared on the accounts of the Argonauts voyage . The literal meaning of harpy is that which snatches as it comes from the ancient Greek word harpazein , which meant to snatch. They are agents of torture for the souls going down to Tartarus . Moreover , the harpy is the mother of the horses which Achilles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beautiful women with wings but , due to confusion with Sirens , harpies were described as ugly . <h> 10 .

Fenrir is the son of Loki and is foretold to kill Odin during Ragnarok but will be killed by Odins son Vioarr . J.R.R Tolkien used the warg and portrayed it as an evil creature . They are ridden by orcs in the Lord of the Rings trilogy whereas in the Hobbit , dwarves and goblins worked with the wargs . Just like Tolkiens portrayal of the warg , the Germans also saw them as creatures of evil .

However , I 've heard that whenever you receive tarot cards , you 're supposed to tap each card three times to cancel out anyone 's energy who may have handled the cards . My friend from work than claimed that I must sleep with my cards before I do a reading , funny right ? I thought the same thing you 're probably thinking right now . Anyway , I was like okay whatever . I guess my energy would be transferred completely through my bed ? I forgot why she said to do so . <p> I had bought an Earth deck ; which I 'm not too fond of . But , I also bought an Energy deck ; which I absolutely adore . The Energy deck is actually Oracle cards , they 're supposed to revel both present energy I can project and the results I 'd get . <p> Before work this morning , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just tried to connect with my inner spiritual side . I shuffled my cards in a random order , I then picked four cards at random throughout the deck and then looked at my handy dandy book that came with the cards to decipher what my conscious mind was trying to tell me . <p> My first card was a picture of a tornado , it was dark and eery . The word read Storm Warning . As I began reading , it was made clear to me that a certain difficulty was heading my way . I pondered what that could mean and then it hit me . I 'm moving to a whole different state in a few months and my boy friend is staying while I go . I 've been with him for three years now and we were going to try the long distance thing . Unfortunately he had been talking about wanting to propose to me before I go . I said no do n't , I know . I probably won worst girl friend of the year award . He heard me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I have a slight underlying feeling he 'll still try . This card basically stands to say that I need to stand up for myself and take my own action on my behalf . It quotes " As with all difficulty , even the worst storm passes . Always remember you have the power and wisdom to handle whatever may come your way . " I know I can handle this situation , I 'm just afraid too . <p> Second card was an open door with a heart hovering in the middle , the word read Door to Romance . Before I even read what it meant , I instantly was reminded of a conversation I had with my best friend about the whole move . I was scared that being away from my current boy friend would make me lonely . Not that I would ever cheat on him , I love him way too damn much . But , I was scared that I could possibly find someone who would just give me the time of day . With that in my mind , I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be in my near future although it always said that it could be a new experience within a current relationship . Which I understood . My boy friend and I are completely two different people . I 'm the type of girl who hates PDA , is n't a fan of cuddling and snuggling . I 'm very independent in a relationship , I 'm not a lovey dovey kind of girl . My boy friend however is . He 's absolutely touchy feely with everything . Since my move is getting closer , he 's somehow gotten worse . I had told my mom and my best friend that he 's absolutely suffocating me with his love . No matter how many times I tell him , he just wo n't back away . I have concluded that I need this move . I need to be able to realize that I miss his constant nagging of wanting to hold my hand and showers of kisses . I think this card is saying that my heart will be opening to a new experience . I 've never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cuddles and kisses . So , maybe this move , I 'll realize how much I adore his constant shower of love . <p> Third card was a man who seemingly enough reminded me of Jesus . It read Healer of Ages . As I 'm reading the words , " This amazing entity is with you now , bringing resolution to physical , mental , and emotional ills , helping to unblock stuck energy and revitalize your life force . " I 've been feeling like a complete asshole ever since I had told my boy friend no to being engaged . Everyone had me feel guilty and an outright bitch . I 'm nineteen . I 'm so young , so naive , so not ready to have that title hanging over my head . I 've had problems with commitment in the past and even though I 've been with him for three years now , being engaged really solidifies that I 'm not to say stuck , but ultimately . I love him , do n't get me wrong . I 'm just not big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've come to terms to how I feel about it all . I finally felt okay with it , it 's my choice . It 's my life . Why should I feel guilty about it ? So I think this card just meant that this entity helped me reestablished my inner feelings about it all . <p> Fourth and last card was a picture of a man hovering in mid air , mediating , it read Rest and Rejuvenation . All it basically said was to relax , and let things go . I think this was linked to the third card . Just re-confirming that because I 've accepted the whole no engagement , I need to let it melt away and just enjoy the rest of the time I have with him . <p> It blows my mind how all of these cards are linked in some sort of another but that 's it words too . I 'm still learning how to give readings and everything but maybe you all who are interested can help me . Send me a message explaining a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I 'll be reading . Drawing from the things you tell me about yourself , I can convert that into giving a reading . I 'll explain what each card is and what it means and than from then on you can pin point if it has anything to deal with a situation in your life .

@@23757704 @3757704/ <h> How to Play Dutch Blitz <p> Dutch Blitz is a card game played with three or more people . The idea of the game is to get rid of all of your cards on your blitz pile by making stacks of cards by suit , ace through ten . The game is best played in a circle or around a table . You have to be close enough to the other players to reach the piles of cards in the playing area . <p> Each player starts with a deck of regular playing cards . Remove the Joker and face cards . Keep the aces . <p> Shuffle your deck . <p> Lay three cards face-up in front of you . Make a forth pile of ten cards face down . This stack is known as your blitz pile . Flip the tenth card so it is face-up . You should now have four different cards face-up . <p> If any of the four face-up cards are aces , put them out in front of you so everyone can reach . This immediately starts the game . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle , everyone in the game can play on the ace with their three face-up cards and the blitz pile in front of them .

Decks of cards will be mixed up during the game . Several stacks of cards can be played on at the same time . You always put your aces in the middle to be played on . <p> Every time you use one of you face-up cards , place the first card from your blitz pile in its spot .

If you use all three or simply can not use the third one , flip another three on top . <p> When you get to the end of your cards , flip the deck over and repeat the process . Keep in mind that you win the round by using your blitz pile and having three face-up cards . <p> Once one of the players has only their three face up cards left , the round is over .

This will shuffle the entire playing deck by one card . Continue the game . This can be done as often as necessary .

It was hard not having the baby 's father around , and she would 've given anything to have Dean around , but she was n't sure that was possible . She could 've figured it out probably if she 'd asked his brother Sam , but honestly , she did n't know if Sam would 've given her a straight answer . Plus with all the shit they deal with she was n't sure she could handle whatever answer he would 've given her . And honestly , she felt it was probably best to raise her child away from the world they lived in ; or she at least hoped it would be away from the terrifying world the brothers lived in . Because Riley was n't sure what she 'd do or how she 'd be able to keep going if something happened to her baby.Sam walked into the house he 'd been living in for the last year wishing still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean back . He knew it was n't exactly something that was done every day , so actually finding an answer was hard and he did n't feel like he 'd gotten any closer to figuring it out than when he started . He did have to admit though that he was glad he had Dana in his life . Because she had been very helpful in keeping him sane over the last year . It was just hard losing Dean and then finding out Dean 's girlfriend was expecting a baby . Even harder when he tried everything he could to keep in touch with Riley and help her out in any way he could but she would n't let him . Because she just kept distancing herself more . And all he could do now was hope that Dean would find a way back , and that Riley and the baby were okay . <p> Dean let out a breath as he looked around . Where the hell was he ? And when the hell was he ? He was finally out of purgatory . He knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know , however , was how long it had been since he 'd been back on the face of the earth . Spotting a gas station near by , he rushed over , eager to figure out when he was , where he was and then , finally , figure out where the hell his brother was . <p> It did n't take him too long to figure out he had been in Purgatory for a whole year . His mind went to Riley and Sam almost instantly . Where the hell was Riley ? Was she safe ? Where was Sammy ? And why did n't he try to get Dean back from Purgatory ? Dana had heard Sam come in . She stood at the kitchen counter , a smile on her face as she sipped on her fifth cup of coffee for the day . " You 're back early .

She was n't even really sure how she was still going after everything . But she was , and she knew that she 'd made it this far so she could n't just give up . Because well she had a baby to take care of , she had to take care of herself , and she did n't have time to lay around crying over Dean or Sam for that matter . Knowing that did n't make it easier though . Honestly , not knowing where Sam was , how he was , or if maybe they should 've stuck together made it harder . Just like not knowing if she 'd ever see Dean again , if he was okay and just stuck somewhere with the chance to getting back to her and Sam , or if he actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her actually made it harder to go on . But she did.Sam sighed and took the beer from his girlfriends hand . " Yes and no , " he told her running his fingers through his hair . " Have you ever been in such a bad place that you did something kind of stupid that had you been in your right mind you never would 've done ? And then once you finally get your life back together you realize you made a huge mistake and then you want to fix it . But do n't know how ? " He asked her knowing it was a pretty vague question , and that probably everyone had been in the same position as him at least once . Well , maybe not the exact same , but most people had done things they regretted . Sam just felt like he was being eaten alive right now because he just wanted to make things right with Riley , now that he realized he needed to . <p> It did n't take him long to locate a phone booth . Dean had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to do was dial a number and see where that went . He knew all of Sam 's numbers , of course . Riley , on the other hand , he was unsure of . He had been gone a year . A lot could happen in a year . Unsure of whether she would still have the same number that she did a year ago , Dean decided to try Sam . It took him a few numbers before he reached a phone that did n't go to voice mail straight away . Holding his breath , Dean clutched onto the phone , hoping and praying that Sam would answer his call.Dana let out a soft breath as she leaned forward to press a kiss to Sam 's cheek . " Still worrying about Riley ? " She knew about Riley , of course . Sam 's brother 's girl . After Dean went missing , Riley had pushed Sam away and she knew Sam hated that he could n't be there for her . " She 's a big girl , babe . And she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back in touch with her . There 's only so much you can do , you know .

One of which was taking him in for a check up to make sure he was okay , and that the ear infection he 'd just recently gotten over was actually gone and they did n't need to do anything else . And she hoped it was because Westly not feeling well and had been the worst . She also needed to stop by the gas station to fill up her tank otherwise they were n't getting anywhere for the day . So once they were in the car she headed for the gas station first just to play it safe . " I know , " Sam replied softly before raising an eyebrow and reaching for his phone when he heard it going off . It was a little shocking really because it did n't ring much these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something while he was out but she was right in front of him so he knew it was n't her and the number was unfamiliar so he knew it was n't Riley either . He did n't think it would be another hunter because he had n't exactly gotten one of those calls in a while . Either way , he answered not exactly sure what or who to expect on the other end . " Hello , " <p> Hearing Sam 's voice as exactly the thing that Dean had needed . " Sammy ? " He knew how it sounded . It sounded like some demon was trying to play a trick on Sam . But , Dean hoped , Sam would at the very least agree to meet him and douse him in holy water or whatever else it was that he needed to do to make sure that Dean was Dean . " I 'm back , Sammy . And I do n't know where I am but I need to know where you are and where Riley is . " Dana cocked her brow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone went off . It was unusual for anyone to call him , sure . But that did n't mean he did n't get any calls at all . Bobby called once a while . All she knew about him was that he was a father-like figure for the Winchester brothers while they were growing up , since their dad was n't around much to take care of them . <p> Sam almost dropped the phone because he was so shocked to hear the voice on the other end . " D- Dean ? " He said swallowing back when he knew was tears . Now Sam did n't cry very often but hearing his brother 's voice for the first time in a year when he had convinced himself he 'd never hear it again was enough to do it . " What ? " Sam finally asked once he 'd did all that he could to pull himself together and then , of course , comprehend what Dean had asked him . " Well if you describe what 's around you maybe I can figure out where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said biting his lip before he went on . " As far as Riley goes though um I do n't know where she is , " he said knowing it was best to just be straight with Dean now than later.Riley had a pretty normal day planned out . She planned on taking her son the doctor , then she 'd buy some groceries , then she 'd make lunch , and they 'd spend the rest of their day at home . Maybe playing outside if Westley felt up to playing , or if he wanted to nap all day she 'd let him and she 'd get something around the house done . What Riley did n't plan on doing was stopping at the gas station and doing a double take as she walked inside to pay because she thought she 'd spotted Dean in the phone booth . She had n't wanted to think about him at all today . Not because she hated him , not because he was n't worth her time , but because it was too hard to think about him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her if she did n't think about the man she loved . Because she was convinced she 'd never see him again , and she hated that because there was so much she wished he could be a part of . <p> A groan left Dean 's lips as he heard Sam 's words . How had he lost track of where Riley was ? Shaking his head , dean glanced over at the gas station he 'd " borrowed " money from and did a double take . He could 've sworn he saw Riley with ... a baby ? A frown formed on his features as he spoke into the phone . " Sammy . I 'm going to have to call you back . And I will , I swear . Just , sit tight .

And yet , here he stood , as confused as she was sure she looked , talking to his brother ? Sitting her coffee down on the kitchen counter , she walked over to the fridge to grab a beer for herself . The situation definitely required something that was n't coffee . <p> Riley pushed her fingers through her long hair and sighed as she walked into the gas station to pay for the pump she was at . Today was n't supposed to be like this . She had n't wanted to think about Dean or everything he was missing out on . She had n't wanted to spend her day worrying about him or wondering about things she might not ever get an answer to . She 'd wanted to just leave the house with her son , run some errands , and not think about him . Riley wanted him out of her head so that maybe she would n't want to break down every time she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " she finally whispered to herself determined to not break down today . She just hoped it would work . " What- Dean- " Before Sam could even attempt to convince his brother not to hang up the phone the call had already ended . And Sam hated that because well at this point all he knew was that apparently , Dean was back . He did n't know anything else , like where he was , if he was okay , or if it was actually Dean , or why he 'd suddenly hung up the phone . And until he knew where his brother was he could n't exactly figure out any of those things . So Sam supposed he 'd just have to wait for Dean to call him back , which he just hoped actually happened . Otherwise , it was going to be a long day without much sleep that night . <p> Dean walked into the gas station , a frown forming on his face . He could 've sworn that he 'd seen Riley but now ... now he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , right where he 'd turned up . And , even if she was , there was no possible way she 'd be in the same gas station he was at . He did n't believe in coincidences . And this was looking like a big fucking coincidence to him . Glancing around the room , Dean let out a sigh . Of course he 'd imagined seeing her.Dana frowned at Sam . The way that call had ended did not sound okay . " Sam , babe ? Everything alright ? " Walking over , she reached to rest her hand on his shoulder , even though he was a lot taller than she was . She wondered , of course , what that call was about but , over the past year , she 'd realised that Sam did n't particularly like talking about his family and , though she did n't like it , she 'd learned to move past it . <p> " Thank you , " Riley told the cashier after she 'd paid for her gas then she 'd turned to head back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the phone booth and that was one thing , but she was almost positive this time around that the man she saw not to far from her now was Dean . Unless of course her eyes were playing tricks on her , and she really hoped they were n't . But to make sure she decided to make a bold move and walk towards him for a better look . " Dean ? " She said , with a shaky voice and a heart that felt like it could beat straight out of her chest , when she was within a couple feet of him . " Is it really you ? " She added knowing it was probably stupid but she could help herself.Sam shook his head , then ran his hands over his face , then his fingers were pushing through his hair . He had no idea what was going on , or even how to deal with any of this at the moment . But he knew he also that he had to deal with it . " Honestly I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my brothers back but I do n't know it was him for sure . I do n't know where he is , and he hung up before I could ask him anything . So I 'm just not sure about anything right now really . " <p> Dean had just turned to walk back to the phone booth when he heard her voice . It was absolutely unmistakable . Turning to face her , Dean could n't help but grin . Riley . His Riley . With one step , he moved closer , tugging her into a hug . That was when he really took it all in . Riley , the baby , the bags in her hands . Stepping back , he cleared his throat . " God , I 've missed you . " He muttered as his gaze ran over her face , taking her all in . Her face , and the hope of one day seeing her and his brother again , were what had kept him going in Purgatory.Letting out a soft breath , the brunette wrapped her arm around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She asked softly , knowing that Sam would n't say he was pretty sure if he was n't .

From what you 've told me of him , I know Dean would n't ever leave you hanging . " <p> Riley bit her lip doing everything she could to hold back her tears . She 'd never thought this would happen , and it had been the last thing she would 've expected today . But here he was in front of her as if it 's where he 'd always been .

Mommy 's right here , " she told him softly kissing his head not sure how things were about to play out , but she supposed they 'd see . " No , I 'm not sure , " He told her sighing . The only reason he was n't sure though was because well Dean had been gone for the last year and for all Sam knew he could be back only possessed by something or God knew what else . Because well when it came to the world they lived in with all the insane shit he 'd seen and had to deal with over his entire life honestly he was n't going to be sure it was his brother until he threw some holy water on him .

If I called him back from your number , maybe then he 'd believe me when I said I was back . " His eyes darted to Westly and the confusion was still very visible but , he realized , he needed to deal with one issue at one time . " Hey . Do n't worry so much . I have n't seen you this worked up in ... well , this is the first time I 've seen you this worked up . " A frown crossed the brunette 's features as she looked up at him . The Sam she knew did n't like talking about his past , did n't like talking about his family and only ever told her that his parents were dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much besides that and yet , somehow , they 'd ended up building a life together over the course of the past year . <p> Riley nodded her head , " yes . It 's still in my car , though , " she told him biting her lip before she motioned for Dean to follow her out of the gas station and to her car . Once she reached the car she went ahead and put Westly in his car seat and got him all buckled in , then grabbed her phone from the front seat and handed it to Dean . " Here you go , " she said softly . " I 'm sure Sam will answer since I have n't changed my number but he might be a little shocked because I have n't exactly kept in touch with him over this last year , " she told Dean , knowing he 'd probably be a little upset that her and Sam had n't stuck together but there was nothing they could do about it now , then she went to actually put the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could look at the situation and not be worried , or worked up , or just downright confused by everything , but this was n't one of those situations . He was in a weird state of mind right now because apparently his brother was n't dead or gone forever or whatever . Dean was back , which was great but Sam had no idea what that meant . He had a feeling things were about to change a lot . And on top of that madness , there was well the fact that when Dean did finally get in touch with Riley , if he could find her , he 'd find out about his kid which that was something Sam did n't know how Dean would take . But he supposed they 'd see how everything panned out . " I think I 'm going to need something a little bit stronger to drink , " he finally said pretty sure this whole ordeal called for something a bit stronger than beer . <p> A frown crossed Dean 's features once more as he locked his gaze on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , he quickly dialled Sam 's number once more , a sigh leaving his lips . His arm automatically went around Riley as he pulled her closer , not quite ready to let go of her just yet . His gaze turned to the toddler in the car seat once more , wondering for the millionth time since he 'd laid his eyes on the kid if he was his.Sitting her beer down , the brunette leaned up to press a kiss to his cheek . " Stronger drink , coming right up . " With a small smile , she made her way to the mini bar they had set up over the past year . She was worried about the tall Winchester and , though she did n't know what else she could do to help him , she could definitely serve up a drink or two if that was what he needed . <p> Riley let out a content sigh as Dean pulled her close to him . Just being close to him like this was something she 'd dreamed about for the last year but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Having Dean back , even with everything she knew she had to tell him just hanging in the air above them , was amazing . She just hoped that when she did tell him everything , like how she 'd had his baby then ran out on Sam , he did n't get to upset . Though she really was n't sure how he was going to take anything . " As much as I 'd love to stay like this even for a bit longer I really need to get gas , " she said relucantly pulling away from him so she could put gas in her car . " You can get in though , " she told him figuring she 'd take him with her at least to the dr. from there they 'd decide on where they were going.Sam ran his hands over his face wishing he knew what was going on right now , but he did n't .

Only this time it was n't an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't sure what was happening this time around either because he had n't exaclty had contact with her in well over ten months . But he was n't going to complain about her wanting to come back into his life , especailly if it would mean he 'd finally get to meet the most recent addition to his family . " Riley ? " He answered the phone knowing that he should probably inform her of Dean being back since it was likely she did n't know . <p> Before Dean could respond to Riley , Sam had answered the phone . " Actually , it 's me . " He murmured into the phone . " We got ta talk , Sammy . Can you come down to Riley 's ? I think , I hope that that 's where we 're headed now . " With raised brows , he shot a look at Riley , hoping she 'd agree with taking him home with her . He wanted to talk to Sam , of course . But he needed to talk to Riley first.A frown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaning up to press a kiss to Sam 's cheek , Dana grabbed her glass and moved to the dining room .

I would 've been on sooner ! But I was out of the country on a Mission Trip last week and this week 's been me playing catch up on sleep . <p> Riley looked back at Dean and bit her lip . " We can go back to my place , yes , but it 'll be like an hour because I have to take Westly to the doctor to make sure his ear infection 's gone , " She told Dean not sure he 'd understand but she 'd understand if he did n't given he did n't really know Westly , he did n't technically know Westly was his , and well he 'd been gone for a year now and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined Dean calling him earlier , it was n't some cruel prank to play on his emotions . And it was even better that Dean and Riley were already together . That was one thing he could cross off his list of things that needed to be taken care of .

Regardless of the intentions , the following steps can be taken towards a pain free and enjoyable morning after drinking . <h> Eat : <p> If you consume food before hand or even directly after you drink , the food can work to absorb the alcohol in your system and help to sober you up . My suggestion , something that I swear by , is food from McDonald 's right before or after alcohol is consumed . Even if you 're not hungry , eat an order of fries at least . If you 're somewhere where you can not get McDonald 's , eat something like bread , eggs , crackers , honey , or chicken noodle soup . <h> Stay Hydrated : <p> Alcohol consumption can cause you to have to go to the bathroom a lot and therefore robs your body of the water it 's storing and causes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after effect . Before you go to bed or even after you 're just done drinking , drink at least a full glass of water .

If you get enough rest , your body will have time to repair itself from the alcohol and you will feel far better if you 're able to get eight hours compared to that three hours you 'd get if you had to go to work the next day . <h> Pain Killers : <p> Along with your full glass of water , take a couple of Motrin or Tylenol to help keep down the headache that could manifest in the morning .

If you know you 're getting to the point that you think you 'll be hungover the next day , do yourself a favor and stop there . <p> Just know that not all of these tips or tricks may not always work for you personally and the only true way to prevent a hangover is to not drink at all !

A bunch of fun loving " dudes " who come out and play energetic and crowd-participation filled shows . If you 're familiar with them then " What Separates Me From You " will not take you too much by surprise . This band from Ocala , FL never ceases to please their fan base with the sound we 've come to love . <p> A little back story of A Day To Remember will help you understand some of the lyrics used in these 10 new songs released on November 16th in the US ( Nov. 15 in the UK ) . Jeremy McKinnon , Front man and lead singer of A Day To Remember has always been a fan of different genres , Even admitting in an interview that he enjoys Miley Cyrus from time to time . Keeping this in mind you can tell where their pop and their punk collide , however , what Jeremy personally ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are people who consider A Day To Remember sellouts because of their lighter sound . <p> Using this knowledge let 's get into the tracks : <h> Track #1 - Sticks and Bricks ( 3:17 ) <p> Rating : 8 / 10 <p> Sticks and Bricks itself completely demonstrates through the lyrics the views of Jeremy about these people considering A Day To Remember to be sellouts by completely blowing their pop-punk sound out of the water and opening strong and heavy . As quoted by Jeremy in an interview : " You think we 're sellouts ? In the first song I say " My heart is filled with hate " .. Come on " All in all , an excellent start to the album . <h> Track #2 - All I Want ( 3:23 ) <p> Rating : 9 / 10 <p> Going back to their upbeat and catchy tunes , All I Want is a PERFECT example of what we 've come to expect from A Day To Remember . Everyone brought their A - Game here with Jeremy 's rough sounding vocals , Alex 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Kevin and Niel that you can definitely see yourself Air-guitaring to ( Myself in some occasions , But can you blame me ? ) All I Want was the best choice for the first single off of this album . <h> Track #3 - It 's Complicated ( 2:57 ) <p> Rating 7 / 10 <p> This song demonstrates the " other genres " that Jeremy is into . I feel what he did with the lyrical content in this song is to try and combine Homesick style and his punk roots . This song does n't feel as though it would go over well with the typically energetic show that A Day To Remember puts on live . And in a typical A Day To Remember fashion we finish off the song with group vocals . Always makes you want to sing along , Do n't you think ? <h> Track #4 - This Is The House That Doubt Built ( 3:30 ) Rating : 5 / 10 <p> While this song blows my mind in lyrical content , I feel it is the least memorable off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hook me . As much as I listen to it . Still you can tell it is A Day To Remember with their lyrics . <h> Track #5 - 2nd Sucks ( 2:28 ) <p> Rating : 8 / 10 <p> Why does everything about this song scream the nerdy side of A Day To Remember out at me . I myself being a nerd LOVE this song . Mostly because of that " Fight " at the beginning .. It just gets me every time . This song makes you want to walk up to that bully in Highschool and just shout in his face " Get the f**k over it ! " I feel that though this is the shortest on the album , it packs the most punch for me . <h> Track #6 - Better Off This Way ( 3:26 ) <p> Rating : 8 / 10 <p> And the fun never stops . As soon as the heavy ending of 2nd Sucks rings out of your ear drums Jeremy McKinnon decides he does n't want the heavy to stop and you do n't plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing along to the beginning of this song , It packs power and makes you feel as though you 're tough , You 're telling that person that you do n't need them , You 're better off without them . If there was a song that I would say pulls me out of a bad mood it 's Better Off This Way . Classic heavy A Day To Remember . <h> Track #7 - All Signs Point To Lauderdale ( 3:17 ) <p> Rating : 9 / 10 <p> Whoa , Did I stumble into Homesick somehow ? That is EXACTLY what this sounds like . Is it at fault for it ? Hell no . It 's what I like about it . Not changing at all from their previous album they 'll continue to " Hate this washed up town " they live in . A welcome track and my runner up for best choice of the single on this album ( and here 's hoping a music video in the making ! ) <h> Track #8 - You Be Tails , I 'll Be Sonic ( 3:48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , It 's a hilarious title to a really bad ass song . A perfect blend of heavy music and light vocals with Jeremy screaming the verses . You ca n't go wrong with the melodic side of A Day To Remember and they really brought that in this song . Even the screaming has a melodic tune to it . <h> Track #9 - Out Of Time ( 3:27 ) <p> Rating : 6 / 10 <p> The opening to this song is honestly all it does for me , After that the whole song is n't too memorable to me except for " Do n't think you got ta go it alone here " honestly when I hear that it takes me days to get that one line out of my head . I love this song and all , but it does n't hook me and make me want to recommend it to all my friends . <h> Track #10 - If I Leave ( 3:24 ) <p> Rating : 7 / 10 <p> Interestingly enough the only thing that makes me remember this song is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Try Honestly . With this song it brings back serious remnants of " If it means a lot to you " without most of the slow parts . As soon as I looked at the title I thought it was going to be another acoustic . I was greatly introduced to a rather poppy ending to the album . And a good ending at that . <p> With everything said and done , there is the review of What Separates Me From You !

@@23757715 @3757715/ <h> Can Movies Lead To Murder ? <p> There are so many movies put out each year about killing , stalking , rape , but does it really lead people to murder ? <p> To us the movies are nothing more than a shocker film , but to the twisted is it an inspiration for murder ? <p> The movie , Scream , directed by Wes Craven , featured a character wearing an elongated white face mask with hollow eyes and a black cowl , popular among Trick-or-Treaters and for Halloween parties . Aired in 1996 , the film satirized a collection of past slasher movies , offering the plot of a teenage girl targeted by a maniacal killer ( Ghostface ) who must learn her town 's secrets to save herself . But even satires can trigger unbalanced minds to mimicry . It 's all in the images . <h> Movie Poster : Scream <p> Even as Scream spawned two top-grossing sequels , it also inspired crimes .

They stabbed Murray eighteen times and left him to die , but a day and a half later a man walking his dog found him , and he recovered . <p> Just before the attack , the boys had watched Scream at the home of a drug dealer , who had shown them occultic items and weapons , and allegedly told them that the gods wanted Murray to die .

Only when Murray pretended to be dead did they leave , but he was too injured to find his way to a hospital . <p> Fuller accused Gill as the ringleader , and while Gill initially refused to admit his part he later said that the drug dealer had given him drugs and urged him to kill Murray .

Consider this : If the amount of greenhouse gases emitted inversely effect the atmosphere 's ability to block UV rays and keep the earth cool , why were the days in which people burned coal for fuel and burned wood for heat considered to be a mini ice age ? Back in the late 1700s , when Washington crossed the Delaware River , we went through a mini ice age . Thirty years later , it got hot . Thirty years after that , it got cool again , though not to mini ice age standards . <p> People tend to think of woodstoves as cleaner heaters than electric ones , claiming that electric heaters give off more emissions than wood stoves . The answer to this : NO ! Wood gives off more CO2 than electric heaters do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get firewood destroys the habitats of thousands of animals . <p> It 's not a question of , Is this our fault ? , it 's a question of , Shall we believe the government this time ? Shall we believe that we caused such an enormous rate of change over the past , say , fifty years , when we 've spent so much time creating and using cleaner fuels than we had beforehand ? <p> Global warming , while existent and a major problem , are n't the worst things to happen to earth . Its not even just a dopey answer like " people are " its self importance . Religion , international law , and even the sciences , are all by-products of our overwhelming need to beleive we are more important than everything else . 7 ' deadly ' sins anyone ? why r we more important than ants ? its not a question of why we should stop driving cars and emmiting colossal amounts of industrial waste , its the matter of why we are important enough to drive cars in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this for a long time = We 're destroying ourselves . That 's all there is too it . We 've made one too many bad decisons , and it 's showing . And not only are destroying ourselves , we 're taking everything down with it . Oil companie destroy nature to make those ugly oil reels . ans animals get pushed off their homes . We mess with coral reefs and the creates on them die . We jump bowling water into lakes/rivers and the fish die . When are we ever going to realize we are n't the only things that matter on earth ? Great article = <p> I find it odd how all these people can go " It just happens " . Explain the hurricanes , melting , and the animals dying . Is it nateral for CO2 air coponent to triple ? No . So stop trying to fool yourself into saying nothing is happening just so that you can pollute and not feel that bad . <p> Yes , Global Warming is probably a natural process that has occurred on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that as well . And , of course , the poles are going to switch again eventually . ( But this one is n't based upon human interference . Just thought I would mention it anyway . ) <p> The point is that humans are adding to this process via vehicular pollution -- and yes , by their own farts ( methane gas ) . <p> So really it comes down to ihow fast/i . <p> That big gapping hole over Australia/Antarctica is going to get bigger . <p> And it 's going to get hotter . Waay hotter . ( And it 's already like Hell in some places . ) <p> I really should n't read these sorts of articles . They just make me frustrated . I 'm glad I 'm not the only one that knows that Global Warming was going to happen anyway . A couple of people have said so already . We 've had it before and we ca n't stop it no matter what we do . My Geography teacher made it very clear that we have basically next to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Vapour actually accounts for 98% of the natural Greenhouse Effect ? Now that is definetly something we ca n't stop . Sure Carbon dioxide does n't help but some of that is natural and what we contribute is only speeding the GW up a little tiny bit . And lil-miss-gigglz was right about the cows , except it 's not just cows , it 's every animal and human , they all produce methane . So it was a well written article but I have to say I do n't agree and I think the human race just likes to have something to be scared about and immediately believes it whether the facts are all there or not . <p> Did you know that a lot of the worlds pollution is caused by cow farts ( methane gas ) ? I read an article in the newspaper yesterday saying that the aussies think they can slow down global warming by making everyone eat kangaroos instead of cows . ( You know , we 'd stop breeding cows because we would n't need them . Less cows , less cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metling , the Antarctic is freezing . AND , as other people have already said , the earth naturally goes through warming and cooling phases . So , overall , I 'm not too concerned . Global warming was going to happen anyway , we 've just speeded it up a bit . Also , animal species naturally die out - loads have done already . Dinosaurs , for example . <p> It 's perfectly natural what 's going on - it 's been doing it for millions of years . The earth warms , and then cools . We have ice ages , we leave ice ages . We 're currently still iin/i an ice age - characterised by the ice at the poles of the earth . It would have melted eventually without humans , and maybe it 's melting quicker with them , but we ca n't do that thing of accepting all responsibility for a natural phenomenon simply beyond our control . We 're not ithat/i powerful ! <p> Do n't tell the oil companies that though . It 'd still be nice to cut pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hype about human beings causing global warming though .

The only constructive thing I icould/i say would be to cite your sources , but , because I ido/i already know most of what this article pertains to , I wo n't stress that . <p> I would , however , like to make some other things crystal clear . <p> Venice is already doomed basically . True , the water level is rising probably due to the polar ice caps melting , but Venice is already sinking because of the weight of the buildings and the structures under the the surface . To sum up Venice 's existence , the city is made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " islands " are essentially structures of wood-covered mud . Like boxes , I suppose . And on these boxes are the heavy buildings . Which cause the sinking .

But yes , New Orleans was doomed the minute " they " got the bright idea to build a city on a delta . <p> Oh , geez . Does everyone also know that the Earth naturally goes through phases of intense heat and intense cold through time ? There was a very similar phenomenon in the middle ages . Of course we must do our best to protect the environment , but I wish that everyone would chill with the blame and relax about the whole " global warming " thing . I wish that everyone would stop shouting at the human race and just become more conscious without claiming a fault . <p> It 's about time someone made something like this .

I was n't able to find out where the recipe originated from , but the foggy coastline of Northern California is artichoke country . Like finding small hole-in-the-walls that serve clam chowder in New England , in California you can sometimes find local diners that sell delicious artichoke soup . <p> The recipe I made , called " Creamy Artichoke Chicken Soup " , has 8-10 servings . The preparation time is approximately 2 hours and 10 minutes . It 's a hearty soup filled with artichokes along with other vegetables as well as heavy cream and Parmesan cheese . It tastes great with croutons , and the chicken broth can be replaced with a strong vegetable broth for vegetarians . <h> The complete list of ingredients is as follows : <p> 4 medium fresh artichokes <p> Juice of 1 lemon <p> 2 cups water <p> 2 cups chicken broth <p> + cup dry white wine <p> 1 medium russet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 celery stalk <p> 2 cloves garlic <p> 2 bay leaves <p> + teaspoon dried oregano <p> + pound ( about 2 cups ) cooked chicken <p> 1 cup heavy cream <p> 4 tablespoons grated fresh Parmesan or Romano cheese <p> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste <p> When beginning to prepare the soup , the first thing you have to do is wash the artichokes , being certain to run water through all the petals as well . Then you tear off any discolored or brown leaves , mostly found near the base of the stems , then tear off the outer petals . Cut off the stems so that the artichoke is flat on the bottom and ready to sit in the pot . <p> If you do n't have a steamer to put the artichokes in ( like I did n't ) , using a stainless steel soup pot is fine . Just put some silverware in the bottom to hold up the artichokes and help them steam . Fill the pot with about an 1 + of water , which is only enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water to boil in the soup pot , then place all four artichokes on top of the silverware along with the two bay leaves to mix their flavors together as they boil . Next is the lemon . Roll the lemon before you cut it so that it gets extra juicy , then slice the lemon in half . Squeeze both halves over the boiling artichokes . <p> Put the lid over the pot to trap the steam , letting it cook for about 40 minutes . To tell if the artichokes are done or not , pull of one of the inner petals . If the petal comes off easily , then they 're done . <p> Wash one potato , scrubbing with a brush to clean off the dirt . Dice the potato and leave on the skin for extra vitamins . Wash and dice one small carrot . Wash and dice one onion , peel the skin and take out the core . Wash and dice one celery stalk . Place all the diced vegetables together to one side , or put them in a bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken . <p> When the artichokes are done steaming , take them out of the pot to continue preparing them . Tear off the petals one at a time and scrape the artichoke flesh from their bases into a separate bowl . Chop up the heart of the artichoke and put it into the bowl as well . Scrape out and throw away the choke . <p> Keep the water in the pot , but take out the bay leaves and silverware . Put the artichoke meat back into the pot , pour in the chicken broth and white wine , put in the diced vegetables , and put in the spices ( 2 minced cloves of garlic , + teaspoon of oregano , salt and pepper ) . Leave out the chicken , cream , and cheese . Boil the soup , uncovered , for about 15 minutes until the vegetables are tender . Then puree the vegetables , with their liquid , in a blender or food processor . <p> Return artichoke puree to the soup pot .

Bring the heat to a low simmer , stirring constantly until heated . <p> The croutons gave it an extra crunch which was great because I made the soup a bit too thin .

My whole family ( except for my little brother , who did n't want to try it ) loved the Artichoke soup and I thought it tasted wonderful .

In Australia alone , there are 1.5 million people under 18 that are obese . It is so common , in fact , that the government has decided to take more action against it than it has in the past . <p> The Australian Government is currently considering introducing a program to the Child Protection System .

Mind maps are fairly easy to make and , depending on how long your story is , you can make a decent mind map in about ten minutes . A mind map is very different from an outline . It uses colors , shapes , and lineage to help organize your thoughts . I find that mind maps get my creative juices flowing better than writing an outline because outlines are so stiff . Here are some tips for mind mapping your works , but remember : there is no wrong way to make a mind map ! <p> Step One : <p> The first step is to make the shape with your story title in it . This is very simple . <p> Add your characters and their details . I like to create arrows that say one characters relationship to another . <p> Step Four : <p> Add the details of your setting . Use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little details . An easy place to start is the where and when . <p> Step Five : <p> Add the details for your plot .

@@23757735 @3757735/ <h> Hard to Figure Out <p> Payton 's life had been one wild ride after the next , that was one thing she was completely and utterly positive of . Matt had been a boy at the time but he had done so much good in her life . He had showed her the world , or at least their small little section of it . Opened her eyes to everything that was beautiful about the world , from the simplicity of a sunset to the animals than lived in nature . Everything had its part in the world , everything had a purpose . To this day , she remembered the way her first love had made her feel . <p> There were good days , the days that her husband was in a good mood and was the man that she had fallen head over heels in love with . Then there were the bad days , when he lost his temper and she was forced to remember why she needed to obey . Those days , she struggled with what their purpose was . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot land on her ribs ? Of all the wondering she had done , she had never come up with a reason that made any sort of sense to her . But she never dreamed of leaving Ryan . She loved the man - she could n't just abandon him because he had some problems . She had her own problems , she still found herself lost in day dreams of what it would be like if Ryan was Matt . God , did she still . Her husband always seemed to know every time she got lost in her own mind and those days were the worst . She was n't supposed to think of anyone but her husband , after all they were married . <p> Payton did n't work , she needed to be able to take care of the home she lived in with Ryan . Just like the day before and the one before that , Payton had started supper right at 4:30pm . It would finish just a few minutes before Ryan got home and she would be serving it just as he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood . This time around , it was chicken parmigiana , made from scratch . Every morning , Ryan would leave after telling her what he wanted for supper that evening . She would clean for most of the day , not wanting to find so much as a spec of dust out of place . <p> She was listening to music quietly in the background as she worked to finish the chicken parmigiana , humming along to herself . Payton had just been moving a glass measuring cup to pour into the pan that held her homemade sauce when the doorbell rang , startling her into dropping the cup . It shattered on the floor and for a brief moment , she panicked . Oh God , if Ryan was home and watched her break it ... but then , he would n't have rang the door bell . Her stomach had twisted into a bundle of nerves as she turned , wiping her hands off on a hand towel as she walked to the front door . <p> It would be a girl scout looking to sell some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to say no , she had no choice . Ryan was strict with the money and such an expense was n't worth it . Rehearsing what she would say to whomever was on the other side of the door , she finished wiping her hands just as she reached the door . Payton drew in a deep breathe and opened the door , unprepared for her world to be rocked . <p> If there was any one thing that defined Matt 's life , it would be the day his friend Tyler Jacobs died . It had been a complete accident , the result of some stupid teenage stunt . But accident or not , Tyler 's family wanted someone to pay for what had happened and ultimately , Matt had been the one to step forward and take the blame . It has n't been a major charge , but enough to leave Matt a convicted felon . Involuntary manslaughter , those were the two words emblazoned on Matt 's permanent record , the two words that made people look at him like a leper now that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd let Tyler Jacobs die , that 's all he would ever be . <p> After being released from prison , Matt had spent a few days enjoying the things he 'd been denied in prison : Mexican food and private bathrooms and sleeping on a bed that did n't feel like a slab of rock . And alcohol . Jesus Christ , he 'd missed alcohol . But once he 'd become reacquainted with all of his creature comforts , Matt had decided to look up Payton . Payton had been his girlfriend in high school , his first love , and the only person besides his family that had n't been convinced it was him who had killed Tyler . He 'd hoped to try and reconnect with Payton , but in looking her up he 'd discovered that she was married , to a man they 'd both gone to school with . Ryan something or other . Matt did n't remember much about him , just that he 'd never been very nice . But just because Payton was married did n't mean that Matt could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been planning . Matt stuffed his hands into his pockets as he walked up to Payton 's front door , his brow furrowing when he rang the doorbell and heard something shatter inside . A few minutes later the door opened , and Matt could tell by the look on Payton 's face that he was the absolute last person she was expecting to see . <p> " Hey Payton , " Matt said , flashing her his famous dimpled grin . " Can I come in ? I just want to talk , I promise . " <p> Even with the first time that Payton had been made aware of just what went down with Matt and Tyler , she had been positive that it was n't Matt who had killed him . Something must have gone wrong . She did n't know what but she knew that somewhere along the line , something happened where Matt 's friend had died . While he did tend to get into fights and he was bigger , he certainly had never been violent enough to do such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her safe , something that she had never managed to convince her parents of . With the death , it had been all that they needed to deny Payton ever seeing him again . She had been under age at the time so visiting the prison without them had never been an option . <p> Her grip on the hand towel loosened and the item fell to the ground beside her as Payton took in the sight in front of her . She would know those eyes , that smile , and that voice anywhere . She would have been able to pick him out of crowd any day of the week . Payton knew it was wrong , knew she should n't have but before she could stop herself , Payton flung herself into Matt 's arms and hers wrapped tightly around his neck . She buried her face into his shirt , breathing in his scent in what felt like the first time in forever . <p> Clearing her throat as she stepped back from Matt reluctantly , Payton could feel her cheeks turning red . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bit down on her bottom lip as she leaned down to pick up the dish towel from the floor . Payton was a bit stiff in her movements but did n't think too much about it - Matt would n't comment surely . Her eyes flicked to the entrance of the kitchen and she hesitated for a moment before turning back around to Matt . " I 'm just starting dinner so if you 're okay with that , sure , " she answered quietly , stepping to the side . " But not for too long . My , er , " she paused , her stomach sinking as she realized what she had to tell Matt . " My husband will be home soon but for a bit should be fine . " <p> Matt was a little taken back when Payton flung herself into his arms , but he allowed himself to hug her back , even though he knew he should n't . He slipped his arms around her waist , closing his eyes as he pressed his face into her hair , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , back when his life was normal and back when he thought he was going to marry Payton . Matt looked at her when she finally stepped back from him , watching as she bent down to retrieve the hand towel that she 'd dropped onto the floor . He noticed the catch in her voice when she mentioned her husband , but Matt just shrugged . He 'd already known about that , it was n't news to him . Even if it did sting a little . But Matt knew that he would 've been asking way too much by expecting Payton to wait for him to get out of prison . She needed someone to love and support her , and besides that , she was a beautiful woman . If he 'd gotten out and found that she 'd been single , he would 've been dumbfounded that no other man had snatched her up . <p> " Food smells good , " Matt said , walking into the kitchen and taking a seat at the table . He drummed his fingers on the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did you say to your high school sweetheart that you 'd been forced to give up after going to prison because everyone thought you 'd killed your best friend ? There was no etiquette manual for that . " So uh , how have you been ? " Matt finally asked . " I mean , I know you got married , but what about everything else ? Did you go to college ? Where are you working ? And um , if I 'm not prying too much by asking , how did you and Ryan get together ? " <p> It had taken every ounce of self control that Payton had to pull away from Matt 's arms . She sighed as she led the way into the kitchen , immediately kneeling down to sweep up the broken measuring cup . Her shoulders tensed when Matt began speaking because as much as she wanted to avoid the questions , she knew Matt and she knew exactly what was coming her way . She busied herself with pouring a glass of iced tea before turning to set it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was around , that was the most forefront thought in her mind most of the time now . It usually solved more problems than it caused so why would n't she ? <p> At the questions , Payton let out a dry laugh as she turned back to the food that she was cooking . She began to dish up the chicken , setting it into the baking dish before finally placing the dish into the oven . " Uh ... no . I did n't go to school , I started dating Ryan about a year after ... after what happened , " Payton paused to take a deep breath as she turned back to him . " I do n't work , I just do my best to take care of the house and keep things in order , " she spoke quietly , moving to sit in the chair opposite of him . Payton was n't exactly lying to Matt , she just was n't telling the whole truth . No one knew though , no one could know . <p> Matt could tell by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire truth . But now was n't definitely not the right time to try and pry into Payton 's life , he 'd just shown up on her doorstep after several years . When she asked him questions about his plans now , Matt just shrugged his shoulder , reaching for the glass of tea that Payton had placed in front of him . " I got out a couple of days ago , " Matt finally answered , taking a sip of the tea . " Spent the past few days catching up on the basic creature comforts . You know , home cooked meals , private showers , an actual bed that does n't feel like I 'm sleeping on a slab of concrete . And as for my plans now ... well , I do n't really have any . I 'm still just trying to adjust to life outside of prison , because let me tell you , it 's a lot different . I know that eventually I 'm going to have to get a job , but there are only so many that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Matt did n't have the heart to tell Payton , but he was seriously considering saving up a little money and then leaving town . There was no hope for him to have a normal life here , not when ninety five percent of the town believed that he 'd killed his best friend . " You do n't think I did it , right ? " Matt asked suddenly , looking up at Payton . " Killed Tyler , I mean ? I just ... I never got the chance to ask you and you never came to see me and you never wrote me a letter or anything and I just sort of thought that the rest of the town brainwashed you into thinking that I 'm a murderer . " <p> Payton had always felt a certain amount of guilt that she could have perhaps changed the outcome of Matt 's trial . She knew that he would have never hurt Tyler , the first time she had heard it , she knew without a doubt . She had never gotten the chance to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wondered if things would have been different if she had tried . Tried at what , she had no clue . <p> She had had a suspicion the question was coming but when it sounded from Matt 's lips , Payton 's heart skipped a beat . She swallowed the emotion that had suddenly formed in her throat as she turned back to him . Closing her eyes , Payton willed the tears that appeared in her eyes to not fall . It would n't be fair to Matt to cry , it was n't as if she had been the one that had been locked up . The look on Matt 's face broke her heart and she had to resist the urge to hug him , to offer the comfort that she had longed to give him for so long . " No , " she answered quietly , dipping her head as she kicked at the ground . " I never did . You were n't ... you would n't . I just sort of thought you probably blamed me , hated me ... I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I eventually began to believe it , " she whispered , shrugging her shoulders . " I could n't have blamed you if you did . I could have helped you or at least tried to and I did n't . " <p> Matt could tell that what he 'd asked Payton had her close to tears . It made him feel like he 'd been punched in the gut . Ever since he 'd met Payton he 'd always loved her smile and he hated the thought of anything taking that away . And knowing that it was his fault always made him feel awful . " I could never hate you , Payton , " Matt said softly . " We were young and I know that your parents never liked me . And after a little time had passed , I did n't really expect you to show up and visit me . In fact , I 'd hoped you would n't . I 'd hoped that you 'd moved on with your life at that point , because you deserved better than waiting around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much of a life that I could provide for you anyway , not with a felony on my record . So no , I never hated you , Payton . And I could never blame you for moving on and forgetting about me . " Matt looked over when he heard the timer on the oven going off . He knew whatever Payton was cooking for dinner was done and that her husband would be home soon , which meant that he needed to leave . <p> " I 'm going to go , Payton , " Matt said , getting to his feet . He stuffed his hands into his pockets . " But uh , it was nice seeing you again . You 're the only person besides my parents who is n't resting me like a leper or something . And I 'll come by again . If that 's alright with you and Ryan , I mean . I do n't want to intrude . " Matt went over to Payton and wrapped his arms around her shoulders , pulling her into a hug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever you 're cooking , it smells really good . " <p> The relief that flooded Payton was something she had n't been prepared for . She was used to it by now , living with the guilt that she felt . If she had only tried a bit harder , she would have been able to help Matt and maybe he would n't have gone to prison . At the very least , she should n't have given up on him so easily . Which was exactly what she had done . <p> The sound of the timer going over made Payton jump , her eyes widening as fear filled her being . She knew that Matt needed to leave and he needed to leave now because Ryan would be walking through the front door any moment now . There was no telling when he would arrive home but if he so much as caught a hint of Matt being here , she knew that she would be paying for it for the better part of the week . If she was lucky . <p> Payton 's thoughts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to react when Matt neared her . She let out a ragged sigh as she leaned into his touch , her arms slipping around his waist . " Come for lunch maybe tomorrow ? I 'll fix something up , " she spoke quietly , knowing damn well that it was the wrong thing to do . Missing food meant she had eaten when she had n't been told to but that fate was still better than telling Ryan that Matt had gotten out of prison . Right ? " I 'll see you tomorrow hopefully , " she whispered , giving him a weak smile . " It was nice seeing you , y'know . " <p> " I 'd like that , " Matt said , smiling . He had the strangest urge to kiss Payton , but he knew that he could n't . She was married , and from what he remembered , Ryan was kind of an asshole . He did n't want to get Payton in trouble and besides , she 'd probably moved on from Matt by now . She would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had . She deserved better than him , even if he would love to have her in his arms again . " You can just call my parents ' home phone if you want to get ahold of me , " Matt told Payton . " I have n't had a chance to buy myself a phone or anything like that , but I 'm going to make a trip to the bank soon and see if there 's any money left in any of my accounts . " In all honesty , Matt doubted he had even a penny to his name . He was sure most of the little he 'd had saved up when he was a teenager had been used for legal fees , even though he 'd plead guilty . <p> " Bye , Payton , " Matt said . He offered her one last smile before he left the house , going to his car and starting the engine . As he drove back to his parents ' house , all Matt could think about was how different his life would be if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd plead not guilty and somehow been acquitted . He might be the one who was married to Payton , the one who got to eat the delicious food she was cooking , the one who got to fall asleep and wake up next to her . He wanted that to be the reality more than anything , but there was no way . Payton had moved on , and Matt needed to as well . <p> Take me with you . The request was kept silent as she watched Matt leave and she struggled to keep herself together , knowing that if she broke down now , she would never pick herself back up in time before Ryan returned home . He would ask questions and there would be no chance at a lie for her . She could n't lie to him , she had never been good at doing so . He seemed to be able to detect even the tiniest of lies . Payton sighed , turning away as she began to plate supper for Ryan . Poured a glass of wine , preparing herself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan had a good day at work ... maybe they could enjoy themselves and the guilt she felt over wanting to follow Matt would be forgotten about.The next day , Payton had cooked up salmon , tossing together a salad . She was hopeful that Matt would stop by like she had asked the day before . Ryan was long gone and she was careful to plate each dish for Matt , her eyes trained on the details that Ryan would have normally picked apart . The salad need not touch the fish and the dressing should n't be too much , just enough without making the lettuce swim in it . She had sliced up a lemon and set a slice on top of the fish before setting it down on the table . <p> Payton opted for only a small bit of the salad , figuring that she could get away with saying she had had a decent breakfast so she was n't really hungry . It was true , she was n't hungry , far too nervous to even consider actually wanting to eat . So many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to at some point . Ryan would show up early or maybe Matt would ... hell , she did n't know . <p> Matt had almost completely forgotten about meeting Payton for lunch . He only remembered that he was supposed to go when his stomach started to grumble and he went downstairs to fix himself a sandwich . He spit out something quick to his parents and hurried out the door , driving around the block once he 'd reached Payton 's street just to make sure that Ryan was n't home . He felt like they were sneaking around , and really , they sort of were . Even if they were n't sleeping together , Ryan did n't know that Matt was seeing Payton . This time Matt did n't bother to knock , since he knew Payton was expecting him . The smell hit him as soon as he walked through the door , and he grinned . " Everything smells great , Payton , " Matt said , walking into the kitchen . He looked around at the food she 'd plated . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn , this is fancy . I 've never had salmon before . " <p> Matt took one of the plates that was sitting out on the counter and fixed himself a plate , opting for more fish and less salad . He had always been a meat and potatoes type of guy , and being in prison had only intensified this . He poured a glass of tea from the fridge , feeling a little bad that he was going through Payton 's kitchen , and took a seat at her kitchen table . " So I 'm not going to lie , I almost forgot I was supposed to come over for lunch , " Matt admitted , taking a bite of the salmon . " I only remembered when I got hungry and went downstairs to make myself a sandwich . By the way , this salmon is fucking delicious . Holy shit . " <p> A flood of panic filled Payton when the door burst open without anyone knocking . She instantly became afraid that it was her husband and he was home unexpectedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tip of her tongue when Matt appeared . She was positive her relief was obvious , her shoulders sagging and her face breaking into a smile as she looked up to him . Her stomach filled with butterflies and it took a moment before she could bring herself to push the feeling away . Matt had always been someone she thought of in the moments where she was alone , when she and Ryan had a particularly bad fight . Matt had never once yelled at her , had never gotten in her face , had never looked ready to push her . Let alone anything else that Ryan did . <p> " Sorry it 's not more , " Payton apologized quietly as she sat opposite of Matt . She picked up her fork and pushed her food around on the plate , wrapping her free arm around her stomach . " I just ... the fish wo n't be missed and I do n't think the salad will be , " she attempted to explain quietly , leaning forward as she took a bite of her salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Payton looked up with a grin , her cheeks tinging a red when Matt complimented the food . " Oh , uh , I 'm glad . I do n't get to cook fish very often but it 's my absolute favourite , " she said , taking a small bite of her fillet . " So what are ... what 're you planning to do now that you 're out ? If you do n't mind me asking that is . " <p> " Well you should cook fish more often , this is really good , " Matt said again , taking another bite . When Payton asked what he was planning to do now that he was out of prison . He knew she was trying to make conversation , but he wondered if she knew that she 'd just asked him that question last night . " I do n't really have any , " Matt said , shrugging his shoulders as he stabbed a few pieces of lettuce . He stuck them in his mouth , chewing slowly . " I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So for right now , I 'm just getting used to it . And then I might get a job , but I do n't know if I 'll stay in town for long . I mean , everyone here thinks I 'm a murderer , and it 's already going to be hard enough getting a job with a felony on my record as it is without the bias . And I 'd like to go back to school , maybe technical school , but there 's no way I 'd be accepted anywhere with a GED and a felony conviction . It just ... everything that happened that night ... it fucked up my entire future . I do n't even really have one anymore . " <p> Matt shook his head , stuffing another bite of the salmon fillet into his mouth , chewing as slowly as possible . He had n't realized how much he 'd kept bottled up , but now that he 'd let it out , he realized how frustrated he was with his entire situation . His conviction and prison time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything valuable with his life . " And there 's not much to keep me here , anyway , " Matt continued . He glanced up at Payton with a soft , sad smile . " Well , except for one thing . " <p> Payton 's heart broke all over again as Matt explained what he was planning on doing with his future . She could n't really sit here and try to make him feel better , to help him be more optimistic , because she completely understood it . He had a felony on his record - he had killed his best friend according to the law . It would be hard for him to be able to do anything that would be able to provide for himself , let alone a family . Her bottom lip began to wobble as Matt continued , wishing more now than ever that she had managed to be able to help him . Matt deserved it - he had done so much for her when they were together . As much as a teenage sweetheart could and she had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had really needed her . <p> Closing her eyes , Payton willed herself not to cry . She swallowed the lump that formed in her throat as she opened them , finding Matt 's all too quickly . She forced a smile to her lips before dropping her gaze back down to the table between them . " You 've already paid so much for something that you did n't do . You have to ... you have to live for yourself , Matt , " she spoke . " I think it 's safe to say that you 've earned it . " <p> When Payton looked up at Matt and their gazes met , Matt could tell that she was close to tears . He knew that she felt bad about what happened to him , but there was nothing she could 've done to help him back then , and the fact that she felt guilty made him feel awful . " Well there 's a fat chance of me being able to do that here , " Matt said , stabbing a piece of his fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everybody here but you and my parents thinks I 'm a fucking murderer , and anyone who does a simple background check would think the same thing . I 'm never going to be done paying for what everyone thinks I did back then . It 's going to follow me around forever , no matter how hard I try to shake it . And thinking any differently just seems like I 'm setting myself up with a false hope that I 'm actually going to be able to do something with my life . " <p> Matt shoved the fish into his mouth , washing it down with a swig of his tea . He just needed to stop talking about it , that was it . Talking about it just frustrated him and made him depressed . His life had been over since the day Tyler had died and there was no changing that , no matter how much anyone tried . " So um , let 's talk about something else , " Matt said quickly , swallowing the food in his mouth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting happen since I 've been er , gone ? Besides getting married , of course . " <p> Payton could n't blame Matt for how frustrated he was , she was sure that if roles had been reversed , she would likely be feeling the same way as he was . Everyone that Matt had grown up with , the relationships that he had built were all thrown away because of a stupid decision that Matt had n't even made .

Fish was such a rarity that she honestly could n't believe how she had been so daring .

And it would 've been him that wore her wedding band and fell asleep next to her and everything else that Ryan got to do . But everything he 'd wanted for his future had been ripped away , all because of one night when he was seventeen . <p> Matt raised an eyebrow when the comment about him being good with his hands slipped out of Payton 's mouth , a very slight smirk finding its way onto his face .

They 'd done more fumbling around than anything , but it was a good memory at least , one that had tided Matt over during his years in prison . Years that he 'd gone without any sort of sexual contact at all . " And I suppose I could look into it , but I just do n't see any technical school letting me in with a felony on my record . And I ca n't be a carpenter or a mechanic without a technical degree . " Matt sighed , smoothing a hand back through his hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just that I do n't see any way I can get around what happened back then . " <p> Payton had tried to avoid the topic , praying that Matt would just let it go but the moment that he commented on it , she was launched into a fit of giggles . She hung her head , covering her face with her hands as she shook her head . Once she had composed herself , Payton bit down on her lip as she looked up from her plate of abandoned food . For the first time in what felt like forever , she was genuinely smiling as she shook her head . " You say that like I knew what I was doing ! " She answered , tilting her head to the side as she watched Matt . " I had no clue what to do with you , if I remember correctly , I looked at you like a deer caught in headlights and said I did n't think it would be that big ! " Payton groaned , turning her head away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit out of the ordinary . ' Cause ... " she trailed off , flashing a tiny grin . She would never finish the thought but she was sure Matt could see what she had been hinting at about Ryan . <p> Suddenly becoming more serious , Payton straightened up as she eyed him . " Matt , if there 's anyone in this world that can overcome everything that you 've been through , it 's you . You were so strong , so brave when we were kids . You were what gave me strength whenever I needed it , you were my rock , " she paused to take a deep breath . " Maybe it would be better for you to , " she paused again , " to move . Somewhere where people do n't know your face or your name . Then maybe starting your life over would be easier for you . "

First and foremost , a definition : a Mary Sue is a character that is overly perfect , is right about everything , and has few to no flaws . Next , the argument about just what constitutes a Mary Sue is ongoing , and there is no one right answer . And lastly , if you spot a few things in this article that apply to your character , do n't feel bad . Original characters are special . They require imagination , dedication and devotion . Just as all good parents want their children to be the best they can be , we authors want the same for our babies . But one thing to understand : in order for your character to thrive , they must be relatable and have room to grow , A.K.A Not Perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's get down to busines , shall we ? <h> Names <p> Names have absolutely nothing to do with anything .

A lot of Mary Sue Litmus Tests put a lot of emphasis on this , and , quite frankly , it just . Does n't . Matter . Moving on . <h> Alter Ego <p> Some writers , usually inadvertently , like to model their original character after an alter ego of theirs , or someone they wish they were . Most of us have alter egos , which is perfectly fine . When you are looking in the mirror and wish you had just a little less acne , or you 're out with your friends and you long to be just a tad bit funnier , that is A-okay . We all want to better ourselves ; it 's natural . And if we could all make ourselves perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing a character , alter egos belong in our heads , not in our stories . When you are subejcting others to your world , do not forcefeed them an idealized version of yourself . It 's very unpleasant for the reader , and is fairly easy to spot . <h> Haunting Past Used As An Excuse for Present Decisions <p> In order to make a character more relatable , a writer will quite often give them a tragic past , whether it be woefully dramatic , or fairly plain with tragic undertones . Personal histories are what make us human , and we want to make our characters as near to human ( or if your character is n't human , as relatable ) as possible . It is inevitable that such a backstory would affect your character 's decision making and judgment , sometimes poorly . But if they are making poor choices and using the past as an excuse , please do n't let them get away with it .

( Really , it is . ) And do n't make the scolding character suffer because of their disagreement ( A.K.A. getting yelled at about it later , suffering a similar situtation , or even death . ) You do n't enjoy it when someone 's right all the time ; why should your readers ? <p> And last , but certainly not least ... <h> No Flaws <p> For most readers , a completely perfect character is a major turn-off , and can immediately dispel a potential subscriber and/or commenter .

@@23757760 @3757760/ <p> I do n't know whether I will be able to acknowledge whether people remember or forget me after my death . I do n't think it matters as long as I 'm not there to witness the memory of me still lingers in some people 's head . If I will be there after my death , I want to remembered by the living people , but not much , because they need to go on with their life . I also have a feeling that they might not remember me , but I do n't think I will be too sad , because I am dead and it is quite normal for living people to forget the dead . <p> The reason I want to be remembered after death is very simple ; ) I want to be and become something great and to have made something out of my life . I want to have helped other people with their lives also : ) I just want to have been somebody that the world wants to remember . I want to be great , maybe even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for certain , but I do n't know how much I care if I 'm remembered after I 'm gone . I just want to mean something in the moment , but once I 'm dead I wo n't be conscious and therefore obviously it wo n't matter to me if anyone remembers me . <p> I 've been told that the only thing a person can leave behind to remember them is their children , and as someone who ca n't see myself as a parent in the future this very much disturbed me . <p> I 'm hoping maybe I 'll leave something behind , maybe some writing of mine will get uncovered one day . Or , seeing as it 's the field I want to go into , maybe I 'll make some big scientific discovery that makes a difference on the world . I do n't know . <p> But I just kind of want to do something to make my life count , you know ? Like I do n't want to near the end of my life and realize I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be too late to go back . <p> I feel like an attention whore , but I really want people to remember me not only as someone they knew , but because of my writing . I want kids being taught about me in schools , while teachers praise my work . I know I do n't deserve it , but that 's how I feel <p> Honestly , part of me says , " yeah I 'd love to be remembered as the girl who loved to laugh or the girl who tried to help . " But ... then there 's that part of me that says no ... I really do n't care if people do or not . I do n't want to be a pain for people or a burden , so if my memory is dragging someone down , I 'd much rather be forgotten . <p> It depends on what the individual defines as being remembered in my opinion . <p> For example , I often remember my nan , with her silver sharp tongue that contrasted with her petite fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world or by discovering a new thing to be marvelled at . She is just remembered by people that love her . <p> In the event of my death , as it stands I would be remembered by those that love me so I do n't really have a choice . <p> But as for being remembered for doing something amazing , I 'm working on it : ) <p> I 'm not really sure . It 'd be nice to be remembered fondly but i would n't want anyone to become obsessively depressed and regretful , saying stuff like , " I should'vr done this with her , " " If only I had done something . " Etc . I want my loved ones to grieve , mourn and move on . <p> I do n't think I will ever become famous or worthy of cult followers , so , I do n't know . I mean , I want you to remember me but not cry over my death . Celebrate the times we had and remember what we have . Just because I 'm not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to forget me and cry when you think of me . I want you to smile at the times we had , or think of them on a night you need to be comforted . But if I am forgotten that 's alright too . Like I said , I 'm not worthy of cult followers so if the thought of me fades forever , that 's alright . <p> I 'm honestly not too sure about if I would want to be remembered after death . I feel like it is nearly impossible.I 'm reading The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius right now for my AP English class , and in it Lady Philosophy explains that everyone dies two deaths . The first death is physical , taking your last breath . The second death is when all thoughts of you are lost , when you are no longer remembered.That sounds super depressing , and I 'm not sure if I believe it entirely , but I just thought it was interesting . <p> I 'm honestly not too sure about if I would want to be remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm reading The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius right now for my AP English class , and in it Lady Philosophy explains that everyone dies two deaths .

The second death is when all thoughts of you are lost , when you are no longer remembered.That sounds super depressing , and I 'm not sure if I believe it entirely , but I just thought it was interesting . <p> I 've heard of that before and it depresses the hell out of me , and in a way , I think I believe it because once your loved ones have passed on , there 's nothing else , really . I think eventually , we 're all forgotten over time and it could easily be like a second death . <p> I think my faint desire to be remembered after I die is almost natural because I 'm a writer . Even when you 're dead , your writing is out there somewhere and it might get buried , but it 's out there and someone might remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it or at least know it 's out there , and know of you . I do n't want to be remembered because I wrote a " classic " or anything ; I do n't want to be like Sylvia Plath or someone else . I just want my writing to be out there when I die so there 's a sliver of hope that I 'm remembered when I 'm gone and my loved ones are no longer around to talk about me . But I 'm also an idealist so I 'm not sure how realistic that might be . <p> But truthfully , deep down , I still believe we 're all eventually forgotten . As the years go by , I think the memory will be too buried underneath everything else to truly exist . I think one day , William Shakespeare and Sylvia Plath and H.P. Lovecraft will be forgotten underneath the memories of more recent authors . So even though we remember them now , decades later , that does n't mean we always will " we 'll stop hearing about them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject ; their wording and writing style will be outdated and pointless to teach and they 'll fade away , replaced by other authors . Books like To Kill a Mockingbird and Catcher in the Rye will all eventually be forgotten . It 'll take a long time , but it 's going to happen . Authors from our times will be the new classic writers ; books we read and adored when we were teenagers will be taught to teenagers many generations from now instead of Shakespeare or Plath or Robert Frost because the language will die and no longer be appreciated , therefore no longer taught . And like everything else , it 'll be forgotten . <p> So I 'm not sure what to believe . It 's been decades and decades since some of what we consider " classics " were written and they 're still remembered , but for how much longer ? It ca n't be forever ; nothing lasts forever . I think writing keeps us alive longer than we can possibly be physically . The idealist and romantic in me wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , but the pessimistic ( and possibly realistic ) side of me knows we 're all forgotten eventually , no matter the footprint we 've left on the world . There 's always going to be someone that does it better , introduces something new , and overthrows what we think will forever be remembered . <p> I think the only thing that 'll ever be remembered are the wars of the world and the destruction we 've caused such as the cities we 've built and the lands we 've ruined because we 're an aggressively controlling and sad species . <p> @ pallidEverything you said is very valid . It will take a very long time , but eventually a lot of those classic writers , musicians , etc. will be forgotten and replaced . Very good point . Really though , nothing lasts forever , like you said
