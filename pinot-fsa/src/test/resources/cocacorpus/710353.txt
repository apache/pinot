It 's easy to get pumped up for that great project , only to fall flat by making some basic mistakes which will automatically rule you out of contention . Creative Commission is here to help you score success and we 're right behind you every step of the way . <p> So we asked our commissioners from major labels and management companies for their top tips to make sure that you avoid the common pitfalls and leave a lasting impression on the people that matter most ... <p> - <p> Do n't take the easy option <p> We know it 's tempting to send out the same application to hundreds of different prospects with a few tweaks here and there , but trust us , commissioners know when you have n't thoroughly understood the brief . <p> Firing off applications and taking shortcuts might appear to speed things up , but hard work and diligent research is the key to success . Read the brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well equipped to explain why and how you will deliver amazing results . <p> Best foot forward <p> You might have an incredible body of work in your portfolio which is sure to impress the commissioner on a project , but if they ca n't find it quickly and easily it will never see the light of day . A simple URL to your website or blog could make or break your chances of winning the commission . <p> Remember , your application is your opportunity to show off your creative skills , investing some time in devising some clever visuals and references to your tone , style and colour will leave a lasting impression . <p> Respect the budget <p> Nobody likes going over budget , so always take into consideration the size of the job before committing to a commission . If you 're expecting -10,000 on a -5000 brief , it 's probably a good time to look elsewhere . <p> Likewise , if you oversell your capacity to deliver the project , then it could come back on you further down the line . Know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bite off more than you can chew . <p> - <p> Know your artist <p> It 's easy to fall into the trap of getting sidetracked by a single piece of work by an artist and not appreciating the full picture . <p> Taking the time to get to know the artist in-depth by digging into their wider body of work - finding out who they have worked with in the past , what their tastes and preferences are - will ultimately pay dividends in the long run . <p> Simple details make a big difference ; referring to a female artist as he ' in your application , or comparing them to someone that does n't fit the bill is a sure fire way to lose a commission . <p> You 'll quickly find that with a broader knowledge of the artist , the task of convincing the commissioner that you are the right person to lead their project becomes a whole lot easier . <p> Do n't delay <p> When you 've found that perfect project , do n't hesitate to respond . Competition is fierce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same boat as you desperate to win the work . <p> Getting in there early puts you ahead of the competition and shows the commissioner that you 're serious . Take too long , and they might lose interest . <p> The commissioner is your friend <p> You , the commissioner and the artist will eventually be a team when you start work on the project . The application is your chance to build good relationships , so take the opportunity to work collaboratively with the commissioner from the get go . <p> Do n't be tempted to go around the commissioner and straight to the artist with your application , and if winning the commission means building up a dialogue , then do n't be shy ! <h> Join CC for free <p> We are not an agency .

So we selected our favourite music-related pieces and asked Suzanne to set the record straight and tell us all about how she struck gold with such incredible polygon art . <p> - <p> ' It all started by wanting to give my brother an unusual gift and decided on doing a portrait of his dog , Maggie , ' she told us . ' I did n't want to just give him a sketch as he 's always been drawn to the more abstract images and I had seen a few examples of polygon art and liked it so decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about 20 hours to finish but worth it when I saw his face when he got the gift ! ' <p> Inspired by the positive reaction , Suzanne began to develop her style by illustrating icons from music and film . <p> ' I start by sketching where the main parts of the face are , so outline the face shape , eyes , nose and mouth in Illustrator using the original as a guide . Then I start filling in the more detailed parts by drawing triangles , the smaller the triangles the more detail I get , and just work outwards from there . ' <p> ' I use a Wacom pen and tablet and Illustrator to draw each triangle by hand , then colour it up there as well using a colour palette I 've made up , either realistic skin tones or going quite abstract . Each portrait takes anywhere from 8-15 hours to do from start to finish , depending on how much detail I want to get . I 've learned to not blink a lot since starting doing these !

Closely followed by my Dolly Parton print , I had n't done many female portraits and Dolly turned out better than I had expected as I was working from a grainy black and white image . I most admire Olly Moss , I think his alternative movie posters and paper cut prints are things of utter beauty .
