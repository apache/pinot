@@59597494 @8597494/ <h> Industry consolidation , and why it 's happening <p> The landscape of our industry has changed drastically in the last five years . Independent dealerships and small auto groups are being eaten up by larger groups left , right and center . <p> But , why is this happening ? <p> How is it going to affect me ? <p> What should I do ? <p> Continue on concerned reader , and all will be revealed ... <p> 1 ) Our industry has changed <p> The reach of the Internet and the way in which it has changed consumer behavior is a big part of this consolidation . <p> The Internet is a complicated and ever evolving challenge , and one that has really shaken the status quo up . Many dealers would rather sell out to a big dealer group than try to adapt to a shifting market that they no longer understand . <p> 2 ) The economy has struggled , and oil has skyrocketed <p> It 's said that in tough times the rich get richer , and the poor get poorer . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get shaky knees and want to pull the ejection cord . This offers a great opportunity to the big groups out there that have the staying power and confidence to get through the tough times . <p> They know that the market will rebound , so they buy stores in times of desperation ( i.e. when our oil prices recently went through the roof ) and reap the rewards the market corrects itself in the months and years to come . <p> 3 ) The first generation dealers are moving on <p> The dealership model is still relatively new in the grand scheme of things , and 90 percent of the dealerships out there were started in the last 40 years . <p> That initial wave of founders are now in their 70 's and beyond . Their priorities are different , and often the appeal of cashing out and providing their families with lifelong financial security is just too great to resist . <p> 4 ) Increasingly competitive <p> There are more dealers than ever before , and dealership advertising budgets are at an all-time high . The glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 10 years ago , having a strong franchise and a reasonable PMA was essentially a license to print money . A dealership would essentially have to try to fail , but this is no longer the case . <p> With the increase in competition from the big groups and better operators , the old-school independent dealers who have been on cruise control for the last 10-40 years are now being forced to reassess the way they run their business . <p> 5 ) Higher operating costs <p> This one is pretty self explanatory . The cost of real estate alone has nearly doubled in most places of Canada over the last 10 years . <p> Everything from the office furniture we use , the software we rely on , to the gas we fill up cars with have escalated in price . Similar to the increase in competition , these higher operating costs force antiquated dealerships to either run a tighter ship or risk slowly sinking into obscurity . <p> 6 ) Economies of scale <p> Medium to large auto groups generally receive a discount in the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( note : if you are part of an auto group and you are not currently negotiating as a group and leveraging that power , you are doing it wrong ) . When most dealers have 10 's of thousands of dollars in monthly costs , a 10-20 percent discount can provide a significant advantage . <p> Final Thoughts <p> - In a sense , what we 're seeing with the automotive industry is just Darwin 's famous theory playing out . The strong are eating the weak , growing stronger and evolving faster . <p> Most dealerships that are being purchased by auto groups are underperformers , often with aging and complacent ownership . The big groups then bring in fresh blood , better processes and modern tools . It 's not uncommon to see an underperforming store completely turn around and double its numbers months after being acquired by a larger group/better operator . <p> Manufacturers award more new dealership locations to medium-large auto groups than to independent and small groups , largely because they believe that the store will do better under the larger umbrella . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's time to take a good look at your business for ways you can improve your operation .

" However , economic factors , notably higher employment , lower gas prices and an improved wealth factor from a healthy stock market and higher housing prices , apparently have made shoppers more comfortable considering a discretionary purchase like a sporty car . " <p> The CPO version of the Audi S4 , the performance sedan based on the A4 , was particularly scarce in June . <p> This model ranked No. 2 on the national scarcity list and No. 1 in the Atlanta , Philadelphia , Dallas-Fort Worth and San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose markets . <p> The CPO Audi S4 was also No. 2 in Los Angeles , No. 3 in New York and No. 4 in Boston on the regional scarcity lists . <p> The CPO model of the Audi S5 performance coupe also made a showing on the national scarcity list , coming in at No.7 .

" They represent an even smaller percentage of Audis certified pre-owned and used inventory . " <p> And supply is definitely lagging demand . <p> Audi continues to become and even more popular luxury brand , " posting dramatic growth on the new-car side for several years , " said Krebs . <p> Krebs also explained that one demographic , in particular , may be turning toward the Audi brand . <p> " In addition , Autotrader studies show Audi is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at certified pre-owned and used as a way to acquire their dream brand , " Krebs said . <p> Subarus sportier models also peppered the scarcity lists , as well , after dominating many of the slots in May . <p> For example , the CPO Subaru WRX was the No. 1 scarcest vehicle last month , and the unit came in at No. 7 nationally on the late-model used list . <p> Other sporty models that remained scarce in June were a number of Porsche models , the Chevrolet Corvette and the Nissan 370z . <p> Krebs also pointed out one fluctuation that may be a sign fall is approaching . <p> " Extremely popular on the new-car side , sport utilities , a category that dominated the scarcity lists during the fall and winter months , also showed up more frequently on the June scarcity list perhaps a harbinger of a change in the season , " Krebs said . <p> For example , the CPO Toyota 4Runner was the No. 4 most scarce vehicle in Atlanta last month ; the used GMC Yukon came in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the CPO Jeep Wrangler notched the No. 3 spot in Dallas Ft-Worth , among others . <p> Click below for the full June CPO and late-model used scarcity lists , provided by Autotrader.

" When a dealer walks in the front door of the new ADESA Chicago auction , he or she might think it looks a lot like home . <p> And that is by design . <p> In designing the front office to the 167,000-square-foot auction in the Chicago suburbs , ADESA visited new-car dealerships throughout its home turf of Indianapolis to get a sense of how those stores were laid out , says Kurt Madvig , the company 's vice president of auction operations . <p> The goal , he said while showing Auto Remarketing the new digs during its grand opening in March , was for the dealer " to feel like he 's coming into his own office . " <p> Aside from floor plan finance and fleet/lease offices that are tucked away ( for legal reasons ) , the front office has a spread-out feel to it , with a fair bit of open space and no long counters . <p> Walking through the front office and then through two pairs of double-doors under a horizontal cityscape image of Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left side of the arena ( from the entrance ) are doors to the outside that can be opened and closed as necessary .

This is designed to avoid the " wind-tunnel effect , " Madvig said . <p> No doubt that will come in handy , mere miles from the broad shoulders of the Windy City . <p> In the lanes themselves , near the blocks , are digital displays with lights , announcements and other bits of information . <p> The point , Madvig said , is to make sure that the dealer in the lane " whether he or she is tech-savvy or not " has the same easy access to information to the person bidding online , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition from the old paper days to digital , " Madvig said . <p> Safety , convenience are paramount <p> In addition to the ADESA-teal on the floor , another color you may notice in the arena is yellow . <p> Pylons in this hue line the lanes and are designed for safety . These steel tubes are filled with concrete , have plastic outer covers and go four feet into the ground , Madvig said . <p> Should a car go off course , this helps to keep it contained within the lane . <p> Another unique part of the facilities : The cafeteria and Internet are smack dab in the middle of the arena , allowing the dealer to " feel like this is the only place they need to be " during the sale , Madvig said . <p> Now , as far as those bright floors , they 're actually an epoxy surface with grit , which is designed to make them anti-slip with all the weather Chicagoland can get , be it rain , snow or ice . <p> Speaking of weather , the exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the entire facility utilizes rolled concrete instead of asphalt . <p> You will also see ADESA Chicago employees with mobile printers , vehicle stickers with bar codes and folks using mobile phone apps to conduct business " all of this with the intention of making the customer 's day quicker and more efficient at the auction . <p> In other words , using technology to take care of the dealer 's needs within the walls of the arena and reduce the cycle time . <p> Meaning they can get back home " and take care of retail business " sooner . <p> Online , in-lane : Best of both worlds <p> Speaking to a crowd at the grand opening , ADESA president and chief executive officer Stephane St-Hilaire emphasized the importance of brick-and-mortar auctions to the company . <p> Building a $40 million facility in the nation 's third-largest metropolitan area is certainly one way to show that . <p> St-Hilaire also emphasized in that speech , however , that ADESA 's online offering is something in which the company places a great deal of importance , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing recently that it will put between $20 million and $25 million into upgrading its online sales platforms over the next three years . <p> This approach of investing in both online and brick-and-mortar was clear at ADESA Chicago , where the " hybrid model " of a physical and Web presence takes center stage as a means to serve the customer . <p> " It 's a reflection of our approach to the market , " St-Hilaire said in an interview with Auto Remarketing at the grand opening . <p> In a news release ahead of the opening , St-Hilaire called ADESA Chicago the company 's " most integrated , customer-centric and technologically advanced physical auction .

@@59597584 @8597584/ <p> IRVINE , Calif . " One of the benefits Auto- Gravity chief marketing officer Serge Vartanov often emphasized during a conversation with Auto Remarketing to discuss the mobile auto financing tool the firm is offering was empowerment . <p> Vartanov discussed empowerment in conttext of keeping dealerships in an important place of the vehicle-delivery process , but also while providing consumers with additional information that traditionally they could not obtain until arriving at the F&amp;I office . <p> " Our belief is if you look at disruptive moments over the past 20 to 25 years , oftentimes when a tech player comes into an industry what they 're innovating is improving on something that lacks convenience or transparency or empowerment of efficiency and choice . We saw that when we talked with dealerships and car shoppers , " Vartanov said . <p> " No matter how much research you do online , you do n't really know until you go into the dealership and you 're taken into the F&amp;I office what your deal is going to be . There 's an anxiety in that experience insofar as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a car shopper . The process really does take quite a bit of time , " he continued . <p> " Our view is we can innovate against that . We can put car shoppers in a position where they 're able to see their indirect finance options that the dealer can also see because they 're the same lenders the dealer works with , " Vartanov went on to say . " If you can empower the consumer with those options , if you can let them know these are the lenders that have approved you , whether you 're super-prime or subprime , the experience for the car shopper , the dealer and even the lender is a lot better and much more robust . " <p> Thus far , it appears AutoGravity is gaining some robust momentum as the company recently announced that it has surpassed 200,000 downloads of its native iOS and Android smartphone apps . The platform allows shoppers in 46 states to obtain up to four finance offers on any make , model and trim of new or used vehicle by following four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lease offers within minutes . <p> " AutoGravity has brought car finance into the digital age , " said Andy Hinrichs , who became AutoGravity 's founder and chief executive officer after decades as an auto finance executive with captives such as Mercedes- Benz Financial Services . <p> " Our industry-leading technology has been embraced by top banks and captive auto lenders , as well as leading dealer groups who see customers shopping on their smartphones every day , " Hinrichs continued in a news release . " We 've re-designed the car finance experience , taking it from hours to minutes for car buyers across the country . " <p> To arrive at this point has been no small task . Vartanov noted that more than half of AutoGravity 's employees are engineers since it took a coordinated effort to design the platform that can communicate with consumers , dealers and finance companies efficiently and securely . <p> " Every lender that joins AutoGravity we pass through a vetting process , " Vartanov said . " Our compliance team meets with the lender 's compliance team . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and security teams . These lenders hold us up to extremely high standards because many of these lenders are large , publicly traded corporations . We 've passed through those screens with flying colors . " <p> Vartanov added later , " That 's critical because if you 're going to be partnering with lenders of this magnitude to be able to offer those indirect lending offers in the marketplace , you have to be at least as secure as the lender and you have to be as mindful of compliance and regulatory concerns as the lender is . " <p> AutoGravity launched its app in California last year . Since that point , Vartanov highlighted the company has developed relationships with fi nance companies up and down the credit spectrum so it can cater to all consumers , who evidently quickly leverage the technology once downloading it to a device . <p> " AutoGravity gives you the peace of mind of seeing multiple indirect offers anytime , anywhere within minutes , " said Vartanov , who pointed out that the average user obtains offers within 10 minutes of downloading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if these shoppers are already on the lot using their smartphones " as recent analysis pointed to that situation happening more often " AutoGravity 's platform could help grease the financing wheels to reduce the time it takes to finalize delivery . <p> " These are financed deals that the dealership participates in . With these indirect offers , the dealer can put them up very easily in their own systems without requiring an additional application from the customer . They 're deals where dealers have participation in the rate , " Vartanov said . <p> " What we heard again and again from dealers is you see car shoppers in the showroom looking at the phone , not necessarily talking to a living human being , " he continued . " What dealers have realized , and this is why they 've embraced AutoGravity , you have to be there on the phone to be relevant and meet those consumer needs . This is true across the credit spectrum . "

" We know those particular types of inventories will climb due to high lease rates , so having an abundance of new inventory will create more pricing pressure for those vehicles .

" You would think in February with the expectations and with respect to seasonality , we all know this is a slow month .

Until we see a meaningful impact on overall inventory levels and days ' supply , it 's going to be a slow ramp back down with incentives . And at this point , we 're still seeing the trend head upward , " Gutierrez went on to say . <p> So if incentives are going to stay high , what 's that trend going to do to dealerships ' used-vehicle prospects ? <p> " With days ' supply where it is and the incentive load at $3,600-plus per unit , there 's most definitely going to be a trickle-down effect impacting the used-car side , " Gutierrez said .

" Really , anywhere that Howard Segal has gone , there have been cars . <p> His job as a youth at the gas station , pumping fuel at age 13 . Following the footsteps of his older brother , the southern New Jersey native then became a mechanic in his late teens . <p> That eventually led to the dealership world , auto finance and remarketing . <p> Even in his personal time , Segal enjoys classic and muscle car restoration as a hobby . <p> " I 'm interested in the auto finance I side , in the remarketing side , the repair side and the sales side . Cars have always been a big part of my life , a big part of my family , as well , " he said . <p> And now the vice president and national remarketing manager for Wells Fargo is our latest National Remarketing Executive of the Year . <p> The award , sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the National Remarketing Conference portion of Used Car Week , but first here 's a bit more about the longtime Wells Fargo executive . <p> Segal has seen it all when it comes to the car business . He worked for a decade in the dealership world , beginning in his early 20 s . Starting off as a mechanic in the service department , Segal advanced from there , eventually becoming a used-car manager . <p> He has been with Wells Fargo since 2003 and held previous remarketing roles with Bank of America and PNC National bank . All told , Segal has been on the remarketing side of the business for more than 20 years , but his experience on the dealership level certainly still helps him today . <p> He said that working in the dealership gave him the chance to experience the sales and service process and learn the organizational parts of the business . <p> " And as far as how it 's helped me leading up to what I do today , its helps me on a communication level with my vendors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good understanding of the process from retail through reconditioning and the sales side , so it 's actually given me a very good , wide vantage point into what I do today . " <p> During his time in remarketing , Segal said the biggest change has been within the technology the industry offers . <p> " Obviously , the technology part of our business has just changed drastically , to how we offer the cars , the speed at which we offer the cars . The detail on the condition report has changed , " Segal said . <p> " I remember condition reports being handwritten , as opposed to what they are today . The vast number and volume of buyers we can reach today that we could n't years ago has just changed tremendously , " he added . <p> Not to mention , information can be accessed considerably more quickly , he said . <p> That said , some fundamentals have remained the same , specifically " how we sell the car , " Segal said . <p> " The car is reconditioned one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time . And the car is offered for sale one car at a time at the auction process , with the bidders in the auction lanes raising their hand . " <p> Segal was quick to point out that " there 's no doubt " to the presence of online bidders , which have " been a big part of our business " for a decade or more . <p> " But how we fundamentally sell the car remains the same , " he said . " A lot of things that surround it have changed drastically . " <p> Some areas that may show even further change in 2016 , at least from the consignor 's vantage point , are used-vehicle volumes , incentives on the new-car side and advancing technology . <p> Segal said he 'll be watching volumes expected to hit the market next year and beyond , particularly on the off-lease and off-rental side , which can pressure value retention . Similarly , Segal is keeping a close watch on new-car incentives and any impact that might have on the wholesale market . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take advantage of alternative sales channels that can help them get their cars to market quicker and to a larger audience . " As a consignor , we need to continually look at those opportunities , as well , because maximizing retention and minimizing expenses is key to everything we do , " Segal said , adding that there may be " additional opportunity " when it comes to new technology available .
