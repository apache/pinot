@@77050486 @5750486/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Maximum effective range of uzi family <p> Last night I competed in a match with a bunch of rifle , pistol and shotgun guys with my Mini Uzi . Most folks were shooting 223 from their carbines and the very first shot of the first stage was a 6 " plate 95 yards out . It took me 5 or 6 shots to nail it but all my shots were close to the target and after running the stage I found myself curious as to exactly what the effective range of a 9mm round ( 124 grain ) would be coming out of the various Uzis . I could not find the info in the Uzitalk library so I 'm asking here . Guns.ru lists the following <p> Fullsize 200m Mini 100m Micro 30m <p> and I have found other varying distances online from a number of websites and I was n't sure what was correct . Has anyone shot their uzi at 200m or more ? <p> I doubt there is a single correct answer . It depends on how you define " effective " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target accurately ? Hitting a 6 " plate accurately ? Stopping a man ? Killing a man ? <p> I was talking to a guy recently who was a German armorer . Based on his experience with new recruits , he said on average a person could hit a man sized taget 7 out of 10 times at 200 meters with an UZI , and 3 out of 10 times with a G3 ( 7.62 NATO ) . The poor showing with the G3 was due to people being afraid of the recoil . So is the UZI or the G3 more effective at 200 yards ? <p> Looking for the definitive reference book on UZI history and technical information ? Check out my book The UZI Submachine Gun Examined . Details to order a copy are here . <p> Well , I took the same shot last night as well with the L34 and danced around that target 5 times before I hit it . ( and so did the vast majority of people shooting 223 ) " Effective " range of the L34 is 75 yds give or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressor books ) It still comes down to ( in my opinion ) the operator being able to make the shot . Getting a hit in the head/brain stem/ heart/throat are vital areas and I do believe that the 9mm would do that at 200 meters . The question is can you make the shot ? BTW it was fun hitting that target at that distance . Its shows again that the open bolt vs closed bolt is a flawed argument . <p> No , but I 'm about to - next time out at the range . Of course , I 'm shooting a IMI B SA with the 16 " barrel . I was laying em in at 100-yards not too long ago . In fact , the first few clips I shot , I was purposely aiming high and ended up grouping at the upper portion of the cardboard . Once I realized this , I began firing from a " normal " benchrest position with the post dead center and grouped dead-on . My next time out , I 'm going to go for 200 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try both ranges again with 10 " . <p> I have been able to test my IMI model B at our local 300 yard range . It is a semi auto with a 16 ' ' barrel , I was using 9mm +P 115 gr reloads ( 5.5gr red dot with a 115gr rainer JHP ) . With iorn sights I am able to get 25 of 25 hits on an IPSC target at 100 yards from a prone supported postion . At 150 yards I dropped to 17 of 25 hits and at 200 yards I dropped to 11 of 25 hits , at 100yards it would group in the A and B zone , at 150 I had a few A hits and most of the rounds going into the B and C zone . At 200 yards it was mainly C zone hits and a few in the B zone with no clear pattern or grouping . At 300yards I hit the target stand once with a skipped round and busted the support . Now with an AR ... , but I still love the Uzi ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice report Ed thank you ! I agree with you on the 200m range Dave , do you know what IMI considered the effective ranges ? Did they publish them anywhere ? I ca n't seem to find any official listing but I 'm sure there must be one since they had to put together some fact sheets when they were selling them to other countries .

@@77050488 @5750488/ <p> Extensive world-wide use of the UZI submachine gun has assured it a place , perhaps even a reverence , in the annals of small arms history . Indeed , this gun bearing its inventors nickname ( and that of SWATs German Shepherd mascot UZI ! ) has during its career thus far seen service in one capacity or another with almost everyones military or police forces . Even the prestigious U.S. Secret Service utilizes it to guard government officials , including the President of the United States . <p> Yet , nothing is so perfect that it can not bear improvement or mutation into a " family " or arms and so is the case with the UZI . Israel Military Industries and the U.S. based importer , Action Arms , are now offering to military and police agencies , as well as licensed Class 3 dealers , a " chapped and channeled " version of the UZI . Known simply as the " Mini-UZI " , the new gun retains all of the positive features of its bigger brother and , as well , sports a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development of the Mini-UZI has existed unofficially for several years and most ordnance-oriented personnel have asked repeatedly the question of " why ? " - why a mini UZI ? What does such a weapon do that a regular UZI can not ? <p> As might be expected , the answer varies , depending upon whom you ask , but my sources in Israel tell me that the primary idea was to utilize the best characteristics of the standard UZI ( with which the Israelis have had well documented success when they used it properly ) in a smaller arm for special operations and " firing port weapon " functions . Even a cursory visual inspection of the gun suggests that it could well fulfill all such applications . Actual field-testing confirms completely the thesis . <p> While overall length ( stocks extended ) of both the " Mini " and standard UZI are within an inch of each other , the mini-version is a good deal shorter with stock folded ( 14.4 inches/36 cm versus 17.9 inches/47 cm ) . The full-sized UZI with fixed wooden stock is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Mini-UZI . The standard UZI folding stock leaves a great deal to be desired in that consistent , comfortable stock-welds are a virtual impossibility , a problem the fixed-stock versions do not share . But to obtain decent sighting at speed , one has up to now been forced to accept the increased length and bulk of the fixed-stock gun . When you are crammed into an armored personnel carrier or aircraft with a full compliment of men and personal equipment , this becomes a major headache ! The new Mini-UZI solves the problem by providing decreased bulk and length without sacrificing the superiority of the old fixed buttstock . <p> It is able to accomplish this by incorporating an excellent hinge design that precludes " wobble " when the stock is extended and a stock itself that is constructed of heavy steel rod and designed to force a proper stock-weld for shoulder-fire applications . Good show ! <p> The " hands-find-hands " magazine release , grip safety , actuator ratchet and selector switch of the original UZI have been retained . I find the mag release , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffness and pronounced edges of the selector switch are an impossible combination to master . Naturally , one can modify it to allow manipulation with less " oomph " required and polish off the edges , but it would be nice if the factory would perform these important functions because they are universally important to everyone , regardless of his mission . <p> Those who have UZIs ( and this includes me ) say that the 500 rpm cyclic rate is a dream and does not require manipulation of the selector switch to get single shots . Yep , that is indeed true - of the standard UZI . The new Mini-UZI is a first-class " rip snorter " in that its cyclic rate is in excess of 1,000 rpm , 1,200 rpm being the case with mine . Simple trigger manipulation , although both good technique and logistically sound , just wo n't suffice with a cyclic rate this high . This is why the stiffness of and edges on the selector switch are serious criticisms . <p> New to the Mini-UZI are a front sight that uses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaded post with lock-ring prevalent on the standard model . Also present is an adjustable rear sight that uses the same improved ( read that simpler , smaller and flatter ) adjustment tool as the front sight instead of a bulkier front sight tool and a screwdriver as required on the standard gun . Again - bravo ! A further improvement should be to arrange adjustment of both front and rear sight without tools of any kind . Accomplishment of this would really put the gun miles ahead and let 's hope such an improvement will be forthcoming in the not-too-distant future . <p> Also new is a two-vent muzzle brake for the obvious purpose of assisting in full-auto control of the weapon . As the action photography included with this text reveals , the brake is , at best , minimally effective and , in my opinion , should be abandoned and replaced with suppressor threads to allow the possibility of an additional category of potential applications . Clearly , the high cyclic rate of the Mini-UZI , along with its compactness , illustrate the intent of its builders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitted with soundsuppressor threads , the " mini " could strongly rival the Ingram M-10 and 11 for such roles . <p> Assembly/disassembly procedures for the new gun are the same as its parent and demonstrate the same ruggedness and simplicity of the fullsized gun . <p> Shoulder employment of the Mini-UZI produced substantially superior results , both on the range and in the field , to those produced by the regular UZI , but close-range full-auto work proved to be more difficult due to the tremendously high cyclic rate and sharp angle of the grip in relation to the gun 's receiver . On the other hand , a bit of familiarization helped a lot to reduce the problem and , if one views the picture from a truly objective standpoint , the target was still shot to ribbons , even if it did shoot up a bit more ammunition in the process ! Thus , perhaps the problem is more theoretical than real . <p> Also interesting was that in spite of the somewhat flimsy appearance of the buttstock , both underarm and shoulder work was easily facilitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still efficient . This , too , is an important disclosure that the gun 's designers were paying attention . <p> All in all , the new Mini-UZI is an interesting gun that shows considerable versatility and the potential to completely replace altogether its big brother , the standard UZI . I make no secret of the fact that I like the UZI SMG very much , for it has earned my respect by virtue of a battlefield performance record that rivals even the venerable Thompson and MP-40 . Few arms approach , much less achieve , this level of notoriety and the fact that the UZI has done so speaks more or less for itself . I feel that the Mini-UZI is thus a fitting successor to the standard version and will " stand tall " among its competitors for years to come . A " slobs weapon " ? Hardly . <p> My only other criticism is that I wish its cyclic rate was in the same range as the full-sized UZI , for this would preclude entirely manipulation of the safety/selector switch ; an ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , important . Other than this and previously mentioned comments , I give the Mini-UZI a clean bill of health . <p> With submachine guns returning to popularity previously unheard of during the last three decades , the Mini-UZI will continue to proliferate in the hands of both the " good guys " and " bad guys " alike . The man who knows how to use this weapon is a serious force to be reckoned with and should be treated with great caution and tactical respect .

The application fee is $200 and it 's good for 3 years , it costs $90 to renew every three years . You have to get fingerprinted , photographed and fill out the Form 7 package . A BATF compliance officer will pay you a visit and inspect your business location .

Once BATF cashes your check , you can deal in NFA weapons , your EIN will become your NFA SOT number . This is what is known as a Class 3 NFA dealer . <p> Now you can apply for a type 07 license , this is a license to manufacture weapons . It is $150 per 3 years , you will have to pay a similar SOT to manufacture NFA weapons , State Department fee ( $700 per year ) , excise tax on each weapon made and one other fee if I recall . This is what is known as a Class 2 manufacturer .

You will also need a address for your business . If it is the same address as your residence , your residence ( or a portion of it ) is open for the annual BATF inspections . <p> Can I make a semi-auto UZI myself ? <p> Yes , you can make a semi-auto UZI yourself , but the first question you should ask yourself is " Why ? " . At the moment Vector Arms is selling semi-auto UZIs for a very reasonable price and it 's unlikely you could save much money building one yourself . The reason the build cost is high is that you must use proper semi-auto parts . The inexpensive UZI SMG parts kits are of little value to a semi-auto builder . If cost is the reason for building it yourself , you should re-evaluate your decision . However , if you want to build an UZI just for the enjoyment of doing it yourself , then you can legally do it subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own personal use . Note that since an UZI is classified as a non-sporting arm , you can not use more than 10 imported parts or it would be considered a foreign assault weapon , which were banned from import to the US in 1989 . For information on parts counts , check the Norinco conversion article in the library here . <p> Can I make a semi-auto UZI from an SMG parts kit ? <p> Not really . There are very few parts from a parts kit that can be used in a semi-auto UZI . The barrel is too short unless you register your gun as a Short Barreled Rifle ( SBR ) . The quick detach wood stock ca n't be used unless you get a barrel about 18 " long or you swap the hardware on the stock so it 's not quick detach . To use the grip assembly you 'll need to weld a block in the front of it so the selector ca n't be moved to the full auto position . The full auto open bolt can not be used without major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have to be slotted to match up with the blocking bar that has to be welded to the inside of the semi-auto receiver that you 'll have to buy or manufacture . You also need to make sure you have the required number of American parts . <p> Where can I get a barrel for my SBR UZI ? <p> Once you have an approved form 1 , you can put a short barrel on your UZI . You have a few choices on where to obtain a short barrel . You can take the long barrel that came on your semi-auto and cut it down to the desired length . However , if you have an original IMI semi-auto , the barrel should be serial numbered to the receiver so you may want to leave that barrel original . You could buy another long carbine barrel and cut it down to the appropriate length . Or you could buy a 10.2 " SMG barrel and modify it to work in your receiver . That will require you to turn down the raised band near the barrel flange so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turn down the chamber end of the barrel so it fits inside the barrel restrictor ring . Anyone with a lathe could do this work , or you could find a vendor that does it commercially . The last option is to buy a short barrel already made to fit a semi-auto UZI . In the past , companies like SWD sold short barrels for people doing licensed conversions . Barrels like that are hard to find . <p> Vector Questions : <p> Why are the Vector Receivers marked " Group Industries " ? <p> A company named Group Industries made semi-auto and registered full auto UZI receivers back in the 1980 's Most of the receivers were not assembled into completed firearms before the company went bankrupt in the mid 1990 's . Vector Arms purchased the receivers at auction and used them to build their own UZI 's . Vector usually stamped their own name on the left side of the receiver in addition to the original Group Industries markings . <p> Should I get a Group Industries or IMI receiver when I order a semi-auto Vector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either Group Industries or IMI receivers . The Group Industries receivers were made in the US during the 1980 's . Vector heat treats the Group Industries receivers during the manufacturing process , which should increase their life expectancy . The downside is that the heat treating can warp the receivers , requiring some straightening during manufacture , and the receivers are harder to weld in the future if repairs are needed . The IMI receivers are original Israeli receivers made in the 1980 's and are not heat treated . They have the original IMI stampings on the receiver , giving them a more authentic look . Which one is better ? There really is no wrong choice . Both receivers are well made and should give a life time of shooting in a semi-auto . <p> Shooting your UZI : <p> What kind of ammo should I use in my UZI ? <p> UZIs like hot ammo . It takes a fair amount of energy to move the heavy bolt and recoil spring in an UZI. +P and +P+ ammo work well and are safe to use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9mm pistols that most commercial ammo is designed for . One common option that people use is 115 grain FMJ Winchester White box that is sold in 100 round value packs at Wal-Mart stores around the US . Although it 's not very hot ammo , it 's hot enough and a cheap source of readily available ammo . Because of the powder used in the Winchester White box ammo , it is not recommended for use with a suppressor . ( Unburned powder collects in the suppressor . ) For best results with a suppressor , you 'll want to use subsonic ammo , which typically uses 147 grain bullets or heavier in 9mm . <p> How accurate is a semi-auto UZI with a 16 " barrel ? <p> The 9mm cartridge is n't designed for long range use but people commonly ask how accurate an UZI is at 100 yards - especially a semi-auto UZI with a 16 " barrel . The answer is : quite accurate ! Shooting from a bench , UZI Talk members have reported 4 " groups at 100 yards and regularly hitting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievable challenge . <p> Parts Questions : <p> Can I use an SMG top cover on my semi-auto UZI ? <p> Yes , but you have to modify the top cover slightly . Used top covers from UZI machine guns are plentiful and cheap , and people like to use them on semi-auto UZIs to keep their original top cover looking nice . The SMG top covers typically have a ratchet mechanism that works as a safety device on open bolt guns . The problem is that when you put the top cover on a closed bolt semi-auto UZI , you can not pull the bolt back far enough to release the safety ratchet and therefore you ca n't cock the gun . The solution is to remove the ratchet pawl on the underside of the cover and disable the top cover safety , which is not needed on a closed bolt gun anyway .

One I am looking at is a new Vector Arms full size . I have heard several people say they are out of business now .

I have the Vector on hold for pickup tomorrow , but I think I 'll get the IMI now instead . Must be all the good reviews I read on the Vector pertains to there earlier models . <p> I had wondered if Vector was still around . Last I heard they had a pretty minimal staff . <p> I have one that was assembled around 2014 . It seems finicky with ammo . If you run a hotter spec Winchester NATO 124g ammo , usually I do n't have any problems , but weaker 9mm and I 'll get a jam every magazine . <p> I think part of the problem and I see this with my Suomi M31 as well , is that these designs were originally open bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed bolt designs and you need enough oomph to kick the big heavy bolt back and bring it back into battery while feeding another round . <p> Right now I 'm on the fence as to what to do with this gun . Originally I was looking to SBR it , but I du n no . It is a crowd pleaser though for friends and family at my range . <p> I contacted one of the Vector Arms distributors today and this is what they said : <p> Hi , they are not closing down . Quality is as good as ever . The bankruptcy had nothing to do with money but instead was to keep the old owner from trying to steal back the company . Like I said , they cant build them fast enough to service the demand I have for them . They do not need to be sent back as long as you break them in . They are built to very tight specs and if you do n't  at least run 300 rounds through them they sometimes act up a bit . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grip safety or they can run poorly . This is true of any UZI . <p> I own both Vector and IMI . IMI hands down . Vector shoots fine , tolerances and fit are awful . Parkerizing good .

With the Vector you can order them and Atlantic Firearms had it to my FFL within 36 hours of ordering . <p> The other option is the Centurys but I looked at one of those in person and felt the Vector was worth the extra money .

@@77050496 @5750496/ <p> Officially created on May 15 , 1948 , the modern nation of Israel was immediately attacked by its Arab neighbors . Israels ill-equipped army defended itself with any weapons that were available . STEns , MP40s , Enfields and Mausers were widely employed . The lives of many Israeli soldiers were lost unnecessarily due to insufficient and non-standardized weapons . To rectify the situation , soon after securing a shaky cease fire , the Israelis sought to manufacture standardized weapons within their own borders . Instead of adopting a submachine gun with a proven design , such as a STEn or a Madsen M1946 ( or M50 ) , a new subgun , designed by Uziel Gal , was chosen . Though Uziel Gals submachine gun was new , there was nothing original in its design . To quickly arm his new nation , Gal copied the innovative features of two modern Czechoslovakian subguns , the ZK 476 and M23/25 . <p> The First Example of A Third Generation Subgun <p> Designed by Josef and Frantisek Koucky , the Czechoslovakian The ZK 476 represents an historic marker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate every feature that defines a classic third generation subgun . ( For a detailed description of the generations of subguns , see Small Arms Review Volume 2 , Number 1 . Back issues are available from Moose Lake Publishing . ) <p> Second and third generation subguns share one basic design characteristic . Both generations were designed for quick and inexpensive production . Low cost production methods are the first characteristic of a third generation subgun . The ZK 476 combined the second generations simplified manufacturing techniques with two new design innovations and created another class of subgun.The third generation . <p> The Telescoping Bolt <p> The first major innovation of the Czech ZK 476 was its use of a telescoping bolt . Not original to the ZK 476 , this type of bolt was first used on an earlier Koucky subgun , the ZK 467 . Firing from a closed bolt and looking much like a carbine or a Beretta M38a subgun , the ZK 467s hollow telescoping bolt partially surrounded the barrel when closed . This advanced bolt design allowed a shorter overall length . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of ignition , the hollow bolt places a thick metal shield between the cartridge and the shooters face . In view of the dubious quality of some imported 9mm ammo , this is an important consideration . <p> The Kouckys may not have invented the ZK 467s telescoping bolt though . Some authorities believe that Vaclav Holek , another Czech designer , invented it during the WW II German occupation of Czechoslovakia . Another report states that as early as 1945 , the British were experimenting with a telescoping bolt subgun . Neither claim for a telescoping bolt that preceded the ZK 467s can be verified . No examples exist to support these claims . The Koucky ZK 467 is the first confirmed example of a subgun to use this new , innovative type of bolt . <p> The Second Innovation of a Third Generation Subgun <p> Though in the 1930s a few Colt 1911 pistols were converted to full auto , the Koucky ZK 476 was the first true subgun to have a centrally located pistol grip containing a magazine well . The **28;0;TOOLONG is the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes reloading much easier , especially at night . " Hand finds hand , " is a natural ability . <p> Having a centrally located pistol grip has a second benefit . The ZK 476 , the UZI and all well designed third generation subguns are well balanced . Emergency one-handed firing is less difficult with a well-balanced third generation subgun . <p> The combination of a telescoping bolt and a **27;30;TOOLONG was the breakthrough that allowed the Koucky ZK 476 to be very compact while retaining its eight inch barrel . Much copied by others , the ZK 476s simplified construction methods , its **27;59;TOOLONG and its telescoping bolt make it , unquestionably , the first example of a third generation subgun . <p> A bit of trivia here from THE WORLDS SUBMACHINE GUNS . " . the first subgun to balance at its pistol grip was not the ZK 476 , it was the 1941 Australian Owen . " Technically , this broad claim is not quite correct . Though heavy , a Thompson subgun with a twenty round ( XX ) magazine does balance at its pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " drum magazine however , it does not . <p> Unlike the ZK 476 , the Australian Owen was not a third generation subgun . Neither was it a second generation . Made with much skilled labor and machine tool time , like a Thompson , the Owen was a first generation subgun . <p> Like a second generation subguns , the Owens receiver was made from extruded steel tubing . Nearly every other part however , was made on a milling machine from a solid bar of steel . This required the labor of a skilled craftsman . Even the Owens extruded tubing receiver was labor intensive to complete . The magazine well and the release pin housing for the quick-detachable barrel were welded to the receiver . The welds were then polished so smoothly that the mag well and release pin housing appear be seamless parts of the receiver . <p> Only the Owens lack of wooden furniture made it appear to be a second generation subgun . Later model Owens did have wood inserts in their steel stocks . The Owens pistol grip has no magazine well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subguns point of balance . <p> More Shared Features <p> Koucky ZK 476s and UZIs have ambidextrous cocking knobs on top of their receivers and grip safeties . Both fire from an unlocked , open bolt . Both UZIs and ZK 476s have advanced ignition . This feature has the effect of softening the recoil and enhancing controllability while allowing the subgun to weigh less . In full auto , an UZI will consistently shoot smaller two and three-shot groups than will a closed bolt H&amp;K MP5 . To approach the controllability of an UZI , an MP5 must have an efficient muzzle brake or suppressor . <p> Advanced Ignition 101 <p> The advanced ignition principle is quite simple . It requires no extra parts . An advanced ignition open bolt subguns chamber depth is made a few thousands of an inch shorter than the cartridge cases length . This causes the forward moving bolts fixed firing pin to ignite the primer a moment before the bolt strikes the chamber face . As the recoiling cartridge case begins pushing rearward , it meets the resistance of the forward-moving bolt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reversed and the cartridges felt recoil is reduced . The use of advanced ignition makes the firing cycle seem smoother to the operator . <p> Advanced ignition also enhances controllability by reducing the subguns muzzle climb. The heavy telescoping bolts center of mass is moving forward of the subguns center of gravity ( CG ) at the point of cartridge ignition . The inertial action of the telescoping bolt , pushes the advanced ignition subguns muzzle forward and down , thereby reducing felt recoil and countering the recoiling cartridges attempt to make the muzzle climb. If the subgun designer has done his job well , the two opposing forces cancel each other and the subgun is very easy to control in full auto . <p> Finally , the inertia of an advanced ignition subguns forward moving bolt must be overcome by the recoiling cartridge case . This allows the weight of the bolt to be reduced , decreasing the subguns weight . <p> The First Subgun With a Grip Safety <p> The Koucky ZK 476 has a shooting-hand activated grip safety . It may be the first of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1911 Colt pistols . This is not certain however . The French M.A.S . C1 subgun also has a shooting-hand activated grip safety . Both the French C1 and Czech ZK 476 were developed during the same time period . <p> To be technically correct , it must be mentioned that the 1945 Italian TZ-45 was the first subgun to have a grip safety . The TZ-45s grip safety is activated by the non-shooting hand though . It is very similar to the grip safeties of the more familiar Madsen M1946 and M50 . ( See " The Madsen M50 " in Small Arms Review Volume 2 , Number 2 ) <p> Czech Models 23 &amp; 25 <p> Manufacturing records are incomplete , but it appears that only a few Czech ZK 476s were made . Only two examples are known to exist today . The first subguns of the third generation to be manufactured in significant quantities were the Czech Models 23 and 25 . Resembling the soon-to-be-produced UZI , both models were identical , except that the Model 23 had a fixed wood stock and the Model 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 476 or the UZI that followed it , the Czech models 23 and 25 lacked a grip safety . <p> Said to have been designed by Vaclav Holek , production of Model 23 and 25 subguns began in 1949 at the Ceskoslovenska Zbronka ( CZ ) factory in Uhersky Brod . Over 100,000 of the two models were manufactured before their production ended in 1952 , just as UZI production was beginning . <p> The Model 23/25s magazine was original . Though its double-column , two-position feed method had been used previously , Holeks Model 23/25 subgun was the first to have a magazine with a semi-triangular ( wedge ) plan form . Instead of two parallel columns of ammo , the M23/25s semi-triangular magazine angled the cartridges toward the center . This enhanced feeding reliability . Soon after the M23/25 was introduced , a very similar 36 round magazine for the Swedish K appeared . <p> The CZ 23/25 had one useful feature that Uziel Gal chose to ignore . A stripper clip guide was attached to the right side of the subguns fore grip . A 32 round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the built-in guide . <p> To avoid confusion , the CZ models 24 and 26 must be mentioned . Models 23 and 25 Czech subguns were chambered for 9X19mm ammo . Models 24 and 26 were chambered for the more powerful Russian 7.62X25mm round . Like the Models 23 and 25 , the only difference between the Models 24 and 26 were their fixed wood and metal folding stocks . <p> Gals Simplifications <p> Though Uziel Gal originated no new innovations when he designed the subgun that bears his name , his design did simplify the manufacturing process . The receivers of Czech Models 23 and 25 are made from extruded tubing . Though the tube is simple to make , precise machine work is required to cut the required holes for the magazine well , the ejection port and the slots for the cocking knob and the sear . <p> UZI receivers are simpler , cheaper and faster to manufacture . Like Danish Madsen M50s and STEn MKIIIs , UZI receivers are stamped from flat metal sheets , much like using a cookie cutter to cut cookies from dough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the receiver and make every required hole . This eliminates time consuming , costly machine work . In the final step of the receiver forming operation , the flat stamped receiver sheets are bent around forming dies . This gives them their rectangular shape . <p> Making the stamping and forming dies and then setting up the machinery to manufacture Gals subgun was costly and time consuming . Once the production line was in place though , UZI subguns could be produced rapidly and inexpensively . <p> Gal also simplified the M23/25s ejector . An UZIs ejector is just a simple post. It is riveted to the receiver . The M23/25s ejector is a short rod that is attached to the buffer pad support . Adjacent to the ejector rod is the operating spring guide rod . It is attached to the buffer pad support too . There is a tube-like hole in the M23/25s bolt . The M23/25s ejector rod passes through it . <p> Though not copied by Gal , the M23/25s excellent ejector did not go unnoticed . Gordon Ingram adopted it for his MAC10 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UZI and the British STEn were both born of dire necessity during troubled times . ( For more details , read " Britains Salvation " in Small Arms Review , Volume 1 , Number 3 ) When these subguns were developed , each nation feared that an invasion was eminent . Both nations needed to arm quickly . The urgency necessitated developing a subgun that could be produced quickly and cheaply . Both nations succeeded admirably and created classic subguns . The STEn however , was replaced with a better subgun only eleven years after its birth . Due to its superior qualities , the UZI , unlike the STEn , is still going strong after fifty years . <p> Made of inexpensive stampings like a STEn MKIII , UZIs , in addition to their compactness , exhibit a quality in their design and manufacturing that STEns lack . One example of the UZIs quality is its superior adjustable sights . Another example is the long ridges that are stamped in the sides of the UZIs receiver . Simple to make , their importance is often overlooked . These ridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fouling can accumulate harmlessly between cleanings . This helps to ensure reliability in harsh combat conditions . <p> The first UZIs had wood stocks and either wood or fiber pistol grips and fore ends . Plastic grips and fore ends soon appeared . The earlier wood stocks were two inches longer that the later wood stocks . The folding steel stock , which is almost an UZI trademark today , did not appear until 1960 . Folding stock UZIs were first issued , not to Israeli soldiers , but to the West German ' BundesgrenshutzGrupen ' ( Border Patrol ) , who were the first foreign nationals to adopt the UZI . <p> The UZIs folding metal stock is , arguably , the best folding or retracting stock of any subgun . Due to its central **25;88;TOOLONG , telescoping bolt and folding stock , the UZI is very compact . When the stock is folded , its length is only 17.5 inches . <p> The concept of a folding or retracting stock , however , was not new in 1960 . Hugo Schmeisser applied for a patent on one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its kind either . In his patent application , he stated that folding and retracting stocks were already known and that his application was for an improved retracting stock . <p> Safety/Fire Control Selector <p> An UZI has two safeties . The first is the previously discussed grip safety . The grip safety is automatically engaged if it is not deliberately squeezed . The grip safety prevents an accidental discharge by locking the bolt in either the forward ( at rest ) or rear ( cocked ) position . <p> The grip safety must be squeezed to either cock or to fire an UZI . If loaded , many second generation subguns will fire if they are dropped on their butts . Due to its grip safety , an UZI will not . <p> A manual safety is incorporated into the UZIs fire control selector . The aft position is SAFE . When the manual safety is engaged , even if the grip safety is squeezed , the bolt can not be retracted . Additionally , when the selector is moved to SAFE , a bar moves rearward , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Moving the UZIs selector forward , to the middle position , selects SEMI AUTO and permits the user to cock the subgun if the grip safety is squeezed . The UZIs method of achieving semi auto fire is quite advanced . Many less advanced subguns achieve semi auto fire by moving a tripping lever upward into the path of the bolt . When the trigger is pulled and the bolt moves forward , the bolt strikes the tripping lever , forcing the tripping lever downward . The downward moving tripping lever pivots on a central pin and its rear portion moves upward lifting the sear . After the subgun fires one round , the bolt retracts past the sear . When the operating spring pushes the bolt forward again , the bolt is caught on the uplifted sear . <p> As long as all of the working parts are in order , the tripping lever method of achieving semi auto fire works fine . Unfortunately , the temper of the tripping lever is critical . If it is too soft , it will soon wear out and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it is too hard , the tripping lever may be brittle and break . Fortunately , if the tripping lever breaks , the subguns full auto function is usually unimpaired after the broken portion is removed . The soldier may only be able to fire in full auto , but he will not be without a weapon until it can be repaired properly . <p> Instead of the using the tripping lever method to attain semi auto fire , when set to SEMI AUTO , an UZIs safety bar moves under the pivoting sear release mechanism . When the trigger is pulled , the sear mechanism pivots on the safety bar . A moment after the sear releases the bolt , the pivoting semi auto mechanism releases the sear . The spring-loaded sear pops up quickly to stop the bolt after firing one round . <p> The UZIs most forward selector position is FULL AUTO . In this position , the safety bar is completely out of play. The trigger pulls the sear out of engagement with the bolt and the UZI will fire automatically until either the trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enhancing Improvements <p> Two UZI improvements , adopted about 1960 , made it even safer . Recall that an UZIs manual safety must be set to either SEMI or FULL AUTO and its grip safety squeezed before an UZI can be cocked . In this condition , an UZI is ready to fire . If the shooters hand slips off of the cocking knob while cocking , the bolt can move forward , strip a round from the magazine and fire . To help prevent accidents of this type , the UZIs cocking knob was enlarged . The larger knob provides a surer grasp to help prevent the shooters hand from slipping . <p> A ratchet mechanism was also added to the enlarged UZI cocking knob . If the shooters hand does slip off of the ratcheting cocking knob while cocking , the ratchet will catch the bolt and prevent an accidental discharge ( AD ) . These two innovations are completely contained within the easily removable top-cover . Retrofitting an early model UZI to the new , safer configuration only requires exchanging top-covers . Upgrade time ? Ten seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new triangular magazine , Uziel Gal chose to use a proven Beretta two-column , two-position feed subgun magazine . The Beretta magazine has an interesting history . It is a direct descendant of the magazine that was used on the first pistol caliber machine gun , the Villar Perosa . For more details about this historic magazine read " The Beretta M38 " in Small Arms Review , Volume 3 , Number 11 . <p> Genuine IMI UZI 9mm magazines are available in four capacities , 20 , 25 , 32 and 40 rounds . Some RKIs have stated that UZI 40 round magazines and Beretta 40 round magazines , upon which the UZI magazine is patterned , are unreliable . The author has had no experience with original IMI 40 round UZI magazines . He does have experience though with original Beretta 40 round magazines . In his experience , they have been flawless in a Beretta M38a . At the Spring 2001 Knob Creek Classic Subgun Match , first and second places were won by a wide margin by competitors who were shooting a Beretta M38a and using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can mount a bayonet . Some ask , " Why ? " There actually may be a legitimate use for one , controlling crowds or herding prisoners . <p> Perhaps of more practical value though , is a grenade launching fixture that replaces the UZIs barrel locking nut . Launched by a special grenade launching blank cartridge , an UZI anti-tank grenade is said to be capable of penetrating seven inches of steel armor . <p> A bright spotlight can be attached to the UZIs bayonet mount . Its slim battery compartment serves as a forward pistol grip for the non-shooting hand . A trigger-like switch is located on the fore grip . It activates the spotlight . The switch is spring loaded to the OFF position . <p> IMI makes magazine brackets that allow two UZI magazines to be connected at a ninety degree angle . Their purpose is to assist in making quick magazine changes . The author finds them to be awkward to use but other RKIs like them . The weight of the forward protruding magazine is said to help control the UZIs already minimal muzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to load . No loading tool is necessary . Though unneeded , IMI does sell a combination UZI magazine loading and unloading tool . The magazine loading tool is a cartridge guide that fits the top of the magazine . No stripper clips are used with the tool . Five rounds of loose ammo are stacked vertically into the guide and another UZI magazine is then used to press them into the empty magazine . <p> At the base of the loading tool is an unloading finger. To use it , hold the loaded UZI magazine parallel to the ground with the bullet pointing downward ( primer up ) . Place the finger on the second cartridge and compress the magazine spring until the base of the tool contacts the left and right magazine lips . At this point , the top cartridge will fall from the magazine . While holding the tool firmly against the magazine lips , move it swiftly from side to side . The rest of the cartridges will fall out . <p> Though tedious to describe , using the UZI magazine unloading tool is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unload an UZI magazine the old fashioned way , ... with the trigger . <p> More compact than most previous subguns , in 2001 , UZIs are available in .22LR , .40AE , 9mm and .45acp . Several countries have produced copies of Uziel Gals ubiquitous subgun . These include China ( Norinco ) , Belgium ( FN ) , U.S.A. ( Group Industries and Vector Arms ) , Cuba , and France . The Israeli IMI and Belgian FN UZIs are generally believed to be the best of made of them all . <p> Uziel Gals Opus Magnum <p> In 1963 , Thomas Nelson stated , " ( The UZI is ) a submachine gun which , in design and function , leaves little to be desired . It is now the most widely distributed submachine gun in the Western World .

Of course this is the SHTF scenerio . I personally would n't shoot at a deer at half that range with a good rifle as your vital organ hit probability is very slim , and I wo n't take a shot on an animal if I 'm not assured a good/great chance of a kill . <p> Now on the other hand , if you have a good range finder , can guess the drift of the bullet you 're using in the wind that is blowing at the time , can accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold conditions and can dial your scope to hit a 15 " circle at that range consistanly ....... then I 'd go for it . <p> Jim <p> Last edited by jarhead jim ; 03-02-2008 at 07:03 AM . <p> My anger management classes are pissing me off ! <p> I was Beat by a cute GIRL at the UT6 SMG Match and I did not even get a lousy T-Shirt <p> Most shooters are n't practiced past 100 meters . The cartridge in practiced hands , good loads and good rifle is regularly used in competition at 600 meters with open sights . Heavier bullets like a 220 BT will retain there velocity better and decrease the change due to winddrift . Best results will be obtained using a barrel that is rifled for this projectile . Off the shelf rifles are typically rifled for use with 150-180 gr projectiles . The .338 and larger calibers are much better choices for shooting out past 800 or so because the projectile is still supersonic . One of my favorite long range guns is a 40-65 , using a 409 gr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've shot about 6 or 7 and I have a couple myself . Accuracy @ 300 to 400yds was good , ( I went on an antelope hunt and a friend killed several with one of the " package rifles " ) . They are easy on the pocketbook which would free you up for better glass . Pre 64 M70 Winchesters usually shoot good as well . I have a couple of old Model 740 Remington 's in ' 06 and I have killed a lot of deer with it out to 500 yds and it is a semi auto . 10 round magazines are plentiful for it but I do n't think it would hold up too well if you started shooting 20 or 30 rounds non-stop . <p> thanks guys .. i realize that in SHTF the majority of shots are going to be under 400yds , but itd be nice to know i could do longer shots though if i ever needed to .. deer hunting most likely within 200yds .. however i was just wondering what its max range was .. <p> i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until i came to the problem of not finding any ammo available .. totally rules out that one , what good is having a rifle that you cant shoot ? <p> you can get 30-06 anywhere basically and the surplus is one of the few calibers left that is somewhat affordable . It will also give you an excuse to get a Garand if you do n't already have one and a 1903A3 is an excellent platform for deer huntin or huntin anything else for that matter . <p> You mentioned some interest in the 338 , but fell back for lack of ammo . The Savage 112 300 Win Mag I have will print sub 1 " groups at 250 yards on sandbags with 88 grains of H-870 and a 190 grain Sierra Matchking Hollowpoint bullet . These are handloads with only neck sizing done to them after fireforming in the rifle first . This is the same load that had the world 's record for 1000 yard group for a number of years . Savage makes probably the most accurate out of the box rifle under $600 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to SD to hunt if you think 150 is a long way .

WAY too much for me .. <p> i 'm kinda falling back to the $500 range for a Remngton 700 ADL i saw in an add i got in the mail recently .. it was only listed in 30/06 and had a 22 " rifle-sight barrel and laminated stock , BEAUTIFUL rifle ! <p> MrM4 , i would love to go on out-of-state hunts where the game is bigger than in TX , but i hear out-of-state licenses are ridiculous price-wise .. hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Africa if i ever could .. if a simple turkey hunt gives me a rush , i could n't even begin to imagine the rush given by hunting something like rhino or hippo , even lion .. <p> Dantheman , for specs on the savage , you 'd just have to go Google it cause I could n't tell ya much there as for what they offer . I know the 112 has a larger forend that is rather flat on the bottom for sandbag type shooting , but if a skinny fuck like me can handle it comfortably , someone your size would like it . Mine has a stainless steel fluted barrel and a lamanated stock . But I hit it with several different cans of spraypaint to camoflage it . Plus you can change out the barrels and bolt faces at home if you want to change calibers . All you need are a barrel tightening bushing wrench and fired cases or headspace gauges to headspace your barrel/bolt . <p> Jim <p> My anger management classes are pissing me off ! <p> I was Beat by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even get a lousy T-Shirt <p> thanks jj , i 'll look into that when i get the time , ive been really pre-occupied job hunting lately .. <p> and recoil is NO problem for me whatsoever , in fact , i like it ! i sold a 20ga last year or so because it just did n't  have enough ' umph ' to it , and i really do n't  understand why people think 12ga 's kick too hard .. the only firearms i like that do n't  kick are black rifles .. <p> The Savage 112 is a great value and versatile rifle . The ones manufactured after ' 04 ( ? ) come with the Accu-Trigger , which is user adjustable down to 1.5 lbs . <p> The Remington 710 is nice and serviceable but not a good starting point for a precision rifle . Cast metal parts that are only finished for functional fit . It is Remingtons answer to the Savage " package " deals , rifle and scope combos . <p> The Remington 700 's are the standard in my opinion . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . <p> i would LOVE to go on the UT5 shoot , but i cant say for sure yet .. ive been applying here and there around my general area and hopefully i will get a call back soon , so i can buy alot of ammo for it .. i 'd really like the opportunity to finally shoot a full auto too , as im not fortunate enough to yet have a chance , but i 'm ready to have a big toothy grin for days straight <p> as for the ' boomers ' i have in mind , a Desert Eagle .50 , EAA 10mm , 300WM , 12gauges , either a .480 or 44mag ruger DA .. and i would n't mind touching off a 700nitro express if one ever comes my way , would n't want to own one though .. <p> i stopped by Gander Mountain earlier to get a 1 on 1 look at the remington 30/06 ive been drooling over , the guy said " if only you 'd been here 30min ago , we just sold the last 2 we had to the same guy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO have one of those Golani 's before they 're gone ! ! it 'd look really nice next to my UZI <p> This may give you some idea of what an old war relic is capable of using factory iron sights at measured distances rather than optimistic guesstimates . Our VIMBAR , or Vintage MIlitary Bolt Action Rifle matches make use of as issued guns with no modifications allowed to any part of the gun and NO optics . These are as issued to the troops of the rifle 's country of origin and it 's amazing what the right shooter can do with a cheap surplus gun and ammo . Shots out to 500 yards on steel targets slightly smaller than a man are routine from a prone position and most misses are very close . Dealing with wind and desert mirages at those distances is a challenge , but to answer your question , YES , the 30-06 can be an accurate gun with the right optic , ammo , and practice for both deer and SHTF scenarios out to 600 yards and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets that size and distance without plenty of practice . <p> i want to add more to my ' vintage ' collection as well , thinking about a Remington 03A3 , Enfield No4MkI , Yugo Mauser , German Mauser , Mosin Nagant M91/30 PU , russian SKS just off the top of my head .. all i have in my ' vintage ' collection so far is a P14 enfield , russian M44 , and a Yugo SKS .. but ive got to aquire a Golani , a PTR-91 , and maybe a 2nd AK or UZI or both before i start back up on the vintage collection ..

@@77050507 @5750507/ <p> Action Arms Ltd. has taken the feedback from users of theirs and other sub-guns and from this they have expanded their UZI line to fulfill the demands for a .45 caliber SMG , slower firing rates , and a supercompact , controllable full-auto 9mm pistol . <p> Without getting into caliber debates , it goes without saying there is a demand for a quality .45 sub-gun for both regular law enforcement and special government agencies . At the recent Soldier Of Fortune Combat Arms Exhibition we were immediately halted by the larger hole in the front of an UZI on display . Through conversation with the Action Arms staff we learned they had been listening to the needs of SMG users and have reacted by coming out with their new .45 full-size SMG . We arranged to test the new products from UZI at American Shooters Supply 's state-of-the-art range in Las Vegas , Nevada . <p> .45 CALIBER IN FULL AND SEMIAUTO <p> By the simple exchange of barrel , bolt , and magazine , the selective-fire open bolt models of the standard UZI can be converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only full-auto .45 conversion kits , but we were informed that in early ' 86 kits will be available for the semiauto carbines , too . <p> I found the .45 UZI conversion kit easy to install . The procedure is as simple as pulling the cover , removing the bolt , and unscrewing the barrel . The 9mm parts are replaced with the .45 bolt , barrel and reinstallation of the cover . As the .45 cartridge is much larger in diameter the conversion comes with .45 caliber magazines and due to the larger cartridge size , the .45 magazines hold only 16 rounds . In the near future larger capacity mags will be available . <p> Once we had the conversion , our next step was to fire the gun and I can say that the .45 is a joy to shoot . It 's very controllable due to the weight of the UZI and the slower cyclic rate of the .45 ( 500 RPM ) . We found the accuracy in semiauto was excellent with body hits possible out to 200+ meters . If you have looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to choose . <p> CHOICE OF FIRE RATES FOR THE MINI-UZI <p> The popular Mini-UZI now offers a choice of three firing rates simply by changing the bolt . The Mini weighs 1 3/4 pounds less than the standard UZI and is roughly four inches shorter with the stock folded . The shorter has the options of the standard open bolt at a cyclic rate of 950 RPM , or by changing bolts , the new striker-fired closed bolt will give increased accuracy on semiauto fire and a full-auto rate of 900 RPM , or another optional bolt system , and our favorite , the new heavy open bolt which gives a very controllable 750 RPM firing rate . <p> Our congratulations to Action Arms for some smart moves here , rather than getting tied up in the open vs. closed bolt debate , they have made both systems available and they can be interchanged in seconds . During some of our testing in fact , we changed from open to closed bolt firing , without even leaving our firing position , as a bolt change in an UZI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt out and replacing it with a new one . No adjustments necessary , as the UZI uses a very simple and reliable blow back system of operation . <p> In our limited testing we found that the closed bolt system required a little hotter ammo to function flawlessly . We used 125-grain Remington FMC ammo and we had a few failures to eject . I feel this is due to the second spring required for the striker . We did not have any Samson 9mm +P carbine ammo or other hot submachine gun ammo , but I feel there would be no problems with any of the hotter ammos . <p> In blow back type weapons there are two main ways to control the rate of fire ; one would be to change the recoil spring tension and the other the mass of the bolt . In simple terms , if you increase the weight of the bolt the rate of fire goes down . UZI has approached this concept in an interesting way as they have added weight to the bolt by using tungsten inserts . Tungsten is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding a great deal of weight without making major changes in the basic weapon . By adding 12 ounces of tungsten , the rate of fire was reduced to 750 RPM from the standard 950 RPM . <p> We found controllability increased along with the benefit of more bursts per magazine . When comparing the closed and the open bolt to the heavy open bolt , it was evident that the closed bolt was more accurate on semiauto , but with the open heavy bolt the differences were small at reasonable ranges . <p> MICRO FIREPOWER <p> UZI 's new Micro is awesome firepower in a 9.5-inch overall package . As you may know there has been a semiauto UZI pistol available for some time which was aimed at the civilian market . Now UZI engineers have modified the basic pistol design for full-auto , plus added a folding stock which is a needed addition when the little gun is fired full-auto . At just under four pounds , this compact weapon should find favor with Special Op groups and high risk security personnel . <p> From our testing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 10 meters it was easy to put controlled bursts in any chosen area of the B27 target . The Micro Uzi requires the shooter to concentrate on what he is doing as this weapon is a small , powerful sub-gun and at 1200 RPM will empty the standard 32 round magazine in 1.6 seconds of fire . With a proper stance and trigger control , the Micro Uzi is a very effective weapon for close in , quick response in the hands of a properly trained operator . <p> As with all UZI 's , the Micro is all-steel construction , designed for the most rugged use . One of the features that I have always appreciated on all UZI 's is the grip safety . Some shooters with small hands or with limited strength in their grip may have some difficulty in keeping the grip safety depressed , but the grip safety goes a long way in reducing accidental discharge . <p> From what we observed UZI has been doing its homework to supply state-of-the-art in compact firepower for law enforcement and security agencies . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have produced the Mini UZI , and now added to that we have the Micro and replacement bolts for the Mini and conversion kit for the originals to .45 ACP . We believe that 1986 should be a good year for Action Arms , the exclusive importer in the U.S. of all UZI products .

It is for a .45 H&amp;K USP Compact .

If it 's a sealed unit you 're asking for some pretty horrible maintenance/risk of full-on baffle strikes . I would recommend cutting the outside of the barrel under the slide , and using an adapter that screws on the barrel , fitting flush with the rest of the barrel under the slide that would project to whatever thread pitch you need outside of the weapon . You 'd still get a weapon that does n't have a barrel jetting out the end of it ( when you want to return to factory origonal look while maintaining suppressor longevity - not to mention cut down on the risk of something else going horribly wrong ) . I had this done to my Berretta 87 .22 by Doug Melton at SRT Arms . He cut the barrel down under the slide and made an adapter to fit my pilot suppressor . I can remove the adapter , screw on a thread cover and the weapon is returned to look IDENTICAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H&amp;Ks and the Glocks , your barrel would be so thin at the muzzle/suppressor attachement point that it would make the barrel/suppressor nipple very week if you cut the inside . Cutting the outside allows you to install a thread protector that not only protects the threads from the slide ratcheting , but adds the strength back into the barrel . ALSO if you cut the threads on the inside , you 'd have to use a nipple with outside threads on the suppressor , and this nipple would have to be made so thin as to not too severely impact the bullets flight inside the muzzle of the weapon . The nipple would eventually distort ( under the force the LCD/booster applies + having to support the additional weight of the can ) causing the suppressor to cant severely and potentially blowing up in your face .. not comfortable it more than likely would n't be hazardous beyond a loss of an eye or some stitches ( worst case ) , but your pride and pocket book would take a serious hit reguardless . <p> Inside threads are only good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a reason why almost EVERY suppressor out there uses attachment points on the OUTSIDE of the barrels About 99% of the units mount to an attachment point external to the firearm ( extended barrel or the like ) , however I am sure there have been several people that have tried to make an internal threaded can before . Just do n't  be too surprised if the C2 SOT(s) declines from making a can such as this . The liability to their business and that to your safety is too great . IMHO anyway . <p> About 25 years ago , I used to internally thread barrels of the Walther PPK with a 3/8-24 thread and then use a protruding stud as part of the mount . What I found was that the bullet passing through the coupling stud had issues with propelling gases rushing around the projectile and causing some tippling of the bullet . Bottom line is that there were frequent baffle kisses and poor accuracy . Why not go with a larger thread and a larger bore passage ? SImple answer was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not find a reasonable thread that would work . <p> It became simpler to just turn the OD of the barrel down , externally thread , and then build an adapter.

@@77050513 @5750513/ <p> One of the unique parts of the UZI design is its bolt . The wrap around design allowed the bolt to overlap the barrel 3.75 " on the full sized UZI carbine . That resulted in several advantages : <p> Allowed the UZI to maintain a longer barrel without sacrificing overall length . <p> Permitted the use of a lighter bolt . <p> Gave the gun better balance . <p> Wrapped the bolt around the chamber , making the gun safer . <p> The original UZI was an open bolt design , although closed bolt designs followed in the Mini and Micro as well as semi automatic versions of the UZI . One of the primary differences between the open and closed bolt design is the firing pin . The open bolt has a fixed firing pin that 's an integral piece of the bolt face and causes the round to fire whenever the bolt travels forward to a closed position . The closed bolt design has a floating firing pin that 's attached to a striker assembly . That allows the firing pin to move forward under sear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt design , having an additional recoil spring on the striker assembly , will significantly increase the rate of fire over an open bolt . The closed bolt design is also considered to be more accurate , particularly in semi automatic fire , because the bolt does not move between the time the trigger is pulled and the round is fired . Another difference found in bolts is the bolt face . The bolt face on a full automatic bolt ( either open or closed ) is fully supported , meaning that the rim on the outside of the bolt face goes most of the way around . This rim helps the cartridge case pass over the firing pin as its being stripped out of the magazine . The semi automatic bolt design uses a partially supported rim , where the bottom portion of the rim has been milled flat with the bolt face . Due to the unavailability of closed bolts for the full size UZI SMG , bolt conversions are sometimes done . <p> Another variable found in bolts is their weight , modified to control rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " heavy bolt " for the Mini UZI . It had tungsten inserts to increase the weight of the bolt and thus reduce the rate of fire . The IMI heavy bolt was never available for sale . However , UZI Talk member barrelxchange recently produced Mini UZI heavy bolts and are available in both 9mm/.40S&amp;W and .45ACP . For more information , contact Troy at barrelxchange@aol.com . <p> Another modification is a light bolt for the full size UZI to increase rate of fire . While never a production item , individuals have sometimes modified bolts themselves by milling out section section to reduce the weight . This is a difficult process due to the hardness of the bolts . A much easier way to increase rate of fire is to add a rubber buffer behind the bolt , thus decreasing the bolt 's range of motion . <p> Comparison of 9mm UZI Bolts <p> The bolts for the UZI Carbine , Mini , Micro and Pistol maintain the same width and height but vary in length . Additionally , the bolt for the semi automatic version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing the bolt to pass over the blocking rail that is welded on the inside of the Model A and Model B receiver . Note that it is illegal to cut a slot in the side of a standard SMG bolt in an attempt to use it in a semi automatic UZI . Cutting the slot is considered manufacturing a machine gun and is illegal regardless of whether or not you put it in a gun or even own an UZI . <p> Following is a comparison of several Uzi bolts . This information is provided for identification purposes only . No one should ever try to convert one bolt to a different type . Note that these measurements and weights are taken from individual specimens . They are not factory specs . Weights for the closed bolts are taken without the striker assembly . <p> With the gaining popularity of the .40 S&amp;W for law enforcement use , IMI manufactured a few closed bolts for the Mini UZI in that caliber . <p> Recoil Springs <p> Recoil springs for the different model UZI 's vary . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full automatic and semi automatic . The red pad on the SMG recoil spring holds the back end of the spring in the proper place . The semi automatic spring does not need one because the spring is held in place by the large recoil buffer that 's inserted in the back of the semi receiver . <p> Mini UZI Bolts <p> The full auto version of the Mini UZI bolt has two little " feet " that stick out the front of the bolt while the semi auto version of the Mini UZI does not . Many people wonder just what those little feet do . On a full auto Mini UZI firing from an open bolt , the bolt must start from rest and gain enough momentum to strip the first round from the magazine . To gain that momentum the bolt must sit back from the magazine . Because the sear catches the bolt on the feet that project out the front of the bolt , it causes the bolt to sit farther back in the receiver and thus it can gain more momentum when it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feet slide into when the bolt closes , allowing it to close fully on the chamber . The same effect could be achieved with a longer bolt , but using the feet permits a shorter and lighter gun . The semi automatic Mini fires from a closed bolt and so it 's not a problem . Registered bolts for the Mini UZI are typically full auto bolts with the feet cut off . ( See " Legal Issues " below . ) Because of that , the bolt must be pulled back far enough to make sure it engages the rim of the first round before firing . When the first round is fired , the bolt is already resting on the case instead of striking it with momentum . That can lead to light primer strikes or failure to feeds . <p> Legal Issues <p> Any full auto bolt that can be inserted into an unmodified semi automatic receiver is considered a machine gun . Such a bolt has to be registered as a machine gun or it 's considered an illegal machine gun . Therefore cutting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal ( unless done by a class II dealer to produce a post 1986 machine gun ) because it would allow the bolt to be used in a semi automatic UZI . In the same way , a semi automatic receiver can not be modified to accept a full auto bolt . That would include removing the blocking bar from the inside of a full sized receiver or cutting holes in the trunnion of a Mini UZI to accommodate the feet on a full auto Mini bolt .

IMI manufactured most of their own magazines , but they ocassionally purchased some from other suppliers . Additionally , other manufacturers made magazines for their own UZI production or for aftermarket sales . <p> All magazines that were issues to the Israeli Defense Force ( IDF ) were marked with a star . ( Note : it 's just a star , not the Star of David . ) Magazines that IMI sold for commercial use were stamped with " IMI " . The real problem that confuses the issue is that IMI also sold magazines without any markings on them at all . Some IMI customers preferred not to have Israeli marking on the products they were buying and IMI was more than happy to fulfill their requests .

By eliminating the folded seam , the inside dimensions of the magazine ( front to back ) could be increased . <p> Both of the manufactures licensed by IMI to produce UZIs ( Fabrique Nationale in Belgium and Lyttleton in South Africa ) made their own magazines . Their magazines were made to IMI specs . The FN magazines are generally unmarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa ) magazines either have an " S " tool mark ( " S2 " , " S3 " , ... , " S8 " ) . IMI used FN and Lyttleton as magazine subcontractors and would sometimes add their star or " IMI " mark to the existing marks . This can be seen by looking at the magazines sold by Action Arms in the United States . The magazines came from IMI but some of them have Lyttleton marks on them . You can even see them on one of the Action Arms brochure covers . <p> One final way to help identify UZI magazines is by their finish . Magazines made by IMI , FN or Lyttelton subcontractors either had a parkerized finish ( for military use ) or a painted finish ( for commercial use . ) No 9mm IMI magazines were produced with a blued finish , however the IMI .41AE and .45ACP magazines were blued .. 
@@77050516 @5750516/ <p> In terms of the western world , it has been arguably the most popular and widely used submachine gun of the post World War Two era . <p> The security requirements of the new nation of Israel fostered the creation of this unique , compact , and robust firearm . The necessity for such a weapon came as a result of hard lessons learned by the pioneers who created this state . Their painful and tragic experiences during the war was the aftermath of a failed discipline forsaking armed selfdefense for an entire culture and people . Those who survived the harsh consequences of these utopian ideals lost all illusions about the prospect of reasoning in a civilized way with evil that wished them i 'll ; either as individuals , as a country , or as a people . <p> The gun that came from and is most frequently associated with these hardened survivors is the UZI submachine gun . The UZI was invented by Major Uziel Gal of the Israeli Army a few short years after the nation-state of Israel was created and baptized in birth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelis used any obsolete , but available World War Two surplus small arms in their quest to build a country . However , it quickly became apparent the military forces of Israel needed their own indigenous submachine gun , and in 1951 the UZI appeared . <p> It is a design that has proven so successful that not only can it be found in almost every area of Israeli life , both public and private , it has also been adopted by the military forces of several NATO countries ( Germany calls it the MP-2 ) , the United States Secret Service , as well as any number of police organizations throughout the free world . Even FN Herstal produced a licensed copy of the full size UZI from 1958 to 1971 . <p> Yet , with the increased popularity of competing designs , the UZI is , without question , one of the most successful submachine gun designs of the post-WWII period . <p> The UZI 's most sterling characteristic , and the one that endears itself to any fighting man who has ever used it , is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always . Even in the harshest environments , and the desert regions of the Middle East fall easily into that category . <p> This reputation for reliability is not something that came by chance , but through a superior design . Uziel Gal , now living in the United States , examined many of the submachine gun designs present during the years immediately following the Second World War , but he was attracted to the post-war designs of the Czechoslovakian M23 and M25 submachine guns . <p> Many authorities credit these two guns with being the first to exhibit the recessed bolt that " wraps-around " the barrel and overhangs the rear portion of it . But , the truth of the matter is a Polish engineer named Podsenkowsky , had a few years prior to the Czech guns designed a submachine gun with many of the features of the CZ-23 &amp; CZ-25 for the British government . This submachine gun was called the MCEM 2 and was never officially adopted because of its high rate of fire , but it was probably the first to use an over-hanging bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case , the UZI was not the first to use the combination of characteristics that identify a Third Generation Submachine Gun , but it is undoubtedly the most easily recognized member , and that includes the American designed Ingram MAC-10 . <p> The first feature of a Third Generation Submachine gun is the previously mentioned bolt that allows the use of a longer barrel . <p> The second major feature is the magazine inside the pistol grip . The advantage here is the famous " hand finds hand " reload when the shooter is operating in low light scenarios , due to the increase ease with which the operator can find the magazine well for a quick reload . It also creates a firearm with a more neutral balance as the center of gravity is very near the pistol grip . <p> Many today claim any short barreled , compact carbine is a " submachine gun " . What they ignore is the caliber of the weapon in question and whether or not the firearm is capable of selective or full-auto fire . <p> The UZI is chambered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns in the Western world . It does not fire any of the assault rifle cartridges that are capable of more power and penetration , like the 5.56x45mm round , the 7.62x39mm round , or the i.62x51mm cartridges . <p> This is one of the major distinctions all submachine guns share . They are carbine-like weapons even if they use small folding stocks - firing pistol caliber ammunition , usually one of the four following calibers : 9x19mm , .45 ACP , 7.62x25mm , or .380 ACP . <p> ( NOTE : The semi-auto UZI carbine , that was imported prior to President Bush 's assault rifle ban , is not a machine gun . It is incapable of full-auto fire without extensive modifications and it is also not an assault rifle as it does not fire an assault rifle cartridge . It fires only pistol cartridges of either 9mm Parabellum , .45 ACP or.41 AE caliber . Additionally , it is a difficult firearm to conceal with its legally mandated 16 " barrel . ) Submachine guns are definitely a thing of the past in terms of general military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more powerful and longer ranged rifle ammunition . But , for this very same reason they are especially attractive to police agencies world wide . There are a number of factors that influence this situation . <p> The first is there is less possibility of excessive penetration when pistol caliber weapons are employed , and the penetration in this case is not that experienced with through and through wounds in felonious subjects . but the excessive penetration found when a 7.62 NATO slug tears through an exterior apartment wall , two interior walls , and the thin sac membrane surrounding the heart of an infant asleep in its crib . <p> Secondly , if a police force is already employing 9mm Parabellum handguns , then ammunition supply and logistics is easier and less complicated ; a common round being available for both qualifications and practice . <p> The third reason pistol caliber submachine guns are extremely useful in police applications is the increased flexibility offered by submachine guns . Submachine guns with their lower velocity projectiles ( often at or near the speed of sound ) are easier to silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submachine guns are also easier to master than assault rifles in terms of target proficiency as the muzzle blast is much lower and climb from full-auto bursts more reduced . Additionally , the 9mm ammunition available for training purposes is , as a rule , lower in cost than traditional 5.56x45mm , 7.62x39mm , or 7.62x51mm ammunition . <p> Another reason submachine guns lend themselves to law enforcement applications is the fact , that many models can be had in reduced size versions for easier concealment . This is possible because of their means of operation . <p> Most all pistol caliber full-auto weapons are blow-back operated , and lack the more extensive gas operated locked breech designs found in assault rifles . <p> The Mini-UZI seen here is a prime example of this technology . It is a smaller version of the full-size military UZI . <p> Everyone remembers the picture of the Secret Service Agent standing over the prostrate body of Jim Brady and a uniformed Capital Hill police officer as other Secret Service agents and police officers subdue John Hinckley after his assassination attempt upon President Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But , what few remember about that scene was the empty foam lined briefcase lying in the street , or the fact that the UZI in question had its barrel shortened by an inch , so that it would fit inside that covert carry case . <p> Even with its compact size the standard model UZI is not an easy weapon to carry or conceal in high profile situations and that is why you can find abbreviated versions of many submachine guns , including the UZI . <p> In the mid 1980s I.M.l. introduced two additional reduced size versions of the UZI submachine gun . The first was the Micro-UZI . The Micro-UZI was simply a full-auto version of the UZI pistol , but with the addition of a functional folding shoulder stock and the additional selective fire capability . <p> The second was the model seen here and it has proven popular with certain police agencies . It is the Mini-UZI . <p> Physically , the Mini-UZI differs from the full-size military UZI mainly in size , but there are additional differences that become apparent the instance full-auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same manner as the full size model . The receiver is a heavy gauge steel stamping that has been formed into a rectangular box with indentations in the sides of the receiver . These indentations are intended as dirt traps and aid greatly toward making the UZI one of the more reliable submachine guns in existence today . <p> The full size military UZI fires from an open bolt position . The bolt is basically a large , somewhat heavy chunk of square metal that is spring driven and fills the rear portion of the receiver , while the firing pin ( a bump , actually ) has been machined into the breech face portion of the bolt . <p> It is called an open bolt design , because the chamber area is open when the weapon is cocked and ready to fire . The bolt is held to the rear with only the sear and the intended safety devices preventing it from moving forward and firing the weapon . <p> All the UZI submachine guns feature three separate safety features . The first is the manual safety that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left side of the firearm just above the pistol grip . In fact , both the Mini-UZI and the full size UZI share the same pistol grip/selector assembly . <p> The three position selector has the " Safe " position at the rear , the " Semi-Auto " setting in the middle and the forward most setting is the " Full-Auto " regardless of the language used to indicate the appropriate setting . <p> The second safety is the grip safety that works exactly like the one found on the Government Model 1911 pistol . It must be depressed fully to activate the gun for firing . IMI and Action Arms are both emphatic in their protestations to those who would override this safety device by wrapping the pistol grip with tape . <p> Some so called experts have advised this , but the fact remains these guns are not semi-auto pistols holding a few rounds . They are full-auto machine guns and the grip safety was designed for maximum safety . Never should this safety device be altered in any way , shape , or form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cocking piece in the top cover . This safety was not found on the very first UZI submachine guns and legend has it Uzi Gal designed it after the death of a friend who was shot by his issued UZI when the bolt retracted part way , chambered a round , and then accidentally shot him in the head as the bolt closed home . The ratchet safety on the top cover is designed to prevent the bolt from traveling forward until it is fully cocked . <p> All three of these safeties combine together to make the UZI , the Mini-UZI , and the Micro-UZI among the safest SMGs available today . <p> When the trigger is pulled on an UZI , the sear which holds the bolt against a compressed main spring is released and the bolt travels forward under pressure from the main spring . As the bolt , in its forward motion , travels over the loaded magazine , the top most round is stripped from the magazine and fed into the firing chamber . <p> No sooner is the round chambered than the primer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun fires as a consequence . The force of firing drives the bolt back , to either stay cocked , or repeat the sequence of events for full-auto fire . <p> Obviously this is a motion and momentum filled experience as this heavy mass of metal cycles to and fro inside the receiver , and it is understandable why open-bolt sub-guns are , as a rule , more difficult to control in full-auto fire . <p> A key factor in the full-auto controllability question is the rate of fire and the full-size UZI runs somewhere in the region of 600 to 650 rounds per minute . Some well-used UZIs with tired recoil springs will run slower , but experience has shown the UZI at this rate of firing is controllable in fullauto fire , even with the open bolt operation . Part of the credit must be given to the over hung bolt design . <p> But , competitive submachine guns that feature closed bolt designs are becoming extremely popular because they operate in a manner almost identical to conventional semi-auto carbines , and they feature improved first shot accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a large mass of metal moving forward within the receiver . The problem is , however , none of them are as compact or as concealable as the Mini-UZI . <p> The Mini-UZI is smaller than the full-size model and that reduction in size had to come from somewhere and it came from one specific area - a shortened receiver and a shortened bolt . Shortening the receiver also reduced the bolt travel and shortening the bolt made it lighter . This combination of factors yielded a submachine gun with cyclic rate that is somewhat faster than the original . <p> Of course , that is a little like saying an A-10 Tank Buster can fly and shoot faster than an Iraqi truck driver can , especially if the Iraqi is caught in a traffic jam of loot filled vehicles north of Kuwait City . <p> Pure and simple , the Mini-UZI is a bullet hose . Especially those versions that fire from the closed bolt position . In a move to strike at the competition IMI offers the Mini-UZI with two different modes of fire . Police agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faster closed bolt version . The factory literature lists the open bolt version as having a 950 rpm rate of fire , while the advertised rate for the closed bolt Mini-UZI is 1250 rpm . <p> An associate , who is a licensed dealer of machine guns to police agencies , has two dealer sample Mini-UZIs. both are Closed Bolt versions . He has timed the rate of fire of each with the new computer chip inside in his PACT Timer that measures rate of fire . He uses what he calls really hot , 115 gr ammo , that is well within the +P+ range , and the first gun runs approximately 1300 to 1400 rpm , while the second runs just under 1700 rpm . <p> Clearly , those figures are far from the advertised rate . Yet , he defends the guns by stating the Mini-UZI is controllable , especially the closed bolt version on the first shot , but he also plainly points out the 20 round magazine supplied for increased concealment is good only for two bursts at these speeds ! <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is the way he summarized his opinion of the Mini-UZI . <p> Which points out the second major difference between the Mini-UZI and the full size military model . The Mini-UZI features a swing-out folding stock that latches into position with a tongue and groove mechanism at the rear of the receiver and it is very quick to deploy . It is lighter and quicker than the original , sturdy under-folder found on the full-size guns . <p> Another difference between the guns is the barrel . Of course , the Mini-UZI features a shorter barrel at 7.75 inches , as opposed to the 10.25 inch barrel on the full size model , but the Mini also has two elongated slots cut just behind the muzzle at a 45 degree angle off the perpendicular to the right to act as a rudimentary compensator . Regardless of how efficient or inefficient these cuts may appear , they are needed . <p> Among the Mini-UZI accessories available to police officers is a hip holster made by Gene DeSantis that works exceedingly well , concealing it almost as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of professional looking briefcases built by Action Arms to hold not only the gun , but a supply of loaded magazines . Some companies have offered a shoulder harness for the UZIs , but those who have worn them over long hours complain of fatigue . <p> The availability of semi-auto , Israeli manufactured UZIs was curtailed by President Bush 's import ban of 1989 . Springfield Armory no longer offers for sale either the civilian version or the restricted full-auto UZI . <p> Action Arms is now the U.S. sales rep for the full line of UZI machine guns for law enforcement and they have no plans to sell the semi-auto version . This leaves the used gun market as the only source for the civilian interested in obtaining a legal , Israeli-manufactured , semi-auto UZI . <p> The full-size UZI has earned an enviable position in the world of firearms for its outstanding record of performance . The Mini-UZI continues to maintain that level of performance because of features the operators have come to appreciate like its more concealable size and its reliability . <p> But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the experiences and motivation of those who first needed the UZI . It is easy to see how and why they demanded a gun that worked better than any other . 
@@77050517 @5750517/ <p> On September 11th , 2003 , family and friends gathered at Kibutz Yagur cemetery in Israel . It had been one year since Uzi Gal had been laid to rest there and they came to pay their respects . Uzi 's grave site sits under the pine trees , just at the foot of Mt Carmel . Beside him is his wife Ahuva 's grave and around him are three generations of the Gal family . The grave stones are simple , as is the custom at the Kibutz .

Following is an abridged version of Uzi Gal 's biography that was read at his funeral : <p> Uziel ( Uzi ) Gal was born on 15 December 1923 , as Gothard Glas , to Erich and Miele Glas in Weimar , Germany . His parents divorced when he was young and he grew up mostly with his mother , in a farmhouse filled with antiques , including some old weapons .

After over two years in prison he was pardoned and returned to Yagur in 1946 . <p> During the 1948 war of Independence , Uzi participated in several battles in northern Israel . After the state of Israel was established in May 1948 , he was sent to an officer-training course , and while there , demonstrated the submachine gun prototype he had developed on his own in Yagur . Uzi was sent to work at the Israel Military Industries to continue developing the gun .

@@77050519 @5750519/ <p> A few months ago , Milch Kalter , the affable head of Action Arms , the UZI importer for the United States , made a trip to the West Coast carrying with him two of his fully automatic firearms for the staff of Guns &amp; Ammo to test . Because of legal restrictions , the G&amp;A staff had never had the opportunity to wring out either of the fully automatic arms his company imports , the carbine and the Mini UZI . The Mini UZI , as its name implies , is a snub nosed , wire-stocked version of the standard UZI SMG . In addition , it spews out 9mm slugs at an impressive 900 rounds per minute ! This is a bit much for standard military issue , so this " burp " gun has become standard issue to those behind-the-scenes international government agencies that are seldom mentioned in everyday conversation . Agencies who demand the " bestest and the mostest " as their duties often require them to defend heads of states against terrorists . <p> Civilians , gun writers or not , seldom have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , the G&amp;A staff enjoyed having the opportunity to legally fire a gun that has drastically changed modern warfare . We also compared them to the standard semi-auto UZI carbine that has caught the fancy of many military buffs in the United States . After sending many hundreds of full-auto rounds through both the full-sized SMG and the Mini UZI , as well as a hatful of rounds through the semi-auto carbine , we were impressed ! We found that the educated trigger finger could let off a single round - or a lethal six-to-ten-shot burst , ample proof of the versatility and controllability of this arm . One thing stood out after that day of feeding countless rounds through those UZIs - they were as reliable as a brick . They always worked with any ammunition we fed them . Hollow points , full metal jacket bullets , it did n't matter . We pulled the trigger and the guns went bang - every time ! It was also that same day that Mitch verified for us the rumor we had been aware of for quite some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be introducing a pistol into this country as a companion piece for those shooters who liked the civilian-legal semi-automatic carbine and desired a handgun built along the same lines , and utilizing the same basic action as the bigger arm . <p> Well , now they 've done it , and we had the unique opportunity to put the first production model UZI pistol , serial number 0001 , through its paces . Our conclusion was that it was surprisingly accurate , for a two-fisted pistol , and , like its bigger , full-scale predecessors , reliable as a brick . We fed it Federal hollow point ammo , Samson FMJs - Israeli ammo imported by Action Arms Inc. - and it digested everything without a stutter . We did n't have the chance to try the pistol with lead bullets ; no one on staff had any loaded up at the time , but there 's no reason to think the pistol would be any different from the results we had during a previous test with the semi-auto carbine , and that particular arm had no trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we also found the UZI pistol to group a smidgen tighter than wed expected , although to be sure it is n't a target pistol . Basically , what it is is a plinker , and that 's meant to say the pistol is a gun that 's fun to take out and blaze away with . That 's not all the new pistol is good for , of course ; with its 20 round magazine full to the brim , it would make some serious kind of home defense arm . <p> Primarily , this pistol is nothing more than a blowback operated 9mm handgun . It utilizes a massive breechbolt and two heavy springs to overcome and tame the pressure generated by the 9mm Parabellum cartridge . Normally in a handgun , one would expect to see a pistol utilizing a locked breech , but the UZI is n't a pistol that can be compared to other 9mms on the market . Since its not meant to be carried concealed , and its overall size is greater than most traditional pistols , the weight of the breechblock is n't a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bullet has left the 4 1/2-inch barrel and breech pressure has dropped to zero . The breechblocks rearward movement is halted by the recoil springs , backed up by a plastic or nylon buffer . Upon returning to battery another round is stripped from the magazine and fed into the chamber . <p> Being a semi-automatic , the trigger has to be released and pulled again to fire the newly chambered round . The pistol is available only in semi-auto , and in fact IMI has no plans to make it in any other configuration ; this handgun is meant only for the civilian market . <p> The UZI pistol shares much with its larger brothers . It has a grip safety that must be depressed by the firing hand before the gun will fire . It also has a standard safety that disengages the sear and blocks the trigger , located on the left side of the frame . It shares the same method of loading a new magazine into the magazine well as the full-size SMGs - the hands-to-hands style . With this , the firing hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hands together , the fully loaded magazine slips snugly into place . <p> Like its two older brethren , the new pistol is of modular design . The pistol can be stripped without the use of tools in less than a minute . It breaks down into four major modules ; the breechbolt , pistol grip/fire control assembly , barrel and the frame . This modular design is found in most of todays arms based on military guns in that allows for ease of repair in the field . Also , the average soldier does n't  have to know a great deal about the internal workings of his arm - if something breaks , he only has to remove the faulty module and replace it with a new one . <p> Although not a target pistol , the UZI has fully adjustable sights , the front for elevation and the rear for windage . UZI supplies a sight adjusting tool for both and the sight itself is clever in operation . The post is four-sided , and each side has a white dot on it . Our test gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it took about ten turns to bring the sighting point down to the bullseye . The rear sight uses the same tool for windage corrections . The rear sight is a simple " U " notch with a white dot on each side of the " U " . Lining all three dots up in a horizontal position - the two at the rear and the one of the front sight - gives you a quick and precise battle-sight picture . <p> Although fitted with adjustable sights , as we stated earlier , the gun is n't a target pistol . The primary reason we did n't get good groups could be traced to the trigger . Although the trigger broke with a fairly light seven-pound pull , it was plagued with creep and a great amount of overt ravel . It 's a single stage military trigger , pure and simple , and any accuracy work suffers because of it . However , before you think you could n't hit a bam if you were standing inside , let me assure you this is n't so . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor of G&amp;A , and I were able to fire six-inch , five-shot groups . When you think about it that is n't all bad . And when we set up a silhouette target at 21 feet , all 20 rounds from the magazine went into the " 9 " ring or better during rapid fire , again producing about a six-inch group . Most of the rounds were in a four-inch group inside the " 10 " ring in the best group shot , and that is very good combat accuracy . <p> The UZI is no lightweight , weighing in at 56 ounces , and it certainly is n't a small pistol with dimensions of 6 5/8 inches high , 1 + inches wide and 9.45 inches long . It is , however , more accurate than it has a right to be , and perhaps most of all it 's an UZI , a name steeped in history . The reliability of the pistol should never be a problem . <p> Basically , it 's the same design that has been proven time and time again in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Eastern deserts . <p> The UZI pistol is n't inexpensive , costing $550 , however very few have the heritage this pistol has . Although UZI is a new name when it comes to handguns , it should carve its own niche in the marketplace . Its a natural for those who already own one of the semi-automatic carbines ; its also a natural for the shooter/collector who wants to own a working bit of history .

@@77050520 @5750520/ <p> The UZI is known as a tough , tireless workhorse that never fails . While there 's a lot of truth to that , it needs good care like any other firearm . Out of spec parts or poor maintenance can put your afternoon of fun on hold quickly . Here are some suggestions to consider the next time your workhorse stumbles . Most of these suggestions apply to fully automatic or semiautomatic UZIs but you 'll find that replacement parts for the semiautomatic are harder to find and more expensive so there 's an incentive to repair rather than replace in that case . The three most common problems you 'll run into are failure to fire , failure to eject and failure to feed . <p> Failure to Fire <p> The UZI bolt face , showing unused firing pin ( A ) and the extractor claw ( B ) in the proper position . Note that the extractor rests on the raised rim just below the claw . <p> A failure to fire occurs when the round is fed into the chamber but the primer does n't  detonate . Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are three possible causes for this . First , the open bolt firing pin , which is a small projection milled into the bolt face , may be worn or broken . This is an uncommon cause but if it happens , the firing pin will need to be welded up or the bolt replaced . Surplus bolts are cheap and plentiful so replacement is usually the easiest option . The firing pin on the semiautomatic UZI is pinned to the carrier and can also be replaced if worn . <p> Another cause is excess headspace . If the round does n't  seat firmly in the chamber , the bolt will push the round forward rather than detonate the primer . Excess headspace can be caused by an out of spec chamber but that 's uncommon . A more likely cause is a loose barrel nut . This simple to diagnose , simple to fix problem can easily go unnoticed . With the barrel nut tightened you should not feel any play in the barrel . If the problem is chronic , it might be due to the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut being broken off . Either part can be easily replaced . Remember to depress the barrel nut catch when tightening the barrel nut to reduce wear on both parts . If the problem persists , an easy cure is to put a rubber or copper gasket between the barrel flange and the barrel nut . Another rare cause of excess headspace is broken trunion welds . If the welds that hold the trunion inside the receiver fail , the trunion will slide forward when firing the gun . Rewelding the trunion should be done by a qualified gunsmith . <p> The final cause of failure to fire occurs when the bolt moves forward so slowly that it does n't  hit the primer hard enough to detonate it . This is actually a type of failure to feed and will be discussed later in the article . <p> Broken teeth on the barrel nut will allow the nut to loosen when the gun is fired . <p> If you can hear the clicks while tightening the barrel nut , then you are wearing out the front edge of the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut catch should be held down until the nut is tight . The catch on the left shows wear but the front edge is still square so its serviceable . <p> The barrel trunion is welded to the receiver in two spots on each side . If the welds break , the trunion can slide forward as depicted in the right photo . The left photo shows the proper position of the trunion up against the front of the receiver . <p> Failure to Eject <p> The point of the ejector ( A ) faces forward and strikes the base of the cartridge as the bolt recoils . The rivet head ( B ) can be seen to the side of the ejector . <p> Failure to eject is also known as stovepiping . The first possible cause of failure to eject is weak ammo . The heavy bolt and recoil spring of an UZI require a heavier impulse to operate than a typical 9mm pistol . UMC and Remington green box ammo are notoriously weak and can cause failures to eject . If the empty cases are not ejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If ammo is n't the problem , take a look at the ejector . It should be level , tight and pointing straight forward . Its riveted to the bottom of the receiver and if it gets loose it wont firmly strike the back of the fired case as the bolt recoils reward . To tighten a loose ejector , remove the grip frame from the gun , exposing the bottom of the rivet . With the top cover and bolt removed , turn the gun over and rest the head of the rivet on a support , then hammer the bottom of the rivet until the ejector is tight . Once its tight , install the bolt without the recoil spring and push the bolt forward and backward by hand . It should pass over the ejector without hitting it . Performing this check with the barrel and stock removed will give you a better view of the ejector clearance . <p> To secure a loose ejector , turn the receiver upside down and support the rivet head . A bolt held in a vise makes a suitable support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rivet until the ejector is tight . <p> If ejection problems persist , its time to check the extractor , which is the leading cause of failures to eject . The extractor must firmly grip the case as the empty round strikes the ejector in order to generate the energy needed to flip the case out of the gun . Remove and clean the extractor , particularly under the claw . Residue buildup under the extractor claw will prevent it from firmly gripping the case rim . Also clean the bolt hole that the extractor sits in . A .22 caliber cleaning swab works nicely for this . Residue in the hole will prevent the extractor from flexing properly . Before reassembling , be sure that you have the correct extractor in the gun . 9mm extractors are unmarked while the .45ACP extractors are stamped " 45 " near the back . They are not interchangeable . For best results its also best not to mix up semiautomatic and fully automatic extractors.The lower point of the extractor claw is removed on the semiautomatic extractor to facilitate feeding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the back of the bolt . Line up the long slot on the back of the ejector with the arrow on the back of the bolt . Reinsert the extractor retaining pin from the left side of the bolt . Using a small screwdriver , try to push the extractor claw sideways . It should require firm pressure but move freely . If there 's no tension on it , the extractor will have to be removed again and bent slightly . If nothing else seems to help , replace the extractor . <p> To remove the extractor , push the extractor retaining pin out and then push the extractor out from the front side of the bolt . <p> The semiautomatic extractor ( left ) has one corner of the claw removed . This ensures reliable feeding as the case rim slides up the bolt face . Cases do not slide up the bolt face on fully automatic bolts because the lower lip of the bolt lifts the case rim over the extractor . The rim snaps under the extractor as the bolt closes . <p> Failure to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many potential causes . A failure to feed occurs when the bolt can not forcefully strip the round from the magazine and push it into the barrel chamber . The problems fall into three categories : bad recoil spring , excess friction on the bolt , or misalignment of the guns components . <p> A weak recoil spring wont impart enough energy on the bolt for it to feed a round properly . Recoil springs can get weak with use and its good to have a spare on hand , but its not a common problem . A more common cause of a spring related failure is aftermarket springs that do n't  meet factory specs . Surplus IMI springs are cheap and plentiful so you should replace it at any sign of problems . The entire spring and recoil rod assembly should be replaced as a single piece . <p> A much more common cause of failure to feed is excess friction on the bolt and that can come from several sources . The first thing to check is the gap between the bolt and the top cover . Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure the gap . It should be between .005 inches and .015 inches ; preferable about .010 inches . If the gap is too small , the top cover will need to be bent to give more clearance . You do n't  need any fancy equipment to bend a top cover ; just a little patience and ordinary hand tools . The easiest approach is to flip the top cover upside down and support both ends with blocks of wood . Use a rubber mallet to hammer the middle of the top cover to put a little bow in it . Do it slowly and re-measure the gap frequently . If the gap is tight towards the front or back of the bolt , bend the front or back of the top cover down . You can get by with a vise and a crescent wrench to bend the ends of the top cover . Be sure the gap between the bolt and top cover does not get excessively wide because it will allow the bolt to slide past the sear without depressing the trigger . That would cause a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Insert a .005 inch feeler gauge between the bolt and top cover . If it does not move freely , the cover will need to be bent to reduce friction on the bolt . A .015 incher feeler gauge should be tight to avoid a runaway condition . Check the gap with the gauge inserted straight in , pointed backwards , and pointed forwards . <p> The long slot on the back of the extractor will be horizontal when properly reinserted in the back of the bolt . Fully automatic open bolts will have an arrow showing the proper alignment . <p> If the top cover gap is okay , verify there are no other sources of friction by using the bolt slide test . This test only works on open bolt UZIs . Assemble the unloaded gun without the recoil spring , remove the magazine , put the selector on full auto and hold down the grip safety . While pulling the trigger , tip the gun forward then backward . You should hear the bolt slide freely from the front to the back of the receiver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing and correct the problem . One common cause of binding is trying to use surplus machine gun bolts in a converted semiautomatic UZI that still has a barrel restrictor ring . An IMI machine gun bolt will not have enough clearance and will rub on the top of the restrictor ring . If that 's the problem , the best solution is to have a qualified gunsmith cut off the top of the restrictor ring , leaving just the machined feed ramp . <p> If friction is n't an issue , then the problem may be due to misalignment of the guns components . First check the magazine . Bent or cracked feed lips will cause misfeeds so the easiest test is to try different magazines . The original 25 round IMI magazines are the most reliable for function tests . Another magazine related problem occurs if its held too high in the magazine-well . To test for this you 'll need to repeat the bolt slide test mentioned above , but do it with a magazine body inserted in the gun . You must remove the magazine spring and follower for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feed lips during this test , you 'll need remove the magazine catch and bend it so the magazine is held in a lower position . Check several magazines before bending . <p> If the magazine alignment looks okay , the other potential alignment problem is much more serious . When the barrel is not properly aligned with the bolt , the round being fed into the chamber will not feed straight in , resulting in a light primer strike or the round jamming between the bolt and barrel . This type of alignment problem is most commonly found on guns built from Group Industries receivers ( original Group Industries or Vector guns ) due to those receivers being somewhat out of spec . Additionally , the heat treating done by both Group Industries and Vector warp the receivers and they need to be straightened before assembly , occasionally resulting in misalignment . Straightening a misaligned receiver is not something you should attempt yourself so if everything else checks out on your gun and you 're still experiencing failures to feed , the best alternative is to contact Vector Arms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on any brand of UZI and their customer service is first rate . <p> The simplicity of the UZI design will allow you to diagnose and correct most problems easily should any arise . With a minimal amount of care , this legendary submachine gun will give you a lifetime of reliable operation . <p> Originally published in the January , 2008 issue of Small Arms Review Magazine . 
@@77050521 @5750521/ <p> UZI ! For years the mere utterance of the word has sent the heart pounding and the pulse racing in the minds of soldiers , Hollywood producers , and home grown Walter Mitty types alike . This near mythical creation out of the brilliant mind of Uziel Gal has risen from the depths of despair of a nearly stillborn young nation , to its current status as THE defining image of at least three generations . There is almost no place on earth that the name , or image , of the UZI submachine gun can not be found such that this universal familiarity has led to its being one of the most popular firearms on the collectors market today . <p> Available Guns <p> Unfortunately for the NFA weapons collector in these United States , the UZI SMG is not as readily available as its worldwide status would suggest . Due to our controlling firearms laws and the market demands of past years , the collectible versions of the UZI have come to be defined by three distinct variations . <p> Any fully transferable factory produced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported prior to 1968 and the enactment of the Gun Control Act . In this category there exists two variations of the type : the Israeli/IMI produced originals , and the license built clones produced in Belgium by FN-Herstal . But before you start looking for one of those be aware that very few of either origin were ever imported prior to 1968 and they command a premium price ! <p> The only other option for a factory produced SMG is either the large number of dealer sample/law enforcement guns that were imported between 1968-1986 ( which are restricted to acquisition by civilians who are Special Occupational Tax payers only ) , or the US manufactured SMGs produced in the middle 1980s by Group Industries Inc. of Louisville , KY . The Group guns are factory produced SMGs , accurate and exact in every detail , as they were manufactured on jigs and tooling obtained from FN , often using original FN produced parts obtained in the deal . They are also all fully transferable . Group guns are available for approximately less than half the cost of a Pre-68 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are just as good as the originals . The differences are in finish only , and as a bonus the group guns were offered from the factory in .45ACP and .22LR calibers , in addition to the standard 9mm caliber . It has been reported that very few of the non-9mm calibers were delivered from the factory as such . Group also sold caliber conversion kits as an accessory item . There have been a few problems with later Group Industries UZIs , mostly related to the bolts . Installing a factory UZI bolt seems to alleviate the problems . <p> The last , and most common , version of the NFA collectable UZI SMG are those guns that originated as Title I semi-auto carbines , and were later converted to select fire and registered with the NFA ( National Firearms Act Branch of BATF ) as transferable SMGs . These guns come in two distinct flavors . First is the " registered receiver conversion " , whose registration status allows the receiver to be modified to the factory original SMG configuration . The second is the " registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special bolt that has been manufactured to fit and function in the receiver of a standard , unmodified , semi-auto carbine but in the select fire , open bolt , mode of operation . This type of conversion can not legally employ some of the standard SMG features that would require receiver modifications , as described below . <p> These two types of conversion guns are our topic of investigation , as there are many variations . As with all conversions , there exist guns that were converted correctly and safely , and there are those that bear watching out for . A thorough understanding of the accepted practices used in a proper conversion of each type will allow the prospective buyer or current owner to gain maximum enjoyment from this gun , while avoiding a potentially bad experience . <p> The Semi-Auto Carbine <p> It must be first understood that Action Arms Inc. , over the course of the years they were importing the semi-auto guns , imported two different version of the UZI semi-auto carbine . These versions were officially known as the Model A and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for certain small differences , some of which were also being incorporated into the factory SMGs at this time too . The most noticeable difference was the arrangement of their sighting systems . On the Model A the sights are identical to the original SMG design , in which all adjustability for windage and elevation is accomplished by movement of the front sight elements . The rear sight is a fixed peep , adjustable only for two range settings of 50m and 100m . Part of the problem was not taking into account the change from a 10 inch barrel on the SMG , to the 16 inch barrel on the semi-auto . The Model B incorporated a new sighting system which allowed elevation adjustments on the front sight post , and windage from the rear peep sight , in addition to the range selections . The operational difference is that the Model B does not require any special tool to make adjustments , whereas the Model A requires a dedicated sight tool . Also , on the Model B , the front sling swivel rotates a full 360 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotate through a full arc . One early versions of the Model A the bolt face was also slightly different . Early imports has a full cartridge seating bottom rim , whereas the later Model A ( and all Model B guns ) incorporate a relieved lower cartridge seat face to hinder easy conversion to full-auto fire . This became an important distinction when legally converting these guns , as discussed below . There is a perception that the Model A was a better candidate for conversions , as it was closer to the original SMG , and could be converted more easily , in some cases . On a few of the very early examples of the Model A , the blocking rail was not adequately welded , which may be the root of that bit of MG lore . <p> As an aside it must be pointed out , that while all Israeli manufactured semi-auto carbines were imported by Action Arms Inc. , there was also a clone of the semi-auto carbine being made by Group Industries here in the USA . Group Industries started making SMGs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which there are a small number about , but nowhere near as many as of the Action Arms imports . And though it has never been reported that the Group semis were available in time to be receiver registered , as transferable SMG conversions prior to the 1986 making ban , many have apparently been used when installing NFA registered , conversion bolts . The design and quality of Group Industries guns rivals that of the Israeli originals , and there should be no hesitation in their employment as host guns for bolt conversions . For our purposes here we are only concerned with original Israeli-made guns , and possibly these Group Industries clones , when used as the basis for a conversion with a registered bolt . It should be noted that there were imported at different times , and by different importers , unlicensed , cheap copies of the semi-auto carbine made by Norinco in China . These poor quality guns made it in under that name of " Officers 9 " , long before the semi-auto import ban , and long before the " current " rash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly seen with thumbhole , sporter style fixed stocks . Despite when ( and under which name ) these Chinese copies are encountered , it must be very clearly stated that they are extremely poor copies , which regard to metallurgy , fit , and finish . They are so poor as to preclude discussion here . Due to the poor timing involved , very few of the Chinese guns would seem to have been in-country and able to be registered prior to the 1986 making ban , but some may have been used for an SMG conversion with one of the many legally registered conversion bolts . Under no circumstances could this be recommended , as these guns are so poorly made as to be potentially impossible to make them function reliably with a conversion bolt installed .

@@77050523 @5750523/ <p> Think of a really effective submachine gun . Chances are that one of two models spring to mind : the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 or the UZI . Both weapons are excellent designs in wide spread use , and it 's hard to choose between them . The German gun , with its closed-bolt firing cycle , is more accurate and is the better weapon for police and counter terrorist work . The sturdy , reliable UZI is marginally superior as an infantry weapon . Both weapons are perfect for the close range fighting associated with urban areas . The German gun was produced in the 1960s by a state which was an industrial giant , with a well established arms industry . The Israeli weapon was built earlier in the 1950s , by a developing country , with a ramshackle economy and a Mickey Mouse arms industry . How did the Israelis manage it ? <p> The main reason is that they had a sophisticated and ruthless system of competitive tender : they pitched two decent , local designs against each other in a battle to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer of genius , a man by the name of Uzi Gal . The Israeli arms industry started up in conditions of illegality in the Palestine of the 1930s . Secret underground workshops built D.I.Y . small arms of varying quality . Some of these weapons were ingenious ; most were eccentric . The Dubigun , a 12-gauge " carbine " with a six-round drum magazine , was impressive looking . However , it was probably more dangerous to the firer than the target ! By the mid 1940s the Israelis were producing an unlicensed copy of the 9mm MK II Sten . Unfortunately , the Israelis had to build the gun of poor quality materials , only the barrel - cannibalized and rebored from the barrels of old hunting rifles - was actually made of steel ! This did nothing for the accuracy and reliability of this STEN clone . <p> By 1950 , the Israeli military , having had enough of submachine guns that blew up in your face or which jammed just when the fire fight was getting interesting , put forward a requirement for a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sturdy enough to take punishment and accurate enough to dish it out . <p> Israel and its hostile neighbors during the 1950s were involved in a cycle of artillery duels , nighttime border raids and counter strikes . The Israelis had inferior artillery but had infantry better trained in night fighting . The submachine gun , easy to carry and with a high rate of fire , was ideal for this kind of close-in and dirty type of warfare . The Israelis were desperate to put a reliable weapon in the hands of their paratroopers , the spear-point of their night raiders . Having decided that there was nothing on the market to meet their requirements , they had to build a submachine gun from scratch . <p> BITTER CONTEST <p> The Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) found that they had two designs in development which appeared to meet their needs . The first was a rather traditional looking weapon designed by Major Chaim Kara , head of the light weapons section of the IDF 's Science Corps . The second weapon was built by a youngster working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a genius for weapon design - Uzi Gal . Both guns needed further development before being submitted to testing . The Kara in particular needed reworking to meet the advanced demands of the IDF . The rival submachine guns , named after their creators , were handed over to the army in 1952 for competitive trials . <p> With the help of Colonel Matti Hemed ( retired ) of the IDF Collection Houses Museum Tel Aviv , I examined the weapons entered for trial . Matti , who was involved with just about all the small arms trials the IDF has ever carried out , was able to explain why the UZI won the contest . <p> The 9mm Kara was a good gun , the match of any found in the major armies of the time . Despite its traditional appearance , it utilized - as did the UZI - a wrap-around bolt and blowback operation . Wrap-around bolts allow the construction of a much more compact and handy weapon . Nowadays this type of bolt is common ; in the 1950s , they were innovative . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well made . Its circular cross-section was built to very fine tolerances , difficult to manufacture cheaply . Having only eight main parts , the gun was easy to field strip . Just as well really as its precision manufacturing process would not have withstood the grit and dust of the Middle East without jamming . The Kara had the choice of a 20- and 40-round magazine . <p> The 9mm UZI , even in its crude looking initial version , was a gun of a later generation than the Kara . Well built , it employed a large amount of stamped steel in its design : simple to mass produce and without the need for the close tolerances demanded in the manufacture of the Kara . The UZI was a killing machine : precise and elegant in its design , rather than in the quality of its construction . With its wrap-around telescoping bolt , the UZI was a compact weapon . The original UZI was fitted with a 30-round magazine ; later models have 25- or 32-round magazines . <p> The UZI had excellent human engineering . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip . Uzi Gal had thought what happens to a tired soldier fighting at night and needing to change magazines in the dark . The soldier may be frightened , disorientated and fumbling . The designer thought of the " fist finds fist " principal . No matter how dark the night or how tired you are , you will be able to touch your fists together without thinking . The fact that a soldiers dominant hand holds the combined pistol/grip magazine housing , allows the UZI to be reloaded quickly . The Kara 's later prototypes followed this feature of the UZI , however it was insufficient to sway the contest . <p> The UZI had a number of other advantages . Unlike most submachine guns , the UZI is almost immune from the danger of inadvertent misfires . A substantial safety catch at the back of the magazine housing needs to be squeezed at the same time as the trigger , before the gun will fire . Because of this safety feature an UZI is not likely to accidentally discharge if dropped to the ground . The weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strip down and reassemble - a good feature for combat operations . For a submachine gun , the UZI is accurate with limited recoil and climb ; it can even be fired one-handed . <p> Incidentally , Uzi Gal has been accused of copying the Czech weapon , the CZ23 , with its similar layout . Colonel Matti , who knows Uzi Gal very well , describes Gal as being absolutely straight and honest . When Gal says he did not copy the Czech gun , he is telling the truth ; it was simply the case of two sharp design teams coming up with similar sophisticated blueprints . <p> Anyway in 1951 , twelve Karas and five UZIs were placed on trial . After a period of rigorous testing , the UZI was declared the winner . The UZI was accepted because of its ability to fire and function in dusty , gritty environments without jamming . The gun was also easier to mass produce than the Kara . <p> WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LOST UZIS <p> From 1951 through to 1955 some eighty preproduction models were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design was altered and enhanced at the request of the IDF . In 1955 , the UZI recognizable as the gun we know today , was finally put into service . In 1956 , the gun proved its reliability during the Suez War . It was the start of a great career . The gun continued to evolve when in service . Perhaps the most important modification was the introduction of a neat , folding metal stock to replace a fixed wooden one in 1967 . As well as having been built by Israeli Military Industries for the IDF and many other armies , the UZI was license built by FN , the famous Belgium weapons firm . <p> Colonel Matti showed me several prototype variants that were never to go into service . The most startling of these was an UZI built in 1967 , fitted with a bayonet lug and equipped to fire rifle grenades ! Mercifully for the soldiers intended to use them , this unwieldy beast was not accepted by the IDF . In 1980 , the demand for an even more compact weapon led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing power of the UZI , compressed into a smaller package ; it 's most often used in covert work by special forces . The model of the Mini-UZI that is in service has a folding metal stock of a rugged design . Colonel Matti showed me the Mini-UZI as it might have been , with a selection of alternate stocks including a two-bar telescoping butt . Many of the variants of the Mini-UZI variants that were tested but not adopted , had forward pistol grips . The UZI continued its shrinking act in the 1980s with the adoption of the UZI pistol and the Micro-UZI . These super compact weapons have the reliability , sturdiness and good ergonomic design of the UZI squeezed into miniature bundles . <p> So there you have it . The UZI was the product of an individual weapon designer of genius . Early development of the sound basic design came about through competition from the Kara . Further evolution of the UZI , once it was adopted for service , occurred because of the increasing demand for ever smaller killing packages . The UZI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the UZI has largely been replaced in front-line military service by cut-down assault rifles , it remains in use with police forces and with soldiers in non combat roles . Its simple construction , reliability and portability will see it soldering on for a long time to come . Uzi Gal wo n't disappear from the scene either . The new Ruger MP9 submachine gun is based on Gal 's latest design work . <p> Thanks to Matti , Meir and Zvika of the Collection Houses Museum Tel Aviv for their help .

It 's illegal and the UZI Talk web site will offer no help to anyone doing a conversion . But converted guns are a fact of life for UZI collectors . Prior to 1986 , several class II dealers legally converted semi automatic UZI 's into full autos and they are transferable to individuals . If you 're thinking about buying a full auto IMI UZI , it almost certainly is a pre-1986 conversion . Before you buy , you should understand a few things about the conversion process and the issues ( both operational and legal ) that may arise from it . <p> The first thing to understand when looking at a converted UZI is what the registered part is . That will have a significant impact on what you can and can not do with the gun . When class II manufacturers were registering new machine guns prior to the 1986 ban , they could choose which part they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of two parts for an UZI - either the receiver or the bolt . These are the two parts that are generally incompatible with each other when mixing semi automatic and full automatic parts . By registering one of the parts as a machine gun , it could be modified in ways that would otherwise be illegal . For example , if a bolt was registered , the manufacturer could then cut a slot in the side so it would work in a semi automatic receiver with a blocking bar . Or if the receiver was registered , the blocking bar could be removed , permitting the use of an unmodified SMG bolt . The registered part gets modified and the non-registered part remains essentially unchanged so that it 's still legal when the registered part is removed . <p> There are advantages and disadvantages for each of these choices . With a registered bolt , the bolt can be freely dropped into difference receivers . A damaged receiver can be easily replaced and the registered bolt is reused . Unfortunately , a registered bolt generally does n't permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you remove the registered bolt , and then you no longer have a fully automatic weapon . The other disadvantage of a registered bolt is that the receiver is typically left unmodified or slightly modified . Because of that , you might be stuck using semi automatic parts instead of the cheaper and more widely available SMG parts . Some class II dealers registered bolts because of availability and the ease in which it could be done in the mad rush to register guns before the 1986 ban . <p> On the other hand , if you have a registered receiver , the manufacturer could modify the receiver in any way he wanted . The receiver could be converted to be identical to an original SMG receiver . Once that 's done , any SMG part can be used , giving you a cheap supply of spare parts . Also , since any bolt can be used in the receiver , caliber conversions are not a problem . The only drawback with a registered receiver is that a damaged receiver can not be replaced - but that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UZI receiver . Registered receivers are generally considered a better option and will usually command a higher price than a registered bolt . <p> There 's one important point to remember with a registered receiver . The manufacturer COULD modify the receiver to be 100% the same as an SMG receiver , but they did n't have to . Depending on who did the work , it could have been a minimal conversion or a complete conversion . Know what you 're getting before you buy . Was the blocking bar removed ? If not , then an SMG bolt ca n't be used and a sloted bolt would be necessary and inseparable from the receiver . Was the barrel restrictor ring removed and barrel trunion bored out ? If not , then SMG barrels could not be used and you 'll have a harder time getting the barrels you want . If the gun is a Mini UZI , was the trunion milled out to make space for the full auto Mini UZI bolt feet ? If not , a semi automatic bolt would have to be used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , know who did the conversion and stick to the manufacturers that did quality work . Poor workmanship could cause trunions to be out of alignment , tolerances to be out of spec , metal to be brittle due to overheating . Any of these problems will adversely affect the enjoyment of your UZI and the large investment you made in it . <p> Conversion Details <p> Let 's take a closer look at some details you should understand if you own or consider owning a registered UZI conversion . While " registered receivers " and " registered bolts " are the two most common conversions you 'll find , there are other types around : <p> Registered Receiver : A registered receiver conversion is probably the most desirable - assuming the bolt blocking bar was removed - because it 's the most versatile and capable of being an almost exact copy of a factory SMG UZI . However , not all registered receivers have the bolt blocking bar removed . If they do n't , their versatility and value are similar to a registered bolt gun because a slotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bolt can never be separated from the receiver . The ATF no longer allows the rail to be removed and the bolt replaced by an unslotted bolt . <p> Registered Bolt : They are normally a regular SMG open bolt that has been slotted on the side to clear the bolt blocking bar and have been milled in the front to clear the barrel restrictor ring found on the semi automatic full size UZI receiver . There are less common variations of the registered bolt including some that were registered closed bolts . Fleming did some Mini Uzi Closed bolt conversions . There are quite a few registered bolts that were cut down for use in a Mini or Micro/UZI Pistol . Neither the Mini nor Micro/UZI Pistol ever had the bolt blocking bar , making it easier to move a registered bolt from gun to gun . In fact , you could move the bolt around between a Mini and a Micro/Pistol provided you fabricate special cocking lugs for the respective top cover . <p> Registered Sear : Most of these are Fleming registered sears that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered sears that are not married to any receiver but these are extremely rare . <p> Registered LaFrance MG Conversion Kit : These consisted of a short barrel , slotted bolt and modified lower . These had all of his information engraved on the front of the magazine well and as such are sometimes referred to as a registered " lower " . There was also a matching serial number on top of the bolt and usually his logo above it . <p> Possible registered " kicker " : The " kicker " conversion was mentioned in the September 1984 issue of Firepower magazine . Being that they were around at that time , there is a possibility that some of them were registered . <p> Registered conversions can be found for all three size UZI 's : <p> The full size UZI carbine which came as the Model A and Model B. <p> The Mini UZI Carbine . Although the Mini UZI carbine did not enter the US until 1987 , registered bolts for the Mini UZI can be found . <p> The UZI Pistol , which came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the full auto Micro UZI . <p> Semi UZI 's in all three sizes share some common characteristics that may have been addressed during a conversion . If you are evaluating a conversion for purchase , you should inspect each of these items and understand what state it 's in . It will have some bearing on the value of the gun , what parts can be interchanged in the gun and whether the gun will function properly or not . <p> Bolt Face : The semi automatics are all closed bolt and the lower " lip " on the bolt face has been milled off as seen in this photo . For full auto use , the bolts must have a fully supported bolt face ( the lower lip must be present . ) This is true for both open and closed bolt full auto operation . <p> Extractors : The semi automatic extractors are different from the SMG extractors . The lower corner of the semi automatic extractor has been removed , making it unreliable for full auto firing . An SMG extractor should be installed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use sears that are specific for the semi automatic models . The sear pads ( the notches that stick up through the bottom of the receiver ) are smaller both in length and width . Correspondingly , the holes in the receiver that the sear pad passes through are smaller in the semi than on the full auto . This is a picture of an unconverted semi Model A 's sear and openings in the bottom of the receiver . The openings may look large enough to accommodate an SMG sear but they are not . <p> Legal Disclaimer : The top cover slot cover on semi automatics have a legal disclaimer stamped on them . While it 's purely cosmetic , it needs to be replaced to be consistent with an original SMG . <p> Non-Serrated Top Cover : Since the semi automatics are all closed bolt , they do not need the serrated top cover , which is a safety device for open bolt guns . If your conversion is an open bolt , the top cover should be replaced with a serrated top cover . <p> Barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the feed ramp . The restrictor ring supports the chamber end of the barrel , but is a smaller diameter than standard SMG barrels , preventing their use . The restrictor ring also hits the inside of standard SMG bolts , preventing their use . ( One exception to this is the Factory Micro UZI , which uses the same restrictor ring as the UZI Pistol . ) <p> There are three ways to deal with the barrel restrictor ring : <p> Leave the barrel restrictor ring unaltered . This requires the use of modified bolts and barrels instead of standard SMG parts . ( Full size UZI bolts made by Group bolt were relieved so they would not contact the restrictor ring . ) Note that with the Mini and Micro UZI , the restrictor ring only obstructs the factory IMI SMG open bolt , not the closed bolt . <p> Trim down the top and sides of the restrictor ring . This allows you to use standard SMG bolts , which now have enough clearance to pass over the restrictor ring . The remaining portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still requires you to use barrels with a smaller chamber end like a semi automatic barrel . <p> Completely mill off the restrictor ring . This allows you to use of all factory SMG barrels ( assuming the trunion is also made compatible ) and bolts and still leaves the semi automatic feed ramp for excellent feeding of virtually all ammo types . This is the most desirable type of modification . <p> As mentioned above , if the restrictor ring is not trimmed or completely milled off , it will rub against an SMG bolt . Group Industries machined both their semi and SMG bolts so that either one would clear the ring for ease of manufacturing rather than doing two different styles . ( Note the added clearance in the photo at the 2 o'clock position to the bolt face . ) Using a Group Industries bolt , someone doing a conversion would n't have to worry about messing with the ring or modifying a bolt . Fleming commonly did this with his conversions . <p> Large Trigger Group Lug/Pin : All the semi automatic UZI 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welded on the bottom of the receiver , and a 9mm pin that goes through the trigger group and the lug . This is to prevent installing an SMG lower ( which have 8mm holes ) on a semi receiver . A conversion can account for this in one of two ways . Either it can reduce the hole size in the lug to 8mm to match an SMG lower , or it can use semi lower with a 9mm hole and convert it to full auto . One exception to this size issue is that the factory Micro SMG and the UZI Pistol both use a 9mm trigger group lug/pin . <p> This example shows a bushing that has been installed in the trigger group lug , reducing it to 8mm so an SMG pin/lower can be properly installed . Rewelding this area rather than using a bushing is also an option . <p> Blocked Trigger Group : The lowers on semi automatics all have a block welded to the inside bottom of the grip frame to prevent the selector from moving to the full auto position . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as was done on this Fleming conversion <p> Two Position Fire Selector Bar : The selector bar has notches that engage the fire selector spring so that the bar does not move during firing . A semi automatic fire selector bar just has two notches . A third notch should be added so the bar does not move when set to full auto . <p> Two Position Selector Switch : Semi automatics have a two position selector switch , marked " F " and " S " . For cosmetic and safety reasons , a conversion should identify the third position for full auto fire . An " A " should be stamped into the third position . Some conversions will change the " F " to an " R " to look like an original SMG . <p> Receiver Markings : The original receivers are all marked in such a way to identify them as semi automatic . For aesthetic purposes , the receivers can be remarked to look like an original SMG - within the restrictions set forth by the ATF . You can not alter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UZI 's have a serial number prefix identifying their semi automatic model , no conversion can be marked 100% correctly .

It may be that I have to do the buffer and the gas block , I just do n't  want overkill if just one purchase will do the trick . Also , I may have to go up to a 11 inch barrel <p> I 've been messing around with h2 &amp;h3 carbine buffers and not really getting the results I want . I just ordered the a5 buffer tube and spring+ h2 , h3 , and h4 buffers from vltor . Its a midlength buffer system with a collapsable stock if that makes any sense . Basically it allows a longer stroke . Plus the h4 buffer weighs 7 oz . If it runs with the h4 it should runs slower hoping around mid 700s . I 've also been told the recoil impulse is more like the rifle length buffer system . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some rate of fire videos . <p> My RLL is mac 10 fast - I need to slow it waaaaayyyy down . It may be that I have to do the buffer and the gas block , I just do n't  want overkill if just one purchase will do the trick . Also , I may have to go up to a 11 inch barrel <p> So I think starting with the MGI buffer would be best . Yes the MGI buffer is very pricey . When I only had a M16 RR and a couple of semi auto guns , I bought an extra MGI buffer for use with the semi auto rifle calibers . I bought the extra MGI buffer because I found it so much more comfortable to shoot in rifle calibers . <p> I 've never tried to use limiting the gas to the carrier to adjust ROF . It is my understanding that the DI bolt/carrier assembly needs a certain volume of gas at a certain amount of pressure for proper function . My limited understanding is the gas moves so fast that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber that the gas port is the slower the ROF will be . Because the pressure is so high since the port is so close to the chamber , so a small change in port size will effect function . But the speed of the bolt group is more effected by the mass of the bolt group and buffer . So I 'd think to slow the ROF increasing the buffer mass would have a much larger effect on ROF than limiting gas flow to the bolt group . It seems that the spring in the MGI buffer allows this super heavy buffer function . When I first bought a 9mm upper and got a 9mm buffer . I thought I 'd leave the 9mm buffer in the RR . But I had function problems . The MGI buffer has approximately the same mass as the 9mm buffer but it still will function with my rifle uppers . <p> I completely agree . The first three things I 'd do to control the ROF with a 7 1/2 " upper , ( which I own ) , is replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scott knows I 'm in love with my AAC mechanical buffer but if I was starting off fresh , I 'd buy an MGI . <p> If I focus hard , I can pull singles with my 7 1/2 " upper about 50% of the time but accuracy suffers when my focus is on the trigger . Like I use that upper for accuracy anyway ... just saying it 's doable for the average guy with some practice . Doubles are super easy with no focus what-so-ever . IIRC , I 've able to pull much better than 50% with Scott 's 9mm setup using the light AAC buffer spring but that may have been with the Enidine buffer ? <p> I agree with " Vegas " . The MGI reduces by percentage . So the faster the upper is running , the more of a difference you 'll notice in ROF . So the 7.5 " will have a much greater ROF reduction than a 20 " upper . Personally not only did I find a ROF difference from a " H " buffer , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I originally bought a spare for my semi auto . Of course " Which one is best ? " will tend to bring out a " which is best , Ford , Chevy , or Dodge " discussion . I 'm sure you could find shooters that would say any one of those buffers is best . YMMV. 
@@77050526 @5750526/ <p> Loading clips for the C3 Rapid Loader can be a challenge to say the least . Sometimes I do n't  know which is worse , loading the clips or maybe just thumb loading the magazines . One of the big advantages to the clips is that I can have a lot of them loaded and take with me to the range for an outing . Admittedly , I can load a lot of magazines ( sometimes ) but it still makes my thumb sore . One of the solutions is to use the metal clips that hold 36 rounds that come with the Norma training ammo . Unless you have the subcaliber conversion barrel , you cant use this ammo effectively in your firearm , so some folks will buy the ammo and ditch the rounds for the metal clips . This still leaves the dilemma of how to put your loaded rounds easily into the clips for future use . Here is the method that I use . It is by no means the easiest out there ( I 'm sure ) but it works for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the 25 round plastic trays they use work well for this method . The large 50 round trays that a lot of other ammo come in just seem to be too large or the rows are spaced too far apart to work this method . <p> First step is to remove the middle row of five rounds from the plastic tray . If you have several empty plastic trays , use the middle rows to fill up the empties . Be careful when doing this that you start with the second row and work out . If you place the first round in the outermost row , the tray will tip over . Starting in the second row will stop that problem . <p> It is important at this stage to have a solid raised area to rest the plastic tray with the rounds in it . The working tray has to be elevated above the working surface . If you try to do this on a flat surface , the resulting loaded rows will prevent proper loading . <p> Align the first two empty rows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Using your thumb and hand , slide the tray down the row to load 10 rounds into the metal tray . <p> This will give you two rows of 5 rounds as shown . Do n't  worry about loading the two remaining rounds in these rows yet . If you have a lot of these to do , it will break the flow . <p> Now , rotate the plastic block so that the other double row of rounds is in your working area . Rotate the metal clip so that the loaded rows are on the outside and do n't  interfere with the sliding process . This is where you will find the need for the raised surface and the missing middle row . <p> This will now give you 20 rounds loaded in four rows of 5 . Take another plastic clip and repeat the process for the final two rows . <p> This process will give you six rows of 5 rounds in the metal clips . <p> To load the final single rounds , I have found that holding the clips and bending them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a simple matter to place the six single final rounds in place to give you six rows of 6 rounds . <p> The first time or two that you do this with the clips , they might be a bit stiff and take some jockeying around with , but with practice it gets easier and quicker . Sure makes loading the magazines a lot easier . Also , be very careful with your fingers during this process . These clips can be sharp and if you slip while applying pressure you can cut or puncture your hands and fingers . 
@@77050527 @5750527/ <p> The Norinco UZI 's were unlicensed copies of the IMI UZI Model B and were manufactured in China in the the mid 1990 's . The Norincos were stamped with the importer information - " A.C.C.INT'LINTRAC KNOXVILLE , TN " - and were distributed by Action Arms . <p> Comparison with the IMI Model B <p> There are four changes from the original IMI Model B design that were required before the guns could be sold in the United States : - The folding stock was replaced with a wooden thumbhole stock . - The barrel nut was spot welded in three places to prevent removal of the barrel . - The bayonet lug was removed . - The magazine was blocked so it would only hold ten rounds . <p> Aside from those four changes , the guns are mechanically the same , however fit and finish are significantly differently . While the IMI Model B has a smooth , black , painted finish , the Norinco has a gray phosphate finish that mars easily . Parts on the IMI have smooth edges and generally have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times have sharp edges that reveal their low cost manufacturing process . <p> The Norinco has a number of parts that are serial numbered to match the gun : the receiver , bolt , firing pin carrier , top cover , grip frame and magazine as well as the box are all numbered . No other markings were found on any parts , suggesting that no surplus contract parts were used in the manufacture of the Norinco . The quality of the parts would also confirm that . <p> Here 's a closer look at how the Norinco and IMI Model B parts compare : <p> The only real noticeable difference on the side of the receiver is the removal of the bayonet lug from the Norinco . The rear of the lug is left to attach the front grip panels . Welds ( such as on the front sight ) are much more noticeable on the Norinco . <p> The bottom of the Norinco receiver is mostly with same with the exception of two holes drilled towards the rear of the receiver for attaching the thumbhole stiock . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the receivers look identical . The Norinco uses the same semi auto feed ramp with restrictor ring as the IMI . It also has the same Model B style ejector . <p> The Norinco uses the standard Model B style sights . No difference was noted in the trunion but measurements could not be made since the barrel ca n't be removed on the Norinco . <p> The Norinco has the same bolt blocking bar required on all semi automatic UZI 's imported into the United States . It uses the standard IMI recoil buffer . The Norinco has Model B rear sights , although flipping the sight between 100 and 200 yards caused the windage screw to turn , while it remained in place on the IMI . <p> The Norinco top cover had two cosmetic differences . It did not have the IMI warnings stamped into the cover , but it did have the gun 's serial number stamped on the rear of the cover . <p> The grip assemblies were mechanically identical but the difference in quality was apparent . The Norinco had a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were interchangeable between the guns and individual fire control parts should be as well . The Norinco grip frame had the gun 's serial number stamped on the lower right side . <p> The bolts were almost identical , both having the Model B firing pin safety . The only difference was the different contour of the rear side of the ejection port . The Norinco bolt was stamped with the serial number of the gun . <p> The Norinco had a wider extractor , like you 'd find on a full automatic . Other than that the bolt faces were identical . <p> Firing pin carriers were identical except that the Norinco carrier was stamped with the serial number of the gun . <p> The barrel nut is spot welded in three places . The BATF required this before the gun could be sold in the United States . <p> The thumbhole stock does not attach directly to the receiver . Instead , a bracket attaches to the receiver and the stock attaches to the bracket . The bracket slides under the folding stock catch ( below the receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folding stock does . It would not normally be removed from the receiver . With the bracket removed , an IMI folding stock would fit properly . That could be a useful fact if the current prohibition on post-ban folding stocks goes away . <p> The thumbhole stock gives approximately the same length of pull but does not have the same drop as the folding stock . <p> A stock only a mother could love . This thing is just plain ugly . It 's made of very soft wood and crudely fashioned . It looks like a small amount of rough handling would break it easily . Also , you can not take the grip frame off the receiver ( for cleaning ) without taking the stock off the gun . <p> The final insult - a " Made in China " sticker proudly plastered across the butt plate .

Action Arms attached a card to the pistol grip of each one of the Norinco 's : <p> Removing the Norinco Thumbhole Stock <p> Many people ask if the thumbhole stock can be replaced with the standard UZI folding stock . The answer is yes - but subject to all the rules and regulations . First , it can only be done if the gun qualifies as US made rather than imported . A gun qualifies as imported if it has not more than 10 imported parts .

@@77050530 @5750530/ <p> Now , with an understanding of the various mechanical differences between the SMG and the semi-auto carbine , it is relevant to discuss the actual mechanical methods of conversion that will be found on a NFA registered UZI carbine SMG conversion . <p> It did not take long after Action Arms Inc. began importing the first carbines to the USA in 1980 before some very industrious minds began to figure out how to convert the gun into a full-auto firing ( versions in full-auto only , and selective full-auto fire ) submachine gun . <p> The first type of conversion took clever advantage of the design of the striker-fired , closed-bolt , semi-auto mechanism in spite of all that IMI had done to prevent easy conversion . In fact , some of the IMI changes actually facilitated this type of conversion ! Recall from above , that the first Model A guns to come in were slightly different than all those that followed . IMI had forgotten a few very important details it seems ! For the open-bolt mode of fire , the full-circumference rim on the bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the fixed firing pin striking the primer cap , is critical . Without this lower rim on the bolt face the cartridge bottom rim will hang up on the firing pin , causing jamming as it enters the chamber . The cartridge rim will climb into the bolt face too soon . On a closed-bolt weapon there is no firing pin in the way , until sear release of the striker after bolt closure and chambering , so the elimination of that lower lip is of no consequence unless somehow , that fixed firing pin , or its equivalent , suddenly reappears ! That is exactly what those industrious minds figured out how to do . If the striker could be attached to the rear of the bolt it would act as an open bolt , with a fixed firing pin protruding at the bolt face . Even simpler , it was noticed that the striker spring was strong enough to carry the striker in place against the rear of the bolt during chambering , enough to cause reliable primer ignition ! Now you were half way there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding rim already , remember ? Two thirds of the way there . If you could somehow allow the selector lever ( early Model A select levers had three detent notches ) to move forward far enough to interrupt the disconnector function , the bolt would continue to reciprocate until trigger release .... full-auto ( only ) ! Method one done . <p> In finer detail , these were mostly all registered receiver conversions for two basic reasons . Reason one , because at this time there was no economic reason NOT to register the whole gun as an SMG , and reason two , the ATF rulings which brought about the so-called " machine gun conversion parts " distinction was just beginning to get started with the " AR15 drop-in auto sear " mania and the like , with the UZI conversion scene adding to the fire for the following reason . From the just discussed conversion method above , it becomes apparent that one could convert a semi-auto carbine to fall-auto with no receiver modifications . If a new selector lever that bypassed the disconnector function could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . That was exactly what was done in some cases , with a " Conversion Selector Lever " being NFA registered as the machine gun itself , and either installed in a gun by a Class II Manufacturer or owner ( on Form 1 ) , or sold by itself . ATF promptly ruled this lever was a machine gun with the usual warning against unregistered possession , etc . <p> So , early Model As with the full SMG style lower bolt face rim ) can be found with this NFA registered lever as the only difference , but they will be able to fire fall-auto only , not selectively . For later bolts with the lower rim machined off , it was necessary to reinstall that rim as in an SMG bolt face . This was usually done by welding a machine contoured half rim ring back onto the bolt face itself . For the selector lever itself to NOT be considered a registerable part under the NFA , it had to be of the original design with the right-angle finger attached that engaged the disconnector ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trigger grip frame housing ) . Early Model A select levers with all three detent positions could be used just as a regular SMG part if the blocking piece could be removed , but doing so altered the as manufactured status of the gun , and was disallowed by ATF , unless the receiver was NFA registered , and this was the only way to remain legal with a conversion of this type early on . The proper conversion method then had the blocking piece removed to replicate the SMG control housing function . Later semi-auto select levers were devoid of the third detent notch , so that had it to be reconfigured on later guns undergoing conversion . This describes the various NFA registered guns that can be encountered from the earliest conversions done . This phase lasted only about a year or so , and changed very quickly when those industrious minds went to work again , this time on the bolt itself . <p> Since to modify the relieved bolt face seen on most Model A guns required accurate welding and reheat treating of the bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured in the full SMG configuration as regards open bolt firing requirements . If you started with a SMG type bolt the only major modification needed would be to allow placement inside the semi receiver with its blocking rail . A simple job of milling a slot in the correct location to mimic the design of the semi-auto bolt , and the gun would function in the open bolt mode . And so the now famous " slotted bolt " was born . The first versions sold openly were designed to accommodate the normal closed bolt recoil spring and buffer arrangement which was slightly longer in depth on the semi gun because the semi closed bolt did not need to reciprocate as far back into the receiver because of the striker assembly riding behind it . To this end , the cut track opening for the cocking slide in the top cover had a slightly shorter track , as the cocking slide did not need to be drawn as far back with the striker engaging the sear instead of the bolt . To retain as much of the original SMG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by replacing the semi recoil and buffer assemblies with a standard SMG version the slotted bolt could attain all the relevant dimensions of the SMG , save for the milled slot in the side . By increasing the length of the slotted conversion bolt to normal SMG spec it also restored the normal cyclic rate by virtue of the increased mass and recoil travel . The only down side to this bolt , and all future NFA registered conversion bolts of this description , is that it now required the full travel of the cocking slide to engage the bolt notch with the sear while cocking the weapon , such that it became necessary to now mill open the length of the cocking track opening to normal SMG specs too . It was often easier to just replace the whole top cover , with the added benefit of the SMG ratcheting mechanism coming along for free . <p> This all came to an immediate halt in mid 1982 , when ATF ruled that such fixed firing pin , slotted bolts , like the drop-in selector or lever , were machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale , and possession was to be in full compliance with the NFA . There were though a small number of legal registered conversions made by using these unrestricted , restricted , conversion bolts prior to that ruling , and they were allowed ( grandfathered ) , as they were previously lawfully , registered in full compliance with the existing laws , though the conversion bolt now needed to be married to that particular serial numbered receiver . If it ever needed replacement you were out of luck . With this restriction some of these registered receiver guns simply ditched ( read : destroyed ) the UN-registered conversion bolt and went ahead and finished the receiver modifications that allowed utilization of an original , solid SMG open-bolt , as these were the only bolts that remained legal for unrestricted sale and transfer after the ruling . <p> This is the basis then for the second most common method of conversion , that of using an NFA registered , slotted conversion bolt , in an otherwise unmodified Title 1 semi-auto receiver . These slotted conversion bolts were still made and marketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a lot of them were ! The slotted conversion bolt is operationally identical to the standard SMG open bolt , except for the milled slot in the right upper side face . All other relevant dimensions and operating characteristics are the same , with one small nod to the inescapable reality that it was to be used in an unmodified semi-auto carbine receiver . All semi-auto carbines incorporate the barrel modifications as described above such that a normal SMG bolt face , if used in an unmodified semi-auto receiver , would not properly close against the rear of the barrel chamber , as the restrictor ring which surrounds the rear of the semi-auto barrel would interfere . So , NFA registered slotted conversion bolts are slightly relieved at the forward upper bolt face to accommodate the normal semi-auto barrel and mounting setup . <p> With a registered conversion bolt installed , it was deemed acceptable by ATF to allow modification of the lower receiver trigger housing fire control unit any way desired , and most units were simply modified from the semi-auto to selective mode of fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swap out the semi-auto unit for a standard factory original SMG lower , as long as the SMG trigger housing is modified ( by opening up the mounting pin holes to 9mm ) , and not the upper receiver center block ! Even with a registered slotted conversion bolt installed , upper receiver modifications are generally disapproved of by ATF , although the only specifically illegal modification is removal of the blocking rail on the right upper inside of the receiver . The caveat against modifying the lower receiver push pin mounting hole to bring it back to the 8mm SMG standard is that it may be viewed as evidence of intent to illegally convert the semi-auto upper receiver ( by allowing pin-on conversion of an SMG lower housing combined with the first bolt modification method described above ) if the NFA-registered bolt is ever separated . It is inadvisable to make this modification in light of that distinction . Guns found with the remaining upper receiver modifications , such as barrel trunnion and feed ramp alterations , are not illegal and add to the perceptible value of the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a NFA-registered slotted conversion bolt is an excellent method of conversion as it does not overly hinder one in obtaining a near copy of the factory SMG original , and in most cases the absolute differences between a bolt gun and registered receiver conversion are merely aesthetic , with the spare parts scenario being the most common complaint . And , if you already have a semi-auto gun in your collection , the acquisition of an NFA-registered conversion bolt may allow an inexpensive changeover into the full-auto realm of the design , as it was originally intended . <p> The only remaining point to discuss about these registered conversion bolts is as regards their inherent value and weaknesses . All of these bolts were NOT created equal , either in materials or workmanship ! If it is decided that a conversion bolt is the way to proceed a careful examination of the intended bolt is in order if you wish to maximize the usage and enjoyment of the converted gun . Slotted conversion bolts were made from two distinct sources , each with its own pluses and minuses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factory original SMG open-bolt , and then make the two modifications to adapt it to conversion use in the semi-auto carbine , namely milling the clearance slot , and the bolt face relief cut for the rear barrel support ring . The main concern here is : Did the manufacturer of these bolts properly account for the re-heat treatment of the finished bolt . Since these bolts are normally hardened , it should have been annealed prior to machining , and then heat treated again to proper finish hardness . A finish hardness of at least Rockwell 55-56 on the C ( hard , but able to be cut with a file ) scale is desired to prevent premature wear of the sear holding notches and bolt face . A tungsten carbide-cutter mill may have been used instead of the heat treatment process ( es ) , but this could lead to localized heat distortion damage ( unlikely ) during the milling operation(s) if it is not done very carefully . Closely examine any bolts that show evidence of stress risers , hairline cracks , crystallization or burring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either from machined forgings , bar stock or investment castings . Both forgings and bar stock are common , and perfectly acceptable as base materials for a machine gun bolt , with a slight nod being given to the forged bolts as they duplicate the factory original manufacturing method , while having intrinsically better metallurgical properties . Lastly , some new manufacture bolts were made from cast steel and then finish machined . Investment cast parts are acceptable , providing that the proper manufacturing methods were employed during casting , and were to industry standards . The single most common problem found with cast parts relates to improper cooling practices which allow finished dimensions to stray from spec . All cast UZI bolts were not created equal , and there are unfortunately cast UZI bolts that are known to be off-spec due to a materials specification change which substituted a different alloy than originally specified . This material had a slightly different contraction rate , which caused it to cool to a finish dimension that was larger than tolerance . There ended up being a small lot of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite obvious by the fitting marks that were required to get them to function . <p> All of these bolts of any manufacturing method , should be heat treated for long-term service , so check the pedigree of the bolt in question and verify manufacturing specs if at all possible . As regards reported , known problems with these registered slotted bolts , it boils down to two areas . First , for the reasons above , some bolts exhibit an excessive wear profile in the sear holding notches which can lead to eventual failure to properly hold on the sear fingers . Potential dangers from run-away firing aside , this is not that serious of a problem to repair , though it entails welding up the sear notches in a jig and then re-machining them to spec ( followed by proper re-heat treatment ! ) . Secondly , some of the improperly heat treated bolts have had their fixed firing pin wear down from extended use to the point where there is not enough pin protruding to reliably cause primer ignition . The only acceptable method of repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a replacement fixed pin which can be heat-shrunk into place . These repair pins are rare items , and few people working around MG 's have any experience with doing this , but since we are talking about a registered part , repair is the only legal way to go registered slotted bolts should , of and in themselves , be of no particular concern as regards wear and longevity in an SMG conversion , as they have the full potential to meet a normal factory original parts life and utility span , if they were correctly manufactured in the first place . As with all conversion parts though , once the general design was in the public domain many different sources made and registered them and all were not created equal , so a close physical examination is advised . And if a well-worn , or even damaged or improperly manufactured , registered bolt should be found , do not discount it out of hand , as it can be repaired and restored to operational status by a competent professional . The price to be paid should reflect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable with time , any item with a registration paper/tax stamp is worth a close examination prior to purchase , if at all possible . <p> The final conversion type is the so-called registered receiver gun . As most people understand the meaning of the term , it is qualified by one underlying distinction , the removal of the blocking rail inside the receiver to allow utilization of a standard , solid , SMG open bolt . Though we noted that there are a select few registered receiver guns , as described above , that were converted by other methods , these are not generally perceived to be of the same general class , as they still have the blocking rail intact and therefore have not been converted to SMG description . However , due to their receiver status they most certainly could be completed to full SMG spec at the owner 's discretion . The owner who wishes to do so should check with ATF Technology Branch first before doing so - and get it in writing . But for most registered receiver guns , their attraction lies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near clone of the factory SMG , in both function and appearance . Due to the registration status , with no legal barriers to altering the receiver itself , we are free to return the receiver to its normal SMG description . <p> This complete conversion of the gun back to its near factory SMG description is accomplished as follows , though individual guns may exhibit various stages of completeness of the full conversion . The complete conversion is begun by removal of the bolt blocking rail in preparation for installation of a factory original SMG open bolt . The IMI design for the mounting of the blocking rail incorporated two extension tabs near each end , that located the rail by mating with opposite slots in the receiver sidewall , and then were welded in place and had the welds ground smooth prior to finishing of the weapon 's exterior . When altering the receiver for the conversion to a factory type SMG bolt it became necessary to remove the rail completely , flush with the receiver sidewall , a job best accomplished with a vertical milling cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail flush with the receiver sidewall without causing damage . The problem with this is that the last section of the rail was installed too far back in the receiver channel to allow milling it completely free , so some ingenuity was called for . Most conversions were done by carefully milling off the rail as much as possible rearward then using a small torquing force , or shear force , to break free the remaining tab joint . Done carefully , this resulted in no damage to the receiver sidewalls , though many people apparently used alternate methods than a mill , or rushed the job or applied too much torque/ shear force as twisted/dented rear sidewalls are one of the most common flaws in conversions . These sidewall flaws can be straightened , but it is a difficult job and best done by an experienced professional . <p> The other required major alteration to the semi-auto upper receiver , to render it a clone of the factory produced SMG , was the conversion of the barrel mounting points . The barrel trunnion through-hole needs to be opened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns will have had this done by line boring to the axis though more commonly this was simply placed into a vertical holding fixture and a drill press was used . This can result in misalignment of the mounted barrel and may be a root cause of feeding troubles , and failure to be able to properly tighten the barrel mounting collar . The rear barrel holding ring/feed ramp assembly will also have to have the entire ring structure milled off flush with the upper surface of the feed ramp , duplicating the SMG ramp contours , to avoid bolt face contact . Once these two operations were performed , an SMG barrel could be simply replaced . <p> The selector lever block in the top inside shelf of the trigger housing frame was also installed by the same locating tab method , as employed on the blocking rail in the upper receiver . The correct method to remove it was a simple milling operation , though other torquing/shearing operations were commonly utilized . If the block was not fully removed flush , or if any remnants of the weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-angle finger of the selector lever that prevents smooth operation of the disconnector function and subsequent improper semi-auto functioning . So , to do a proper conversion , one must completely remove the select lever block , as some improper conversions merely attempted to notch , or cut out , instead of fully removing the block , and a sticking or troublesome selector lever can usually be traced to this . An SMG selector lever is the ideal way to complete a fully correct conversion , and this can be simply exchanged , although the majority of conversions probably used modified semi levers ( note : there are two different SMG selectors available - later production ones have the safety tang , early military ones do not . ) . The semi-auto select levers were modified by adding the third detent , and these detents may give trouble if not properly done . Check for correct depth and spacing as compared to the original two semi-auto only control positions if the selector will not engage the full-auto position smoothly and firmly . A correct job will have the third detent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut or ground out . <p> As discussed above the remaining operation to the trigger housing was remarking of the housing exterior for the third selector detent position after it had been milled , cut , or stamped into the housing exterior . The exterior of the trigger housing is where it is easy to tell the care and professionalism , or lack thereof , that went into the conversion . The remarking of the housing for the third detent position can vary from either indistinguishable from factory , to sloppy and badly mismatched . A cold chisel and hand stamp , held by hand and eyeballed , was often the preferred method . The best conversions will have utilized a professional stamping fixture with a font-matching stamp to duplicate the lettering already existing in the other two positions , combined with welding up of the old fire position F , and restamping of the now required R for the semi-auto detent position . Some conversions may simply have had the entire semi-auto unit replaced with a surplus factory SMG type trigger housing , which should be unaltered except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMG trigger housing . If the original semi-auto sear was exchanged for an SMG sear , with the full width fingers , the sear clearance holes in the bottom of the upper receiver will need to be enlarged to SMG spec for proper clearance . The difference is slight , and many were not properly enlarged as required . For reliable operation with the SMG sear it is necessary to enlarge the holes . <p> The top cover modifications , required for the SMG open bolt installation as discussed above , will most likely have been accomplished by a simple replacement and exchange of the semi-auto original cover assembly for a surplus SMG , ratcheting type unit . This would be considered the most desirable method for this assembly , though modified semi-auto units are also common and perfectly acceptable , though less military looking . <p> The final aspect of the conversion is the installation , a drop in job now , of an original solid face , SMG style open bolt and its attendant recoil spring and buffer assembly . This bolt should already come equipped with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be exchanged for one . <p> With a complete exterior refinish , this is the ideal state of conversion in a complete conversion of the semi-auto carbine into as near as possible a clone of the factory produced , select fire , open bolt , SMG original , save for the mounting pm holes for the lower trigger housing and the semi-auto Model A/B markings . These trigger housing pinholes and the receiver markings could have been altered if a registered receiver gun was remanufactured by a Class II manufacturer , but conversions using registered bolts can not alter the receiver or its factory markings . As can be readily seen , since there exist such a wide range of possible conversions out there , respective values also vary widely . Most desirable would seem to be a fully converted registered receiver gun exhibiting all the alterations to render a near perfect copy of the factory SMG . These guns , circa early 1998 prices , are fairly priced in the mid to high $2000s for excellent condition guns with a known pedigree originally done by reputable sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical or major aesthetic problems . Value increases with higher content of SMG style parts , or modifications to accept those standard parts . Registered bolts are fairly priced from $500-$1000 alone , depending on manufacturer and condition , and materials and methods used for manufacture . A complete bolt gun will depend upon the host semi-auto guns inherent value and whether any additional allowable alterations exist . These could command as a package anywhere from the low $1000s to the mid $2000s . As a general rule ANY bolt gun is worth less than a registered receiver conversion of comparable condition . Though , if you happen to run across one of the few very early conversions , those that fall under the heading of anomalies , such as those that contain a NFA registered selector lever , or are grandfathered un-registered slotted bolt , judgment will have to be used as to value based upon overall condition and the wear and tear on the registered part(s) . Negotiations are in order , as there is simply no definitive value basis . <p> Hopefully now , with an understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear picture can be drawn of the complex nature of this particular class of civilian legal NFA firearm and its convoluted path to the marketplace and firing lines across the country . While there exists a large variance in this class of guns , it is also nice to know that they represent a solid value for the collectors money , while being easy to shoot and service , as spare parts and accessories are abundant and inexpensive .

@@77050532 @5750532/ <p> By the late 1990 's , both open and closed bolt versions of the full size UZI SMG were being imported into the United States for law enforcement use . However , full size closed bolts were still unavailable to people with transferable UZIs . As a result , bolt conversions were sought after to give people the closed bolt experience in their full size UZI SMG . <p> Just like in the Mini UZI closed bolts , the full auto closed bolt on the full size UZI is very similar to a semi auto bolt , but a semi bolt can not be used for full auto fire . The absence of a lower lip on the semi bolt face allows the exposed firing pin to contact the rim of a case during feeding , causing it to jam . Even though the full auto closed bolt looks very similar to a semi auto closed bolt , a conversion usually begins with a full auto OPEN bolt . This results in two advantages : ( 1 ) the open bolt does not have a slot cut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slot in the side would be manufacturing an illegal machine gun . And ( 2 ) , the open bolt is fully supported - having a raised lip on the bottom edge of the bolt face . Following are photos comparing an original open with a full auto closed bolt converted by D&amp;D Sales . <p> Comparison of the bolt face between the open and closed bolts . The raised lower lip and full auto extractor are maintained from the open bolt . A hole is drilled through the converted bolt permitting a carrier mounted firing pin rather than the fixed firing pin on the face of the open bolt . <p> This bottom rails of the bolt need to be modified during the conversion . Notice that the front rails have been extended on the closed bolt ( refer to red circles ) . This modification is necessary to keep the sear from holding the closed bolt open . The red straight lines show where the rails had been removed . The large cut on the left side of the bolt ( right side of photo ) make room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right side of the bolt ( left side of photo ) allows the sear to pop up so it can catch the striker . <p> The right side of the bolts show how the closed bolt ejection port was enlarged . Because of the shorter stroke of the closed bolt , the enlarged ejection port ensures that the ejected case will clear the bolt as it moves forward . The red line shows where a portion of the rail had been removed ( allowing the sear to pop up and catch the striker on the other side ) and the red circle shows where the rail had been extended . <p> The left side of the bolt again shows where the rail was removed to make room for the carrier ( red line ) and the front of the rail is built up ( red circle ) so the bolt is not held open by the sear . <p> The rear of the bolt shows the hole that was drilled to allow the floating firing pin to be inserted . The striker assembly butts up to the two small raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffer and striker assembly are standard semi automatic parts . The recoil spring is a full auto version without the thin , hard buffer . A shorter semi auto recoil spring will not work with the full auto closed bolt conversion . <p> Three different views of the completed closed bolt assembly . When the striker is " charged " or " cocked , " the front of the rail of the striker ( see inside of red circle ) makes contact with one side of the sear only . When the charging handle is released , the bolt will move forward and strip a round from the magazine and chamber it . At that point , the striker is held to the rear by the sear and the bolt is forward with a cartridge in the chamber . This is why it is called a " closed bolt . " When the trigger is pulled , the sear is retracted allowing the striker assembly to move forward and the primer is ignited by the firing pin . When the selector is in full auto mode , the striker will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger is depressed . This causes the firing pin to protrude from the bolt face like the fixed firing pin of the open bolt . When the trigger is released , the sear engages the striker and holds it to the rear while the bolt moves forward and chambers a cartridge . <p> The full auto sear does not need to be modified for this conversion to work , but the closed bolt conversion will not work with the ratchet mechanism installed in the top cover because the bolt can not be retracted far enough to disengage the ratchet pawl . To use the converted closed bolt , you either need to remove the ratchet pawl or use a semi auto top cover . With this configuration , care needs to be taken to ensure that the bolt/striker assembly has been completely pulled to the rear when cocking the gun . If its not and you release the charging handle without allowing the striker to be engaged by the sear , the gun may discharge . <p> The closed bolt conversion results in an extremely fast rate of fire -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt assembly . The ROF is much higher due to the limited travel of the closed bolt as compared to the open bolt ( the open bolts travels farther into the rear of the receiver ) . There are two factors reducing the bolt travel : ( 1 ) the additional length of the closed bolt buffer ( buffer is 1 and 3/4 inches long ) , and ( 2 ) the rear portion of the striker assembly , that protrudes from the back of the closed bolt , adds at least another 1/2 inch . Taking both of these factors into account , the closed bolt has about two inches less travel than the open bolt version . This decreased bolt travel is what dramatically increases the cyclic rate . A properly converted closed bolt should be every bit as reliable as the open bolt . 
@@77050533 @5750533/ <p> As the heart of the Vector UZI , the raw receiver is CNC machined in several areas to bring it into proper specification . Group Industries initially stamped them slightly oversize , therefore , the front and back are slightly shortened while the top is milled down a bit to reduce the receiver 's height . Also , the distance between the front/rear sight ears is adjusted to permit proper fitting of the top cover . These operations are all done on a CNC mill which is equipped with a special anti-vibration fixture . Once completed , all edges are debarred via stoning . <p> With the receiver now in tolerance , it is time for welding . The bayonet lug , foregrip and pistol grip lugs , barrel trunnion , barrel nut catch housing and butt plate are all TIG welded into position while using special holding fixtures to assure correct placement and 3 axis alignment . Once completed and passing inspection , the front and rear sight brackets are then fixtured in place and spot welded . <p> With this work completed , it is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the entire receiver up to commercial standard . No jagged edges , globs of weld , non-square comers , etc . All are brought up to the highest standard possible . Then , the front and rear sight holes are drilled out on a press and tapped with the appropriate threads . The final work on the receiver , before the first grit blasting and heat treating , is the riveting of the sling swivel to the left side . This is done via a special support fixture and pneumatic riveting equipment . Now , time for case hardening . <p> The Group Industries receiver is unique among all those produced by IMI , FN , Lyttleton or RH-ALAN : it is case hardened . When a typical UZI is used over a very long period of time the rails on the bottom of the bolt may wear longitudinal grooves into the receiver . This can lead to incorrect stripping/chambering of the cartridge , alteration of sear release geometry , etc . Mind you , we are talking about a lot of firing being done to achieve these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver is the registered part , Vector wanted to make sure it would not wear out . The bolt can be replaced , not so the receiver . <p> To harden the Vector receiver via a carburizing process , it is first placed in a special oxygen-free oven at 1500F and then exposed for four hours to carbon gas . This penetrates the metal surface to a depth of .015 " . Then , it is quenched in oil to bring the receiver hardness towards 60C on the Rockwell scale . As this is too brittle , it is then tempered to bring the hardness down to the acceptable range of 35C . By doing so the skin of the receiver is hard ( resists wear ) while the interior is relatively soft ( absorbs shock ) . Even though normal UZI receivers are noted for their toughness , this receiver is simply not going to wear out . <p> A little known fact is that the UZI ejector is also heat treated . The Vector UZI ejector is of a higher Rockwell number than the receiver , therefore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once this is done , it is time for finishing . <p> The parkerized finish of the Vector is first class and bears special examination . After grit blasting the UZI receiver/parts with #80 aluminum oxide grit to remove hardening scale ( receiver ) and existing finish ( the parts ) , it is then dipped in a low flashpoint Stoddard solvent cleaning tank to ensure all grit dust and contaminants are removed . Next , it is transferred to the Parco Lubrite #2 parkerizing tank and immersed for 15 minutes at 205F . When removed , the acid is neutralized via dipping into a hot water wash tank ; when brought out of this tank the heated metal rapidly air dries itself . Finally , everything is dipped into a tank of light oil so the parkerizing 's crystalline structure will readily absorb the petroleum and provide the necessary protective surface . <p> The final step in production is to carefully assemble all the parts into a Vector UZI , gauge/examine it for fit of parts , smoothness of action , etc . Firing tests are done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the functioning of the first and last rounds as this is where the greatest malfunction chance occurs . Upon passing these tests it is then cleaned up and boxed into inventory . <p> Evaluation of the Vector UZI <p> The Vector UZI is an UZI .... there is nothing new or unique about it since the 1MI version first emerged in 1951 . It fires from the open bolt , while cyclic operation is based on the blowback principle . As it is a select fire weapon , the safety lever located by the right thumb of the firing hand allows Auto-Repetitive-Safe operation . The Vector UZI uses the traditional A-R-S markings are seen on many IMI and most FN versions . <p> Starting from the front and moving backwards , the first item to observe is the barrel itself . It is 10.2 " long and has a 4-groove RH twist of 1:10 . The chamber has been cut slightly larger than that of the IMI semi-auto carbine as it must handle rapid cycling of the brass cartridge case . This one modification alone will solve a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined and thus the firing of corrosive ammo must be followed up immediately with a good hot soapy water scrubbing and appropriate oiling . <p> The next item is the ratcheting top cover . This is exactly what late production IMI/FN full auto UZI 's used and is a key safety component . Since the Vector fires from an open bolt , anytime the bolt slams home and there is a round in the chamber and/or magazine it will fire . This is inherently unsafe and requires this special top cover . The cocking knob is directly attached to the ratchet assembly , which contains a small pawl . When the knob is pulled back to cock the bolt , the pawl clicks against the ratchet teeth and will not let the bolt slide home if it is accidentally released before the sear can engage the trip ledge . Thus , this overcomes a major safety concern of all open bolt firearms . Ralph did the right thing by insuring his UZI has a ratcheting top cover . <p> Next up is the Vector pistol grip assembly . As earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interchange freely with their equivalent SMG assembly . The selector lever on the Vector pistol grip assembly is the traditional A-R-S version . When moved to the rear detent , it is on safe . One click forward is repetitive ( semi-auto ) and a final click forward is full auto . The thumb grip safety is retained and adds further security when handling the weapon . Once you are used to achieving a proper firing grip it falls quite naturally to hand . <p> The Vector boll deserves special attention . With the proliferation of the 950 B&amp;G Machine registered bolts , some visibility has been given to what kind of bolt an UZI has and its method of construction . As most B&amp;G bolts were hurriedly investment cast of 8620 steel this led in some cases to problems during cooling with dimensional integrity . This is not the case with the Vector bolt . It was machined from high grade 4140 billet steel then carefully hardened and quenched . With normal ( and some abnormal ) use it will last for the life of the UZI . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip " SMG type and achieves a very firm grip on the brass case . A final note of interest : close examination behind its ejection cutout will show a " Circle P " stamped proofmark . This indicates the Pretoria arsenal where it was made quality parts meant for use in a very dirty African war . <p> Unlike registered bolt guns , the registered receiver Vector does not have a bolt blocking rail . Also , it has the taller SMG ejector which gives a very positive kick to the case during extraction . The feed ramp does not carry the barrel restrictor ring as found on IMI semi-auto carbines . The feed ramp also does not support/interfere with the chamber end of the barrel in any way .... it simply and reliably guides the cartridge into the barrel . The front and rear sights are exactly as found on the IMI SMG and Model A carbine . This means a special front sight adjusting tool ( widely available ) is needed to make aiming corrections . Finally , the folding stock is exactly as found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow breaking down and locking forward under the receiver . <p> Testing of the Vector UZI <p> The unloaded Vector UZI weighs 7.81bs and is 25.5 " long with the stock open , and 18.5 " with the stock collapsed . The barrel is 10.2 " long and retained via the large barrel nut which screws down over the mounting flange . Sights are the exact same as the IMI SMG and Model A , with a 100/200m rear flip sight and windage/elevation adjusted through the eccentric front sight . The plastic furniture is optionally green or black . The black plastic grips which came with the evaluation model had been in storage for many years and did not have the substantial appearance of the IMI grips . However , Vector Arms has now contracted with Prestige Plastics , of Louisville , KY , for a large production run of very high quality furniture . These newer grips are currently available and look beautiful . <p> Firing the Vector is exactly the same as the IMI UZI . Squeeze the thumb safety on the back of the pistol grip assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ratchet assembly lightly click its way through the top cover teeth . When it strikes the rear of the slot , let go and the knob will spring forward while the bolt is held to the rear by the sear pads . Place the selector switch on " S " . Insert the 25-round magazine into the mag well opening and snap it into place . Take up a good shooting position and ensure the backstop is appropriate . Sight on the target , squeeze the thumb safety with the web of your hand and slide the selector switch forward to either " R " or " A " . Press the trigger and the fun will immediately begin . <p> The Vector UZI cyclic rate is the same as the IMI SMG - approximately 650rpm . You will feel each individual round as it goes off and can easily traverse your fire to match the target(s) . The muzzle of the UZI will lightly rock up-and-down as the heavy bolt reciprocates . After the 3-4th round of a burst is fired it is easy to adjust impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the UZI is a second generation SMG and it is heavy when compared to newer competitors ... big deal . This increased heft smothers the 9mm recoil and gives a very high feeling of user confidence . <p> My test Vector exhibited only two minor problems as received : the black plastic grips which have since been corrected ; and , one locknut from a handguard screw fell off . The locknuts are difficult to screw all the way down as they must be tightened with a small spanner wrench . After a lot of firing the vibration may cause the nut to back off until it falls out . Vector Arms immediately replaced it with a new one after a quick phone call ; a homemade tool is simple to fabricate and will eliminate this problem which affects all UZI 's . My personal IMI SMG has also dropped one or two . <p> That was it ... the Vector UZI functioned flawlessly after firing over 2,000 rounds - without ever being cleaned a single time ! <p> Warranty and Accessories <p> The first Vector UZI was shipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , they come in a sturdy cardboard box with a 25-round magazine , owners manual and warranty card . The warranty card really catches your interest as it covers the SMG for one year on materials and workmanship .

Original IMI wooden buttstocks , a very well done vertical foregrip , .45ACP conversion kit , BFA , bayonet , front sight wrench , cordura nylon assault case , etc. are all available . Perhaps the one option which every UZI owner should consider is Vector 's soon-to-be released .22RF conversion kit . During my conversations with Ralph he stated that it will drop in and function with both registered receiver AND registered bolt UZI 's . <p> Another option being offered is a suppressor which is licensed from a world famous Swiss firm and made here in the US . It features CNC machining of the internals and thus allows operator disassembly/reassembly with little fear of resulting misalignment . For ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel modifications . Cost is $450 for 9mm and $475 for .45ACP . <p> Finally , Vector Arms will work on your UZI even if they did not make it . If you need a tuneup or major rework , Ralph can do it ... this includes case hardening your own receiver . Further , ATF allows registered bolt owners the option to remove the barrel restrictor ring , align bore the barrel trunnion to fit SMG barrels and enlarge the receiver sear openings . The cost is typically $30 per operation . So , for about $100 Ralph can upgrade your registered bolt UZI to take advantage of cheap SMG barrels and full auto sears with their larger pads . <p> Conclusion <p> Ralph Merrill and Vector Arms have truly created the ultimate UZI .

@@77050534 @5750534/ <p> IMI shipped two flavors of the semi automatic UZI carbine to the United States - the Model A and the Model B. The difference between the two are slight and people often ask how to tell them apart . With one of each in hand , I did a side by side comparison .

The left side of the receiver , under the rear sight , will be stamped either Model A or Model B. <p> Front Sight : <p> Probably the most talked about difference between the two models is the sights . The Model A shipped with the sights originally designed for the UZI SMG . The Model B shipped with sights that were designed for the newer Mini UZI .

A different sight adjustment tool is used for each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to tell the difference between the A and B at a distance is the rear sight .

One is marked for 100 yeards and one marked for 200 yeards . The distance is selected by flipping the L sight forward or backward . The Model A sight was originally designed for the 10 " SMG barrel so it tends to shoot high with the 16 " semi barrel . On the Model B , the rear sight is also an L shaped peep sight but it 's windage adjustable .

The ejector pivots this safety arm out of the way when the bolt closes . This safety mechanism can be found on all closed bolt UZIs , including the Mini UZI and the UZI Pistol . <p> Ejector : <p> I 've heard that the ejector on the Model B was lower but that did not seem to be the case on the gun I examined . The only difference was that the rear corner of the Model B ejector was cut at an angle .

The receivers on both the Model A and B have flat spots above the sling swivel stud . Some ( but not all ) Model A 's have a larger stud with two flat spots on it .

@@77050541 @5750541/ <p> If you have an UZI , you probably have a lot of magazines . If you have a lot of magazines , you know that it can take some time to get them all loaded before a trip to the range . Fortunately , there are a number of good loaders to help you with that process . UZI magazine loaders operate in basically one of two ways . The first type of loader depresses the magazine follower , allowing you to slide the next round in easily . The second type of loader pushes rounds directly into the magazine . This works because UZI magazines are double wide all the way to the feed lips , as opposed to older style magazines that were double stacked but narrowed down to single column near the feed lips . This type of push loader holds rounds above the magazine and the operator pushes the column of ammo directly down into the magazine . Load time can be significantly decreased , though the force required to push down the rounds can bring back some wear and tear on the thumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that you need to load a magazine without a loader . The easiest way to load an UZI magazine without any tools is by " bump " loading . To bump load a magazine , set one round on top of the magazine feed lips . Grip the magazine with one had and place the thumb of that same hand over the round to be loaded . Lift the magazine up and strike the bottom of the magazine on a hard surface like a table . The sudden stop will cause the follower and any rounds already in the magazine to depress the magazine spring , allowing the new round to be pushed into place with very little pressure on your thumb . This technique actually works better once you have a few rounds in the magazine due to the increased momentum that compresses the magazine spring . <p> LULA Loader <p> The excellent LULA loader is now available for the UZI . The loader snaps onto the top of an UZI magazine and each time the lever is moved forward or backward , it pushes the follower down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with zero resistance . As fast as it loads magazines , it can unload them even faster . You wo n't find a better loader . The LULA is made by maglula in Israel and is available through resellers that carry Butler Creek products . <p> IMI 5 Round Loader <p> This simple loader produced by IMI sits on top of the magazine and allows five rounds to be stacked in place , ready to load . All you have to do is push the rounds straight down into the magazine . It works well but you 'll find that you want to push the rounds down with something other than your thumb . The long finger sticking out the bottom of the loader is for unloading magazines . Here 's the original instruction sheet provided by Action Arms . <p> IMI Magazine Loader <p> This simple loader slides over the top of a magazine and depresses the magazine follower , making it easier to slide in the next round . It 's designed to use with single feed position magazines , like the .45 ACP and .41AE magazines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cammenga Loader <p> The Cammenga loader is an all plastic push down style loader that holds up to 16 rounds . A magazine is slid into the end of a full loader and the handle is depressed to force all the rounds into the magazine . The Cammenga works great on IMI 25 round magazines . Other magazines ( including IMI 32 round and contract magazines like the South African 25 round magazines ) often fit tightly in the loader . Grinding or cutting away some material on the magazine loader may be necessary to get a good fit . The Cammenga loader is available from a number of vendors including Vector Arms . <p> Kvar Loader <p> The Kvar loader is the same design as the Cammenga loader but its construction is all metal rather than plastic . Up to 16 rounds are loaded in the tray , the cover is closed , the loader is placed on top of a magazine and the charging handle is depressed to push all rounds into the magazine . <p> Rapid Loader <p> The C3 Rapid Loader was designed after the Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but instead of the loader holding the ammo , the loader is fed by 30 round plastic clips - five rows of six rounds . Each push of the loader plunger pushes another six rounds into the magazine and then the clip is gravity fed to align the next six rounds . A full magazine can easily be loaded in 2-3 seconds . One does have to preload the clips , but that can be done at any time and stored that way for the next trip to the range . <p> The C3 Rapid Loader is no longer manufactured but there are quite a number still around . Finding spare clips is the hard part and the value of this loader really hinges on having a lot of spare clips . Fortunately the metal clips from Swedish K practice ammo work great in the Rapid Loader . The metal clips are 36 round ( six rows of six ) and function just like the original plastic clips . Check out this suggestion for loading the clips. 
@@77050542 @5750542/ <p> Like other semi-auto derivatives of ex-military pattern machine guns , the UZI semi-auto carbine had to undergo a significant redesign from the SMG parent in order to pass the BATFs measuring stick to allow importation and sale to U.S. citizens as a Title I firearm . Obviously , such changes are made with the intention of NOT allowing an easy conversion into a machine gun , and it is important to fully understand these engineering changes . A proper , safe , and legal conversion will have retained the inherent safety features of the parent SMG design , while rendering as close as mechanically possible a virtual copy of the SMG functionality and aesthetically . Israel Military Industries ( IMI ) , unfortunately for the NFA collector community , went far beyond the absolute minimum changes required from the SMG design to allow importation and sale in this country . These extra semi-auto only features are the central focus of most of the complaints leveled at conversions of these guns , with regard to function and user-friendliness . <p> The differences between a functional conversion ( one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and a complete conversion ( one that virtually replicates the original SMG in all aspects including function , parts interchangeability , and appearance ) , are significant . They can cause extreme variations in the fair price range of differing guns . To gain a complete understanding of the selection and desirability of available guns out there , let 's first take a look at the basic mechanical differences between the SMG and the semi-auto carbine ( as originally imported . ) <p> The single most important difference between the original SMG and the semi-auto carbine is in the respective methods of operation . The SMG fires from the open-bolt position using a fixed firing pin . The carbine had to be redesigned to fire from the closed-bolt position , utilizing a striker . This was solely to pass importation restrictions based upon a pending ruling prohibiting the manufacture of semi-auto Title I guns that fired from an open bolt . To this end there were several significant design changes made . The first was the installation on the rear upper right side of the sheet metal receiver of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " blocking rail " ) that prevented the drop-in installation of the SMG type , fixed firing pin , open bolt . In order to accommodate the blocking rail inside the receiver the semi-auto bolt has a full-length notch cut in its upper right side to allow passage over the blocking rail . Since the gun could not use a fixed firing pin a striker mechanism was incorporated into the bolt group , which now comprised a slightly shorter bolt with a full length hole drilled through its center to accommodate a moving firing pin , this pin came forward upon , sear release , to strike the cartridge primer . The bolt itself merely reciprocated within the length of the receiver housing , with each shot closing upon the freshly chambered round . The striker assembly stayed caught by the sear in the same rear position of the former SMG open bolt . The striker assembly itself comprised the long firing pin and square section of steel that has a sear holding notch cut into its bottom surface , along with a separate spring to provide the striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the main recoil spring ( attached in the familiar place on the bolt itself ) , and the smaller striker spring . There is an interconnecting slot cut into the left side bottom of the semi-auto bolt to mate with the long arm of the striker assembly . This assures proper alignment during movement . Due to the fact that the striker arm ( contained the single sear notch ) the right bottom ridge of the semi-auto bolt that would normally contain a sear notch in the SMG bolt is milled open from the rear of the ejection opening , to slightly ahead of it . The SMG bolt is solid on top and side faces , except for the sear holding notch , and the ejection port opening . To finish out the bolt group changes , The SMG has a different type of extractor than the semi-auto bolt . The lip of the semi-auto extractor is considerably thinner and shallower than that installed on the SMG bolt , for unknown reasons . It is clearly desirable to have the SMG version installed in a full-auto gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely interchangeable . Lastly , a note is in order on the two different kinds of semi-auto bolts on Model A guns , as this has an important bearing on how these guns may have been converted to the full-auto fire mode . When IMI first designed the Model A semi-auto bolt the bolt face was identical to the SMG open-bolt design ( save for the deletion of the fixed firing pin ) in that it incorporated a full-circumference cartridge holding rim . This cartridge holding rim was designed to snap around the base rim of the cartridge and hold it in position as it entered the chamber , just prior to contact with the fixed firing pin . Later Model A , and all Model B , guns have the lower section of this rim machined off , as another disabling design feature , to preclude easy modification to full-auto fire , as will now be discussed below . <p> Now , with the mode of fire changed , the fire controls had to be similarly altered . All fire-control parts are contained in a separate housing attached centrally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprises the pistol grip and the magazine well . The SMG fire-control assembly allows for three control positions , safe , semi-auto , and full-auto . The selector levers have a small right angle , finger-like , bent piece of metal which , in a SMG installation , moves forward and bypasses the disconnector function in the fully forward full-auto position . For semi-auto fire to occur it is placed in the middle position , where it can function the disconnector , releasing the sear after the trigger nose drops . To force the condition of semi-auto operation , whereby the disconnector is activated continuously , it would be required to mechanically preclude the selector from moving forward past this point . The alterations were made to the semi-auto grip housing by adding a small block of metal inside the front center shelf of this housing to preclude the selector from moving forward enough to engage the full-auto position on the trigger nose , and by-pass the disconnector . The selector levers themselves are the same except for deletion of the third selector position notch . Very early semi-auto selectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three control position notches already cut . Later versions deleted the third position . Concurrent with the changes in the semi-auto guns which resulted in their being redesignated as Model B , all versions of UZI selector levers had a vertical safety tang added to the upper surface of the lever , which prevented the sear from dropping ( by blocking the left underside sear finger , in the same mechanical fashion as the right underside finger is blocked by the vertical tang of the grip safety ) until the selector switch was moved into one of the fire positions . <p> The only other difference in the fire control parts relates to the sear itself . The SMG sear is quite noticeably larger on the fingers that protrude up into the receiver to catch the bolt . In comparison , the semi sear , because it only had to restrain the much lighter striker mass , has smaller fingers . The smaller semi sear will work but is NOT recommended , as excessive wear can result . A proper conversion will have the sear projection holes in the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the factory SMG sear to be installed and function . This was not always done , and on conversion guns utilizing a registered bolt it may be looked upon as an illegal receiver modification by BATF , unless the bolt was permanently married to the receiver by serial number on the transfer form . ( A note on all UZI sears ; the sears , by design , are made to a less hardened surface treatment than the bolt so that when wear does occur , and it will , the comparatively cheaper sear can be replaced rather than the entire expensive bolt . A highly worn sear can allow runaway fire , in slips over the rounded , worn , sear fingers so always check the sear condition on a regular basis ! ) <p> Lastly , on the fire control group , the axis pins that hold on the lower receiver control group onto the upper receiver have two different size mounting pins/holes , again to preclude a direct swapping of the SMG group onto the semi-auto receiver . The SMG uses a 8mm pins and receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver holes . This prevents an SMG lower from being pinned on without enlarging the pinholes in the SMG trigger housing . You will still have to use 9mm pins to mount it . With the availability of parts kit guns now so abundant many people have chosen to install a real SMG lower , either for increased reliability , or just to get the Hebrew markings of the Israeli originals . <p> Jumping back up into the front of the receiver , we discover yet another joyous collection of maddening alterations that hinder our journey back to the world of the original SMG configuration . The two most often heard complaints about owning a conversion SMG relate to the barrel selection availability and mounting problems . IMI thoughtfully left no stone unturned when redesigning the UZI for semi-auto sale in the U.S. Their most fondly remembered alterations prevent the installation and usage of cheap and plentiful SMG short barrels , instead forcing the owner of an SMG conversion that has not been fully SMG configured to resort to modifying and cutting down semi-auto barrels . Thankfully they are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noted that possession of one of these short barrels that will drop into a semi-auto UZI and the semi-auto UZI itself would comprise possession of a short barreled rifle , requiring registration under Title II of the 1968 Gun Control Act . ) The semi-auto is different from the SMG as regards barrel mounting in two important aspects . First , the actual barrel trunnion , which forms the heart of the forward part of the upper receiver by being welded into place , has a smaller diameter passage hole for the barrel flanges than on the SMG . This prevents an SMG barrel from being slipped into the trunnion . On the front of the magazine well , inside the bottom of the receiver , is welded on both SMG and semi-auto versions a cartridge feed ramp to guide the nose of the bullet into the chamber of the barrel . On the original SMG version that is all that it is , a cartridge guide . On the semi-auto version it also contains a thick ring which serves to hold the rear end of the barrel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevents the larger rear diameter of a standard SMG barrel from being inserted and utilized in the semi-auto conversion that does not have these two features fixed . So one has to either cut and recrown the semi-auto barrels , or turn down the flanges on the SMG versions . A proper and complete conversion will have had the trunnion passage hole bored out to SMG spec , and the barrel ring milled off the feed ramp . <p> The last important difference between the SMG and the semi-auto carbine is in the design of the top covers . The SMG cover has an extra mechanism in the cocking track designed to prevent inadvertent discharge of the weapon if the cocking knob is accidentally released prior to full rearward travel being reached and sear lock-up of the bolt . This is commonly called a ratcheting top cover , due to the small ratchet mechanism which will catch and hold the bolt . This is only a feature in the open-bolt guns . It is not found , or needed , in a closed bolt firing weapon . The visible tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the top cover bottom track . Semi-auto tracks are smooth for their entire length . There is also a slight difference in the length of the cut opening between the SMG and semi-auto carbine top cover tracks , which will be explained below . A proper conversion need not have this ratcheting top cover to function correctly , but anything designed , and available to the owner/operator , for safety reasons should be utilized . It is not possible to modify the semi-auto top cover for this ratcheting mechanism ( for all practical purposes at least ) , so most complete conversions will have this entire assembly exchanged for a standard SMG unit . The other bonus benefit to this exchange of top covers is that the semi-auto carbine has a lengthy and annoying warning against illegal conversions stamped into the cocking knob slide , and since we 're discussing a legal NFA registered weapon , it 's only fitting to eliminate such aggravating visible verbiage on the exterior of the weapon . ( See Photo on page 73 . ) <p> There is one more aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns could utilize either a folding metal stock or a fixed wooden one . The folders attach semi-permanently in the same fashion on either gun , but on the SMG the wooden stock is provisioned for quick detachment by a release lever on the stock underside . On the semi-auto carbine , the wooden stock is semi-permanently attached . The SMG quick-detach wooden stock will interchange for those who so desire .

@@77050545 @5750545/ <p> The UZI was manufactured in standard calibers and as such , there is a wide variety of sources for ammunition . Off the shelf commercial ammo , military surplus and home reloads can all be used successfully . One rule of thumb to remember is that UZI 's like hot ammo . Most commercial 9mm and .45 ACP ammo is loaded for use in pistols . The heaver bolt and recoil springs of an UZI function more reliably with ammo that is hotter than you 'd normally run in a pistol , and the robust design of the UZI can easily stand the added pressure of these rounds . <p> One warning to keep in mind : you should not use aluminum cased ammo in an open bolt submachine gun . An open bolt gun like the UZI uses the principle of advanced primer ignition , and sometimes a round may be discharged without being fully chambered .

@@77050551 @5750551/ <p> In the July issue of FIREPOWER , we made the statement that the UZI carbine was the most logical semi-automatic weapon to convert to select fire . To reiterate why , we refer you to that issue . In this article we want to take an overview into practical ways to accomplish the conversion . Also , we 're assuming the reader is already familiar with the carbine mechanism . <p> Conversion methods have , because of BATF rulings , changed from what was done in the beginning . Early attention was focused on the bolt . Before commercially made , open firing bolts were available , only the skilled machinist would attempt to alter the existing bolt . Soon , bolts were marketed that were designed to replace the original . They were the same size and used the original recoil spring and large rubber buffer block . This , naturally , resulted in a faster than normal cyclic rate . These bolts had a groove machined into the side to clear the blocking bar . IMI had welded this bar inside the receiver to prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lever , or simply removing it , full auto fire could be achieved with the new style bolts . <p> Before too long the BATF ruled that such a bolt constituted a machine gun by an interpretation of the statute that says : " . . . any part or group of parts that can readily convert . .. " . This means that possession of this bolt - now a legally defined machine gun must be accompanied by a $200 tax stamp . The " machine gun " can then legally be installed into your carbine . However , do n't  add a short barrel to your " carbine " as this transforms it into a " sort barreled rifle " ! A bit confusing to say the least . <p> Today , such bolts have all but disappeared . The only thing that comes close is some that are still available where the slot has been plugged and welded . The user must remove the plug and has the responsibility of obtaining a BATF Form 1 approval before doing so . To complete this type of conversion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are full ( SMG ) size and utilize a longer stroke . This necessitates elongating the rear of the cocking knob slot by 5/8 inch . <p> The trigger housing can be permanently altered into near " factory original " configuration or you can install one of the replacement levers such as the " Kicker " by Arm-Tec , Inc. , and the " Two-Step " by Best Tool &amp; Equip . Co . These selectors are cleverly made in such a manner as to allow select fire . Still providing a " safe " position , they require no matching of a lower housing . While not necessary , a better appearance can be had by affixing a plate , either permanent or removable , that indicates the three selector positions . <p> Another method of conversion is to utilize an open firing bolt that is devoid of any clearance groove . These bolts are readily available and at this time are legal to purchase and possess . When you alter the receiver to accept one , then you need prior BATF approval . This complete conversion method is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UZI . When carefully done , it produces a nearly " factory original " submachine gun . <p> A small amount of machine work is required and can be accomplished with the most basic of tools . Probably the most difficult job is " neatly " using number and letter stamps to correctly indicate the select lever positions and to place your identification on the receiver . <p> From an economic standpoint , you will have a good investment . A weapon will have been created that is worth more than was spent on the entire package . As we stated in the last issue of FIREPOWER , it makes little sense to make a select fire weapon when the cost exceeds what you would pay for a factory made one . However , in the case of the UZI , the only select fire models which are legal for civilians to possess are those which have been converted from semi-auto after being imported into this country . <p> Besides the bolt , you will need a new buffer/spring assembly . Machine gun type extractors are also available and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has had a corner machined off . The replacement features a wider lip and is considered more reliable . Another item which you might want , although the difference is purely cosmetic , is the small cover plate that covers the cocking knob slot . The original has some writing stamped on it while the replacement is plain . <p> One last replacement item that we feel is worthy of mention is the select lever knob . The original is molded from plastic and is rather small for quick , reliable operation . Best Tool &amp; Equip. , Hico , TX 76457 , makes an ideal replacement knob . It is larger and is made of aluminum . It is available not only in black , but also in red or blue anodized finish . <p> With all the short barrels available , one shouldnt even consider cutting the original carbine barrel down . Keep it as it is . Replacement barrels , in 10 inch length , can be purchased plain or threaded 1/2-28 with a removable adapter to fit the 9mm ( MAC 10 ) Sionics suppressor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniper " barrel is available from Scherer , Gilberts , IL , 60136 .

Has anyone solved this problem ? What are your thoughts everybody ? <p> To address the concerns noted in the video ( high rate of fire and potential damage to the registered receiver ) a number of users will do much of what the video shows , that is , add a stiffer recoil spring and heavier buffer ( available in several weights from a number of vendors ) . Also some users put stainless steel hammer and trigger pins in as Colts began doing with theirs years ago . KNS anti-rotation pins ( which are stainless steel ) are also fairly commonly used . The CMMG bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tungsten insert . Hydraulic buffers are sometimes used and are said to reduce " choppy " feel . Adding too much buffer weight and/or using too stiff a spring may cause the firearm to reach a Fail To Eject mode , or Fail To Cycle properly mode such that a new round is not stripped from the magazine . <p> It is important to keep in mind that the AR platform was not designed for blow back operation . As such , the blow back implementations will present compromises that are not in and/or different from those in the normal operational mode . <p> And then there those who who will buy a Registered Drop In Auto Sear and install it in a relatively low cost AR-15 lower which can be beaten to a worthless lump with impunity . <p> I use my SGW RR with a 9mm upper in subgun matches all the time . I use a JP Enterprises 9mm bolt with a VLTOR A5 buffer system with their heaviest buffer , a Geissele SSF fire control group , and KNS anti rotation pins . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower after thousands and thousands of rounds over the past couple years . I also use the exact same lower configuration with an 18 " heavy barreled upper for ' belt fed ' matches . The only change I make is to replace the collapsible stock with the Magpul fixed stock that goes over a carbine buffer tube . The same gun on full auto can shoot 9mm triples into 2 " at 25 feet or hit a man size target at 600 yards in 5.56 . It 's a beautiful thing . <p> Our belt fed 9mm system uses a standard 3 oz buffer and the recoil is like firing a .22 which is pretty awesome in full auto . You do n't have to worry about the lower as the energy is absorbed by the mechanism that advances the belt . <p> Do the M16 . You wo n't regret it . When I was working at the shop I always told people if they could swing the cash my first two MGs would be a M16 and an HK sear . Best bang for your buck because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own a couple of MP5 's , but for some reason the M16 in 9mm is still by far my favorite shooting subgun . I mean do n't get me wrong the MP5SD is hard to beat for looks and being a crowd pleaser , but the M16 is dear to me . I 've shot tens of thousands of rounds through four or five different set ups , I 've always used a ramped bolt and KNS pins . No noticeable wear on any of my lowers . <h> Smooth is Relative <p> The MP5 is smoother shooting than the best case M16 9mm in my experience . If you are getting trigger slap with the M16 , then it is a sign of the hammer over-traveling and hitting the disconnector and could eventually result in broken pins and/or possible wallowing of the pin holes in the receiver . Not all M16 9MM set-ups have this problem , but if you do there are real fixes for this - it is a solvable problem . A " smoothed " M16 9mm is one of my favorites to shoot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short order since they are so fun to shoot . I hope to try the FM9 soon . It looks pretty smooth from the vids I 've seen ... <p> Beowulf , I have the same set up from MA . Just waiting on my Sendra to clear . Any pointers on reliability in FA ? <p> Go with a standard carbine buffer weight . Heavier weights will cause it to jam up . That 's been the biggest thing for me .

Cosmetically , the fit , finish and welds were first rate , to me anyway , there was one very small spot by the flash suppressor where the finish was a little thin . Retractable buttstock , trigger pack , and forearm all fit nice and snug with virtually no play . Bipod snaps on and off easily , though one leg is a little stiff to deploy . Function was checked with 2 40 rd. aluminum mags and one 25 rd. steel HK mag . FWIW , the 40 rd. aluminum that was supplied with the rifle has been refinished in a nice flat black . I used 55 gr. fmj remanufactured ammo from HSM , and 55 gr. fmj Wolf new manufactured polymer coated ammo . So far functioning has been perfect with all mags and both types of ammo , both rapic and slow fire , I 'm up to around 350 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HSM ammo , but with the Wolf I was getting 3-4 " groups at 100 m with the open factory sights .

Acted a little squirrely at first . However , once it started running , it ran fine . Also checked it with the Registered Sear , and it ran fine in FA , as well . Only 100 rounds or so , so far . Will wring it out more next week .

@@77050558 @5750558/ <p> The basic process of purchasing NFA weapons does n't really differ that much from state to state or from one locale to another . You generally can either get them or you ca n't . A few states do n't allow them at all , or allow some but not others . A few states allow them but have their own registration requirements . If you live any where in the US that allows NFA weapons , and your CLEO will sign , the basic procedure is like this : <p> Once you have located an NFA weapon to purchase , it will need to be transferred to the state you live in before it can transferred to you . Most people selling a weapon are going to require you to pay for the weapon prior to them transferring out of their state . If it is in the hands of a private party , it is usually considered acceptable for them to transfer the weapon to a dealer in their home state prior to you paying . Once in the hands of a licensed dealer in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state dealer , who in turn pays the private party . Note that this is n't a required way of doing things , just a common and safe way for all involved . Once paid , the dealer transfers the item to a dealer in your state using a BATF form 5320.3 ( aka form 3 ) . This will take around 4-5 weeks , depending on BATF and there is no federal tax on that transfer . Alternatively , a private seller could transfer directly to a dealer in your state . In either case , the transfer from a private seller to any dealer requires an approved BATF form 5320.4 ( aka form 4 ) and a $200 tax . The seller may require that you pay for that first transfer tax . Be sure to clarify that with the seller as part of your purchase agreement . <p> If you are buying the NFA weapon from an out of state dealer rather than a private party , you pay the selling dealer for the weapon and they can transfer it to a dealer in your state by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final twist is that if you are an FFL holder ( or C&amp;R holder if you are buying a C&amp;R NFA weapon ) , the out of state dealer can transfer directly to you on a form 4 . <p> Once in the weapon is in your state ( either at a dealer or if the seller is already in your state ) , you are ready to start the form 4 that will transfer the weapon to you . If you bought the weapon from out of state and your dealer is just helping with the transfer , it 's likely that he will charge you a fee , which has nothing to do with the federal transfer tax you 'll need to pay . Common dealer transfer fees are around $100 . You will need two copies of BATF form 5320.4 ( form 4 ) , one certificate of compliance form ( proof of citizenship ) , two photo 's ( passport size - aka 2 " x 2 " ) and two fingerprint cards . Your local dealer should be able to get you the form 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be obtained by contacting the BATF or from an on-line source . As for the fingerprint cards , it 's important that you use a card properly formatted for the BATF . The cards have an area ( ORI field ) that must have the ORI for the BATF in Wash . DC . If you get your cards from a local PD it will have the local PD 's ORI and will not be accepted by the BATF . If you have to use a local fingerprint card , get a blank , white sticker and cover the local PD ORI . Fill in <p> DCATF0100 AT&amp;F FIREARMS &amp; EXPLO DIV WASH , DC <p> Filling out the form 4 requires specific info from the weapon and from your dealer so the dealer should help you with this . Once the form 4 's are filled out ( fill both out by hand rather than photocopying ) , attach the two photos - one to each copy of the form . The photos can be glued , taped or stapled to the form 4 . Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement agency that has jurisdiction where you reside ( unless you are purchasing this weapon for some sort of job requirement ) . Get your fingerprints taken ( usually a charge for this so bring money ) and either request to see the Chief/Sheriff or drop off the forms for him to sign . In most small counties you will just go in and see the CLEO . In most large counties you will just drop off the forms and be called when they are signed . Again BIG NOTE , you should already know if your CLEO will sign for these types of weapons before purchasing . Your local dealer should be able to give you at least a clue . <p> Once you get your forms back from the CLEO , take them , the fingerprint cards , the certificate of compliance ( proof of citizenship ) , and a check or money order for $200.00 made out to the Dept. of the Treasury , and mail it all off to the address on the form 4 . Sometimes the dealer will do this for you , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your first ever application of any kind to the BATF it will take a few months to process . It 's been known to take as much as six months average at some times , but should take more like three months . If you have already purchased an NFA weapon in the past year or if you have an FFL , the process can be much quicker IF you alert the examiner to your previous transaction . They will not automatically know . After September 11 , 2001 , the FBI started pre-screening and de-contaminating fingerprint cards before they process them . This has slowed the process by a few more weeks but it is unknown how long this procedure will be in place . <p> Once the BATF approves the form 4 they will retain 1 copy for their records and send the other back to your dealer . NOTE , under the law , the seller is the person paying the tax . Therefore if you have any questions during this lengthy wait , the BATF will not talk to you in any great detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . If you have any questions , you need to speak to your dealer . Be patient , dealers ca n't do anything to speed up the process , and constantly pestering them will only make them not answer your calls .

@@77050574 @5750574/ <p> The semi automatic Mini UZI Carbine did not enter the US until 1987 - after the May 1986 ban on new transferable machineguns - so the variety and number of converted IMI Mini 's is limited . The Mini UZI SMG was in the US before 1986 as dealer samples so there were some around for class II dealers to copy . One option they had before 1986 was to chop down the receiver on a full size UZI in the same way that Vector chopped down some of the full sized Group Industries receivers . These guns are referred to as " re-welds " ( from the fact that the receiver had to be welded back together after being cut down ) and Fleming did some conversions this way .. <h> Sears:Fleming also did some registered sears for the Mini UZI that are permanently married to the receivers . Fleming was registering regular UZI SMG sears before 1986 then installing them after 1986 . He would install them in a full size UZI by removing the bolt blocking rail , or in the Mini UZI by relieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory open bolt . ATF stopped him from doing any more in 1988 , so there was a window from 1987 to1988 when these Mini 's were done . This is the only option to have a fully transferable IMI Mini UZI that has the relieved trunion and is not a re-weld . While there is nothing wrong with most re-welds , this is the closest you can possibly get to a factory Mini UZI SMG that is fully transferable . <h> Qualified also made some registered sears that were not married to any receivers but they are extremely rare . <h> Bolts:The most common of the Mini UZI conversions is the registered bolt . These were made by cutting down registered full size UZI bolts and therefore most of them do not have the two feet on the front of the bolt . In addition to missing the feet , the front of the bolt has to be re-welded <p> So just what are those feet ? The " feet " are the two rails that project out the front of the bolt . When the bolt closes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trunion . IMI chose this design because it allowed them to reduce the length of the receiver and the overall weight of the gun , both of which were important design goals of the Mini UZI . The sear stops the bolt on the front of those feet , ensuring that the bolt face is far enough back for the gun to cycle properly . But what happens on a converted bolt with no feet ? Let 's take a look . <p> Full Size UZI : <p> For comparison , this is a picture of a full size UZI with its bolt charged . Notice how much distance there is between the bolt face and the back of the dummy round . This ensures that the bolt gets a " running start " and has plenty of momentum to strip off the first round . <p> Factory Mini UZI : <p> Here is a Mini UZI with a factory open bolt with feet . The bolt face is not as far back as the full size UZI , but it 's well back from the rim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much of the ejector is visible . ) <p> Mini bolt with no Feet : <p> A Mini UZI bolt that does n't have the feet will still run fine but there is one problem . To avoid malfunctioning on the first round , the bolt should be forward when inserting a loaded magazine . <p> This photo shows a bolt with no feet in a Mini UZI using a proper SMG sear . Since the magazine was inserted when the bolt was back , the first round is tilted up severely and will jam . <p> Mini bolt with no Feet : <p> This picture shows a Micro UZI ( which uses the same size bolt as the Mini ) with a bolt without feet and a semi sear . Note that the bolt is even farther forward ( as can be seen by almost none of the ejector showing . ) This happens because the semi sear pads are not as wide as the SMG pads , allowing the bolt to move father forward . Reliability is better with the proper SMG sear . <p> Mini bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the magazine is properly inserted with the bolt closed and then the bolt is cocked . Instead of tilting the first round up , the bolt pushes the first round ahead slightly . Since it 's not tilted at an odd angle , it will feed properly . <h> Trunions:In order for the bolt feet to function properly , there has to be a hole on either side of the trunion for the feet to slip into . Without the holes there , the bolt face can not completely close on the barrel chamber and the gun will not fire . The Mini UZI and UZI Pistol to not have a bolt blocking bar in the receiver like the full size UZI and it 's the trunion holes that legally distinguish a semi automatic from a full auto . Adding trunion holes to a semi automatic Mini or Pistol is considered manufacturing a machinegun and is currently restricted to class II dealers for creating dealer sample guns . Here 's a look at some of the different trunions : <p> Semi Auto : The Mini UZI trunion is skeletonized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not need to be milled out because it 's made to run with a closed bolt , which have no feet . <p> Full Auto : The trunion on a full auto IMI Mini UZI has a notch milled out on each side of the trunion . That allows the feet on an open bolt to rest alongside the trunion . Without these notches , the bolt would not close all the way . <p> Vector : The Vector Mini UZI is actually a cut down full size UZI and it has a trunion from a full sized UZI , which is not skeletonized . The Vector trunion has two notches milled out just like the full auto IMI . This is allowed because the receiver is already registered as a machinegun . <p> Note that while the trunion on the semi automatic Mini UZI is not milled out for the feet , the rounded shape of the trunion does leave a gap on either side . Another conversion possibility is to take a registered factory open bolt for the Mini UZI and narrow the insides of the feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the smaller gaps in the semi Mini UZI . Although this is a nice solution , it 's not something you 're likely to see because the semi Mini UZI 's did n't arrive in the US until after the May 1986 end to new transferable machineguns , so people typically did n't bother registering any of the factory Mini UZI open bolts . It is possible to do this by cutting down a full size registered bolt to Mini UZI size and manufacture these feet in the process . It will then fit in an unmodified Mini Uzi receiver . <h> Barrels:Unlike the full size UZI , the inner dimensions of the Mini UZI trunion are not smaller on the semi automatic than on the SMG . Only the barrel restrictor ring prevents an SMG barrel from being used in the semi automatic . Below are three Mini UZI barrels . The top barrel is a factory semi automatic barrel for the Mini UZI Carbine . Note that there is no secondary barrel band so the barrel is supported by the band behind the flange and the tapered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel is a factory IMI Mini UZI SMG barrel that has had the chamber end turned down to go in the barrel restrictor ring . Again , unlike the full size UZI , this is the only modification needed to fit in an unmodified semi automatic Mini UZI receiver . <p> The bottom barrel is an unmodified factory IMI Mini UZI SMG barrel . <h> Vector Mini UZI ( Registered Receiver ) : Fortunately for UZI enthusiasts , Vector has come to the rescue by making more Mini UZI 's available to the transferable market . These were done by taking some of their transferable Group Industries receivers and modifying them to Mini UZI SMG specifications . Here are some of the details : <p> The full size IMI or Group receivers were not designed to accept the " feet " of the Mini UZI open bolt . Vector had to cut holes in the side of the receiver to make room for the feet . <p> On some Vector Mini UZI 's , holes were left in the receiver for the feet to poke through . This example shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle shows the area that was cut and re-welded . <p> This is an early Vector Mini UZI where they were trying to copy the rear ribs of an IMI Mini UZI SMG . They had to stop short to not mess with the original manufacturer 's markings . A real IMI only has 1 long rib on the left side rather than two . <p> The long vertical circle shows approximately where this receiver was re-welded . <p> This is a Fleming Mini UZI Conversion showing the left IMI rear " rib " . Fleming had them engraved this way rather than the factory which is just " MINI UZI " . <p> Here 's the right side of the Vector Mini UZI with two small " ribs " . Also note the use of the Model A style sights . The early IMI Mini UZI 's had these sights but all of the Mini UZI 's ( semi automatic and SMG ) shipped to the US had the Model B style sights . Vector does offer the Model B style as an upgrade . <p> IMI Mini UZI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the receiver Also note the Model B style sights found on basically all Mini UZI 's shipped outside of Israel . <p> The Vector trunion is actually a trunion from the full size UZI . It also uses the Model A style sights .

You also need to take into account that having a SMG spec UZI would also be worth more then registered bolt guns , and slotted bolt RR 's if you ever decide to sell . <p> " Never be haughty to the humble , or humble to the haughty .

I think if you looked over old posts you 'd find 100 times more people warning about the " risks " than you 'll find people with actual problems . The only real risk takers are the people who bought Vector guns . They 're all fixable problems of course , but there was never any shortage of problems . <p> Looking for the definitive reference book on UZI history and technical information ?

@@77050576 @5750576/ 71162 @qwx691162 <p> I have had firearms refinished in GunKote and Lauer 's Duracoat ( applied by Lauer themselves ) , and while both have proved to be very durable , I 'll stick with Norrell 's Molycoat . <p> The Norrell goes on in very thin coats -- you can add as many coats as you want -- while the GunKote and Duracoat are much thicker . All seem to have the same properties , though the thicker the coating , the longer it lasts ... but the GunKote and Duracoat look and feel , well , plastic . Ya know , like your gun was dipped in that cushion-grip stuff you can use to coat the handles of your tools . Molycoat , OTOH , looks and feels more like black parkerizing . <p> +1 on Tony K 's Norrell 's Moly Resin recommendation . I use that stuff exclusively after parkerizing and am very happy w/ it . It is definitely more durable than the Brownell 's stuff and it is also used by the military . <h> moly coats ... <p> I have tried all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three mentioned , I think the NORRELL 'S is the best . HOWEVER , at the S.H.O.T . Show this year I stumbled upon a booth that advertised a ceramic-based finish , and I ordered several samples . IT IS OUTSTANDING ! You can have the moly-based finishes ; this ceramic stuff is MUCH ' harder ' and more scratch-resistant . It is from a company called " N.I.C . Industries " out of White City , Oregon , and is called " CERACOTE . " It sprays on just like the moly-based finishes , with the exception that they recommend a gravity-fed airbrush . I have used it with a standard ' Badger ' airbrush , and it seemed to work O.K. , but I kept shaking it to keep the particulate stuff in suspension . It air dries for 20-30 minutes , then into the oven for 2 hours at 250degrees or 1 hour at 350 . I does n't go on as thin as the NORRELL moly , but it still goes on pretty thin and I have never had a problem with tolerance . I load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have this finish in oodles of colors ; I have used the Armor Black , Sniper Grey and O.D. Green . I liked the color of NORRELL 'S O.D. Green better than the CERACOTE O.D. On 1911 's the black slide/grey frame looks really good . It goes on so tough that when I push in front+rear NOVAK sights it does n't tear up the finish on the dovetails . I also have noticed that it covers sharp edges better than the moly-teflon . As with any surface coating , 90% is in the preparation ... strip , clean , abrasive-grit blast ... <h> more on refinishing ... <p> The company is " NIC Industries " at 7050 Sixth Street , White City , Oregon , 97503 . Their number is 866-774-7628 , and they are at www.nicindustries.com . Also , I misspoke on the actual name of the black ; I use the ' graphite black ' instead of the ' armor black . ' I believe the ' armor black ' is an air-drying finish that does not require baking ; perfect for scopes and plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it will air-dry so you can use it on scopes and such . I applied a thick coat of ' graphite black ' to a 11 " long fighting knife I made ; turned out really nice . Even though I kinda loaded it on , you can still see my name etched into the blade . I just got another order from them yesterday with a different color ; titanium , which going to put on a 1911 frame with the graphite black on the slide . These people also make a finish that you slobber down the bore , to increase lubricity and protect the bore . Apparently their main business is coating the inside of cylinders and cylinder heads , inside and outside of exhaust systems , turbo 's , etc , so this stuff LOVES heat . It also seems to have good lubricity ; slides slide easier , etc . The stuff does not qualify as ' hazardous ' by FedEx and UPS , so no confiscatory HazMat fees apply ... <h> Thanks for the ' Heads-Up ' <p> I 'll look into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refinishing . I use Norrell 's alot and have been very happy with it , but I 'm willing to venture out there and try other stuff too . <p> I was happy with the look of the moly-teflon finishes , when the gun was finished and shipped , but they started coming back with scratches and the sharp edges worn off . Everyone is using these ' kydex ' holsters lately , and they are hard on the moly finishes . A lot of guys ' pamper ' their custom 1911 's , and the moly holds up reasonably well for them . Go shoot two , three hundred rounds and tear the thing down ; the disconnector rubs the finish off the inside of the slide , the finish starts flaking or wearing off the feed ramp , the sharp edges around the mag release ( on the right side of the frame ) flakes off , not to mention the wearmarks on the slide rails . Really let 's you know the high spots on your slide-to-frame fit ... The ceramic stuff is TONS harder , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big fighting knife for a kinda ' commerative ' plaque I made for a co-worker ; I did the entire knife ( it had a 6061 knurled handle ) in the ' graphite black ' ceracote . I had sharpened the knife prior to the black finish . I re-sharpened the edge , because I wanted the thing razor sharp , and it took several DOZEN passes over a CLEAN ceramic sharpening sticks ( Crock-Sticks ) before it removed enough finish to expose and sharpen the edge . The material of the blade+guard was " D-2 . " It loaded up the sticks , and every other pass or so I had to rotate the sticks in their holder to expose fresh ceramic . This stuff is that tough . I have tried it with the moly finish , and it peels right off the first pass . The NIC folks recommend a gravity-fed spraygun ; I have been using a lil BADGER non-gravity airbrush . I bought a ' Harbor Freight ' gravity-fed spraygun , but it does not get the mixture down fine enough for me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great for spraying motorcycle tanks+fenders , but I 'm going back to the BADGER even though it does not have the upright ' gravity fed ' supply . I just keep shaking it as I spray , and so far it goes on just fine . It looks like I am going to be doing a bunch of these , so I will probably buy a small gravity fed airbrush here soon . I truly believe that a black oxide , like bluing , is better , but I do not do enough to justify having several stainless tanks full of salts , ( like DuLite ) a HUGE gas bill to heat the salts to over three hundred and deal with the stress and danger of all that for a few 1911 's a month or even a week . Plus , you can do any color you like so long as it is black . I have found the ceramic coatings a good compromise . Get a small ( I think it is about four ounces , and I am getting 4-5 1911 's out of that ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test runs . They recommend 24-1 ratio of color to catalyst . Start with the BADGER 'S needle backed out for a very fine thin mist of color , just enough to ' fog ' the surface , then adjust your needle til you get the amount you feel conmortable with . Too much color causes small ' zits ' on the surface ; best to run it fine and build it up . Keep shaking it as you go ; I pull the cup off the bottom of the gun every thirty seconds or so , cover the outlet and breathe hole with my fingers and shake the heck out of it then push it back into the gun . Once you are satisfied with the coverage , let it air-dry for twenty-thirty minutes before putting it in the oven . This will give you time to clean you gun ; get right on this because once it ' kicks ' it is a BITCH to get out of the ' works . ' Acetone , M.E.K. or lacquer thinner all work good . Another thing ; surface prep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tank and big HcL Acid tanks ; in those first to clean+strip old finishes off , then beadblast . Blow dry with DRY compressed air ; do not touch ! I have all the parts hanging from copper wire from big long copper hooks . Once out of the beadblaster , and when your airbrush is ' loaded , ' take a small propane torch and gently heat all the parts immediately before airbrushing . Watch the part(s) closely ; on a 1911 slide , for instance , you can see the line of moisture advancing ahead of your torch flame . Move the flame along the part , ' chasing ' that moisture line off the part . This not only gets rid of the moisture in the part ( I do n't care HOW good or how many air dryers you have along your airlines ) this small amount of heat will ' open ' the pores of the metal to better accept the finish . Do n't get carried away with the heat ; too much and the finish will boil off the instant it touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you get a ' fisheye ' your part is not clean enough . Start the whole process over , and be more careful . If you get a ' run , ' start over ; I have never been able to ' wipe ' the run off without it being visible later . On revolvers it is crucial that you heat the bbl/frame joint sufficiently to ' boil ' out any moisture collected in the **25;115;TOOLONG process ; I GUARANTEE you it will ' bubble ' out in the oven , ruining your even , smooth finish if you do n't get it all out before applying the finish . Keep this in mind on every joint where you can not take the pieces apart prior to refinishing . Obviously you can not heat scopes , plastic frames , etc ; use their air-drying finish . If you order enough stuff from NIC they will ( should ) send you about a dozen light alloy tubes with an example of each color ... <p> One thing you must remember abuot NIC Ind . is that the gun refinishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their company .

Every time I call them I have to remind them this is for putting on guns ... I just got another couple jugs of their stuff to do 4-5 1911 's this weekend ... going to try another new color as well ... <h> CeraKote Followup <p> I wanted to write a little ' review ' of the CeraKote product . I used my Lt wt Commander ( everyday carry gun in a duty rig ) as my test subject . I guess I have had the CeraKote on there almost 3 months and have put enough rounds through it to get an idea how this stuff holds up . I 'm extremely impressed with the hardness and durability of the Cerakote coating . I ordered ' Graphite Black ' for the slide and other parts and did the frame only in ' Sniper Gray ' . It 's an extremely ' business-like ' look for a work gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails for wear and tore it down . There is ZERO wear on the frame and slide rails ! The only wear that I can see is where the disconnector contacts the underside of the slide . No visible wear around the muzzle area even though it has seen lots of holster presentations ........ I 'm also one of our Departments Firearm Instructors , so I get to play alot with guns . Very impressive performance thus far . <p> Now the negative . This stuff takes alot more attention and care in the application process . With Norrell 's Moly Resin the process is simple and easy : degrease , blast , degrease again , preheat , spray and cure . With Norrell 's , the product dries almost instantly to a properly preheated part and can actually be handled without too much worry of messing up the finish . No-can-do with Cerakote ! It stays in a somewhat wet/fluid/tacky state until cured . So you really need to make sure that all parts are hung properly . The next negative is that it 's a 2 part mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ..... not a huge hassle but still a pain . OH ... one more thing ... this stuff is EXPENSIVE ! ! ! ! Something like $30+ dollars for a little 4oz bottle ! <p> All-in-All I really like the product . It does exactly what it says it does . The only issues are the pain-in-the-ass factor of application and the expense . I will begin offering it as an option for customers who need an extreme duty finish for their pistols . <p> I too am the armorer for my PD ... We got a bunch of 14 " 870 's from the Border Patrol and they were in pretty rough shape , so I 've been ' cerakote'ing ' them one by one and am really happy with the results . I put a thin amount of electroless nickel on the two shell latches ( you got ta pop them out of the receiver to refinish it anyways ) as these latches usually are the first to rust . I am going to try the Armor Black next , the Graphite Black is not quite flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he told me that by adding more hardener you will get more gloss . I asked him if it would cause it to ' kick ' quicker , but he said it will still have a pot life of two hours or so , plenty of time . Yes , it is a horrible sticky mess until air dried and especially baked on , and DO NOT let ANYTHING brush up against the parts til baked ! I did a WWI Finnish MAXIM tri-pod the other day ; the ' sniper grey ' offsets the bronze fittings nicely . Brandon also said that he did his personal GLOCK in the bake-on finish ; he just set the oven for 225degrees for 2.5 hours and the slide and frame match perfectly ! I am going to try that next , probably in Coyote Tan ...

@@77050579 @5750579/ 71162 @qwx691162 <p> Mike85220 , I am interested about what you said about a shorter barrel length reducing the rate of fire . How does that work ? I had a debate with a friend last night about rates of fire . I told him that longer barrels in blow-back operated guns can reduce the rate of fire , due to the fact that having a longer barrel will cause the bullet to be traveling through the barrel for a longer period of time when compared to a shorter barrel , and that therefore , gasses are trapped behind the bullet for a longer period of time , and that therefore , those gases actually hold the bolt rearward somewhat , and prevent it from closing as quickly as it would if the gasses had been released earlier if the barrel had been shorter . Granted , this does n't make much sense to me because of the fact that the gasses are allowed to escape through the chamber as soon as the bolt begins to move backwards , thereby instantly alleviating the the gas pressure , or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I had read once on a forum that talked about longer barrels on MACs having slower rates of fire .

Thanks for any knowledge which you can impart to me . Hopefully I do n't have to tell my friend that I was all wrong lol . <p> It 's an oldie but a goodie .

@@77050583 @5750583/ <p> Many SAR readers have wondered over the past five years what ever happened to the lot of Group Industries registered UZI receivers that were sold at the Group Industries auction . Did someone purchase these valuable pieces of ordnance and " sit on them " until market conditions changed and a huge profit margin become realized ? <p> Not really . <p> They were bought by Ralph Merrill , President of Vector Arms , and it simply took this long to find a high quality source of new parts to build them up into a finished product . He has finally done so and is now selling them on the fully transferable C3 market . As there has been so much talk about the Vector UZI , this article will answer many questions by providing a detailed history , evaluation and test of a regular production version ... no special " hand finished " ringers here ! The standard of comparison will be the world famous IMI 9mm UZI . <p> Finally , let me take all the suspense out of your mind . I have carried an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosnia , Croatia and Serbia ) and also own the IMI version . While not being a total expert , I do have sufficient knowledge and real world experience to fairly test/evaluate one . Saying this , and with no financial interest in Vector Arms , I can unequivocally state the tested Vector UZI is the finest one I have ever used . Period . <p> Birth of the Receiver <p> The heart of the Vector UZI is its registered receiver . These started life in 1985-86 when the flats were stamped and folded by Michael Brown , at that time the President of Group Industries . This company had gained a reputation in the 1980 's as a converter of the semi-auto IMI UZI into select fire . As the price of the IMI UZI increased and the supply became spotty , Michael conceived the idea of making his own US version and not being dependent on a foreign supplier . Further , he would be able to directly influence the quality and end up with a superior product . As an inside joke , the Group Industries UZI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected this number as it was the House of Representatives law enacted in May , 1986 which banned newly manufactured machine gun ownership by private citizens . <p> To gain additional funding for this very ambitious project , Michael teamed up with Roger Small , head of Scattergun Technologies ( And the old Automatic Weapons Company ) . Roger agreed to partially fund it for approximately $250,000 providing he ( Roger ) received specific delivery schedules and exclusive distribution privileges . <p> In the end , Group Industries could not meet the agreed upon terms and Scattergun Technologies sued for breach of contract . After a prolonged length of back and forth moves from both sides , Scattergun Technologies finally won a judgment against Group Industries in 1993 . Meanwhile , Group sought protection from its creditors by filing for several reorganizations under Chapter 11 . This only temporarily prevailed , however , and in early 1995 the creditors ordered the assets to be liquidated under Chapter 7 . An auction was held on 24 August 1995 the likes of which has rarely been seen before ( MAC auction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many items up for bid included forming/stamping dies , boxes of parts , several full automatic weapons , one WWII WC24 command car , two M5A1 light tanks and 3318 registered - and fully transferable - UZI receiver frames . There were nowhere near enough spare parts to complete these valuable receivers and some people wondered if the buyer had bought the proverbial " pig in the poke " . <p> The mysterious high bidder was #221 who paid $265,000 for the 3318 UZI receivers along with an additional 109 Post-86 DS receivers . Including the 10% buyer 's premium to the auctioneer , the total bill was $291,500 ; this meant the unit cost for all 3427 receivers was $85.06 each . The buyer 's name was Marcos Garcia and he was the representative for one Ralph Merrill ... President of Vector Arms . <p> Now that Vector Arms had just entered the UZI market in a big way , Ralph had to figure out : 1 ) where to access a very large supply of new parts to complete these 3318 fully transferable receivers ; and , 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vector UZI ? These two items became a world class nightmare . <p> Sourcing of Parts <p> Ralph first contacted Israeli Military Industries ( IMI ) in January , 1996 , to inquire about the parts/production necessary to finish the receivers . Though their UZI production lines had been shut down several years earlier when moved from Tel Aviv , it was expected that substantial numbers of parts would remain in inventory and thus be available for Vector 's use . Incredibly , IMI had none available as they had been sold off or consumed by the world market . Further , they were not interested in reopening the production lines for a relatively few number of SMG 's . <p> In February , 1997 he contacted the other major UZI manufacturer - Fabrique Nationale ( FN ) of Herstal , Belgium . FN had been famous for years regarding its high quality manufacturing processes and had supplied numerous military/police forces of several nations . Unfortunately , as with IMI , no parts or production services were available . Their production line had been shut down in the 1980 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tooling , jigs , dies , etc. had been sold , transferred or outright destroyed . <p> During March , 1997 , Ralph contacted Distraco SA ( IMI-Europe ) headquarters in Brussels , Belgium . He hoped they possessed a suitably large inventory of spare parts and the supporting production facilities to finish the Group Industry receivers This , too , was fruitless . They did have a good number of parts but could not support any UZI production . Distraco SA could install parts and repair existing firearms but did not possess the facilities to perform initial buildup of the receiver . The equipment needed to install barrel trunnions , rear plates , sight brackets , etc. did not exist . At this point , Ralph felt pretty down . It appeared he would have to undertake the exact events which led to Group Industries ' downfall ... 1 ) set up his own production facility ; and , 2 ) make the parts himself . Technically it was feasible , but financially it was a prohibitive process . Thus , in the Spring of 1997 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production facilities in Utah ( more on this later ) . Further , as this would push them to the limit , the location of existing new UZI parts was now imperative . <p> And then luck smiled ... <p> In July , 1997 , Ralph heard that South Africa could be a salvation regarding parts . During the late 1970 's the Pretoria based firm of Lyttleton Engineering had quietly manufactured thousands of UZI 's to supply South African forces engaged in the Rhodesian war . Upon conclusion of this war and creation of Zimbabwe , the demand for these UZI 's had ceased . Consequently , over 5000 brand new Lyttleton made SMG 's were carefully stored in a South African warehouse . Yes , the government would sell them but was not interested in dismantling them into parts kits - someone else must do that . Negotiations to acquire these new UZIs and get them stripped down would take the next 1 1/2 years . <p> An UZI is comprised of 85 parts and the Lyttleton UZI 's could provide 77 . This is because the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the receiver in such a way that they would be destroyed during removal . Thus , where to acquire the barrel nut latch housing , front sight bracket , bayonet lug , foregrip lug , pistol grip lug , rear plate and rear sight bracket ? Perhaps a final foreign trip could locate these seven missing parts . <p> In September , 1998 , Ralph visited the Croatian firm of RH-ALAN , which was producing an UZI clone - the ERO 9 - and amenable to providing the seven missing parts . But ... they wanted $500,000 to do so . Additionally , some of these parts were investment cast and somewhat suspect regarding long term use/wear which the American shooter would expect of a " new production " fully transferable SMG . Ralph thanked them very much and decided he would make these seven parts himself . There was no other solution . <p> At this same time in September , 1998 , the South Africans finally shipped the 5000 Lyttleton UZI 's to Switzerland where they were carefully disassembled into the necessary 77 parts by a respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first 60 kits landed in Utah via Delta Airlines in February , 1999 , with the bulk arriving by sealift in May . <p> After four years of diligent searching , Vector Arms finally had 77 of the 84 new parts they needed . Now , they were going to make the additional seven parts themselves and set up full production facilities . <p> Vector 's Manufacturing Process <p> As mentioned earlier , Ralph had decided in the spring of 1997 to set up production facilities himself when IMI and FN did not come through . To learn how to make an UZI , he located Mike Brown and asked him to conduct an " UZI school " and teach how it is done . As Mike had remained true to the product and wanted " his " UZI 's to be completed and distributed to the American market , he agreed to take Ralph under his tutelage . If Group Industries was dead , then Vector Arms would finish the job . <p> Over a ten day period in the summer of 1997 , Mike taught Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the initial stamping to the final finishing , he covered it all . To validate his skills , Ralph built ten UZI 's and had Mike carefully examine each one . They were equal to , or better than , those of IMI and FN . In fact , the Vector UZI is built to the highest commercial standards and exceeds that of any milspec version . Surface finish is much finer , edges are carefully deburred , welds are correctly dressed down , forming marks left by the stamping dies are removed via special tooling , etc . After Ralph graduated the school he went back to Vector Arms and taught his crew how to do it to commercial standard . <p> With this production knowledge and the 77 Lyttleton made parts in hand , Vector Arms manufactured their own seven parts to complete the set . The rear sight bracket is formed from 14 gauge steel with a stamping die formerly owned by Group Industries . Also , stamping dies were built to form the front sight bracket , while the remaining five parts were machined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , the registered receiver and all 84 parts necessary to make a true UZI were available .

They had dimensional inaccuracies in their rails , and the heat treating was not consistently adequate . CNC-Warrior receivers , on the other hand , are EVERY BIT as good as the IMI receivers . In the quality metal , and dimensionally , they are identical . Additionally , the finishing ( machining , not paint ) work on the CNC-W receivers are in fact , better than IMI 's . The builders you mentioned all have very good reputations , but there was only one in there who is a real Galil specialist , and yes , it sure does make a difference . " T " -Mark and Troy have built great reputations for building ... stamped AKM 's . Sure , they 've even done some AK-47 type milled receiver builds , which does , and does n't , directly transfer go Galil builds . The barrels install completely differently , different feed angles , etc . It comes down to ..... are you looking for someone to " assemble your kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a real master Galil specialist , to build and " fine tune " you 're new gun . Jeff 's work is very much like one of the great 1911 specialist 's who improve on an already excellent product . Jeff " massages " virtually every part . He 's not the one to just " slap together " a kit . If Jeff is provided with all new , or almost new IMI , or South African parts , and a CNC-W , or IMI receiver , his final product will be superior to all others , including a factory IMI gun . ( As most of us here know , the South African version of the Galil , was designed to be an even stronger , more robust , and " damage proof " gun than the IMI gun was , and the South African parts are , accordingly , more " robust " .

I 've heard those Infinity Firearms receivers were IMI leftover receivers , and I heard they were n't , buy were ORF receivers . <p> Look like ORF to me ... Possible he got some IMI , but the cliff stearns builds look pretty rough ... Persoonally , I 'd go either Golani or authentic IMI before that ... His prices are n't too far off of Tenngalil build either , which would be the best option of the bunch . <p> I 'd like to know who made those Infinity Firearms receivers , I think Infinity also made their own complete guns . For a fast , cheap , slap together build , I 'd go with an Apex heavily " used " kit and a AWO receiver , for a total of $600 , and learn to make it myself . For a decent used parts kit , already on a " possibly " good receiver , " ready to fire " , you could go with a Golani , and hope you get a good " enough " receiver . Yes , you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for about $3000 plus , for a NIB IMI Galil . If you could find one in a reasonable time frame . ( They 're not getting those crazy $4500 asking prices ) I wo n't speak to Jeff Miller 's actual labor build prices , I 'll leave that up to him , but , suffice to say , it completely depends on what you 're spending on the parts you send him , and other options , receivers , finishes , lightening cuts or not , barrel types , etc . Jeff though , is the very best , and is totally " head and shoulders " above all other builders of Galils . You could possibly spend twice that $1500 Cliff Stearns gun price for the best of the best in custom built Galils , which will be better than an IMI production gun , Gah-ron-teed ! ! ! ! <p> The heart of the wise inclines to the right , but the heart of the fool to the tyranny in government . " - Thomas Jefferson And yes , that means " military grade " weaponry . <p> I found Cliff on gunbroker and asked him to do the barrel work on my two galil builds . He only charged me $200 plus shipping to do the headspacing , bullet guide , extractor cut , handgaurd cut , and gas port , Basically all the barrel work . I did all the rivets and finishing work . He had a fast turn around time and the work he did was good to go , he even accepts paypal for payment . I 've already fired the ARM he helped with and everything functioned properly . I like to do as much of the build as I can but without a mill I needed help with the cuts so Cliff worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year on a build and his price was right on for what I was trying to spend . If funds were not an issue I would just pony up the $3000 and get an original . I 'd say my rifle is far superior to any Golani out there , I got an original IMI 18 inch chrome lined barrel from blackthorn for the arm , its built on a new AWO receiver . Not as nice as a cnc warrior receiver I know but good enough for me . <p> Any galil lovers in Eastern Washington ( Pullman Spokane ) want to go for a shoot , hit me up and I 'll bring the ammo . Also I have lots of jigs and tools for building if anyone wants to put together a rifle or do some refinishing . Gun junkies unite ! <p> Ya ' see now , " That 's what I 'm talking about " ! I want to be able to replace the barrels on my Galils , all by myself , in addition to the relatively simpler task of finishing the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds pretty good though . That means anybody could easily " build their own " for $800 , - ( $350 Apex parts kit , $250 AWO receiver , $200 barrel install ) In addition to my Jeff Miller builds , I 'd like to have a few " beaters " , that function reliably though , with none of the Golani issues , so that might be the way to go , until I can get the equipment for the barrel installs . <p> When I started the Galil kick there were no apex kits , so I bought a spendy gunbroker kit that some dude had been sitting on from 2004 . It had all original parts as new , unissued as you could get and some hard to find ARM parts like front sight block , but had a metal reinforced polymer stock . I did manage to get a receiver for $160 or so to off set the cost of the overpriced kit . About two weeks later apex had AR parts kits for sale , only thing to do at that point was get one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total cost of the two you feel like you got a better deal . lol Anyway it ended up working perfectly because the apex kit came with the older style metal folding stock and the AR front sight block . That gave me enough parts to make an ARM and AR and allowed the proper parts to be together . I looked at buying a mill but the cheapest table top ones were $500+ and suck . I spent less on Cliff for the 2 builds and got his old timer experience for free . <p> Yes , It looks like I might have to break down ( eventually ) , and get some decent equipment to do some hopefully better than " half-ass " builds . Those Tenngalil builds are n't going anywhere though , ever . <p> Are you saying you have done some " half ass " builds or implying that my build is half-ass because the all mighty Tenngalil did n't build it ?

That is awesome that you have the time and skills to do you own builds . <p> Personally ; as you stated earlier ; I would rather have the more expensive better quality kits/parts to do my builds than for example ; the apex kits that sold for a few hundred dollars . If you are going to build something ; do n't go with cheap parts ( quality ) ; especially on the receivers .

On the subject of the Mk 6 - is this a something that can be found in the market , or one of those " jems " that rarely makes an appearance ? S. <p> Traveler was right on the money ... I have the GoD right in front of me ... Only 70 were made . They stopped because the OAL was too short for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism . They are ONLY interchangeable with certain exceptions not with the MK6 . It can mount a No. 5 bayonet . Its reads that Sterling was attempting to make a MK4 look-a-like for the American market but when they released it and it was too short to be imported to realize a continued profit because it needed a stamp . They scrapped the program . Then they abandoned it completely . Hence the reason for only making 70 units . IMHO if it is an MK8 it should have an excedeling high value . I would have to have a stamp to live in America . The GoD book has less than 3 pages on the whole gun . It was known offically as the " 9mm Gun Mark 8 " The boys called it a CBS " closed bolt single shot " . <p> Perhaps some on here on the forum should get a list of those who would buy the book .

TODAY the Amazon Low and High were at $475 to $1872 . At any rate this was my experience on the GoD book ... Regards , X-RZ <p> If the company has no commercial interest in publishing more GoD with paper , shame they could not come up with an electronic version which would not cost much to produce but get the info out there . I guess problem is getting the authors and owners their fair share of IP revenue once it is released on the internet . <p> Need to find someone who owns the book and is willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , not a sloppy half-assed scan as a lot of people do . Maybe talk to the original publisher and talk a deal with him . <p> I have a couple of possible suggestions regarding this . ( 1 ) I read somewhere that Amazon or a company similar to it has a business that will print copies of some books on demand . So if ten people want a particular book ten , and only ten , will be printed at that time for sale . ( 2 ) There is a company that publishes hard copy reprints of high school annuals for about $80 a copy . I have seen one of their reprints and it looks good . Again , this looks like a print on demand service . Maybe this company could do GoD or recommend another printer . Of course the copyright holder will have agree to this . But a commission for a limited number of books custom printed is better than no commission on no books printed .

" <p> IMHO , the Galil is well ahead of the standard AK in accuracy . I would not call it inherently inaccurate . It does suffer the same problem with the bolt carrier/piston action mass and movement ( some vibration ) . So it does lack the M16s accuracy , but in many people 's opinions , it does more than make up for it in dependability and overall ruggedness . <p> I own both . When the time comes and I really need one , I 'm taking the Galil . Everything I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't see that well anymore . <p> Another point here is that in this video the comparison is n't quite fair . They do mention the sights , but do n't make the point that this is probably part of the reason the shooter with the AK could n't hit the target at 200 yards . Put better sights on it , with a longer sight radius ( like on the Galil ) , and you would n't see so much difference . And the AK shooter has VERY poor trigger control . Notice that he 's not squeezing the trigger , he takes a running start with his finger off the trigger and slaps the trigger . Not exactly the best way to get good accuracy . Barrel whip is something that virtually all rifles have to some extent ( notice that they do n't show the end of the barrel of the M-16 when it fires in slow motion , so you ca n't judge whether or to what extent it exhibits the same thing ) , and it appears worse in the AK than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cleaning rod underneath , while the barrel of the M-16 is hidden by the handguards .

Actually I do n't even notice that my SAR was less accurate to a M-16/AR-15 rifles ( shot both on the range on a rifle rest ) . I zero'ed it and it stayed right on target .

@@77050589 @5750589/ <p> As prolific as the classic 9mm UZI submachinegun has been over the past few decades , it has a few shortcomings in certain applications , namely its size ( 18.4 inches ) and weight ( 7.70 lbs . ) . Quite likely , therefore , with markets such as executive protection where maximum concealment is a factor , the UZI has suffered . Enter the Mini UZI . <p> After much thought and redesign , Israel Military Industries ( IMI ) has produced a new UZI which looks as if it has not grown up yet . But it has . Dubbed the " Mini UZI , " the new 9mm SMG has all the features of the regular UZI plus a few of its own . It shares some parts in common with the big gun , including the magazine , and it disassembles in the same way . The Mini UZI also does pretty much what the regular UZI does , but it does it twice as fast with a cyclic rate of 1,200 rounds per minute as compared with 600 rpm for the standard gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , of Mentor , Ohio , 216-257-4872 , was very gracious in inviting Sgt. Gene Pretzeus and I to test his sample Mini UZI for Combat Handguns , and even allowed us to shoot the new SMG before he did . We found the Mini UZI sufficiently comfortable to use , and to have pointing characteristics comparable to an Ingram M10 . The sliding selector is exactly the same as on the standard UZI and this arrangement has never been much to my liking , as compared to a more conventional rotating selector . The magazine release , as with the standard gun , is excellent for a right handed shooter , but slower for left handers . <p> The folding stock of the Mini UZI is more to my liking than that of its big brother . There are no detents to unlock or steps to follow in folding . It simply swings open and closed similar to that of the U.S. M1A1 Carbine , and locks sufficiently in either position . <p> Controllable Rapid Fire <p> With a cyclic rate of 1,200 rpm the Mini UZI is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controllable than we had anticipated , even with the stock folded . This is due to the gun 's compensator which is integral with the counterbored barrel . Special curved slots direct some of the gasses up and to the right , very effectively counteracting the little gun 's tendency to move in that direction . These slots are also directed forward slightly so that noise is not intensified . The compensator is designed for a right handed shooter , however , and with one who is left handed the Mini UZ1 would lend very strongly to walk to the left . <p> 3-4 Round Bursts <p> Four round bursts were the norm with the Mini UZI , but , with concentration , as few as three rounds can be let off on full auto . With such a rate of fire , any less requires using semi-auto .

Once the grip falls away , you will find a spring and detent that is inserted from the bottom of your reciever . You can even loosen the grip screw , pull down on your grip , and leave everything in place . This relieves the spring tension on the detent and will allow you to remove the selector .

@@77050600 @5750600/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Review of AGI Sterling SMG TM &amp; Armorer 's Course Video <p> As mentioned in this thread , American Gunsmithing Institute ( AGI ) has released several videos on popular MGs - including the Sterling . They are available in VHS and DVD . RoverDave has done a review of the Uzi video here . I have also seen it and concur with his findings . <p> I ca n't post any excerpts of either video due to copyright restrictions , but suffice it to say that the Sterling gets the standard AGI treatment . <p> John Bush , Master Gunsmith is the instructor . Some of you may know him as Michael Bush 's dad . <p> Sterling buffs may be disappointed by the fact that there are no earlier guns from the series ( Patchetts , L2A1/A2 , etc. ) and no L34A1 / Mk5 silenced guns . Likewise , no entries from Canada or India . This is first and foremost a video manual and course on the " Crown Jewell " - the L2A3 a/k/a/ Mark 4 . <p> The video starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time we are looking at barrels and patent drawings . However , it soon settles down into a good pace . <p> John shows several early Sterling manuals including some that are quite rare . He points the viewer to the Sterling bible : The Guns of Dagenham by Laidler &amp; Howroyd and the harder to find " Sterling Years " by Edmiston - the latter being more a book about the politics of the small arms trade . <p> The next section " Design &amp; Function " gives us a tour of the gun 's features . John talks about the unique roller follower design of the Sterling " commercial " magazine . We get to compare the superior quality of these magazines to the UK military issue L1A1 . This was the first time I had seen the military mag . <p> John shows some of the features such as the spiral ribbed bolt design , the relief cut on the barrel breach to expel dirt , and the use of stainless pins in the commercial trigger packs . <p> Although John points out the questionable utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would still be nice to show one for completeness sake . <p> John makes use of some " in the white " ( post sample ? ) receiver casings which I think makes it much easier to see the detail of the gun . <p> We are shown how to clean the detail stripped parts the AGI way . The gun is then reassembled and function tested . <p> The accessories chapter shows the front sight tool that was rarely used in practice to drift the sight . A few of the different slings are shown and then it 's off to the range . <p> We get to see John having too much Rambo fun shooting double Sterlings - full auto with the stocks folded up . The slow motion video effects are kinda cool , too . Pay special attention to the recoil stroke of the cocking handle - interesting . <p> I 'd like to finish by pasting in a slightly modified version of the last part of RD 's Uzi review . Why ? Because it 's spot on on the Sterling video as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Dave has : <p> The quality of the DVD was very good . Video quality was clear and crisp . Auto quality was very good . Closeup shots of parts and assembly procedure was generally very good . Occasionally the camera was misdirected or hands were in the way but generally it was very good . Production quality was cheesy but adaquate . Hey , it 's not a Hollywood film . The DVD is indexed so you can jump to various spots in the course . <p> In terms of the information , the course is a good basic overview of the gun , how it works and how to disassemble/assemble it . If you 're completely new to the firearm , you 'll learn a lot. edit . If you 're experienced with the Sterling or generally knowledgeable about guns , you wo n't learn very much . It is nice to see someone doing the work on the gun instead of looking at static photographs , but it 's still basic info . <p> The one thing that is really missing from the course is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to point out common problems , how to diagnose them or fix them . That information would have made this a much more valuable course . <p> John Bush is a knowledgeable and helpful guy . I 've met him in person once and it was a pleasure talking to him . I appreciate the fact the he worked on these courses to help people who might have little or no knowledge on these guns . Is this DVD right for you ? It depends on how much experience you already have with the gun .

Besides the issues of using an NFA gun for self defense , I 'm a little worried that a short barreled shotgun kept in the sleeping quarters for self defense , could lead to me getting my face shot off . Think about it , you lean it against the corner in the bedroom and some night there 's a noise in the dark so you jump out of bed , grab your kimono and put it on .

At least not until I live in a house .

@@77050605 @5750605/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Long term storage of Suomi Drums- spring tension ? <p> I 've got a bunch of Suomi drums , way more than I think I will use in the foreseeable future . I 'm not interested in selling them but interested in storing them long term . I understand some of these things are 70+ years old and work fine , but would they last longer if I removed the spring tension off of the ones I plan on storing ? <p> I have two transferables that use these things . I hope the transferables pass down , and I want my boys to have drums for a long time . <p> Great timing on this thread , and I 'll add a related spring tension question . <p> I am disassembling and cleaning 30 Suomi drums , and noticed there is a wide range of preload on the springs . A couple of springs were preloaded one complete revolution , and five of them were preloaded four full revolutions . One was four-and-a-half revs . These got really tight when wound up two revolutions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there a one-size-fits-all number of revolutions to use when reassembling a drum , and if so , what is it ? If there is not a one-size-fits-all number of turns , how do you determine the number of revolutions to use for each individual drum ? <p> So first of all as far as I can tell spring creep is somewhat of a made-up problem in in context of firearms . There is a lot of down-right wrong information out there about magazine spring creep . Take it from a mechanical engineer , its not something you should worry about . Yes creep does happen , but with stress applied AT elevated temperatures . As long as you are n't storing your drums in the oven , I think you 'll be fine . It is cycles , not static stress that typically causes spring failures failures . <p> I , too , have observed and read about the variability in drum tension . The answer is , you want just enough preload that the drums run fine . If you start getting feed failures towards the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the information . I 've seen countless threads on other firearms boards where posters ask whether storing mags fully loaded ruins the springs . The eventual answer is that it does not ruin the springs . Though I 'm not an engineer , there are several in the family who concur that it is heat , and cycling , that take the toll on springs . Even so , after nearly 200K miles on my current car , which is perhaps half a billion cycles on each valve spring , I have yet to experience high RPM valve float . Adding in the countless stories of mags sitting fully loaded for decades before they 're discovered in grandpa 's pistol , and the old ammo and compressed spring shot just fine , you see that softening of static , compressed springs is a myth . <p> I kind of figured I 'd be in trial and error mode to determine proper preload . I 'm sure that less is more , since I do n't want to wind them up tighter than needed , or find their elastic limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> Thanks for the input . I will leave them stored as is . Just picked a bunch of them up over the last few years , and have n't really cleaned them all like I should . So before going through the complete disassembly and reassembly thought I would ask . <p> I 'd leave the springs alone . The drums were kept in long term storage with the springs pre-wound for over 50 years . A couple of decades more is unlikely to adversely affect them . <p> What I 've found is some drums require more tension , ( pre-winds ) than others . Too much tension and the rounds jam against the side of the drum body and wo n't advance and feed properly . Too little tension and you 've got the same problem . I 've wound over a thousand , each one by feel . If you 're looking for an absolute number , there really is n't one , but 3 complete winds is a good place to start . <p> Thanks .

I am leery of opening up the spring housing . Any guidance to offer ? What about terms for a swap-out ? I sure as heck wo n't trash something this old when a couple of tack welds will put it back in service , and the coil spring inside appears to be good . <p> It 's a fairly simple task to remove the housing cover and that wo n't hurt anything . It 's staked into place , but easy to remove .

Spotlighted by news coverage of wars and rumors of wars , it 's only natural that there is a large market for the sub-gun look-alikes of Old World extraction such as Israel 's UZI , Great Britain 's Sterling and West Germany 's HK-94 . <p> These three carbines are similar enough , yet , at the same time , different enough to be an interesting comparison . The similarities are in the areas of : caliber , barrel length and twist , folding or telescoping stocks , closed bolt firing , in the same ball park price wise , etc . <p> Differences include : each has a distinctively different folding stock , bolt , trigger mechanism , magazine and magazine placement on the weapon . <p> UZI <p> The UZI hardly needs any introduction because of the media exposure it has enjoyed . So much so , in fact , that the name UZI has almost become a " household word " in the shooting world , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be totally objective in our comparison , let 's not let this bias our thinking . <p> While Israel and her famous designer , Israel Galili , ( UZI Talk Note : Uzi Gal was the designer of the UZI , not Israel Galili ) get the praise , the original design efforts should be credited to the Czechoslovakian arms designers who first developed the telescoping bolt principal in their Zk476 and Models 23 and 25 . <p> Like those of its predecessors , the UZI 's bolt telescopes over the barrel chamber , giving a forward weight shift that aids controllability and also allows for a compact receiver design . <p> Workmanship and quality control are evident inside and out . Loading the magazine can be aided greatly by using the loader which is available as an accessory . <p> The folding stock requires a little practice to implement in a hurry . Remember the Secret Service agent during the Presidential assassination attempt ? The attachT case carry requires the stock being folded , where in a normal " ready " carry the stock would already be extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock is a worthwhile accessory . <p> The UZI 's folding stock and removable barrel allow a most compact package , easily fitting into a briefcase or one of the many " S.W.A.T. " type cases available . <p> Another important feature of the UZI is the ease of field stripping , which requires no tools . The UZI comes complete with owners manual , 25 round magazine , sling and a short display barrel for SMG look-alike display . Available accessories include a 32 round magazine , magazine loader , front sight tool and wooden buttstock . <p> STERLING <p> The Sterling Mk VI carbine , while relatively new to the American market , can trace its " roots " back to 1939 in the form of the Lanchester , manufactured by the Sterling Engineering Co. of England . The Lanchester was produced in two versions : one select fire , the other full auto only . It may come as a surprise , but the Sterling 's lineage actually precedes the famous Sten family of SMG 's . <p> Instead of following the third generation design pathway of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the direction of G. W. Patchett , moved the grip and trigger mechanism forward to achieve an optimum weight balance . With various minor design differences , the Sterling has been known as the L2A1 , L2A2 , L2A3 and L2A4 submachine gun . After adoption by British forces , the latter became known as the Sterling Mk IV . The Mk V is the silenced version . <p> The Mk VI carbine , with the exception of its 16-1/8 " barrel , is pure Sterling through and through , including the bayonet mounting lug . It comes with owner 's manual , 34 round magazine , sling and display barrel to allow an SMG type display . Also available is a 10 round magazine . <p> HK-94 ( A3 ) <p> The Heckler &amp; Koch Models HK-91/93 are , perhaps , the best known fighting rifles available in semi-automatic .

A close examination of the bolt reveals the familiar locking lugs , very much like the 91/93 . In fact , the 94 almost looks and feels like a scaled down 91/93 . If you already own one of these rifles , you would feel right al home with the 94 - the charging handle is similar , the telescoping stock is very much the same , the trigger mechanism almost identical . <p> The rear sight offers no elevation adjustment , only changes in the diameter of the hole . The stock extends easily and quickly by merely pressing the conveniently located latch and pulling out until it locks . As with the 91/93 , some shooters will find the stock a bit on the short side , although with some , this aids quick shouldering for aimed shots .

To our staff , each weapon appeared to have pluses and minuses which prospective buyers would have to weigh for themselves : <p> In the area of aimed fire , the Sterling with its 6-groove barrel , 16 " sight radius and FN profile stock seems to have an edge . For quick , aimed fire the HK-94 seems to shoulder a little quicker . For underarm assault type firing , the UZI has always been a front runner .

The legendary status of the UZI was born during these early days of military service . <p> The early years of Israeli statehood were anything but peaceful , but tensions with Egypt rose dramatically in 1955 . Egypt increased pressure on her unwelcome neighbor by blockading Israeli shipping in the Suez Canal and the Straits of Tiran . Additionally , Egyptian backed fedayeen wreaked havoc on Israeli settlements . On October 29 , 1956 , Israel attacked Egypt , mobilizing over 100,000 soldiers in 72 hours . This would be the first big test of the new UZI . Israeli forces quickly moved across Sinai towards the Suez Canal . On October 30th , the United States sponsored a Security Council resolution calling for an Israeli withdrawal , but England and France vetoed it . The following day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost controlling interest in several Middle Eastern countries , England and France were eager to retain some control over the Suez Canal . By November 5th , the IDF had taken control of virtually the entire Sinai peninsula and the British and French has captured Port Said . <p> Upset with Israel 's secret plan to attack Egypt , the United States sided with the Soviet Union ( who had been supporting Egypt ) to pressure Israel to withdraw . The U.S. threatened to withdraw all assistance from Israel as well as UN sanctions . Bowing to U.S. pressure , Israel withdraw from all areas it had taken . As part of the agreement to withdraw , President Eisenhower promised Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion that the U.S. would maintain free navigation in the area . Additionally , UN peace peeking troops would be moved into Sinai . <p> By 1967 , tensions between Israel , Egypt and Syria again reached the breaking point . On May 22 , 1967 , Egypt closed off the Straits of Tiran , blocking off all Israeli shipping . Egypt ordered the UN peacekeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt , Jordan , Syria and Iraq were all aligned against Israel and had 250,000 troops poised for action .

They had taken the entire Sinai peninsula , the Golan Heights , the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , and were in a position to attack Cairo , Damascus and Amman . On June 10th , a ceasefire was declared . In November , the UN Security Council adopted resolution 242 , which outlined the process by which Israel would withdraw from territories occupied during the war in exchange for peace with her neighbors . <p> Israel is a nation constantly on watch .

@@77050616 @5750616/ <p> Once readily available , the open firing Uzi bolt with clearance slot has been declared a machine gun by the BATF . As a result , all known manufacturers of this type of bolt have ceased production . The only way to get such a bolt , at this time , is to purchase one of the open firing bolts which are slotless and alter it yourself after BATF Form I approval . <p> This is an interesting situation where the bolt is registered as a machine gun - not the weapon ! A similar situation exists with the M2 Carbine conversion kit . The desirability of this type of conversion is the weapon itself being able to revert back to its original semi-auto status . The receiver is n't altered and the trigger mechanism of the Uzi can be made to function in the full auto mode by the addition of a special select lever known by such names as the " 2-step " . <p> The only open firing bolts now available are devoid of any clearance slot on the side . Also , they function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that the large buffer block and semi-auto recoil spring must be replaced . <p> These bolts have been hardened and to mill a slot in a normal machine shop operation would require a + inch diameter carbide ball end mill . These are both expensive and easy to break . Hence , this formal operation is beyond the scope of the hobby gunsmith and that brings us to the purpose of this article . <p> The open firing bolt can be slotted quite easily with tooling as simple as a table saw or even a power hand saw used in a table saw configuration . All that is required is to equip the saw with a set of two 7-inch diameter x 1/8 inch thick metal cut-off wheels . These wheels are made from aluminum oxide bonded into a reinforcement of resin and fiberglass . If the blade cover plate will not accept this extra thickness , a replacement plate can be placed on the saw and arbor and slowly raised , thus allowing the wheels to cut their own new opening . Another method is to replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a DADO blade . <p> As with any machine tool operation , proper eye protection should be used . A container of water is necessary to cool the bolt during machining by submerging it after each cut . Since you 're using a woodworking saw , all the residue wood dust should be removed to lessen the fire hazard . <p> The ripping fence is used as a guide and is initially set 1-1/8 inch from the outside edge of the outermost blade . Since you 'll be cutting on the underside or " blind " , some method of limiting the travel will be necessary . The easiest way to accomplish this is to make a mark on either the table or fence with a crayon or tape . A stop block could be " C " clamped to the fence if desired . This mark should be located 2-5/16 inches from the center line of the arbor . <p> For the first cut , raise the cutting wheels 1/32 inch above the table . While holding the bolt firmly to the table and fence , slowly move it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saw and immerse it in the cooling water . While the bolt is cooling , increase the height of the cutting wheels by 1/32 inch and repeat the previous step . <p> Repeat these 1/32 inch cuts until the slot is .380 inch deep . The resulting slot will have a small wedge of metal remaining in the center . This is a result of the double cutting wheel setup and can be cleaned up by removing one cutting wheel and repositioning the fence to place the remaining wheel in the center of the slot . Again , cutting in 1/32 inch increments , remove this wedge from the center of the slot . <p> The resulting bolt will have small corner radiuses at the bottom of the slot . If a more professional job is desired , dress the outside edges of the double cutting wheels to a 1/8 inch radius . The exposed metal in the slot can be finished with cold blue . All that remains to be done now is to permanently mark the bolt per BA TF requirements . This can be done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The marking should be located to be read in the ejection port when the bolt is closed . <p> As one last warning , please be advised that , by the preceding bolt alteration , a machine gun ( by legal definition ) has been created , whether you possess the rest of the gun or not . It is your responsibility to obtain BATF Form 1 approval before the alteration begins .

@@77050619 @5750619/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> My Review of M-11/Nine Magazines : Zytel , PAM 2 and ZMAG <p> INTRODUCTION <p> This article constitutes my review of the most common standard-sized magazines for the SWD M-11/Nine ( and related ) SMGs , namely the Cobray Zytel , Recon Ordnance PAM 2 and recently , Shockwave ZMAG which have capacities of 30-32 rounds . I describe what I like and what I do n't  like about each magazine . Since I come from a test engineer background , I feel compelled to assign a numerical rating to each one . These are purely subjective based on what is important to me . Your ratings may , and probably would , differ . <p> Unlike the Uzi where the OEM factory mags usually function flawlessly , the SWD M-11/Nine ( which I will hereafter refer to incorrectly as the M-11 ) was sold with polymer Zytel magazines which had problems . The main problem was that the polymer feed lips would wear out or become deformed and the mag would cease to feed reliably . This drove a demand for either better mags ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow it to use a better existing mag such as the STEN mags . <p> BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT <p> I gave the ZMAG the highest rating of the group because it is the most user friendly and works flawlessly for brass ammo without any modification or tweaking . I hope Marty from Shockwave does not get mad at me but I still consider that there is room for improvement with the ZMAGs and since they are the only ones still in production , I would love to see a ZMAG upgrade kit that would change out the spring and follower for more robust designs . I still consider my Recon Ordnance PAM 2 mags to be the most reliable for all types of ammo and the most durable but they are not as user friendly as the ZMAGs and some required tweaking the feed lips to make them reliable . I am probably an exception , but I still like the original Zytel magazines after they have been modified with steel feed lips and once that mod is accomplished , I consider them as reliable for brass ammo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to thank Jerry Prasser of Recon Ordnance , Richard Lage of Lage Manufacturing and Marty Ewer of Shockwave Technologies and all other MAC entrepreneurs for their support of the M-11/Nine ( and similar ) platforms because without their contributions , my M-11s would be curiosities residing mostly in a safe . With their contributions , the M-11 is a great subgun that seriously competes with my favorite gun , the Uzi . The Uzi is still my favorite , but not by much . <p> MY RATINGS <p> I view the 32 round IMI Uzi mags as being the gold standard for 9mm SMG mags . The Uzi mags are double feed and the M-11 mags are single feed and there can never be a truly " apples to apples " comparison between the two types . But to the extent possible , I have tried to compare the M-11 mags against the Uzi mags . <p> In order to establish a rating scale , I set a baseline of zero points for a hypothetical basic M-11 mag that feeds brass ammo fairly well but has no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I set the rating for the Uzi mag at 100 points . From my point of view ( and aside from the double feed design ) , the Uzi mag has eleven enhancements or characteristics over a hypothetical basic M-11 mag . I have weighted the desirable characteristics differently in a such a way that if a mag had all the desirable features , it would add up to a 100 point rating like the Uzi . Here are my list of enhancements or desirable characteristics that could be applied to an M-11 mag along with my personal , completely subjective point values ( weighted to total 100 ) : <p> SMG Magazine Desired Characteristics : <p> Note : A very important and desirable characteristic would be corrosion resistance but I did not attempt to measure this and it is not considered in the ratings . <p> Zytel mags have been the subject of much criticism ( Zytel is a registered trademark of DuPont and is basically nylon ) . I will say up front that I like the Zytels as long as they have the steel feed lips modification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like them even better with witness holes drilled in them . I have drilled witness holes in several of mine to show 10 , 20 , 30 and 32 rounds . I like them because they are the easiest to load and are lightweight on top of that . I have used them since I 've had M-11s ( more than a decade ) and for most of that time , I could only compare them to PAM2s . So , by " easy to load " , I mean easy compared to the PAM 2s . They feed brass ammo reliably which for a long time is all that I shot . In the last few years as the cost of ammo has doubled and tripled , I have shot a lot of Russian steel cased ammo , typically TulAmmo from Walmart because it has been cheaper particularly compared to WWB which I do prefer . Unfortunately , the Zytels do not like the steel cased stuff very well due to its higher coefficient of friction and I can only load about 24 rounds before the bullets might start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring does n't  have enough force to always push the bullets tightly up against the mag lips because of the increased friction in the mag ) . This video clip demonstrates the issue : <p> Loading a Zytel mag may cause it to swell slightly resulting in a tighter fit . I have heard this as being an issue for others but I have never been really adversely affected by it . My mags do n't  drop freely anyway but are not hard to slide out . Since I do n't  shoot competitively , I do n't  care if they drop freely as long as they 're not too tight but I know this is important to some folks . <p> There are two kinds of " Cobray " Zytel magazines - the original OEM version and a recent ( since maybe 2008 ) issue of Zytels that are nearly identical to the originals . There is also a Zytel mag made by ProMag which appears similar to the others but was not tested . The original Zytels feature a logo that appears to have been part of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that appears to have been heat stamped on after the body was formed in much the same way that cattle are branded . The older logo features a snake with a globe in the center of the snake . The globe has several latitude and longitude lines . The new logo features a snake with a globe and a single latitude and single longitude line - perhaps it is not a globe but a crosshair sight . The more significant difference is that the original followers have long legs that would tend to serve an anti-tilt function . The new followers have very short legs and would seem to be more susceptible to misfeeds due to the follower tilting . For the spring force tests , I tested 2 of the new Zytels and 8 of the older Zytels . For the " drop free from mag well " tests , I tested all 26 of my Zytel magazines in two M-11/Nine SMGs . <p> Likes : Lightweight , easy to load , easy to disassemble , polymer follower is solid ( very durable ) , can be cut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench shooting and sighting in.Dislikes : Need to install steel lips , does n't  feed more than about 24 steel case rounds reliably . <p> Drop free from mag well on release ? Gun 1 : Of 22 full size Zytels tested , none dropped completely free . Of the four half-height Zytel mags tested , 2 dropped free . This is a little surprising since the half-heights were made by cutting down full size mags and should be the same width . Gun 2 : Of 22 full size Zytels and 4 half-height Zytels tested , none dropped free and they were all a tight fit . <p> Magazines made for the Argentine Pistola Ametrelladora Modelo 2 ( PAM 2 ) SMG have been modified to fit and function with the M-11 and are sold by Recon Ordnance Company . They are made entirely from heavy duty steel . Most of mine have a serial number stamped on the rear of the magazine and a few have " RECON ORD " stamped on the front of the mag . <p> PAM 2 mags are built like a tank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 rounds , have a witness hole so you know when the mag is full ( but there are no intermediate witness holes ) , and all of mine drop freely from the gun I usually shoot . Most of them work fine without any tweaking and are easy to disassemble . Some mags need their feed lips tweaked . PAM 2s have the greatest variability in terms of fit and function . There are differences in size and weight and presentation of the bullet in the feed lips , hence some need tweaking and some do n't  . There are also two problems all PAM 2 mags share : They are hard to load and they do not have a mag stop . To get the 30th or 32nd round loaded , you are looking at applying over 30 pounds of force , depending on how much random " stiction " is involved . PAM 2 mags have a lot of stiction . It is no fun to load a PAM 2 mag . Since there is no mag stop , you need to be at least somewhat careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This has never been a problem for me , but could be for some , especially in competition or under stress . However , a properly tweaked ( if necessary ) PAM 2 , once loaded , will not fail to push even steel case ammo to the top of the mag . They have very strong springs and I have never really needed to lubricate them . I have lubricated them , but I never felt I really needed to . <p> Shockwave Technologies in Salt Lake City developed and in 2014 began selling their ZMAG , designed specifically for the M-11/Nine SMG . The magazine body is steel with a polymer follower . All of my ZMAGs are from the first production run which I understand fit fine in most M-11s but were a tight fit for some M-11s . Due to complaints about a tight fit , subsequent production ZMAGS were slightly narrower and should fit anybodys M-11 . <p> My ZMAGs fit fine in my M-11s although they do not drop all the way free from the gun I shoot the most . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally made for the gun . The ZMAGs functioned perfectly with brass ammo right from the start . They choked on steel case TulAmmo right from the start due to the higher friction with the polymer coated steel casings . At first , I sprayed inside the mags with silicone because it has worked well for other mags . It did not work on the ZMAGs . So , I sprayed them with TriFlow , a wet Teflon based lube . That worked for several loadings over a several month period but then on the same day , a few of the ZMAGs started choking again on the TulAmmo . I cleaned them out with alcohol and sprayed 4 of them with Mil-Comms TW25B and 4 more mags with Blaster Dry Lube with PTFE ( a dry " Teflon " based lube recommended by the manufacturer , i.e. Marty ) . Although TW25B is my preferred lubricant and is what the USAF uses in the very demanding environment of the M61A1 Vulcan gatling gun , the spray version did not seem to work well for the ZMAGs . Although 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mags still choked on them . This video clip demonstrates the issue : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=HyCmtrwfLNE <p> I did not try the synthetic grease version of TW25B that I use for the M-11 itself . For now , the Blaster Dry Lube with PTFE seems to work fine as did the TriFlow . I may post an update in a few months to comment on the longer term results using the Dry Lube with PTFE . <p> The ZMAG is a great option but there are a couple of areas where I would like to see the ZMAGs changed . I would like to see a metal or thicker polymer follower and a more heavy duty spring . Its possible the ZMAGs will never need a new follower or spring but the plastic walls of the follower are only about 0.042 " thick and the spring contains the least amount of metal of the group . The ZMAG spring is similar in gauge and number of coils to the Uzi but feeding a single feed mag is harder . I believe a heftier spring would resolve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a heftier spring and more robust follower as an upgrade kit . I would buy several . <p> That said , a look at my M-11/Nine range box is a good indicator of which mags I prefer to use . My range box comfortably holds 14 full size mags ( plus 2 half-height mags which are good for sighting in from the bench ) . For many years , I carried 8 Zytels and 4 or 6 PAM 2s . Beginning late last year , I started carrying 4 Zytels , 4 PAM 2s , and 4 or 6 ZMAGs . Recently , that has changed . I now carry 8 ZMAGs , and a mix of 4 or 6 Zytels and PAM 2s . I usually load up all the mags I intend to use before I leave the house . It used to be that if I would load anything on the spot at the range , it would be a Zytel because its so much easier than a PAM . Now , I tend to load a ZMAG . <p> Likes : Fairly easy to load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Even after lubrication , performance with steel case ammo is not always assured . Hard to disassemble ( need hammer and punch to slide off base plate ) . Need hammer to slide plate back on . Spring and follower may be completely fine but seem less robust than others . <p> If you buy an M-11/Nine and for simplicity only want to worry about one type of magazine and do n't want to do any modification or tweaking of the magazine , I recommend Shockwaves ZMAG . If you only shoot brass , it is the most user friendly ( witness holes , mag stop , easy to load ) and you do n't  need to worry about anything else . If you do n't  mind some level of tweaking and do n't  need your mag to drop free in a subgun competition , applying steel feed lips ( available very inexpensively from Lage Manufacturing ) to a Zytel can produce a magazine that is generally very reliable for brass ammo . You can drill your own witness holes and have pretty much the same functionality of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want an extremely durable , very reliable mag that will feed any kind of ammo without even needing lubrication , consider the PAM 2 .

" I like to give them an opportunity to shoot my subguns but I prefer to just give them a mag with cheap Russian ammo and I do n't  want to be embarrassed by a failure of the magazine to properly feed the gun .

I finally went to the shooting range with my MAX-11 for the first time this calendar year . I had loaded up 8 ZMAGs with steel cased TulAmmo last fall . Those mags had been treated with Blaster PTFE last fall but had sat in their loaded condition in an ammo can for about 7 months . Unfortunately , 2 of the 8 mags would not fire in full auto . They worked in semi-auto but would n't push the steel cases up fast enough to keep up with FA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaster PTFE at the beginning of the season and periodically thereafter . <p> I know Marty advises against liquid lubricants but I have to say that I really believe I have had better luck using Tri-Flow spray on my ZMAGs for the steel case stuff than I have Blaster PTFE . It also requires re-treating after a while . Your mileage may vary . 
@@77050620 @5750620/ <p> The first submachineguns were relatively large , and were as heavy as the infantry rifles of the time . Even today some SMGs which are considered state-of-the-art weigh as much as a rifle . The trend , however , has been toward SMGs of reduced size , and if smaller is , in some cases , better , then UZI is moving towards the front of the pack . <p> The original UZI 9mm submachinegun was introduced nearly thirty-five years ago . It is considered the first such successful , mass-produced weapon to use the telescoping bolt , and it put Israel on the map as one of the worlds most promising small arms producers . The telescoping bolt surrounds the barrel instead of riding behind it , and acts much like the slide of the Browning type auto pistol . This changes the balance , and makes for a much shorter weapon . Where concealment is a factor , the latter feature is important , but so is weight , and the original UZI tips the scales at almost 9 pounds . Thirty years after the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mini-UZI , was designed . The Mini uses many of the same parts as the full sized UZI including the magazine . It is shorter by almost 4 inches , and weighs just 6 pounds . It has an efficient folding stock , and incorporates slots in the barrel to form an integral compensator to help control the weapon on automatic fire ( see CH April . 1984 ) . However , Israeli Military Industries , maker of the UZI , did not stop there . <p> Soon after the Mini-UZI SMG , UZI introduced a semi-auto only pistol for the U.S. market . While the pistol is based on the Mini-UZI SMG , it is even smaller . Called simply the " UZI Pistol " , the weapon falls into the category of the " Assault Pistol " , or a semi-auto only SMG-like weapon with no shoulder stock , and fires from a closed bolt . While the UZI Pistol is of high quality , like most weapons of this new breed , it is somewhat less of a pistol than a pistol-for-most-purposes . As one salesman once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to successfully combine a handgun with a Black &amp; Decker drill . " Jokes notwithstanding , however , a selective fire UZI Pistol with a shoulder stock would have merit in VIP protection roles and forced building entries where over-penetration is a problem , and this is exactly the weapon UZ1 has now produced to complete its family of SMG 's . The new gun is called the " Micro-UZl . " <p> The " littlest " UZ1 is indeed essentially that companys pistol with selective fire capabilities , and a folding stock which is similar to that on the Mini-UZI . This stock is not unlike the one used on the U.S. M1A1 ( paratroop ) Carbine , in that it operates on a pivoting spring loaded hinge , but the UZI stocks swing to the right which is more desirable mode for this type of mechanism . The butt is rigid , and the stock itself is of a strong steel tube construction , and is padded for comfort . It locks in either position under strong spring pressure , and is simply swung open and closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high quality stampings wherever possible , while other parts like the bolt and barrel are machined forgings . The grips are of high impact plastic . All metal parts are zinc phosphated , over which is applied a tough molecular finish such as is found on most European military firearms . An optional barrel is slotted like that of the Mini-UZI , to form an integral compensator which assists in controlling the weapon during automatic fire . These slots are on a bias to divert gases up and to the right so as to push the gun down and to the left . When the gun is fired on one 's right side , this helps to keep it on target . A left handed shooter , however , would be at a disadvantage . We noticed an increase in control with the slotted barrel . <p> Fires From Closed Bolt <p> Unique about the Micro among UZI SMG 's is that this one fires from a closed bolt . This is accomplished by the same means used with the UZ1 Carbine and UZ1 Pistol . In these weapons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear half amounting to a heavy striker assembly . When chambering a round , the cocking knob is pulled to the rear and released at which time it springs forward , stripping a round from the magazine and chambering it . The striker assembly , however , is caught by the sear , and stays to the rear until the trigger is pulled , where it too jumps forward powered by a separate spring , and drives the firing pin into the primer . Blowback momentum then drives both the bolt and striker assembly to the rear , and the cycle repeats itself . If the weapon is set on semi-auto , the sear disconnects from the trigger , and rises to catch the striker assembly as the bolt continues forward . If the gun is in the full auto mode , and the trigger remains pulled , the bolt and the striker move forward together , firing the round as it is chambered . <p> A submachinegun , or machine pistol , firing from a closed bolt means that the weapon will have a greater accuracy potential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jump forward to fire from the open bolt position , such as is the case with most SMG 's . In addition , the Micro-UZI can be used to a greater advantage on semi-auto at distances out to 100 meters or so . With this weapon we then have an extremely small and concealable SMG firing between 1100 and 1400 rounds per minute which is effective for use in building entries and VIP protection roles , but which can double as a close range sharp-shooting weapon if called upon to do so . It will accept any UZ1 magazine , and disassembles in the same general manner as do all UZIs <p> Special Accessories <p> Available for the Micro , and other UZI 's , is an excellent shoulder suspension rig . This holster is made of supple leather , and suspends the UZI , muzzle down , on the right side under the arm with two magazines hung on the left side . The UZI can be swung out and into action so quickly that it must be seen to be appreciated . From there the gun can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thumb-break snap , instantly frees the piece to have the stock extended and shouldered . This rig is suitable for plainclothes and uniformed carry alike . <p> Another accessory is a top cover mount for the Action Arms Mark V optical sight . While we did not have such a mount for the Micro-UZl , we did test it on a Mini-UZ1 , and found it to provide sufficient accuracy to make semi-auto body hits at 100 meters , even using the Mini 's open bolt system . A closed bolt such as is standard with the Micro-UZl would provide even greater accuracy . The new mount will also accept most other optical Sights . <p> Another accessory we were allowed to test was a prototype vertical foregrip which attaches to the bayonet lug of any UZI weapon . This grip slants forward like that of the Hungarian AKM , and aids in control and fast maneuvering of the weapon . It may become a standard UZI accessory . Beside the above , there is a vast array of UZI accessories available with more on the drawing board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for such a small SMG . Due to the shortness of the gun , the most feasible way to fire it on full auto is with the stock extended , in either the shoulder or the high tuck position depending upon range . The recommended way to hold the Micro is by using a modified Weaver type grip as there is nothing else to grip properly , and we found this hold to work best . In a pinch , such as when rappelling , the gun can be fired full auto using one hand , but with some loss of control . <p> With short full auto burst from the standard barrel we could easily keep most hits on a silhouette target at 30 feet . On semi-auto , the Micro neatly grouped 25 rounds into 5 inches at 25 yards from the standing position , and the entire 25 round magazine was fired in less than 30 seconds ! In short , the Micro-UZI performed much better than we had expected , especially with the ported barrel , and it fed anything we put through it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the excellent Beretta 93R machine pistol ( see FULL AUTO , 1984 ) , but with the advantage of having a fully folding stock , and not being limited to a 3-shot burst mechanism , although the Beretta 's is a good one . While it is less practical to fire the Micro UZI with the stock folded , especially on full auto , this feature makes for excellent concealment of the weapon . It can be easily hidden under a jacket or overcoat , and then quickly brought into action by simply swinging the stock to the open position , or it can be kept out of sight just as easily with the stock already extended . <p> We also fired the Micro-UZl with a suppressor designed especially for it , and the Mini-UZI , by Jonathan Arthur Ciener , Inc. , 6850 Riveredge Dr. , Titusville , FL 32780 . For this test we fired several types of 9mm ammunition , including SAMPSON 9mm Carbine/SMG ONLY high velocity , Blazer 9mm JHP and special IMI blue tip Subsonic 9mm . The suppressor adds just a few inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when using the high velocity black tipped SMG rounds , although the special subsonic ammo is noticeably quieter with barely more than a whisper and the operation of the bolt able to be heard . We also tested this suppressor on the Mini-UZI along with a brand new " heavy " bolt for that SMG , which cuts the rate of fire from 950 down to 750 RPM . There will also be a closed bolt available soon for the Mini-UZI which will operate exactly as does that of the Micro . Also available down the road will be .45 ACP/9mm conversion kits for all UZI SMGs , and a .22 kit . Look for our test on it soon . <p> The Micro UZI typifies the high quality UZI has come to be known for the world over , as UZI products are in use in virtually every Freeworld country and probably all Comm-block countries as well . What is more , the Micro has taken UZI to a new level , a marriage of the utmost in concealability , reliability and effectiveness matched by few other weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now an UZI " for all seasons " where such a weapon is called for . The excellent magazine , and spare parts logistics are a high selling point for simplifying inventory , and the optical sight and .45 ACP conversion options will appeal to a great many users .

@@77050623 @5750623/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Wanted : Review of FREE Suppressor Cover <p> Ok Guys , <p> We have a new line of Suppressor Covers and need ONE member to accept a free one for your review . Just like the Fake Can offer .. first PM or EMAIL to me gets a Cover of your choice in either our standard sizes ( Fits our Fake Can line ) . The Two standard sizes are 8 X 1.5 " or 13.5 X 1.5 " . <p> I can offer some observations without even seeing one of your covers in person , though . I 've used the old RPB / Et . Cetra nomex covers before . You know , the ones with the coil spring on one end to hold the cover in place on a MAC can . <p> The inside of the cover was very smooth . You put it on a smooth can , and you get zero traction . The cover does indeed provide a heat barrier . And on most guns , that would be sufficient . Unfortunately , I was using my can on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the can in place to keep it from unscrewing . The cover was so slick on the can , that it would still start to loosen while shooting in spite of me gripping the cover tightly ( okay - insert girly-man grip jokes here ) . <p> What I found worked very well were the lace-up leather &amp; nomex covers made by Beep , wife of Dolphin Shooter on the Subguns.com boards . Whatever the leather was treated / finished with seems to grip the smooth aluminum can very well . That sucker is not coming off unless you unlace it and it works very well for heat protection . Here 's mine in use : <p> Similarly , while I have n't tried them , the Griptastic cover from Tom Bowers appears to be a good option as well . It is made from some type of high-temp rubber ( neoprene maybe ) and has ridges so there is some air between the shooter 's hand and the hot can as well . <p> Now , I 'm not here trying to poop on your new product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality product brought to our little hobby/sport/obsession . But the carbon felt appears to be pretty slick , and would probably give similar results as my original Et . Cetra cover . I imagine you were looking for something that would not mar or scratch the can 's surface . After all , sandpaper would stay put , but the can would look beat to death after one use . But you might consider using something that has some grip , while still protecting the can 's surface . <p> Hi , Thanks for some insight . We looked at some of those designs and liked some of what they offered and missed some of what they did n't . <p> I do n't care for lace up anything but my shoes I like silicon for a heat insulator but not as a layer of material between a speeding piece of bullet or can/baffle fragment and my bare hand . <p> Yes the Carbon Fiber is slicker and can slide a bit but we use a 1/4 thick piece that tends to smash and fill pretty well around the can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we used mutiple straps around the edge instead of one on the seam edge , it makes it tighter and provides a little more range . <p> I guess I wanted a heavy duty cover since I make Form 1 Cans and am always just a little worried I made that last Baffle hole " just a little " to tight . <p> They all have their place and all are a compromise . I like the retro look of Leather and straps on the old Two Stage Sionics Cans though . <p> If I could sell em I would make these with a Durorubber material on the end seams to provide some real grip but the stuff is CRAZY in price for the really high temp stuff . Keep the ideas coming though .. I love the thought processes . <p> Works great for a while . But even a rubber O-ring , teflon on the threads , and cranked on with a strap wrench wo n't work for extended use . <p> Like the time I was at a subgun match and ran 300 rounds of .45 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds . <p> It started out as a good run , but the can eventually loosened . And then the baffle strikes started and accuracy went in the toilet . So I needed to shoot more which made the situation worse . I suppose I 'm lucky I did n't launch the endcap downrange . Here is what I ended up with . <h> Can Cover Review <p> Sorry for it taking so long to post the product review , life happens ... Here is my first impression of the quality and function of the Title II Arms Can Cover ... <p> At first glance the can cover looks to be well made . I know very little about sewing so I had my wife take a look at it . She is a quilter and has been sewing for many years . She made a few positive comments then noticed that a couple of the stitches that attach the Velcro are coming loose , she could not tell me if they would fail or if they were just loose and nothing to worry about . Due to the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gun club ; it is down in the river bottom and prone to flooding . I wanted to give it a try so I ran three 32 round 9mm mags through the M10 with my Lage Max10 upper and Bower CAC9 suppressor . I shot the three mags back to back as fast as the gun would shoot . The can heated up but did not get too hot the burn the skin . The can cover did not heat up even after several minutes after doing the mag dumps . My UZI cans are out being rebuilt/cleaned so I was not able to try the can cover on either of the cans I have for it . I did use it on my YHM Cobra 45 can on my Sig P220 . It is difficult if not impossible to shoot enough ammo through the Sig to make the can uncomfortable to the touch . The can cover did make the sights unusable as it increased the diameter of the can too much to be able to use them . I tried to use it on my TAC67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the same problem on the P22 as I did with the Sig , too large to use the sights . The Ruger was usable but not necessary . Like the Sig it is difficult to shoot enough ammo to make the can too hot to handle . The only real test I was able to perform was with the M10 . I think that the can cover will meet the needs of fellow subgun owners . It is VERY easy to use with the Velcro , so much better/faster than a lace on cover . I did not shoot enough to get the outside of the can cover to change temperatures so that tells me it does what it was intended to do ; protect your hands from getting burned while giving you something to hold on to . A big " Job Well Done " goes out to the guys at Title II Arms . <p> I would add a picture of the cover on my MAX10 but I am not having much luck getting the photo to cooperate . 
@@77050624 @5750624/ 71162 @qwx691162 <p> My Cobray went about 5000 rounds before it started having any jams . The jams seem to stem from using Wolf which pounds the heck out of the cheap ejector rod . Once the rod is slightly bent , it makes ejection not so consistent . This is because the rod can rotate and the point of impact on the brass changes as it does so . I had it where it kept jamming each magazine , took it apart , and when it was put back together it shot great . This is because of said rod being slightly bent . It eventually ate up my upper and I had to get a new one . I also bought a new rod . <p> The parts are inexpensive , so no worries . <p> These guns are very reliable when new . <p> When you shoot a bunch of rounds through them , they can easily be put back into very reliable status just by replacing some key parts . <p> These guns can take a lot of rounds , and with the new MAX-11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to the lower cyclic and weight to help dampen vibration . <p> The M-11/9 has some variation in shooting between guns . What I mean by this is , you can take a handful of these smgs and they have a slightly different shooting experience to them . <p> Some stocks are nice and tight , some wobbly . Some uppers are a little tighter tolerance to the bolt and the cyclic rate is lower , and some are chainsaw fast . Some feel smooth and controlled , some feel like jackhammers . <p> I replaced my upper with another Cobray stock upper and now it feels like a jackhammer when before it was pretty smooth and controllable . My groups have opened up quite considerably . My buffer is like new ... <p> I am just going to go with the MAX-11 and be done with it . I just need to get myself $700 first . I have shot the MAX-11 and it is the same shooting quality if not better as an UZI . <p> I bought my M11/9 NIB for $3200 . Not a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the deal . Really the M11/9 in stock form is pretty crude compared to other designs ... but you can do alot with the basic gun to make it very nice . The Lage upper and folder will turn the M11/9 into another gun entirely , making the M11/9 the best buy for " cheaper " subguns . Take the plunge and buy NIB if you can and then get on Richards waiting list . If you really want to break the bank a Uzi is a great choice but is in the 6-7k range . <p> Have you considered the M10 in 45 ? It 's much bigger and heavier than the M11/9 but it 's a lot more robust ; both parts and receiver . Do try one first as the grip is kinda bulky for some people . There 's also the possibility of 9mm and other caliber conversions that 'll work with the M10 . But if you 're into accessories , nothing beats the M11/9 in terms of add-on options . If I were to only get one gun , it would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as getting " only one " when it comes to C3 . <p> I bought a NIB sten converted M11/9 a couple of years ago for $1700 . Everyone told me at the time that I paid way too much , but its the standard NFA situation where you never pay too much , you just buy it too late . <p> During my " Wait " I posted asking advice for what spare parts to buy . I got all kinds of nutty responses . One guy even told me to get the whole gun rewelded and refinished before shooting it . The best advice I got was from the guy at RPB who told me " go shoot it and then call us if you need to " . <p> I have n't shot my M11/9 a whole lot ( few thousand rounds ) , but so far it has functioned perfectly . The only thing you definitely need to replace on a recurring basis is the buffer . The soft rubber ones go pretty quick which is why I prefer the harder ones . <p> The M11/9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do with it . Its no uzi , but you can make it into something resembling and uzi for an extra $700 with the Lage slow fire upper . Since I have an uzi , I shoot it at normal ( buzz gun ) speed . I like mine and am glad I bought it . Its a fun toy . <p> IMO , there are some things you need to do before firing it . Frankly , I do n't think they 're safe out of the box to fire : <p> 1 . Get rid of the crappy wire stock . Sooner or later , it will collapse on you while you 're shooting it ( not good ) . There are a number of replacement stocks ranging from fancy side folders to cheap conversion pieces that allow you to attach a cheap collapsable M-16 stock ( what I did ) . <p> 2 . Get rid of the strap . The guy at RPB said that they 'd seen guns come in with the strap having a bullet hole in it . This is simply not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me " there 's guys missing digits because of these guns " . <p> 3 . Get a sidecocking upper . The upper that comes with the gun is a POS . The cocking handle will sooner or later fly off and hit you in the face before disappearing and ruining your trip to the range . Get a sidecocking upper that preferably has a mount for a red dot optic . A red dot scope makes shooting a lot more fun . <p> 4 . Get some space between your fingers and the end of the barrel spewing about 20 rounds per second . I opted for a 10 " sidcocking upper with a foregrip . You can also attach a real or fake silencer . I think its wise to have something up there so your fingers are n't literally less than an inch from the end of the barrel . <p> I do have a spare bolt assembly for mine , but have never used it . The sten mags a a bit of a pain to load , but they function perfectly and are dirt cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks . The M10/45 probably is a better gun , but I 'm happy with my M11/9 . I have a 45 conversion for my uzi and rarely ever use it . I think 9mm is the best round for a subgun . The uzi is definitely a better gun than either , but you 're looking at a lot more money to get one . <p> Mine had some pretty substantial issues due to bad extractor , since replacing the extractor have had only 2 stoppages , both due to magazine problems . <p> I use both Zytel and Recon Ord metal mags , just received the my Max-11 upper . An unbelievable improvement to the weapon . Workmanship is absolutely top notch . <p> I would think the days of the M11/9 being the bargain MG are rapidly coming to an end , with the addition of the Max-11 ( or some of the other hoopy uppers ) desirability of this gun is going to increase substantially . <p> I was always an anti M11/9 snob ( I admit it ) , but with the Max-11 made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to see how the Max-11 shoots , let me know . <p> What do you guys think of a Powder Springs Mac 10/9 with PS Silencer for $3700 ? <p> If your looking for a collectable then go for it . <p> If you just want a shooter and do n't  care of the make they can be had cheaper <p> personally I would not get a 10/9. for the same money you can get a 10/45 and have the abillity to shoot 9mm as well ( w/ another upper , bolt &amp; mag adaptor ) <p> The M11/nine seems to be the " in " gun currently ( as far as MAC 's go . ) It 's not that hard to see why with all the acessories *currently* availible . However with the max10 comming out and SCA talking about a suomi upper for the fat MAC , the accessory gap will ( IMHO ) soon be briged ... basically any design that will ( conceptually ) work on a 11/nine should work on a 10/45 . Then add in the fact that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just cant do that with the 11/nine <p> really just looking for a shooter . Might try to build a silencer instead of buying a FA . Much cheaper too , I would n't have to sell any guns . I am really limited on purchasing anything premade cause I need it to be instate on form 4 as age requirements do n't apply to the instates per atf letter . <h> Dragon Man <p> philipg <p> He has a very extensive paint ball setup - but for the real thing it is very basic - long shooting line with a number of 25 yard and 100 &amp; 125 yard target positions . <p> Worth the trip just to see the place ( VERY NON PC ) - He is a full Class III dealer .

@@77050632 @5750632/ <h> Receivers:The ATF opinion appears to be that you can do just about anything you want to a semi automatic UZI receiver to bring it up to SMG specifications except for one thing - removing the bolt blocking bar . <p> The Model A and Model B semi automatic UZI carbines all had a bolt blocking bar welded to the inside of the receiver . This bar prevents an unmodified SMG bolt from being used in the gun and was required by the ATF to get approval to sell the gun in the US . Removal of this bar is considered to be manufacturing a machinegun , and results in what is known as a " registered receiver " . That is the preferred way to convert an UZI and permits the use of unmodified SMG bolts . Not all of the transferable registered receivers converted before 1986 had the blocking bar removed . Some people registered the receiver but used a slotted bolt with it . In those cases , the bolt was usually unmarked ( since it was not the registered part ) but it is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver would create an unregistered machinegun . Because of that , a registered receiver that still has the block bar attached is no more versatile than a registered bolt . Since May of 1986 , only class II dealers can create a new machinegun by removing the blocking bar and the gun is considered to be a dealer sample , not transferable to individuals . <h> Bolts:Instead of removing the blocking bar , many people created a registered bolt by taking a standard SMG open bolt and milling a slot on the side so it could pass over the block bar . For people doing transferable conversions before 1986 , doing a registered bolt was convenient because they could get a large supply of bolts and the conversion process was easy . B&amp;G is probably the most common registered bolt around today . Here 's a picture of a registered B&amp;G bolt . The vast majority of registered bolts are open bolts , but there are a few registered closed bolts . They were usually made by taking a semi automatic closed bolt and welding up the lower lip so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welded up lower lip is not as durable as an original factory bolt . <p> It has been reported that some of the early semi automatic Model A carbine 's that came into the US had a fully supported bolt face . Representatives from IMI have denied it and the ATF probably would n't have allowed it , but it 's possible that IMI forgot to mill off the lower lip on some of the bolts or the ATF did n't initially realize that it was an issue . It 's also possible that IMI made these bolts available separate from the guns for conversion purposes . Regardless of how they got here , original slotted IMI closed bolts with a lower lip do exist but they are quite rare . They would have been an ideal bolt to register prior to 1986 , requiring no modifications to the receiver or the bolt . <h> Barrels:Depending on what type of bolt was used in the conversion , there may or may not be a conflict with the barrel restrictor ring . For information on the barrel restrictor ring , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled in the conversion will determine what kind of barrel can be used in the gun . Another thing affecting the barrel is the trunion . The inside diameter of the threaded end of the trunion is smaller on a semi automatic UZI carbine than it is on an SMG . This prevents SMG barrels from being inserted into an unmodified semi automatic trunion . A full conversion should bore out the trunion to SMG specs , although it usually was not done . If it has not been done , then the forward trunion band on an SMG barrel has to be turned down to use it in the gun . Here are some different barrel configurations that could be needed in different types of conversions : <p> Factory IMI Chrome lined SMG barrel . Note that the SMG barrel has the larger diameter band after the flange and thus requires the trunion to be opened up to SMG specs . This barrel also has the full barrel diameter all the way to the chamber end , requiring the barrel restrictor ring to be removed . <p> An original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit in a semi automatic trunion and the chamber areas turned down to fit in the barrel restrictor ring . This is commonly found on conversion guns , especially if spare barrels are desired . <p> Chrome lined Bushmaster barrel . The front band and chamber are smaller diameter for use in an unmodified semi automatic receiver , plus the secondary band is in place for additional trunion support . This gives the barrel three areas of support - the restrictor ring , plus the rear and front of the trunion . <p> Chrome lined barrel that appears to be an original IMI semi automatic barrel cut down to SMG length for a registered conversion or an SBR . Note that there is no secondary trunion band so support would be by the front of the trunion and barrel restrictor ring like a normal semi automatic barrel . <p> When transferable conversions were being done in the 1980 's , surplus UZI parts were harder to come by and more expensive than they are today , so there was more incentive to convert existing semi parts then to replace them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done via registered sears . Fleming removed the bolt blocking rail from the receiver and engraved his information on the bottom of the receiver as seen in the picture below . The sear was also crudely engraved with the same info with a vibrating pencil engraver . These sears are permanently married to the receiver and can not be removed . While this information may not be documented on the current form the gun is on , it should be . Qualified did some registered sears that are not married to the receiver but are extremely rare . <p> Receiver Markings : As a final touch , people doing conversions may have restamped the receiver markings to make the gun look like an original SMG . Most conversions were not remarked . Fleming did a " Basic " and " Deluxe " UZI conversion . The Deluxe consisted of remarking the receiver to say " UZI SMG " ( although a factory IMI UZI should really be marked " SMG UZI " ) . The Deluxe also had the lower remarked to ARS while the Basic was usually AFS.

And the going prices for a used semi M-14 , or a new M1A1 as the reincarnated Springfield Armory sells them , was a shock to discover . <p> After researching many , many sites and opinion pages , I have just about come to the conclusion that some variant of the FN-FAL is what I want . But there are so many variants made by different manufacturers in different countries which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to go fishing for opinions on this site ; which I 've come to recognize as the best collection of wits and wisdom of any firearms site I have ever visited .

Not really helpful folks on two of them that I visited , either . <p> I have a couple of .308 variants and I would have to say that the FAL is one of the best .

I bought both my FAL 's used and I have n't had a problem with them . I would go with a metric FAL , IMHO . <p> How about I start simple : of the two types of FALs ( inch and metric ) which would be better to own in the USA ? Which is cheaper ? Which is more reliable ? <p> I know I want a fixed wood stock and foregrip ( I want the weight ) so that should narrow things down . <p> Which manufacturers are the ones to seek ?

If you want an inch gun you 'll have to build it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it built ( unless you buy a century arms variant , same quality issues as all their other guns - some can be great , some bad ) . An Inch gun will take metric mags , but not the other way around . There is no real world difference in reliability between a metric and an inch gun . <p> Izzy means Israeli . An " Izzy " can be built on ANY receiver . There are two types of Izzy 's a light barrel variant and a heavy barrel variant . The light barrel is a standard profile barrel while the heavy barrel is you guessed it ... The furniture looks pretty close to the same but is slightly different and the heavy barrel has a big BAR style bipod . In addition , there are many " Izzy " clone rifles , which are any mixed and matched combination of parts w/ Israeli furniture . FAL parts are pretty much interchangeable so you 'll find lots of mutts . <p> DSA 's are good , as are any FAL properly built on an Imbel ( Brazilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more so ) , Belgian ( real deal , drool ) or Onyx ( even yet more rare ) receiver . Century arms can be ok , if you must have one you 're best bet is one built on an imbel receiver ( earlier production models ) . <p> I 'd watch the marketplace at the falfiles . You can probably get a really nice one for $800 or so if you wait . If you 're looking to spend more , for example anything above $1500 , I 'd say get a Belgian gun ( factory gun , same thing a HK91 is to a vector or a PTR 91 ) . You can get a standard model for between $2-2.5k . <p> P.S. ; I ca n't tell a bit of difference between synthetic and wood furniture .

Inch magazines are getting much harder to come by at the moment . Metric mags are still available , but condition and price varies . Basic difference between the mags : Metric mags have a stamped-outward triangular projection at the top front as a catch tab . Inch pattern mags have a L-shaped bit of steel welded on . Metric receivers have a triangular dimple machined into the front inside wall of the mag well , Inch receivers have a rectangular indention . Metric mags will fit in an Inch gun , but not vice versa . Metric mags sometimes fall out of Inch guns . Metric barrels are threaded to be " timed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying thicknesses . Many parts will actually interchange between the two styles , including furniture . <p> I know I want a fixed wood stock and foregrip ( I want the weight ) so that should narrow things down . <p> In the past few years Australian parts kits ( Inch ) were imported into the US , marketed by Tapco and others . These have all but dried up , and " Gun Parts Guy " ( google ) bought the remaining stock from Tapco . Wood furniture is available from him and other seconddary sources but the condition varies . DS Arms ( DSA ) also has US-made wood furniture available . <p> Which manufacturers are the ones to seek ? Which are the ones to avoid ? Are there certain years of certain models that suck ? Man , this is complicated . <p> There have been lots of FALs built up by various manufacturers and private individuals over the past 25 years or more .

Professional ' smiths including Arizona response Systems , AZEX Arms , and Black River Gunsmithing ( and others ) built FALs using parts kits form all over . These are good builds . <p> Still , some expereinced and inexperienced individuals also built up FALs in their basements an garages . The quality of the builds varies greatly .

It 's not a problem at a known range but in combat the range would be a guess . <p> At 200 yards the drop is only 42 inches , that seems more realistic as a maximum range . The bullet would be going 805 fps at that range , still has plenty of energy . <p> The actual practical range of the cartridge is the " paper plate test " , the farthest you could hit a paper plate reliably . <p> Seems to me that with a moderate amount of practice a guy with a 9mm MAC could pass the paper plate test out to maybe 150 yards reliably . I mean make a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drop would only be 15 inches , that means you could just point the gun and shoot , not bother with any hold-over for bullet drop . <p> Originally Posted by sillycon <p> I 'm not sure what sort of chrono results you 'd hope for .

The Germans &amp; Russians killed a few million of each other ( and Americans &amp; Chinese ) with 9mm SMGs , and of course , the Israelis are pretty adept at taking care of business with the 9MM. 150-200 meters with sub-gun velocity loaded 9mm is very effective . <p> I personally saw a number of NVA taken out by Karl Gustavs ( Swedish K ) at well over 150 meters in ' Nam , and even one spectacular shot with a Browning Hi-Power at around 200 meters .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead .... <p> No offense , but the 8mm mauser has doubtlessly killed 100,000x as many people as the 9mm .

In one battle , 20,000 French guys died in ONE HOUR . Submachine guns and pistols are very secondary type weapons . <p> No offense taken , however , I have heard for many years that the 9MM Parabellum is still the #1 military killer , though there 's really no hard &amp; fast data ( at least not that I can find ) , just what I 've heard said over the last 50-some-odd years from many sources . <p> As far as sheer numbers , the 9mm has been around since 1902 , used in every conflict since that time ( usually by both sides ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even today . <p> It has been the most widely ISSUED military cartridge in history , to far more nations than you might think . Argentina , Austria , Australia , Bulgaria , Canada , China , Chile , Great Briton , Denmark , Egypt , Finland , India , Israel , Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , South Africa , Syria , and of course Germany , as well as all modern NATO forces ( including the US ) have all used 9mm sub-guns &amp; pistols in their armies over the last 100+ years . The HK MP-5 &amp; UMP are still one of the go-to firearms for Spec-Ops even today .... <p> The number of shots fired is meaningless ...... You 'd be surprised how many rounds are fired to induce a single casualty in combat - the shorter the range however , the higher the percentage goes . I agree that pistols &amp; sub-guns tend to be secondary combat arms , ( the Germans did n't think so , but that 's another point ) but in many engagements ( house-to-house &amp; close quarters combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for a larger percentage of casualties per shots fired . <p> In the " old days " , long-range firepower was needed because the engagement ranges were much longer &amp; the average infantryman was armed with long-range weapons ( 8MM Mauser , 30-06 , 7.62 NATO , etc ) , but today - except for possibly Afghanistan - most infantry firearms are mainly sub-400 meter weapons because combat tactics have changed - it 's much more up-close &amp; personal since Vietnam ( most engagements were at less than 50 meters ) . For the long-range stuff you call in an air-strike . <p> No big deal really ... everyone has their own opinion , but like I originally said : do n't sell the 9mm short . While it 's not my personal favorite cartridge for every situation , it 's been around for 100+ years , and still being used in large number today for one reason ; because it works . Take care .... <p> Additional comment .... The " 20000 French guys in one hour ? " I know that early in WWI the French were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four ranks deep across open ground ) , but they found out that did n't work too well against machine guns .... That , like the Battle of the Somme ( where the British had 60,000 casualties in one day - again - sending men out over open ground against machine-gun fire ) , were isolated incidents , and speak more to the idiocy of the French &amp; British Officer corps than the efficacy of the 8mm cartridge . There were also far more causalities in WWI from Artillery and disease than rifle bullets . Just sayin .... <p> I think it would really depend on what you consider " effective " . Effective as in able to penetrate a human target or effective as in able to go whatever distance ? I know for me , the effective range of all my firearms by technical specs is far greater than the effective range of my abilities , at least if you are talking about the target sizes and groups I try to shoot . That said , I can still put shots from my UZI Carbine on paper at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooters than I am can put them in better groups at that range as well .

Brand new Golani Sporter . Built in June of this year on a " Caspian " receiver . Picked it up on Friday . Took it by the local AK guru yesterday . Checked out mostly OK . Replaced the extractor spring and recoil guide rod assembly spring , as both were worn and the latter was rusty . Cleaned out the bolt and the recoil guide rod . <p> Action is smooth , smoother than my adopted AKS-74N in 5.56mm . The ejector is nice and sharp . The barrel even appears to have been chambfered at the chamber and there are no problems with chambering rounds . Even the Barnes TSXs I bought have no problems , except being just a little beat up . ( But nothing that should inhibit the TSXs from expanding properly . ) The stock wobbles like a drunken sailor when folded and wobbles a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be more cost effective to replace the stock with a new one than to restore the worn one ) . But , beyond that , the gas block is straight , the barrel is straight ( and head space is OK ) , no signs of the receiver being soft or the bolt doing anything it is n't supposed to . Even looks like the guys who had the gun farmed out to them ran a couple of rounds through it to make sure it worked . <p> Took the rifle out to the range . Loaded up my two 35-round Orlites ( purchased years ago , when CDNN had them new in the wrapper ) with a veritable smorgasbord of ammunition : American Eagle XM855 , PMC and UMC 55-grain plinkers , and a couple of rounds of Barnes 's new VOR-TX ammunition . Despite all the initial good news , the gun is running at 90% reliability , right now . Ran 75 rounds and had seven malfunctions , all failures to eject ( and one failure to extract , which my AKS-74N had the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrected and the extractor and extractor spring was replaced ) . One stove-piped , one failed to extract fully ( as described above ) , and the rest just plain failed to exit the receiver ( necks smashed against the barrel ) . <p> Ejection pattern was good , about a yard to the right and three-to-five yards forward , with a couple of outliers ( likely the rounds immediately before or after a malfunction ) . And the pattern that the malfunctions fell into was ... unusual . It would run fine for 10-15 rounds and then the next five would be a malfunction every other round . And then it would go back to normal for another 10-15 rounds . <p> So ... what are the odds that it 's just the chamber is rough and the extractor is fine ? Should I replace the extractor , anyway , and just run a couple hundred rounds to see if the chamber smooths out ? <p> Thanks ! <p> EDIT : Yay , dyslexia ! Obviously , I intended the title to be " Another Fine Example of Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who Cenruty is . If you work for Cenruty , I apologize . : P <p> What I 'd do is replace both the extractor and extractor spring with a new set , keeping in mind most of the suppliers selling just the springs are used parts .

That and run a couple of hundred more rounds through it . Doing all this got my problem child golani running 100% that last several outings . <p> Hmmmm , CAI still half asses Golani Sporters ...

" Search " on here and I corrected the problem for the most part and it is a rifle that I can depend upon , a keeper , , <p> Then I came by an AK47 , WASR-10/63 also somewhere via CAI and the only thing wrong with the AK is that they welded the damned thread protector onto the end of the barrel , so no screw on flash hiders . Otherwise a good ' un ... <p> Oh , the Galil/Golani stock was wobbly , folded or back ... A thin piece of cardboard in the right place solved that when the stock is back , I ignore the wobble when folded , as it seldom is folded ... <p> Sounds just like mine until I replaced the extractor and spring together . Made it 100% ever since then , with all kinds of ammo . Including some handloads I made up testing some surplus powder . 55 grain bullet at only 2400 fps and they ejected like normal . <p> I must be a lucky one have a GLO serial never had a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rec.Its the best century prod I ever got ! G3 -FAL BOTH JUNK ! <p> That 's the whole thing with Century - they can be so hit or miss . My Golani had many problems ( still glad I got it though ) , but my G3 and Fal clones were excellent . It 's like spinning a roulette wheel , sometimes you win sometimes you loose , but then again that 's why they are cheaper . My Century C91 ( HK91/G3 clone ) has .019 bolt gap with standard rollers and my L1A1 Fal runs like a clock . Guess the monkeys showed up sober that day . Did ok with a C93 too , but my Century juju ran out with my Golani . <p> after adding metal to the top of the mag catch , my golani feeds perfect . i ca n't believe how accurate it is , considering the barrel looks like a smoothbore. must be DAMN shallow rifling. i 've run 500+ rounds of steel case brown bear without a stoppage . <p> I have probably about a dozen Century products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Golanis , 3 C93s and never had a problem with ANY of them . <p> If you look at a NM AR15 , the inside of the barrel looks very similar to the Golani , very shallow rifling . Makes for easier cleanup and better accuracy , and will last at least 5000 accurate rounds at 600 yards , and will still shoot good at 300 for another 3000 . A chrome lined barrrel might last 15000 . <p> EDIT : Nope . Well . Maybe . More likely the problem is the recoil guide rod . The monkeys at Century dremmelled it and I always wondered why ... turns out that it was to get the recoil guide rod to mate at the back of the receiver ... but they removed too much material . <p> you might add a little material to the bottom edge of the top cover at the rear so it seats evenly and level , when you add enough material the top cover should be touching the bottom of the groove in the receiver when the tab on the spring guide just slips thru the window

It would have the round go in at a slight angle which stopped the bolt against the round creating a jam . <p> I sent it back to Pro Ord. and it came back with a slightly more throated chamber . What I mean by chamber , is where the locking lugs fit into the barrel . The smith there dremilled and buffed it , and the gun never EVER jammed again ! <p> The gun is incredibly light , durable , reliable , and the best part was , it had pin point accuracy . It bump fired so well , and was a flame thrower with an incredible report to it . <p> I only sold it because I was told by three seperate owners that the bolt was the first thing to break . They said the bolt was brittle like it was made from pot metal . Mine did n't  break , but I sold it soon after , and I was very disappointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they refined it a little . I looked into the bolt problem by calling Bushmaster and they said they solved it by making the bolts out of the same steel they use on their AR-15s . I was assured that they will not break . <p> Did the problem of jamming only exist in my Carbon 15 ? No ... Why ? Because , I have seen two other Carbon 15 pistols on the range and I observed them having the same jam here and there . Did I see if it was a Pro Ord. or if it was a Bushmaster ? No ... <p> I WILL be buying another Carbon 15 pistol within a year . It has to be made by Bushmaster . If it jams , I know the fix , and the end result is an incredibly fun pistol ! <h> Bushmaster Carbon pistol <p> Have had one about a year , probably 100 rounds through it .

It 's a fun range gun , but his FTF problem is too common on that gun for me to trust it for anything else . Lucky for him he 's got a Kimber Custom for that <p> I have a bushmaster carbon 15- the type that has the stupid buttstock . <p> I love it . It is 100% reliable with Wolf and the fireballs are awesome . The muzzle brake is a quick detach type and they make an adapter so you can use whatever aftermarket FH you want . The recoil is low .

That 's something I ca n't say about my RRA 9mm rilfe it 's picky about the Mags it will work with and had about 5 jams while shooting in about the same number of rounds fired as the bushmaster . The RRA is still a good rifle I like it , but just more picky about mags and ammo it will use . All I ever here is people making bad remarks about the carbon guns even though they never owned one ? I have had two bushmaster carbon units and they never have had any problems and are so light to carry it made me sell a few of my heavier Ar15 's as I disliked the weight and feel of them after being spoiled to the light feel .

@@77050645 @5750645/ <p> Used by dozens of countries for over five decades , the UZI submachine gun is one of the world 's oldest and most famous firearms still in use today . This is especially unique since the basic design of the UZI remained unchanged over the years . Made famous by military and law enforcement agencies around the world , made infamous by Hollywood , the UZI is known to everyone . <p> The history of the Uzi started in 1951 , when designer Uziel Gal submitted his design for testing by the Israeli Defense Force ( IDF ) . Gal drew on his own battlefield experiences to ensure that the UZI could suit even the weariest of soldiers operating in the dark . With few parts , it was easy to strip and reassemble , and he housed the magazine in the pistol grip - an innovation that enabled soldiers to reload according to the simple ' fist finds fist ' principle . The UZI was selected due to its lower manufacturing cost , ease of use and greater reliability in battle conditions found in the Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industries ( IMI ) ; a name that has become synonymous with the UZI . <p> The UZI fires the 9mm Parabellum cartridge at a cyclic rate of 600 RPM . It fires from the open bolt position and employs a simple blow back mechanism . The gun makes extensive use of sheet metal stampings , making the construction simple , yet durable and extremely solid . An innovative part of the UZI design is its bolt , which wraps around the chamber end of the barrel . This overlap of 3 + " allows the weapon to have a relatively long 10.2 " barrel while still maintaining a short overall length . <p> In the United States , the only transferable full auto UZI carbines manufactured by IMI are the ones that were imported and registered as NFA weapons prior to the Gun Control Act of 1968 ( or during the amnesty period that was offered at that time . ) There are few of them around and they command a premium price . In 1980 , Action Arms started to import and distribute UZI 's in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fully automatic UZI was offered to law enforcement in 9mm originally , but a 45 . ACP version was added in 1985 along with a .22 LR conversion kit . For the civilian market , the semi automatic Model A was offered , followed later by the Model B which incorporated a few minor differences . With the scarcity of original UZI SMGs , it became common in the 1980s to convert Model A or B UZIs into full auto SMGs . There are many registered conversions available today , some being registered receivers , some being registered bolts , and a few being registered sears . Its important to know what you 're buying when you look at a full auto UZI because it was a common practice to restamp the receiver markings to look like an original UZI SMG . The easiest way to tell for sure is to look at who 's listed as the manufacturer on the guns NFA registry form . If the manufacturer is n't IMI , then its a conversion . <p> The semi automatic Model A and Model B sold in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BATF at the time to make it more difficult to convert to full automatic . The semi automatic guns also came with a 16.1 " barrel to meet federal regulations . In 1987 , Action Arms began shipping .45 ACP and .41 AE versions of the Model B , along with caliber conversion kits allowing conversions between the three calibers that the Model B then shipped in . Also in 1987 , Action Arms began shipping a semi automatic version of the Mini UZI . Due to the smaller size of the gun , it came with a 19.75 " barrel to meet the overall length requirement for a rifle . Due to the import ban on assault weapons , Action Arms was forced to discontinue importation of both the full sized carbine and the Mini carbine in 1989 . That left Action Arms with only one UZI to sell - the UZI Pistol , which is a semi automatic version of the Micro UZI . Action Arms sold the UZI pistol until 1993 , when federal laws prohibited their importation . <p> In the mid 80 's , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had originally made its reputation converting semi automatic UZI 's to select fire weapons , but in 1985-86 they manufactured and registered their own UZI receivers . Unfortunately Group Industries struggled through financial and legal problems for a number of years until they were finally ordered to liquidate their assets under chapter 7 in early 1995. 3318 UZI receivers were sold at auction and purchased by Vector Arms . It took years of work to find or build the parts necessary to assemble the receivers but on May 25 , 1999 , the first Vector UZI was shipped . Another UZI clone that made its way into the United States in the 1990 's is the Norinco UZI from China . One shipment of Norinco UZI 's just made it into the US in the mid 1990 's before they were banned .

I 'm hoping someone ' round here has been here before and can enlighten me . <p> 1 ) I just recently spoke with a guy who built an Uzi on a receiver shell ( group industries ) that he welded up , and the paraphrased summary of what he said was that getting the feed ramp welded in in such a way that feeding issues wo n't arise is about as much work as splitting an atom , and that the whole endeavor is n't worth trying . I look at the parts sitting in my receiver , here , and it does n't seem like there should be any issues . <p> The feed ramp does n't have any noteworthy degree of play in the receiver ( maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the barrel in the turnnion , in the receiver , it feels pretty much solid . It seems simple enough to weld in . Is it really typically such an issue as I was told ? <p> 2 ) How does one usually go about properly positioning the sight bases in the receiver ? The front sight base is what 's troubling me the most . <p> I thought the front sight base simply sat on top of the trunnion , but given the tilt visible with the top cover on , it looks like it 's meant to be placed some distance above it . Is it a matter of letting the back end of the base sit on the top cover , pinching the sight ears together to hold it in with friction , and kind of eyeballing it ' level ' ? This is all I can think of , but I was hoping that there 's a better way . <p> I have the back receiver scrap section with the rear base still in place , and I think after taking some measurements I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some shim stock to hold the rear sight base at the proper height , but is there something more of an established method for this ? <p> I 've found a few build chronicling threads that were helpful .

Apart from needing solid welds to keep the trunnion from being launched out , is there anything I should be aware of ?

@@77050659 @5750659/ <p> The UZI was born of the illegal arms industry of Palestine in the 1930s . A British protectorate at the time , arms manufacturing was illegal and confined to secret underground workshops . Early weapons were unique and not always safe . By the mid 1940s , the Israelis were building unlicensed copies of the Sten MK II . Shortage of materials meant that only the barrel ( built from old hunting rifles ) was actually made of steel . By 1950 , the Israeli military could no longer put up with their unreliable guns and put forward a requirement for a new gun . At the time , the Israelis were heavily involved in night time border raids , often times spearheaded by their paratroopers . To meet this need , they wanted an easy to carry submachine gun with a high rate of fire . <p> The Israeli Defense Force ( IDF ) found that there were two weapons in development that had the potential to meet their needs . The first was a somewhat traditional design by Major Chaim Kara , head of the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was the design of a young military man who seemed to have a genius for weapons design Uziel Gal . Both weapons continued to be refined until they were handed over to the army in 1951 for competitive trials . Twelve Karas and five UZIs were put to the test . <p> Both designs used a wrap around bolt design and were blow back operated . The Kara was a well made gun but its close tolerances made it difficult to manufacture and prone to jamming in the dusty Middle East . In contrast , the UZI was simple to mass produce and was well suited to dusty , gritty environments . The UZI had excellent human engineering . One of the best features of the UZI was that the magazine housing was built into the pistol grip . No matter how dark it was or how tired and frightened a soldier might be , the " fist finds fist " principle would allow the soldier to successfully change a magazine . Later Kara prototypes would adopt this feature . Having only a few parts , the UZI was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it a very safe weapon . With good accuracy and limited recoil and muzzle rise , its easy to see why the UZI won the competition . <p> From 1951 through 1955 , eighty preproduction models were issues to select military units . Feedback during that time lead to a few enhancements and in 1955 , the UZI as we know it today was put into service . The first true test of the weapon came a year later during the Suez War and it was the start of a long and successful career . One of the few modifications to the gun came in 1967 with a metal folding stock replacing the original fixed wooden stock . <p> The success of the UZI led to government contracts all over the world . In the late 1960 's , a large contract with West Germany brought many UZI 's into that country , ( where it was known as the MP2 ) many of which are still in use today . A contract was established in the 1960 's with Fabrique Nationale , and FN produced UZI 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1970 's , a contract with Lyttleton Engineering permitted UZI 's to be manufactured in South Africa . <p> In 1980 , demand for a more compact weapon lead to the Mini UZI . Used primarily by special forces , the Mini UZI saw a number of variations in its folding stock and forward pistol grip before arriving at the version we know today . Calls for an even smaller weapon lead to the Micro UZI in 1984 . <p> The UZI and its variants have seen service in over ninety countries . Its recognized around the world as one of the most successful submachine guns ever built . By the end of 2001 , IMI had sold over $2 billion dollars in UZI 's .

The stock lockup is rock solid and everywhere the fit is tight and uniform . If anyone is holding back DO get one .

Looking back , the entire process including buying the tube directly from Doug did n't take much time , and it looks and sounds like you got one of Don 's better builds . Even though it 's not factory correct , I really like the way he uses white paint to fill in the numbers and letters on the bolts and barrels . It looks good to my eye , and is a sure way to tell DGS built the gun . It 's a beautiful gun , and I thank you for the photos ! <p> I appreciate you sharing the photo of the virgin tube .

You 'll find that the trigger pack does n't get nearly as dirty as the other parts and requires less cleaning . I probably remove and clean mine about once for every half a dozen times I clean the bolt , barrel , and receiver . Even then , it 's seldom very dirty . I seem to have problems keeping the area around the muzzle clean , so you may want to pay closer attention to that area . <p> The Sterlings feel as compared to the two you mentioned is a vast improvement huh ?

@@77050679 @5750679/ <p> Let a new weapon , suitable for select fire conversion , hit the market and there seems to be an unseen race to see who can make it rock-n-roll first . When the new UZI Pistol became available a few months ago we could n't wait to head for the drawing board to lay out a possible design or two . <p> At first sight , this new pistol resembles the Mini-UZI submachine gun . However , a closer look will reveal that , which there is that UZI look , the pistol stands alone as a weapon unto itself . Being a pistol , there 's no folding stock , nor is there a provision for one . The right angle through the grip and magazine well makes for a low pointing characteristic which IMI tried to overcome with grips made extra large toward the heel of the hand . This pistol does n't look or feel like a pistol , so we decided to give it a more suitable existence as a submachine gun . <p> The trigger housing , with a few exceptions , is identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any conversion technique used on the carbine trigger housing would work here . The potential use of such devices as a " Kicker " ( see the article on converting the UZI carbine on page 60 ) has been defeated by IMI 's use of a stepped block which is welded in front of the housing . Of course , this step could be milled off to use The Kicker and it would still allow normal functioning with the original select lever . Unlike the carbine , the slot where the select lever projects outside the housing must be elongated 1/4 inch to the front . <p> Everything seemed relatively easy until we examined the receiver and bolt . This brought into sharp focus the fact that any semi-automatic weapon which existed first in a select fire version is usually easier to convert to that configuration than a weapon which was born a semi-auto . The UZI carbine is a good example . Due to the length of the receiver , bolt stroke , and position of the sear , all that 's needed is a properly made , open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the same techniques were tried with the pistol , the bolt position , when cocked , was just behind the top round in the magazine . The results : not enough energy to strip , chamber and detonate the round . Back to the drawing board . <p> The next step was to examine closed bolt firing . A secondary sear was designed . The only place in the trigger housing to put it was occupied by the grip safety . Since the practicality of the UZI 's grip safety has always been subject to question , we felt no remorse in removing it . The secondary sear assembly is attached to the housing by a screw-clamp arrangement . A flat spring was fashioned in such a manner as to both activate the secondary sear and also retain the sear and trigger pins that had previously been retained by the grip safety . <p> The new sear assembly has a trip lever that senses when the bolt is nearly in battery by following a new camming surface ground on the bottom rail of the bolt . The secondary sear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface that has been welded on the rail of the striker . Anyone who tries to follow us in this conversion is advised to allow for a little " fine tuning " of this entire setup . <p> The selector functions the same as on the " grown up " UZI submachine guns . Semi-auto and " safe " function normally . Forget any accurate full auto fire while shooting the Micro UZI as a machine pistol . The cyclic rate ( 1200 rpm ) and the capital T geometry necessitate the addition of a stock for anything even approaching accurate fire . <p> An examination of the Choate MAC 10 SAP folder from Quartermaster Sales revealed that it could be adapted . We used a method of attaching it that is similar to the one IMI uses to attach the UZI carbine stock . An adaptor block was machined to mount the Choate stock in the proper configuration . When extended , it can be fired from the shoulder or clamped under the arm . Folded , it makes a convenient front hand hold . The only problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the muzzle . To overcome this , a muzzle extender was attached to the barrel with two set screws . <p> The finished product is pictured in this article and the complete conversion book ( No . FP-9 ) , Micro UZI Machine Pistol , is available from Firepower Publications . This is not an easy conversion and unless you are a skilled machinist with proper tools , my advice is not to attempt it . If you " farm out " the machining you 'll spend a fortune . Now , I 'll admit that this sounds like a contradiction - we write a book about it , then tantalize you with this article , only to finish by telling you not to do it ! Not exactly - we just want you to be fully aware of the difficulty of the conversion and not to blame us if you botch up a $600 pistol ! <p> Originally published in the September , 1984 issue of Firepower Magazine .

The thoroughness of this list is a direct result of all its contributors . <p> AR model rifles : generally have plastic handguards , no bipod , and no carrying handle . MR rifles generally have bayonet lugs and AA rifles generally do not . ARM model rifles : generally have wooden handguards , a bipod , and a carrying handle .

There appears to be transitional variants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles during the MR/AA change over period . The Model 331 , 332 , &amp; 361 rifles as imported by AA hold true for the descriptions listed under their MR brethren . The only difference is they contained milled out ; areas on the receiver where the MR importation marks and serial # prefixes have been removed and the AA data added . <p> Some Model 372 ARM rifles have been reported with more noticeable differences . They appear to be an AR/ARM combination . Their features are as follows : Model 372 , 5.56mm , 18 " bbl. , 1-12 " rifling twist , black plastic handguard , bayonet lug , bipod attachment point w/o bipod , Galil style flash suppressor , and no carrying handle . Additionally , they have a shallow " milled out area " on the left side of the receiver where the MR importation marks and serial #prefixes have been removed and the AA data added . It appears these rifles were originally MR rifles , but were " redone " to have AA markings . The Serial #s are in the AAL3xxx range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the " left " side of the rifle . <p> It appears that all AA ( except for transitional models ) &amp; all GS Serial #s are located above the scope mounting " notch " . All Magnum Research rifles are Pre-89 . Most appear to be Kalifornia legal , but there is at least one documented MR rifle which is stamped Galil . Some Action Arms rifles are Pre-89 and some are Post-89 . All Springfield Armory rifles are Post-89 . ( CDNN was a known vendor . ) Springfield imported less than 1000 Galil rifles between 7-25-91 and 7-31-92 . <p> The difference between Pre &amp; Post rifles is as follows : Post-89 rifles have the letter " S " stamped ( sometimes crudely ) AFTER the model number . On some rifles the letter " S " was added after the rifle was imported and on other rifles the " S " was added when the rifle was manufactured . This is not to be confused with " S. Auto Galil " stamped onto the receiver . Post ' 89 rifles have thumbhole stocks , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no flash suppressors . <p> Some Galil rifles ( appear to be only Magnum Research imports ) do not have the word " Galil " stamped onto the receiver and these rifles are called " Kalifornia Legal " and bring a premium price . Early MR imported rifles did not come with Tritium night sights or spring loaded firing pins . Owners could send in their bolts for firing pin spring refit and request their night sights . It is believed that the U.S. Government was in the process of approving tritium for importation at that time . <p> Serial #s appear to start low in MR rifles and reach almost 7000 . The reported low MR # is 005xx and the reported high MR # is 69xx . There have been no rifles reported in the MR5xxx range . Serial #s appear to be in prefixes : 2077xxx , 208xxxx , 209xxxx &amp; 210xxxx for AA rifles . Serial #s appear to be in prefixes : 2099xxx &amp; 2100xxx for GS rifles . <p> The first 100 MR imported Galils arrived with commemorative paperwork signifying their special status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anniversary commemorative sticker attached to the box of " appropriate " AA import rifles . Plastic handguards are now available for ARM style rifles . There are several types of IMI scope mounts . The original ( best &amp; expensive ) utilizes a lever and attaches onto the scope mounting " groove " on the left side of the rifle . This scope mount comes in three variants . One variant is designed for STANAG scopes , another variant is designed for a 1 " tube scope , and the final variant is designed for a " channel " for ACOGs or M-16 style scopes . The cheaper scope mount also attaches onto the scope mounting " groove " and is tightened with a " wheel " or " screw " . There is also a scope mount designed for AN-PVS/2 night vision devices . Additionally , GG&amp;G manufactures and sells a Galil scope mount . <p> Both plastic " Orlite " and steel magazines are available for the 5.56mm rifles . Steel magazines are available in 12 , 35 , and 50 round capacities . Orlite magazines are available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 round steel magazine and a plastic 35 round magazine . There are two types of M-16 magazine adapters designed for the 5.56mm rifles . One type was designed by/for MR and the other by/for AA . As far as can be determined , the only difference is that the MR version has a " safety catch " to prevent accidentally discharging the adapter while changing magazines . There are 20 and 25 round 7.62mm steel magazines available . The 25 round magazines appear to be originally designed for the Galil by IMI . The 20 round magazines appear to be modified M-14 magazines . Valmet ejection port buffers will not fit Galil rifles . There is a IMI Blank Firing Adapter that was available for the 5.56mm rifles . <p> Many serious students of firearms consider the Galil to be the " ultimate " AK rifle . Galils are manufactured from/with a " milled " receiver as opposed to a " stamped " receiver for most Valmets and AK series weapons . Milled receivers are heavier , stronger , and much more expensive to manufacture than stamped receivers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stamped receiver guns and the weight and cost of the milled steel . Perhaps , one should examine the pros and cons of each and arrive at their own conclusions . A Valmet rifle is an excellent rifle if someone did not want to incur the weight &amp; expense of the Galil . <p> It appears there were approximately 7,000 - 9,000 Semi-Automatic Galil rifles imported ( total ) .

@@77050691 @5750691/ <p> Uzi Gal loved guns and the way they were designed . His interest did not end with the UZI machine gun , nor did it end when he retired from Israel Military Industries . Not long after moving to the United States in 1976 , Uzi Gal became part of the American gun culture . His work with Action Arms on the design of a semi automatic UZI for the US market was only one of many avenues of gun design work he pursued . By 1979 , he had obtained an FFL and SOT , and for a ten year period from the mid 1980 's to the mid 1990 's , he actively purchased many semi automatic pistols to study their design . This was a period of time when many new semi automatic pistols were being released and Uzi was fascinated by them . Uzi engaged the gun culture at all levels . He purchased many guns from local gun shops and frequented a local gun range only 10 minutes from his house . But his worldwide status also allowed him to engage the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for for Sturm Ruger on what eventually became the MP-9 machine gun . He did design work with Reed Knight . He was a technical resource for the US Secret Service . Uzi Gal was connected to the US gun market . <p> The majority of the guns Uzi purchased were 9mm . It might be that Uzi favored that caliber , or it might be that it was easier for him to stick with a small number of calibers for his testing and evaluation . Most of the guns that he bought were never sold . They were part of his research into things he was keenly interested in . When Uzi died , his son Iddo handled the estate . Iddo lived in Israel and could not take the guns back with him , so he contacted two of Uzi 's friends . They were both FFL holders and between them they purchased all the guns from Uzi 's estate . Iddo Gal provided a specific document with each one of the guns identifying them as being from Uzi Gal 's estate . If you ever run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's estate , you should expect it to be documented . Uzi was also very organized and kept track of all packaging he received with his guns . Just about all of the guns from his estate were in their original box . Some of them even had the original invoice . <p> As an FFL holder himself , Uzi was required to keep a bound book of acquisitions and depositions . Those records provide some insight into what things interested him and some of the activities he was involved with . Here 's a look at his gun collection . Some of the guns listed below have links to photographs . The photographs are of the actual guns that Uzi Gal owned and are all documented as such . <p> The first gun Uzi bought with his FFL .

Uzi saw one of the 9mm 's at a trade show when they came out and had to have one . Uzi modified the collapsible stock .

@@77050692 @5750692/ <p> The Mini UZI was introduced in 1980 . Like often happens with Israeli made hardware , the weapon was first sold only to the Israeli Special Forces ( SF ) . A few years later after gaining a considerable combat proven reputation , it was offered globally . <p> The primary concept behind the Mini UZI was to shift the best characteristics of the standard UZI to a more compact frame , thus enhancing ease of use in tight Close Quarters Combat ( CQB ) situations as well as enable more concealment options . Accordingly , the Mini UZI retains all the positive features of its bigger brother as well several new modifications of its own : <p> +The most important change is the weapon 's smaller size . With the stock extended the Mini UZI is only 60 cm in length compared to the 65 cm of the standard UZI . However , in the folded stock position the difference is even more noticeable - only 36 cm ( 14.4 " ) for the Mini UZI compared to the 47 cm ( 17.9 " ) of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much easier task . <p> Replacement of the standard UZI heavy folding stock , which took a relatively long time to be extended , with a modern light weight wire folding stock . The stock is attached via an excellent hinge that eliminates wobble when the stock is extended . <p> Newly designed adjustable rear and front sights . ( The same sight was also offered on the semi automatic Model B. ) <p> Closed bolt operated in addition to the standard open bolt operation found in the UZI carbine . <p> An all new muzzle break with two compensating vents slots cut on the top of muzzle , assisting in the control of the weapon during full auto firing mode . <p> Those who have an UZI carbine say will tell you that the 600 RPM cyclic rate is a dream and does not require manipulation of the selector switch to get single shots . The Mini UZI is quite a different story . The advertised cycle rate is 900 RPM but that 's clearly a conservative number . Actual measurements will typically yield something closer to 1200 RPM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclic rate this high and the operator must make appropriate use of the selector switch . <p> Trunnions <p> The trunnion on an UZI is a block of steel welded to the inside of the receiver and is meant to hold the barrel firmly in place . The barrel is not threaded , welded or press fit into the trunion . Instead , one or two raised bands on the barrel match the inside diameter of the trunion hole , keeping the barrel in place . <p> The trunnion on the Mini UZI is essentially the same as the trunnion on the full size UZI with two exceptions . First , the Mini UZI trunnion is " skeletonized " to reduce weight . Second , the Mini UZI trunion has two notches milled out to allow the bolt feet be inserted beyond the face of the trunnion . Bolt feet are only used on the open bolt configuration . When in the cocked position , the feet allow the smaller Mini UZI bolt to be held fully to the rear of the magazine . Without the feet , the Mini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , causing feeding problems . Milling out the notches in the trunnion is considered to be manufacturing a machine gun . It could be done before 1986 when creating a registered receiver conversion . Since 1986 , it can only be done by class II manufactures on dealer sample guns . If a registered receiver gun has notches milled in the trunnion , it can use a standard Mini UZI full auto open bolt . If the trunnion is not milled out ( such as using a semi auto receiver to host a registered bolt ) , the bolt feet will strike the trunnion and the bolt will not close all the way . In that case the feet need to be ground down so they are n't as wide . There 's enough room on the side of the trunnion for the narrow feet to slide by . The other alternative would be to cut off the feet , however this leads to feeding problems and is strongly discouraged . In either case , modifying the bolt feet can only be done to a registered bolt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight . This IMI semi auto trunnion does not need to be milled out because it 's made to run with a closed bolt . <p> The trunnion on a full auto IMI Mini UZI has a notch milled out on each side of the trunnion . That allows the feet on an open bolt to rest along side the trunnion . Without these notches , the bolt would not close all the way . <p> The Vector Mini UZI is actually a cut down full size UZI and it has a trunnion from a full sized UZI , which is not skeletonized . The Vector trunnion has two notches milled out just like the full auto IMI . <p> Design Evolution <p> The first Mini UZIs that IMI manufactured were made from full sized UZI SMG receivers that were cut down to Mini UZI size . The photo above comes from a late 1981 IMI brochure , showing one of the early Mini UZIs as they were originally issued to the IDF . There are several differences in this early version : <p> - The rear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second machine screw . - Dual ribs on the side of the receiver that extend all the way to the rear . - The front and rear sight ears have holes in them . - It still uses the original SMG sights . ( Model A sights. ) - No front sling stud. - The swivel end and butt end of the stock were different . - The wire stock ran parallel to the receiver instead of having drop to it . <p> In 1983 , Action Arms release a Law Enforcement brochure showing the new IMI Mini UZI . The Mini used on the cover of the brochure showed most of the same features as the original IDF guns , except that the sight ears no longer had holes in them and the front slig stud was in place . It was still built off of a cut down receiver and had the early style stock . <p> Inside the same brochure however , the gun pictured was more like the final Mini UZI . It had a real Mini UZI receiver with the shorter receiver ribs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the stock were now like the final stock , however the stock was still parallel to the gun . Solid sight ears were used and the front slig stud was in place , but SMG sights were still used . <p> The April , 1984 issue of Combat Handguns had an article on the new IMI Mini Uzi . The gun on the cover was probably a stock photo that IMI provided to the magazine and it shows most of the early features - the cut down receiver with long ribs and single screw in the foregrip , all early features on the stock , and SMG sights . This was not the gun that was actually used for the tests in the article . <p> The gun that was actually tested for the article had all the later features of the final IMI Mini UZI : shorter side ribs , dual foregrip screws , " Model B " sights , front sling stud , and a wire stock that had a significant drop to it instead of running parallel to the gun . The gun tested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ohio . Neal had just received the new Mini UZI and assuming that the article was photographed some time before the April , 1984 magazine date , it would seem that the Mini UZI first became available in the United States in late 1983 . It looks like all IMI Mini UZI 's shipped to the US had all of the final features from the very start . <p> By 1985 , Action Arms offered three versions of the Mini Uzi : the standard open bolt version , a closed bolt version and a heavy bolt version . Looking for sales in the US civilian market , they began offering a semi automatic version of the Mini UZI in 1987 . It fired from a closed bolt and came with a 19.34 " barrel to meet federal regulations on the overall length of a rifle . Importation of the semi automatic Mini UZI was discontinued in 1989 due to federal regulations .

The South Africans redesigned the Galil ARM a little and renamed it the R4 . They chose to eliminate the carry handle . The ARM rear hand guard retainer has a couple of rings where the handle and pin attach . You also have an original top cover with the serial numbers in large font . The larger fonts on top covers ( serial # ) and bolt carriers supposedly are of SA origin ( We may never really know the codes on these parts ) .

Historically with Galil receivers the very few companies that have attempted to make these receivers have not fared well . Issues with Rockwell hardness , out of spec holes and bolt cut-outs have plagued most makers . CNCW has been the only maker out there without issues .

Take down like so : <p> 1 . Holding the spring tension on the central rotor , remove the screw that holds the follower ( lil L-shaped thing in the ammo track ) and remove the follower . Then gently let the spring in the central rotor unwind . COUNT how many revolutions it takes to fully unwind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unscrew the cental plug in the front of the drum .

@@77050699 @5750699/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> likely cause of out of battery detonation ? <p> A while back had an out of battery detonation on an fnc . The rifle had been very reliable , is a semi-auto version . When it occurred , there were only a couple rounds left in the mag ( to obama , a clip ) . The floor plate blew out and the bolt carrier jammed . <p> I had to pound the bolt carrier out with a hammer and brass rod . The cam on the bolt carrier which the bolt twists in was badly bent . I heated the part and bent it back to it 's normal shape . It now has some very small cracks , which I will vee out and tig weld up . I have some tig rod that is very unique and used to weld up receivers , etc . <p> I understand parts are very rare , hopefully I should be able to repair the bolt carrier . I have a machine shop , welding equipment , etc . <p> I know you will say this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rare rifle ? I do n't think it was because of a reload , but do n't know what caused the mishap . I think a round did n't extract and the bolt picked up a new round , tried to chamber it , and it went off . It 's also possible the round in the chamber had n't been fired , and the new round set it off . I was able to save a very crunched up piece of brass . <p> What kind of primers do you use in your reloads ? My " best guess " based on your statements above is that the firing pin struck the primer before round was fully chambered . Most likely there was some type of obstruction in the chamber when the round was feeding ( brass form a broken case rim or the like ) . Since the FNC using a floating firing pin , it is possible for the momentum of the pin to cause a weak primer strike . If the primers are the sensitive type , the round can go off . This why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They basically just have a thicker primer cup to help avoid issues like this . Benchrest type primers , for example , tend to be some of the most sensitive . Example LONG ... <p> The firing pin spring is there to mitigate this as an issue , but if it has gotten weak , who knows ? <p> Of course , this is just a guess . <p> If you had a chambered live round that did n't go off and filed to extract , I hope it would be noticed before the next round attempted to get chambered . <p> Could have been because of some small object in the chamber , even a piece of grass . I had a similar problem with an AR , rifle suddenly would not chamber my reloads . Thinking that I sized them wrong I stuck a factory load in there , and had the same result you had . Did not slam fire , happened when I pulled the trigger . Bolt was a beech getting open , but when it was all over the only thing I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round Colt magazine though . <p> As for primers , if you used winchester primers , you have your cause . Many many people , including some of the best highpower shooters ( and these people know primers and components ) , are advising people NOT to use them in semi-auto rifles , and then the jerks claim " I have used X 1000 rounds loaded with winchester primers and never had a problem " . You only need one ... <h> likely cause of out of battery detonation <p> The primer is CCI . When the incident occurred , I did n't know what happened at first , but when the floor plate of the magazine blew out , really caught my attention . I collected the parts , including one piece of brass . Ever heard the joke , what was the last thing that went through a fly 's mind before he hit the windshield ? His *sshole . In this case , that 's what the piece of brass looks like , it is all crumbled , the bullet is n't there , but looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all crumbled up . The indentation on the primer looks like a normal primer strike . If there was a round in the chamber , I never found it . <p> So far , I 've returned the bolt carrier to it 's normal shape , some cracks developed . I veed them out with a small cutoff wheel . I welded the groves up with TIG , using 8620 rod . I noticed that the part moved a little from the heat , I 'll have to re-heat it , bend it back slightly , and then quench the part . I will then grind the welds down , and hopefully the bolt carrier will be back to it 's normal shape . Then it goes back together . <p> From looking at the link to CCI , I see that CCI makes a #41 primer for " NATO sensitivity " used on military semi-autos . I 've been using CCI 400 's . Does anybody know how typical off the shelf factory ammo is in reference to the primer sensitivity ? Given the problem getting primers today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> BTW , If I ever had a manual on the FNC , I ca n't find it , anybody know where I can find a scanned in one or a pdf ? <p> Regular CCI is fine for semi-autos . I highly suspect something was stuck in the chamber , piece of brass maybe , and it allowed the bolt to close , but not fully . Did this happen when you pulled the trigger , or was it a slamfire ?

Are there any other SOTs I should check with ? <p> SIA stated that it seems doable overall , with some issues about how much to port ( if I want standard info to drop to subsonic ) , where the porting can be done in order to still cycle semiautomatically , and similar concerns . <p> I know another serviceman in a similar situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders would decrease the unit price . Accordingly : <p> 1 ) Does anyone have any input on how awesome an idea this is ? <p> 2 ) Any other shops I should contact for a quote ? <p> 3 ) Does it seem feasible to port sufficiently to drop sub-sonic but still retain semi-auto functioning ? <p> 4 ) If we can drop the unit price a bit with multiple orders , anyone else interested in getting in ? Any other board where I should check for further interest ? <p> Thanks for any info . I 'm thinking this could be a pretty cool splurge , and not a terrible price for such a novel rifle .

It is a great gun and so much fun . It is the fastest shooting gun I have that actually hits where I am aiming ( my stock Mac 's do n't do as well especially in 45 ) . <p> I never thought I 'd be leaving my full size uzi home everytime I go shooting but that is starting to become the case . The last 6 trips to the range I grabbed 4 or 5 full auto guns and the Uzi just is n't near the fun as the Mini-Uzi and my MP5 's and tons of fun also changing the H&amp;k sear around and making 10 machine guns . <p> Is it a phase or should I consider unloading it ? I should probably wait a year and see if it comes back around . I ran into my high school girlfriend the other month and wondered why the hell I dumped her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the full size Uzi . <p> Hate to say it but no comparison - I 've now got the Vector Mini F/A and would not go back to the full size - heck I honestly like shooting it more than my M16A1 RR .

That said , sounds like you 've got what my father called " 1st world problems " ... Enjoy them all <p> I 'm going to give it 6 months and see how much use I get out of it . I agree with the full size being a much better introduction to full auto but I have a M16 with 22LR suppressed upper and an MP5SD which are the perfect into to F/A . I do n't let anyone play with my Mini Uzi or Mac 10 's unless they have mastered the MP5SD which is a pussy cat . <p> I 'd love to try out a micro too but they are tough to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a novelty . <p> hey Z06 , great looking guns . it looks like you , like the ( Uzi Low-Profile Charging handle ) i was thinking about getting one , but thought they may pull to one side . they look good . how well do they work ... ? <p> After reading this thread I want a mini more &amp; more . My FS Uzi is reliably accurate and can tend to get a bit boring . Maybe the slower ROF compared to my reg sear K gun . Now that is more fun but I do get tighter groups w the Uzi for sure . I wish mini 's were n't in the 14k plus range these days . Lol <p> I have all the mp5 varieties and the mini uzi still makes it to the range most days I go .

I highly recommend the mini . <p> I 'm pretty sure that 's how vector made the registered receiver mini uzi 's ... by chopping up full size models . I do n't know if they offer that on a one at a time basis . I think they would make a killing if they did and half the full size models would be getting chopped up . I 'm not sure on the legality of it . I asked them about chopping down my full size registered bolt into a mini config and vector said ... " You can not convert that bolt it will not work ... Your better off leaving it as it is. "

Thanks BOOM <p> You Can not use the FA bolt in any form in a Semi receiver this would require modifying the bolt thus creating a Unregistered machine gun a very big NO NO . You can use the FA Hebrew marked trigger Housing IF you add a blocking bar in it to keep it from going to the Auto selection all the way forward . there is no way to legally put a FA bolt in a semi so do n't screw with it you 'll make headlines if you do . search the Library on this sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing that keeps the selector from going to the auto position . you 'll also will need to enlarge the pin hole in the housing to fit a semi receiver . there is a lot of differences between Full and semi best thing is search thru the Library .

I just thought that there might be a way to use it for a build . not a big deal . <p> I for sure do n't want to break any rules or regulations with our government . so there for if what you say is true . then I will just sell it to someone that could use it on their Legal gun <p> That proably would be the best option and use the money made to buy a semi parts kit .

But in this case , I think anybody planning on using *any* parts that were originally designed for automatic fire should think long and hard about how advisable that is . One federal circuit court ( the 6th ) has held that six hours to make an M-14 go rock ' n roll means it is readily restorable . The link is below . That decision cites an 8th circuit case where that particular panel held that needing 8 hours AND A WORKING MACHINE SHOP *still* adds up to " readily restorable .

Gents , the stakes are just too high . Sorry to be the bearer of bad news , but know what you 're up against . <p> The bolts are very , very hard . I have , however , heard of a person that annealed a FA bolt , machined the lower lip off the bolt face , drilled and machined the bolt to be a closed bolt with the seperate striker assembly , and then slotted the bolt . At the end , they re-hardend the bolt . <p> Like I said , I heard someone did it ... but I have no first hand knowledge of it being done . If it happened , and it is true , I do n't think any laws would be broken , as long as the last part of the conversion was the slotting of the bolt . If it happened , it seems to be a lot of work to produce a semi bolt , when you could just buy one .

@@77050715 @5750715/ <p> The UZI was not designed for optical sights and the construction of the receiver does not lend itself well to any sort of optic mounts . The two primary problems are the bolt retracting knob and the top cover . The bolt retracting knob sits on top of the receiver and its range of motion takes a lot of room , plus it sticks up quite a ways . Additionally , the UZI top cover does not provide a very firm platform for mounting optics . Despite these problems , various mounts have been designed for the UZI . Action Arms sold mounts for both the full size UZI carbine and the UZI Pistol while they were in business , and a number of aftermarket mounts have been made as well . <p> If you put any kind of optics on an UZI it tends to make the cocking knob a bit awkward to operate .

All 13 that I own came from a dealer/gunsmith in my hometown who bought them in late 1970 or early 1971 as part of an order of three S&amp;W 76 subguns and 30-some magazines , one for himself and two for eventual sale . For years I used to " hang out " at this dealer/gunsmith 's shop in his basement , and was his extra pair of hands , gunshow table-sitter , and shop cleaning person , getting paid in boxes of 22LR ammo . He bought the three S&amp;W 76s and the mags when I was a junior in HS . I got to fire his 76 a few times , the last being shortly before I left for Parris Island in August of 1972 . <p> The dealer passed away in 1978 , and I attended the estate sale and among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot " carton of M14 , M1911 , and M1 Carbine magazines and other items . Nobody bid on the box , and the opening bid was $20 and I bid that and won . I was interested in the M1 Carbine and M1911 magazines but held onto the M14 and S&amp;W 76 mags " just in case . " <p> Since the gunsmith/dealer bought the 13 mags from S&amp;W , and the mag bodies are IDENTICAL with only the floorplates being different , I am 100% confident that regardless of the difference in floorplates , all 13 mags are the " real deal . " <p> Last year I purchased 10 more S&amp;W 76 mags with the long tab floorplate , and they are identical to the " long tab " mags that I got from the deceased dealer 's estate sale . <p> If the " long tab " S&amp;W 76 mags are fakes , somebody went to A LOT of trouble back in the early 70s to exactly counterfeit everything but the floorplates . As an MG dealer told me a few years ago , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on subsequent mag orders so that the longer tab could be used as a disassembly tool ( screwdriver ) in removing the handgrip screw . <p> William of Occam stated in so many words that " the simplest explanation is most often the correct one , " ( Occam 's Razor ) . Given the provenance of my 13 S&amp;W 76 magazines that were all purchased by the same dealer in the early 70s , and that S&amp;W likely changed the floorplate design at some point , and that all 13 of my S&amp;W 76 mags run without fault 100% of the time , I can only conclude that they are genuine . <p> Yesterday I took pictures of our NIB SW76 . It is unfired and this was probably the third or fourth time it 's been unwrapped from its protective paper . <p> We have three SW76s at the department ... we received then in September of 1969 ... they came straight from SW . <p> The little white box below the 76 .. today was the first day that box was opened .. the tape on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brand new magazine ... unwrapping it shows that the magazine is a " short tab " . This should support the theory that the short tabs came first and the long tabs are a product improvement . <p> The first mags had the short tabs and could be inserted into the gun upside down and actually lock in place . Not the thing you want to be able to do . Imagine during a midnight skirmish you load a mag by feel and in the heat of battle you get it into place ( but it is upside down ! ) . Oh oh ... <p> So they added the long tab so that would not happen , mag now will not go in upside down when it has the long tab . <p> My 76 came to me with two mags that were claimed to be factory mags , but I had my doubts about one . I felt OK about one since although it was like new , it still looked to be about the right age ; and it was marked like every other S&amp;W 76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder . It was a little different . It also had some scuffing and dinging on the floorplate like it had skidded across something pretty abrasive ( rocks ? ) , so I wondered if that was real-world damage or an attempt to hide something in the past . But the differences match what is in this thread , so I 'm now pretty sure it 's genuine , but just got used as a monopod on some unforgiving surface . <p> There is a gentleman that makes an excellent reproduction copy of the manual on Sturm .

I applogize for the not so stellar pictures but I do n't have a dedicated picture table setup like some guys and ca n't take it outside due to not wanting to scare the neighbors . <p> This shotgun originally started as a model 109 with threaded muzzle . Before I had even fired the gun I went and partially converted it ( 922r but not NFA ) , I moved the fcg forward and used the tapco g2 trigger setup . I ordered the tromix trigger guard and weld on back plate . I had buddy of mine tig the rear stock plate on and also close up any extra non needed holes , I hand filed it till it was what I wanted ( use to work in an autobody shop for two years thru college so I 've learned a few things ) , I also threw on there the tapco saw grip and a gunfixr plug on the front along with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while back . The rear stock was the machined aluminum stock that MAA was selling and only recently since I received my sbs back did I install the pushbutton folding block that I bought from CSS as I had not seen that style block produced for a year or two since ACE Ltd had ceased production . <p> So as time went by I had the itch to short barrel it and I had looked into a tromix conversion but the wait period on it was what detered me from going to them so I went to the next one that everyone was recommending , will from RJF . So after debating between 8.5 or 10 " barrel conversion will told me that he would make sure the 8.5 would run perfect and that the package I chose was pretty much the full package of what could be done to it for what I needed . <p> It should be noted that the galil style charging handle has not been done to it yet due to me asking for it to be rushed thru to try to get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain YouTube personality that we all love and adore here in the gun community , so asking for a rush job , with a week timeline , a week before Christmas , it is my fault and not theirs . <p> Me working in the gun industry heavily , and being slightly OCD when it comes to fit and finish of any guns that come thru my hands also while having probably bought , sold , traded over 300 guns in my personal collection over the years . I can say that they have taken the time and made sure everything was done correctly before it left the shop . RJF even had to delay a day for shipping my gun because they did n't like how the paint job came out and redid it . <p> Upon picking up the gun it feels neutral in it 's balance of muzzle vs buttstock weight .

I think I can safely say that the MOJO Brake is what the tromix brake should of been . That they took the design and elaborated on it even further . RJF also did a nice subtle job of branding their items with their logo , big enough to see but not an annoyance to the eye , as you can see on the muzzle brake and on the bottom of my receiver and when I get it back the vertical charging handle . <p> The Chaos rail system that they have for this gun is apparently only avail thru RJF for these builds .

There is barely any lateral movement and only vertical movement , with just enough tension at the joint to allow the top cover to stay in place when lifted up ( IE the m'fr does n't flop around when opened ) . The rail seems to be a clamp together design and is held to the rifle in a few places . As far as moment on the rail for trying to rotational twist it I would say maybe a 1/8 inch as this is an ak platform and there is not a barrel nut design like the ar15 .

They shortened the barrel and rethreaded the end and even did the correct shoulder on the front of the barrel ( instead of just a chop and thread that you might do in your garage ) inside my barrel they did the diamond pattern of gas ports as it properly should be . Mentioned before they did work over/smooth the fcg that I had in there along with smoothing the bolt on the gun ( assuming needing to make a smoother transition due to the shorter gas system and having it operate smoothly with no hangups ) , I also did the slow bolt release from back to front and did not feel any spots that the bolt would hangup on while cycling . <p> I have shot the gun a few times and it 's a fun gun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks I 'm going to let a Corpsman friend of mine borrow it and put it thru the paces while he trains before he has to leave the country for a short term assignment .

@@77050721 @5750721/ <p> Born In The USA proved to be a very popular , and even patriotic song for trendy heartthrob and singer Bruce Springsteen , but the subject of this article was not born in the USA . It was born in Israel , and has become one of the most frequently encountered submachine guns in the world today . The object if our examination , however , is not made in Israel , but Louisville , Kentucky , to be exact . While it evokes a strong spirit , it is n't bourbon either , but an American made version of the UZI submachine gun . <p> The first question everyone seems to be asking is : " How can these guys be making machine guns when the McClure-Volkmer law outlawed them for civilians ? " I have had people who have seen ads for the weapons ask me if these fellows figured out some way to get around the law ? Is there an exemption , or are these guys just ignoring the law ? Before we get into the details of the guns themselves , these questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automatic Weaponry in Brentwood , Tennessee , and the man responsible for marketing these weapons because Automatic Weaponry has the exclusive rights to marketing them . No one else can sell them , not even the manufacturer . Roger Small has been marketing full-auto weapons to police and qualified individuals for over ten years and is today the largest distributor of Auto Ordnance Thompsons in the United States . He revealed that this project has been ongoing since before 1981 . And no ! They are not violating the law in any way to my knowledge . They registered and documented a few thousand of the weapons prior to May 19 , 1986 . These are the weapons they are marketing today . <p> O.K. , then you ask , if Roger Small is marketing the guns , who is making them ? If you were at all familiar with converting the Action Arms ' semi-auto UZI Carbine into a full-auto submachine gun prior to May 19 , 1986 , you are aware of a little firm in Louisville , Kentucky , named Group Industries . Group Industries UZI bolts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts , to those filing Form Ones prior to the infamous May 19 Deadline . Mike Brown and his firm , Group Industries , is the firm manufacturing the American version of the UZI and I cant think of a firm more experienced with the UZI and all of its parts ( with the possible exception of Action Arms ) , in the United States today . <p> Mike told me his original intention ( several years ago was to build the UZI and not just the bolts , but the entire weapon and interest in converting the semi-autos , using Group Industries bolts , grew so quickly he was delayed in building the complete gun . As luck would have it , in January of 1986 everything came together and he was ready to start building the complete gun . Then on April 10 , 1986 , Representative Hughes from New Jersey attached his antimachine gun amendment to the McClure-Volkmer bill . Roger Small said they worked day and night constantly until President Ronald Reagan signed the law into effect on May 19 , 1986 . <p> Their greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadline . <p> " It was important to us to have as many of the parts as necessary to build a functioning submachine gun because we were unsure what BATF would allow . " They worked seven days a week , with as little as two hours sleep a night , just so they could make as many weapons as possible . Roger said that by May 19 , 1986 , they had the essential parts that would be necessary to complete every frame they had titled . But , you ask if they had all the parts by May 1986 , why did it take them so long before they started selling them ? Roger said in plain language - they were tired ! Also , they wanted to make sure the parts fit correctly and the weapons would be a quality product when they marketed them in their final form . They lacked the grip moulds and the front sight assemblies , but they could manage a functioning submachine gun from the parts they had before May 19 , 1986 . <p> The next question in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct copy of the UZI design ? Simple , the patent rights for the full-auto UZI may never have been filed or granted and if they did they now have expired . Even the name " UZI " is in dispute as to its generic classification , because Israel Military Industries applied for trademark protection for the name UZI , but Uzi Gal and his company UZI R&amp;D Associates challenged this application in court and they are arguing that the trade name UZI be declared generic . The outcome of this case is unknown , but it is known that IMI has done a poor job of protecting the use of the trade name UZI , up to this point , because the name UZI has been used on everything from water pistols to luggage . <p> How good are the guns ? As near as I can tell , the specimens I have seen are exact duplicates of the original UZI in dimension , balance and handling . Automatic Weaponry is marketing them in three calibers ; 9mm Parabellum , .22 Long Rifle and .45 ACP , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BATF in all three calibers . I have seen the forms and the designation reads " 9mm/.45ACP/.22 . " If the antigunners keep up their successful attacks on machine gunners this may prove to be a very important aspect of full-auto ownership . <p> Now for the true confessions , as I have not actually fired one of these weapons . I have seen them and handled them on two occasions . The first was a very large gun show in the Midwest , and the second was the prearranged appointment during the spring shoot of the Knob Creek Machine Gun Shoot . It was done in this manner to lessen the time necessary to get this article printed . A gun could have been transferred for a test and evaluation examination , but valuable time would have been lost waiting on the paper work to clear Washington . I met Roger Small at Knob Creek where these photos were taken and he shot the weapon for my examination . Why did n't I shoot the gun ? Because I was too busy photographing the UZI and all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why . <p> Do I think I missed anything by not firing these weapons ? Plain answer - NO ! Roger fired several magazines as I photographed him and the gun . One embarrassing moment occurred as we were forward of the line during an intermission to shoot a possible cover shot . The gun hiccupped once in front of 2000 spectators as I was shooting my Nikon . Roger was red faced , but I have shot enough machine guns to know the existence of Murphy 's Law . Whatever can go wrong will when the most people are watching . <p> Talking to Mike Brown revealed the receivers of the guns are made with 10-20 commercial grade cold rolled steel , while the bolt , the disconnector , the sear and just about all of the pins are made from 4140 steel . All of the low carbon steel is heat-treated to a surface hardness of 50 to 60 Rockwell . The barrels are chambered with the standard Clymer 9mm reamer and this could lead to a potential problem . The UZI fires with advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cartridge is fully seated in the chamber . If it becomes dirty or is dimensionally small , the cartridge will fire before it is fully seated and the empty brass will reveal a severe bulge at the base just above the web . The fired brass I examined at Knob Creek was not bulged , but then neither was the weapon extremely dirty . It is a point the user should bear in mind if he intends to reload his brass . The factory Dealer Sample UZI uses a slightly tapered 9mm chamber to avoid these problems when the chamber becomes dirty . <p> Another unique point to the Automatic Weaponry UZI design is the rate of fire of the .22 kit . Most of these .22 kits fire at an astronomical rate in excess of 1200 rpms , but the Automatic Weaponry kit fires at the same rate as the 9mm weapon - 600 rpms . This will be a tremendous asset for training and lower the cost of shooting your machine gun . Mike Brown revealed that almost all of his submachine gun shooting is done today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and realistic rate of fire . <p> The guns themselves retain the balance and handling of the original in every degree , but of course they are marked differently . The marked model number strikes a blow for gun owners ' sarcasm as the model number is HR 4332 , which is the same number as the House bill that outlawed the future possession of new machine guns . <p> The fire selector button is the same as that found on the original UZI , and it is marked " A R S. " This follows the practice of the IMI UZI 's that were built for export sales , although some of those built for sale in Europe were marked " D E S. " The firing positions remained the same in all cases with the forward most position being the full-auto setting , the center position the semi-auto setting and the rearward most position is the setting for SAFE . The rear sight is adjustable for 100 to 200 meters and copies the original in every detail down to the bevel at the rear of the receiver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same manner as the Israeli UZI . <p> Some collectors are underwhelmed by the concept of an American UZI design . They argue that only those UZIs of Israeli manufacture are worthy of attention . In this case I will have to disagree . The vast majority of titled and documented full-auto UZIs in this country are either Form One or Class II Manufacturer conversions and the quality of the weapons involved runs from perfect to abysmal . With the Automatic Weaponry group of weapons the manufacturer is a known quantity and the weapons I feel will be of a uniform quality through the series , regardless of how limited in number they may be . Converted weapons are no more the true UZIs , in my mind , than these American made duplicates . Everyone should remember the semi-auto carbine that served as the basis for conversion , featuring a barrel of different diameter than the true full-auto UZI . Many conversions still retain the receiver bar while using a slotted full-auto bolt . Weapons of this nature hold no more collector value to me than this American made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a two years supply of weapons to be sold and after that two years they will be gone . It may prove to be such an important point I feel I should mention it in closing that each of these weapons is titled in all three calibers , 9mm/.45ACP/.22 . Who knows what evil lurks in Congressional corridors ? But , if you already own a weapon titled in all three calibers , parts possession should not prove to be a problem in the future . <p> For many years automobiles from Detroit degraded the term " Made In The USA , " but many Americans have learned their lesson and are again producing quality materials . I feel the " Made In The USA " UZI design is another example of this trend as the workmanship is excellent and it is a product worth your investigation . <p> Originally published in the September 1987 issue of Firepower magazine .

The gun usually runs fine with any type of bullet , including hollow points and flat points . <p> Some time ago I had bought a barrel from Vector and had it cut &amp; threaded , but I had n't had a chance to see how it shoots . So today I brought it along . The new barrel was doing okay , but I would have some nosedives into the bottom of the barrel with hollowpoints . I had a few of these and switched to round nosed bullets . I then had one or two nosedives with the roundnoses . <p> I pulled the barrel and looked at it . It appears that the OD of the barrel had been chamfered at the chamber . <p> When I got home I checked the other spare barrel that I had bought from Vector . It is also chamfered , but where my threaded barrel appears to have had this done at the factory , the spare barrel looks like this may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the picture : <p> The one on the left is my original barrel that came with my ( pre-Vector ) Group Uzi . Notice how the chamber mouth is funnel-shaped to help guide the bullet . The middle barrel is the one I bought from Vector and had threaded . The barrel on the right is the spare that I bought at the same time . <p> After looking in the library , these look kind of like the barrels in the semi-auto conversions , but without the reduced OD for the restrictor ring as shown about 2/3 of the way down under the " Barrel Restrictor Ring " LONG ... <p> It appears that I would need a different feedramp for these barrels to run correctly . So which is the actual " SMG " spec barrel ? Which is correct , and which is the oddball . And what is the reason for the oddball ? <p> My three-lugged barrel is much like the middle barrel in the photo and it will not cycle the Winchester 147gn subsonic ammo ( flat point ) .

Look at this other picture . My factory ( Group ) barrel has a chamfer on the I 'd ( left barrel in the picture ) . The two barrels from Vector have been chamfered on the OD . <p> Just happened to pop on here . Garrett , your center photo is original IMI or Lyttleton . Mike Brown of Group Industries made his own barrels and the one on the left is how he made them . He told us at Vector that he chamfered the barrels to the outer edge to give them as much help as he could to get the round in the chamber . We followed suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with guns . The right one looks like one of our guys got carried away with the buffer and polished and radiused ( if that is a word ) it all over . Apparently , the center one got out without being chamfered . The picture right above this post from UZI SBR AWC is right on . The FN is done pretty much like the IMI or Lyttleton . The Olympic is a little different according to their own ideas I guess . These barrels look a little different than Garrett 's because they are semi auto and Garratt 's are full auto so the wall thickness is different . We try to chamfer all barrels out of our shop because it seems to help feed better . UZI SBR AWC is very correct in that if you have a lathe and want to try this yourself , you leave the chamber and inner edge alone and chamfer out from the inner edge to the outside so you do n't expose any more casing than is already exposed , if that makes sense .

The blocking bar was removed by the original manufacture and it is all papered etc. ; - ) <p> Since you indicated that you have a Model A and want to make it " like " the original SMG you would have to decide which variant of the SMG you want it to look like . <p> It was only the later guns that had the bolt catch for instance . The ratchet top cover was a modification as well . The large cocking handle was also a modification . The folding metal stock was not available on the first guns and so on ... <p> Do you want it to be like the " final " version of an Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want it to be able to utilize all the parts in a parts kit ( from a demilled Uzi submachine gun ) ? <p> Any of these are possible , it just a matter of time , research and money . Most of the info you need is in the Uzi talk library . <p> Do you want to be able to feed hollow points reliably ? The original Uzi had the stamped feed ramp which was designed for military ball ammunition , the semi has the feed ramp with restrictor ring which feeds hollowpoint ammo better . <p> Do you want it to be an export variant ( IMI sold guns to other countries with changes desired by that buyer ) ? <p> Hello , the link above is pretty detailed as to the differences ... what exactly are you looking for regarding the conversion ? I have some pics if you are interested in certain areas of the receiver or parts in general ... PM me if that would help ... <p> " it requires that the operator retract the bolt slightly by pulling back with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . Because of that , it 's kind of a pain in the ass " <p> The standard Uzi has three safeties built into it , the fire selector , the grip safety and the ratchet top cover . These will prevent most accidental discharges but the bolt safety adds one further fourth safety . <p> It can prevent inertia discharges where the operator has a loaded magazine in the gun with the grip safety depressed with the bolt in the cocked position and fire control safety is on safe and the gun is heavily bumped ( such as jumping out of the back of your troop transport ) . It could go BANG . The bolt safety will prevent this from happening . <p> It was the last safety added to the Uzi ( which was already the safest open bolt design ) . <p> As to finish on the gun , standard IMI military was parkerized I think . Semi gloss black looks great as well . <p> If it is already a registered receiver it can not now be remarked to SMG UZI , that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered receiver gun from a semi gun . <p> Once a gun is registered a different set of marking rules now applies . Weird and not logical but that restriction exists . You could ask for a variance but who knows how long that might take if allowed at all . <p> My IMI is full spec but I do n't run the bolt catch in it on a normal basis . ( Just do n't like it very well and not needed IMHO ) I also reparked mine then did the black over top . I have seen some originals done both ways but the park seems more common for the IMI issue . <p> You can write the Tech branch to get written approval to change the model . I know at least one guy that did that and got approval after a 4-5 month wait . Depends on how important that is to you and it seems like ATF is now probably not going to allow that in the future according to my new SAR article . Of course I have seen quite a few Uzi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a " stop Dog " in the receiver ? I thought it was a lever like a teeter totter that fell into place and blocked the forward movement of the bolt if it was accidently " discharged " on an open bolt due to being dropped - or prevented the bolt from going forward due to gravity ( up side down ) weapon from allowing the bolt to go forward .................... it was never included on the semiauto because it only worked on on the open bolt . <p> I remember reading this somewhere with regards to the difference between a semiauto and a select fire open bolt model and this was left off the imported civilian model . <p> The stop dog is usually encountered in the semi trigger groups although I have seen some FA trigger groups that have it . <p> I believe its purpose is to make sure the locking lever engages correctly . The locking lever is the bit on the trigger that actually holds the sear in a cocked position . When you pull the trigger in semi mode the sear is pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or firing pin in a semi ) and then sear will pop back up , engaging the locking lever . Now the sear pads are in position to catch the bolt as it moves back under recoil ( or firing pin in a semi ) . The stop dog makes sure this reset of the locking lever happens . <p> In full auto mode the sear is held down as long as the trigger is pressed . It only comes back up when the trigger is released . The stop dog is not in play in full auto mode . <p> Since the stop dog is covered by the bottom of the receiver and thus can never touch any part of the bolt it is not part of the " inertia discharge " safety nor can it prevent any upside down discharges . <p> The only thing holding the bolt ( or firing pin ) in a cocked position are the sear pads . <p> A quick review of the safety mechanisms in the Uzi : <p> Fire select safety - prevents the trigger from being pulled . <p> Grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is depressed , sear will not move either . Inertia discharges can not happen if the grip safety is not depressed . <p> Ratchet top cover - bolt will not go forward until the cocking handle is pulled fully to the rear . The bolt will be caught by the sear before the ratchet is reset . This prevents sloppy cocking discharges ( your hand slips off the cocking handle while pulling it back ) . <p> Trigger group bolt safety - prevents a rare type of inertia discharge . The gun must be cocked , loaded mag in place , fire select on safe , grip safety depressed and the gun is heavily bumped . The disadvantage to this safety is the bolt has to be slightly retracted in order to get the fire select safety off safe . <p> The trigger group bolt safety was the last " improvement " to the Uzi safety mechanisms as far as I know .

Even if a FA lower could be attached to the SA receiver , the sear would not work . <p> When the Uzi selector is allowed to move to the full-auto position , whether it be on a SMG lower or an original semi-auto only lower , this disables the semi-auto disconnector .

Most cops or BATF agents do n't understand the law or understand firearm design . If they see a selector move to the full-auto position , they 'll likely just arrest you and take your gun . They 'll also take your computer , all your parts and other guns and all documents they find .

@@77050749 @5750749/ <p> The UZI Pistol was designed for the American market and released in 1984 - before a fully automatic version of the pistol ( later to be known as the Micro UZI ) was ever designed . Immediately people began to thinking about full auto conversion methods for the new UZI . For a period of nearly two years , transferable registered conversions could be done on the UZI Pistol . Many of the UZI Pistol conversions are registered bolts like the Mini UZI . Also like the Mini UZI , the Pistol has no bolt blocking rail so there was no need for slot bolts . A number of manufacturers also did registered receiver conversions , including Wilson Arms , Fleming and Hard Times Armory . LaFrance did quite a few UZI Pistol conversions for the movie industry . <h> Sears:Fleming has stated that he did some registered sear UZI Pistols but those appear to be very rare , seldom showing up for sale . <h> Bolts:Factory Micro UZI 's were all closed bolt guns , but most of the UZI Pistol conversions are open bolt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversions can be made to run . The Mini UZI and Micro UZI both use essentially the same closed bolt assembly - the only difference being that the Micro UZI/Pistol bolt has a notch in the top to accommodate the top cover 's cocking lug . <p> The proper open bolt conversion requires a bolt with feet , just like the Mini UZI bolt , but the UZI Pistol has the same issue as the semi automatic Mini UZI in that the trunion is not relieved to make room for the bolt feet . There have been several approaches to this . <p> Use a Mini UZI bolt with feet and relieve the sides of the trunion to make room for them . <p> Use a Mini UZI bolt with feet and trim down the feet to slide under an unmodified trunion . The feet have to be VERY thin to fit under the trunion . <h> Barrels:Unlike the full size UZI and Mini UZI , the semi and full auto barrels for the UZI Pistol and Micro UZI are interchangeable . In the photo below you can see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all the same diameter . The only difference in the barrels is that the full auto Micro UZI barrel was longer to make room for compensator cuts . The conversion process merely requires a simple barrel swap . Depending on who did the conversion , the barrel may or may not have been swapped out . If you buy a conversion that has the original UZI Pistol barrel still in it , Micro UZI barrels are now easy to obtain and drop in with no further modifications required . <p> Stock : The most obvious difference between the UZI Pistol and the Micro UZI is that the full auto Micro UZI has a folding stock , which is not permitted on a standard UZI Pistol . A conversion may or may not have installed a folding stock . The folding stock makes a huge difference in the controllability of this small weapon during full auto fire and is a very desirable feature to look for when buying a conversion . Adding the stock requires a stock hinge on the back of the UZI receiver . This hinge is milled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not present on the UZI Pistol . The easiest way to address this problem is to buy a new back plate with a hinge and weld it right over the top of the original UZI Pistol back plate . Vector Arms sells a hinged Mini UZI back plate that can be used on an UZI Pistol conversion . It 's important to remember that if a stock is installed on an UZI Pistol that has a registered bolt in it , the bolt must stay with the gun or an illegal short barreled rifle has been created . <p> Sling Pin and **25;333;TOOLONG Micro UZI has two other things that the UZI Pistol does not - a sling pin near the front sight and a bayonet/accessory lug on the bottom of the receiver .

The bayonet lug needs to be welded to the bottom of the receiver .

When the selector and safety is installed , the nub should stick out far enough to engage the safety across its full width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's the lower with the selector installed .

You can see where the safety and the selector engage each other and how a little polishing to the parts is required to make for smooth operation . The corner of the safety must be both round and smooth . You also want the safety to stick up as much as possible so it will engage the bolt with more surface area and provide a more positive lockup . This can be helped by removing some of the metal from the bottom of the " nub " on the selector and polishing it as well . Also by removing a little metal from the top of the safety where it engages the selector .

Place a few layers of tape under the bar and eyeball a even amount of space on the top , side and bottom of the bolt to give sufficient clearance . Do a quick spot weld and recheck the clearance . The bolt must move the entire course of the receiver freely . Proceed with the aid of a C clamp and weld all three holes along the right side of the receiver . <p> Make sure to leave enough clearance for the rear plate to go on by recessing the bar into the receiver by about 1/16 " - 1/8 " <p> The trunion , feed ramp , and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers can provide an alignment bar and rear plate jig ( made from brass ) to properly align the trunion and feed ramp .

If an alignment bar is not available , one could be made from an UZI barrel . <p> The close up picture shows the barrel inserted into the feed ramp . It should extend 1/32 - 1/16 beyond the ring .

Place the rivet from inside the receiver channel , cap the rivet with the swivel . With the aid of a nut and some wood scraps , tap down on the swivel .

@@77050761 @5750761/ <p> UZI . The very name is synonymous with law enforcement at its most stressful . Israel Military Industries ' line of UZI submachine guns and Galil automatic rifles have earned a reputation worldwide as accurate , reliable , simple and easy to use firearms . Now UZI America - a partnership of IMI and Mossberg - is introducing a 9mm and a .40 caliber carbine built on the Mini UZI receiver for the police market . For a law enforcement community that began to re-appreciate the wisdom of having rifles available in cruisers with the infamous Miami FBI shootout in the eighties , and has seen that point driven home with the recent Los Angeles shootout , the new service-grade UZI carbines are made to order . <p> The partnership between Mossberg and IMI is a synergistic one . For the last several years IMI has n't had a U.S. importer/distributor , services that UZI America now provides . And for Mossberg - the world 's largest manufacturer of shotguns ( one-half million per year ! ) - the partnership brings them additional products with which to enhance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally been more focused on the over-seas law enforcement market where they are a major presence in 165 countries . ) <p> A Tool in a Toolbox <p> Just as cops carry many different tools on their belts - OC , baton , firearm , etc. - they also need a variety of cruiser-carried long guns at their disposal to properly address the full spectrum of more serious incidents . Although shotguns will never be displaced , we 've been seeing a wise return to the idea of a police rifle ( in addition to the shotgun ) these last few years . The trainer charged with choosing one for their department has had to make some difficult choices , however . Rifles introduce a whole new discipline and training doctrine to a department . Rifles mean new ammunition to buy , inventory and account for . Where do the rifles go in the cruiser - and is there even room ? Do all cruisers get them , or only supervisors ? Will rifle-toting police officers be accepted by the community ? Will the rifles stand up to duty use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rifle or a carbine ? <p> While every choice involves trade-offs , many departments are opting for handgun-caliber carbines . Their reasoning is that these carbines are relatively inexpensive , they share ammunition with the officer 's handgun , they fit easily in the limited space of a cruiser , they are easy to learn to shoot , and they provide more firepower . In this context , the purpose of a carbine is to extend the range of the duty sidearm in special situations - not necessarily to provide a different level of power from the handguns . <p> Officer Jacques , who recently introduced carbines into his department , positions them as a tool to contain a situation from a distance , while the appropriate resources are brought to the scene to remedy the situation . The police carbine is thus an intermediate level tool positioned between the duty shotgun and a sniper rifle . Firing a single projectile , rather than the nine in 00 buckshot , it also represents less liability at extended distances . <p> Gun Details <p> UZI sub-guns come in three receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is two inches smaller in overall length , and the even smaller Micro . UZI carbines are built on the Mini UZI receiver and available in two calibers , 9mm and 40 , and both caliber carbines come in three variations . The First Responder variation sports a 13.5-inch barrel , a flash suppresses and has an overall length of 29.4 inches . The Individual Officer variant has a non-class-three 16.25-inch barrel and an overall length of 32.2 inches . Finally , the forthcoming 16.25-inch barreled commercial version will have a Dragunov stock for non-law enforcement buyers . The commercial version also features a ramp front sight on the barrel , as opposed to the post front sight on the receiver on the First Responder and Individual Officer versions . According to the factory , a standard 124-grain 9mm hardball round exits the 16.25-inch barrel at a muzzle velocity of 1400 feet per second ( fps ) and will group into 4 inches at 100 meters ( 5 round average ) . Compared to about 1180 fps out of a service pistol that 's a significant increase , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort . All of these polygon-rifled carbine variants accept standard UZI 20- , 25- , and 32-round magazines . They all have fully ( and easily ) adjustable front and rear sights ( the front sights are of a new detent adjustable design - an improvement over the previous method which required a special tool ) , and they share the same familiar ergonomic UZI controls . This last point is important since some carbines have controls that are difficult to reach and manipulate , particularly for smaller hands . Both of us shooting the new UZI carbines have smaller than average hands , and we found that putting the carbine off-safe and into a firing mode was easily accomplished with an intuitive forward push with the right thumb . The UZI carbines retain the magazine-in-the-grip feature of earlier UZI 's , a design characteristic that makes a great deal of sense : thus reloading is a fairly idiot-proof hand-meets-hand exercise . With the magazine well elsewhere , reloading under stress and/or in the dark becomes more problematic . <p> Fires From Closed Bolt <p> The UZI carbines differ from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt . The original UZI 's fired from an open bolt , a design which inherently sacrificed the accuracy of the first shot . On a semi-automatic carbine , of course , all shots are " first " shots , so a closed bolt system is a big advantage . IMI has redesigned the action so that the UZI bolt closes , but the striker assembly , which was sliced , as it were , from the bottom of the bolt , is held back and released by the trigger ; there is also a safety that insures that the gun can not be fired unless the bolt is completely closed . This closed bolt design should eliminate any objections to the proven UZI design for police work . <p> The rest of the carbines is pure UZI - tough and reliable The gun itself , the sights , the magazines , and so on are all mil-spec and literally battle proven , and should stand up to the inevitable banging around that they will get in a cruiser , to say nothing of the actual abuse that all police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mechanically prevented from unintentionally chambering a round even when the stock is slammed ( or dropped ) onto a hard floor . Further , the rifles are simplicity itself to break down and clean : just remove the top cover assembly and one pin on the trigger assembly , and the guns are field stripped ( the extractor is of the 1911 style , with no springs ) . Yet . despite their hardiness , one of the nice things about them is that they look like what they are - rugged , duty-quality rifles - and not so much like military weapons . Certainly , if we can perform our job without undue public alarm , it behooves us , politically and tactically , to do so . The UZI carbines - particularly the 13.5-inch barreled First Responder - are also a nice compact size . Not only does this allow them to fit into an already too-crowded cruiser with minimal intrusion , it allows the carbine to be used in cramped quarters , unconventional shooting positions , and even , if necessary , during a building search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbine column in the " carbine vs. rifle " debate is the low flash of handgun caliber bullets . While .223 and .308 rounds are undoubtedly more effective , their muzzle flash will impair the operator 's vision and thus his/her ability to put that additional muzzle energy to effective use . The First Responder carbine comes with a flash suppresser ; this may or may not be necessary to reduce muzzle flash , but , in the abusive police environment , it is quite important in reducing the pings , dings and other damage that get done to the muzzles tip . <p> How They Shoot <p> These guns are fun to shoot . The stocks are properly sized so that an officer wearing body armor will still have sufficient reach to the trigger . The safety , as mentioned , is easy to release without giving up a firing grip . The sights , aperture rear and post front are easy to pick up in normal light and neither shooter found the fairly short sight radius to be a problem . The optional tritium front sight would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with all defensive/law enforcement guns . Both 9mm and .40 caliber rounds are inherently pleasant shooting , while the pistol grips ( on the law enforcement versions ) and the Dragunov stock ( on the upcoming commercial version ) make handling secure and ergonomic . These rifles are well balanced , making them easy to hold in firing position , and this user-friendliness reduces their perceived weight ( the First Responder weighs 6 pounds unloaded ) . <p> Accessories for the UZI carbines include a light mount/light and scope mounts . Laser Products , Inc. is also designing one of their famous Sure-Fire flashlights to integrate with these rifles . You may or not need a scope , but a light is a necessity , so it looks like you 'll have a choice . <p> A Full Law Enforcement Line <p> UZI America also distributes the full IMI line of UZI and Galil rifles , as well as UZI Eagle pistols . These include the full-size , mini-size and micro-size UZI Eagle pistols , which are available in a choice of three calibers ( 9mm , .40 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original Galil in several variants ( including a sniper version ) , which fire either .223 or .308 rounds and the new .223 micro Galil - an awesome full power , entry gun in a small package ( see Mas Ayoob 's review of this outstanding weapon in the July 1997 GWLE ) . Both us shooters found these guns to be quite controllable , even during full-auto bursts . Moreover , with UZI 's outstanding reliability and ease of maintenance , they should be natural choices for specialized teams now that they are readily available in this country again . One particularly nifty product is the adapter that UZI America has designed and produced to allow Galil 's to use M16 magazines . <p> Mossberg also has some new additions in the law enforcement arena , most notably their new semi-auto 12-gauge shotgun , dubbed the " Jungle Gun . " Like absolutely everything that comes out of the Mossberg factory , this piece is full mil-spec , and it 's the only self-loading shotgun to pass the 3000-round test that the military uses to evaluate pump shotguns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer to meet the quality requirements of ISO 9001 . ) <p> All of this makes Mossberg/UZI America one of the few places an armorer can go to fully outfit a police department with one-stop shopping and one-service provider . If you need a pistol or shotgun , make sure you check out their line . And like departments all across the country , the UZI carbines should be on your short list if you 're adding a carbine to your armory . If you 're not with a department and still need a duty-grade carbine , or even if you are and you just do n't want to hassle with the paperwork , check out the commercial version of these fine weapons .

@@77050763 @5750763/ <p> The original UZI machine gun was designed with a quick detachable wood stock and many of those surplus stocks are available today at a very reasonable price . People sometimes want to use them on their semi-auto UZI and while they do fit , it is not legal to put them on the gun .

It was fun projects and occupied my mind while I was recuperating from injuries . <p> Thanks CF , good to see you at it .

I 'm learning slowly- it 's usually easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing part . <p> Not on the M11 , but I built a .22 upper for a MAC10 back in the early 2000s . I found a piece of square tubing fit perfectly . ( I forget what size , but that 's easy enough to measure ) . I welded a lug in place for the takedown screw , and I bolted everything else together . I mostly used a pile of cannibalized 10/22 parts . ( It was a hoot ! The thing ran around 2000 rpm with CCI Stingers ) . <p> I think a lot of your solution will depend on what equipment you have available . If you only have a welder and simple hand tools you might take a different approach than if you have a full machine shop to play in . <p> I think the reason you do n't see anything about making a basic upper receiver is because you can buy them so cheaply , it 's not worth the effort of trying to save money or get personal satisfaction when you have to go through the heart burn and frustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alignments , and welds done correctly .

Dump the powder out through the hole , and spray a generous amount of gun oil into the hole to " kill " the primer . Sit the cartridge on its base . Let the oil sit on the primer overnight . You now have an inert cartridge . 
@@77050766 @5750766/ 71162 @qwx691162 <p> Israeli gun ownership is very restrictive and guns are very expensive over there , both imported and guns made in country . Do n't let the media photo 's fool you , look it up , it is very hard to purchase firearms , and you MIGHT get buy ONE if you live in a border town getting attacked daily . Israel is very good at marketing a very free country image , when in fact they are just as restrictive as most of the world . <p> Maybe the more pertinent question is how much does a post dealer sample uzi cost in the U.S. ? Maybe $400-$500 if that . For transferable machine guns , almost all of the value is in their legal status ( the piece of paper ) , not what they cost to build . <p> ... Since Israel is the birthplace of the Uzi and everyone one seems to carry one there . <p> I have visited Israel multiple times and have observed the many soldiers on the street , shopping in stores , waiting at bus stops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some version of the M16 . Officers , if they are armed , seem to carry handguns . Also , the security guards ( the kind that wear sunglasses and escort VIPs around ) seem to carry handguns concealed underneath loosely fitting blouses or lightweight jackets . Although I have seen hundreds or thousands of soldiers carrying M16s on the streets , I have only seen someone carrying an Uzi once in Israel . It was a full size Uzi being carried by what appeared to be a private security guard at a tourist attraction called " Mini Israel " . <p> This article from the Jerusalem Post gives a pretty good insight into private firearms ownership in Israel : <p> I never realized Isreal was so restrictive on Firearms !

It presents a clear contrast between the culture of free-for-all gun stores and lax regulation in the United States , and that of Israel . <p> There was a very small number of guns for sale in the store , and most of the items on the racks appeared to be accessories for IDF-issued firearms , for Israelis looking to customize their reserves weapons . The guns on display included a few 9mm pistols , but no assault rifles , hunting rifles , or shotguns were to be found . A poster of a bikini-clad woman holding a Glock .40 was one of the few similarities between the store and its American counterparts . <p> " The private gun sales market is virtually nonexistent . Almost all of our business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to renew their gun licenses , " Ben-Yehuda said , sounding like a man whose clientele has dropped off significantly in recent years . <p> " The problem is that the law makes it very difficult for the good people to get guns . The number of legal guns in recent years has gone to around 170,000 , but there are a half a million illegal guns floating around the Arab sector , no one knows how many . There 's no reason someone who was a fighter pilot should n't be able to get a license to carry a gun . " <p> According to Ben-Yehuda , the store only sells two hour blocs at its firing range , with 50 bullets included , for a price of well over NIS 200 far more expensive than in the US . Ben-Yehuda said he does n't  know of anyone who has received a new carry permit in the past two years , and that potential clients are deterred by the stringent regulations .

Ironic as Israel literally is surrounded by terrorists and face threats daily . And yet the govt ( &amp; public ? ? ? ? ) chooses to actively disarm its citizens . Truly sad . <p> Based on the Jerusalem Post article it sounds like those few who are licensed to own defensive firearms are " issued " fifty rounds of ammunition which should last three years .

Thanks <p> The reality is that you do not know if it has ever been built on , and you do not know if it has ever been on another 4473 before , listed as a rifle perhaps . The only way you have any degree of certainty is if you ordered it from the manufacturer direct , and it went straight to your dealer . Even then , you need to verify with the manufacturer that they did not enter it as a rifle in their bound book . Just because it looks new and there are no obvious marks on it , does not mean it has never been partially or completely assembled . You could have a situation where a previous owner had attached a butstock to it and nothing else . The moment a buttstock was attached , the receiver became a rifle . Then they remove the buttstock and decide to sell the receiver as " new unbuilt " . Technically if you build that into a pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to ask your dealer for a copy of your 4473 with the receiver listed as " receiver " or listed as " Pistol " . Secondly , if it is not already marked as " Pistol " on the actual receiver , you want to contact the manufacturer , and explain to them you are having the unit built into a pistol , and if they can verify in writing that they listed the receiver as a " receiver " or as " pistol " in their bound book . If they tell you they listed it otherwise , you can not build a pistol anymore out of that receiver . <p> It is my understanding that the 4473 Form has changed . Instead of being rifle or pistol , there is a third category . That is as a bare receiver . " gbfirearmsales " certainly has the bases covered above . If you follow that advice you should be more than covered for Federal law . As others have written , the first thing to do is to contact legal council or look up state law where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build the AR pistol in your state before starting the build . <p> BTW , have you shot an AR pistol before ? They are big and bulk with quite a lot more energy being expelled than a 9mm of .45 . I have a 7.5 " upper . I 've tried it with my sear having the stock collapsed , shooting it as a pistol in semi . All it took was one round for me to find out , that is not the way I want to shoot it . Good luck with your AR pistol project . The 7.5 is a lot of fun with a stock and a sear , but I personally would not want one as a pistol . VMMY . <p> I use to be the one that said no in the past until my gun dealers friends showed me the law as its written compared to the new 4473 forms marked as other . If you want to build your AR lower into a pistol you can legally unless your home state say otherwise , which for Alabama is doubtful . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistols . Add a red dot , PWS FSC 556 comp , PRI low profile adjustable gas block , and its not difficult to be proficient within 100yds . The PWS comp and PRI low profile adjustable gas block will limit recoil and allow reliable use of a suppressor . <p> I wanted to build it in one of the 300 " whisper " calibers . Now that the 300 BLK is out I 'm thinking that may be the way to go . AAC will be selling a 9 " barrel so add a suppressor and it may be front heavy but I figured I can rest it on something . One thing I am not sure about is if a pistol can have a bi-pod , could they consider it as a front grip ? There are pistols out there with bi-pods . <p> So I have this straight " Shadow " , you want to build a 300 whisper/blackout pistol , with a 9 " barrel ?

Not items most shooters would track down , or for that matter have interest in buying . <p> While I 'm sure it would be possible to become proficient with an AR pistol , I would also think it would be possible to become proficient using a mirror over your shoulder . To me they are both disadvantages that need to be overcome . Most shooters are more accurate with a shoulder fired firearm than with a handgun . I think most shooters would agree with that statement . Especially at distance , a stock would be an advantage . I personally want every advantage I can get . If you plan to spend that kind of money , why not add a $200 stamp and have the advantage of a stock ? The MGI modular lower system is expensive . But one stamp and you could have a multitude of SBR configurations with magwell changes . <p> Please let me know why that caliber ? From what I 've read there are other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf .

EBR makes 220 gr subsonic with about the same ballistics listed for subsonic 300 whisper , if I want to be quiet and spend big money per round . But I can buy steel cased 7.62X39 for $180 per thousand if I just want to do some " plinking " . I have n't seen 300 whisper/blackout ammo in what I would consider at " plinking " use cost . By the same token , as far as a subgun round , 10 mm AUTO has similar ballistics , has easily obtainable pistols ( Glock 20 and Colt Delta ) , and can get plenty of ammo right off the self .

This shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian sales drive the most R&amp;D of any product produced in the U.S. However , usage and some R&amp;D continues within the government on wipe technology as it is still being used on new suppressors not meant for civilian sales . <p> Another area closed to civilian would be what is known as " captive-piston " ammo in which each round is it 's own silencer . Such ammo would require a $200 tax stamp per round . The bullet is ejected from the cartridge by a piston which is detonated by components in the primer when the primer is struck . However , all blast material and sound is contained within the cartridge . Such ammo makes silencing of normal revolvers possible as well as increased silencing of autos already equipped with suppressors/ silencers or those integrally suppressed . So , the law has effectively shut out civilians from both any wipe technology based systems as well as captive-piston ammo , which has been used heavily and effectively by the Russians . <p> I have an original Sionics 2-stage Powder Springs 9mm can .

If you order wipe material , I found that the softer neoprene holds up better , more flexible , and accuracy is not affected as much as with the harder neoprene . As far as ammo , I use WWB 115gr FMJ 9mm from Wallyworld . If you purchase a 2-stage can with spiral baffles , get an encapsulator tool and a decent strap wrench .

That way each wipe is a consistant thickness . I started using Durometer 80 ( about the hardness of dress shoe sole ) , but I found after only one mag , chunks of materal broke away at the center hole . I switched to using Durometer 50 . A good combination of durability and elasticity . A 12 " x12 " sheet of Ultra-Strength Neoprene 1/4 " Thick 50A Durometer is McMaster-Carr Part #9013K123 @ $23.33ea ..

Do n't worry if your not dead center with the small hole , the bullets will take care of that . I disassemble the suppressor , removing the endcap , 2 spiral and 1 cone baffles , after each outing . It 's not so much to clean the baffles as it is to keep the tube threads between the encapsulator and end cap clean and free of build-up . I 've never disassembled the first stage with the eyelets or removed the second stage tube from the first . If the first stage needs cleaned , I would soak that part in a solvent and let dry throughly . One last note , I would n't advise adding water to this style of can to quiet it . I tried it and it makes nothing but a mess .

Hope this helps . <p> When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to purchase the stock ... this is where your access to tools and equipment might dictate which way to acquire the material . You can either buy it in 1/4 " sheet , or 1-1/4 " round rod . Polyurethane in the same durometer as MacMan specified earlier is a good alternative to neoprene , if price is an issue . As a maintenance mechanic I have access to a lot of equipment and tools including machine shop equipment such as a lathe , milling machine , etc . As such I 've made wipes using both types of stock . If you buy the round stock you will need a way to " slice " the 1/4 " pieces , and to do it fairly straight . You will need a table saw or a band saw with some kind of rip fence or gauge , I guess a hack saw will work as a last resort , but it will be tedious at best . I chucked a piece in the lathe and bored the center hole first , then I used a vertical bandsaw with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center hole after cutting the discs . The cuts will leave burrs , so a file or sander/grinder can be used to finish up the edges . <p> If you order sheet stock the thickness will not be an issue ; instead , cutting the 1-1/4 " discs becomes the job at hand . You will also have some waste material left over from punching the round discs , but it 'll be minimal . A punch of some kind will need to be utilized if this is the route you choose . Our shop had a Whitney punch set up that we used to punch elevator door button panels . We had several dies , including a 1-1/4 " . I was able to punch out my discs using this machine , and also punched the center holes using the 3/16 " die as well . To do it by hand a 1-1/4 " gasket punch and hammer can be used , with a proper backing material to punch on . A centerfinder can be used to mark the center , and a 3/16 " punch can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut from round stock ; the blue ones are neoprene punched from sheet stock .

Due to the fact that the Micro does not have a big market like the AR/M16 and others , manufacturers are not making parts for it . Below is a detailed list of parts that can be easily adapted to the Micro with nothing more than a standard drill , hack saw and flat head screwdriver . This Micro UZI is used as a combat field weapon here in Israel so the accessories had to be tough , practical and readily available if replacements were needed . <p> All I did was take existing bolt-on parts , that can be readily found everywhere , and adapted them to the Micro . None of the accessories were specifically made for the Micro but they worked well on the weapon . The configuration show below is only one of many options that can be done with the Micro UZI . Once a few key parts are bolted on to the weapon the configurations and add-on 's are endless and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; MP5 accessory list a run for their money . <p> All of the accessories ( with the exception of the AR stock adapter ) can be found at any gun parts accessory store or web site .

I ordered most of the accessories on Ebay and most sellers ship internationally ( I love the guys in Taiwan - 10 days to Israel ) . <p> This article is my Mitzvah to all you Micro UZI owners . I know your pain . Hope this helps ! <p> Micro UZI with just a few possible accessories . <p> Micro UZI optic mount/base <p> The most important accessory was without a doubt an optic mount/base for the Micro . The standard UZI has a much longer top receiver cover so mounting a scope base is much easier . However the Micro UZI has a very short top receiver cover so a few minor changes had to be made . NOTE : This same configuration can likely be done with the Mini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a new receiver cover from Vector Arms in order to avoid drilling holes in the original receiver cover . A new cover is fairly inexpensive . <p> The mount shown above is TDI Arms " SR-A " Picatinny Rail - Short length ( for mounting to AR/M16 heat shields ) . The plastic spacers shown protruding from the bottom of the mount in picture #2 were originally designed to fit in the heat shield holes of the AR/M16 . However they made a nice " mini riser " for the optic , and at the same time made more room for the cocking slide to fit when the breach is open . What is nice about the TDI Arms mount is that it comes with pre-threaded holes so no drilling and tapping was necessary on the picatinny rail . A standard steel picatinny can be welded to the receiver cover as well , however I prefer to work with what I have immediately available , and a welder is n't one of them . <p> The screws ( Picture #3 ) that came with the TDI mount had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bolt carrier to clear the screw heads when firing . Also there are two plastic notches on the corners of the TDI rail itself that may need to be filed off or trimmed down with an X-acto knife in order to slide on some optics mounts . One will want to mount the TDI as far to the rear as possible in order to make for the maximum amount of clearance for the cocking handle ( Picture #1 ) . Obviously you will want to make sure the TDI mount is straight when marking the drilling holes on the cover . <p> The only other modification was to cut down the slot cover . In order to avoid having the slot cover hit the TDI optic mount ( located to the rear of the top cover ) the slot cover had to be cut down by about 1 inch . Cutting the slot cover has no affect on the gun 's functionality . Again Class 3 owners may want to buy a new cocking rail and cut it down instead of the original . <p> Pictured is an Aimpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throw " mount . With the TDI in place the types of optics and accessories that can be mounted to the Micro UZI are endless . <p> Quick target acquisition and second shot placement are greatly improved with a Aimpoint type optic . A must for a combat weapon . As one American soldier put it this optic is " used to make bad guys wish they were n't bad any more " . <p> Accessories like this Yankee Hill Riser ( YHM-226 ) can also be bolted on to the TDI base . I used the riser to mount the Night Vision scope ( shown below ) because extra clearance was needed in order to clear the factory site . <p> The Yankee Hill Riser also allows for use of the factory sites even with an optic mounted on the weapon . The only down side was that the elevation adjustment on the Aimpoint had to maxed out in order to compensate for the high elevation of the optic after bolting on the riser . For this reason I only used the YH riser for the NV optic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregrip , flashlight and laser is a UTG Tri-Rail mount ( #2 ) . The UTG mount has 3 picatinny rails , one on each side and one on the bottom . UTG makes a number of these universal barrel mounts ( a 3 notch for shotguns and a 5 notch for larger rifles . ) The " 2 notch " UTG fits perfectly on the Micro UZI barrel , and even leaves enough clearance space for the factory muzzle compensator notches in the barrel ( picture #2 ) . All the necessary tools and mounting hardware are included with the UTG mount . I did not attach any accessories to the left picatinny rail because this weapon sits on a sling and I wanted a narrower profile in the field . However it is there to use if need be <p> In order to keep the forgrip from hanging down too far it is recommended that the " lower hole " in the mount be used ( see picture #3 . ) Picture #3 shows the barrel mounted in the lower hole of the UTG mount as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was done because when mounted in the upper hole the foregrip hamgs down past the factory hand grip to the rear . This mounting method also allows for the mounting of a small laser just above the barrel if desired ( however I used another laser mount ) . <p> There are an endless number of foregrips available on the market . The one pictured here is a UTG Ergonomic grip with battery storage compartment . The compartment holds batteries for the flashlight , laser &amp; Aimpoint and it has a rubber O-ring around the threads making it water tight ( for those rainy days in the field ) . The UTG feels very comfortable in the hand and has a short mounting base ( very important with the limited space of the Micro UZI barrel ) . There are shorter foregrips , m16 handle style foregrips , and even folding foregrips on the market . However make sure that the foregrip has a short mounting base so as to avoid extending past the end of the barrel . <p> I also trimmed a small amount of plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners ) in order to get it to slide past the barrel nut . Once the corners were shaved a bit the grip slid all the way to the rear and sat against the bayonet lug ( picture #1 ) . <p> Micro UZI flashlight and laser mount <p> Flashlight <p> The flashlight mount shown in Pictures #1 &amp; #4 is a ICS Tri-rail flashlight mount ( MC-75 ) . The ICS mount takes all standard 1 " inch flashlights such as the Sure Fire . It also has 3 picatinny rails that bolt onto the mount for attaching even more accessories . The ICS mount shown in picture #1 only has 1 picatinny attached to it ( because I only needed one for the laser ) however the other 2 picatinny 's can be bolted on if needed ( as shown in picture #4 ) . <p> The flashlight shown above is a super bright Xenon 90 lumenstorch . There are other smaller flashlights on the market however I went with this one because it was so damn bright . The flashlight is illuminated by either pressing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like a Maglite ) for a " constant on " . I intentionally did n't install the pressure switch to the light because I wanted to be able to use either hand to turn it on . This set up allows me to light it up with my trigger hand ( thus allowing 1 handed operation of the weapon if need be ) or foregrip hand . <p> I get muzzle blast on the flashlight body because it sticks out past the barrel , but the brightness is worth it ( it is brighter than my 3c mag lite ) . Thing works great for clearing buildings at night . Soon I will put an extended muzzle brake on the end and hopefully this will reduce some of the powder build up on the flashlight . <p> This NCSTAR Pistol flashlight ( with Weaver Rail mount ) is one of many flashlights that can be mounted onto the MICRO UZI 's UTG barrel mount . The NC STAR is much smaller and only requires 1 CR123 battery ( as opposed to th Xenon 's 2 batteries ) . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as bright as the Xenon shown in picture ( 90 lumens ) , so I chose to stick with the Xenon despite its larger profile . <p> Laser <p> The laser is a standard BRONS firearm laser , with weaver mount .

It is very effective . Plus it saves a lot of paperwork . <p> The laser could have been mounted to the left picatinny rail on the UTG Tri-rail mount ( which makes the weapon balance nicely ) but I wanted a narrower profile so I mounted it on the right side under the flashlight via the picatinny rail on the ICS Flashlight mount . There is enough space for the hand to fit ( see picture #2 ) . I also cut down the wire on the laser and soldered in a smaller push button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of wire and gave a lower profile to the switch ) .

They were designed to fit full auto guns with shorter barrels . <p> Hard Cases <p> Action Arms sold Samsonite briefcases that were specially designed for the UZI SMG and Mini UZI . The case for the full size UZI used magnets to keep the gun and spare magazines in place . Note that it held the full size UZI with the stock partially unfolded for quicker deployment . The Mini UZI was secured by foam that was cut to precisely fit the gun and spare magazines . <p> The Samsonite cases were popularized though use by the United States Secret Service . One of these cases can be seen in the photo of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan . <p> When Cobray made the M11/.380 suppressed operational briefcases , they made a small run of non-suppressed UZI cases that fired the same way .

@@77050796 @5750796/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Field Report : Blackjack Uzi Buffers <p> A friend of mine has a set of black buffers and a set of green buffers made by Randy . We took them out today to test . I used a PACT timer that is able to measue ROF ( rate of fire ) . First thing is that shooting my .45 conversion kit in my uzi , it definintely was not as harsh when I added one of the 3/8 inch buffers . Now , checking the ROF with 9mm ammo , we found that the ROF was faster with hotter ammo . We used PMC 124 grain FMJ 9mm and Walmart Winchester 115 grain FMJ 9mm ammo . The Walmart is hotter than the PMC . With the PMC ammo , the ROF was 570 RPM without any buffers , and with the Walmart Winchester ammo , the ROF was about the same . So , even though the Walmart ammo was hotter , it did not affect the ROF without any buffers present . But then with the 1/2 inch black buffer and PMC ammo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walmart ammo , it had a ROF of 673 RPM . Then with all three of his black buffers ( 1/2 inch , 3/8 inch , and 1/4 inch ) using the PMC ammo , we had a ROF of 653 RPM but with the Walmart Winchester ammo , we had a ROF of 849 RPM . We then tried two of he 1/2 inch buffers with two of the 3/8 inch buffers and with the PMC ammo , we had a ROF of 748 RPM , but with the Walmart Winchester ammo , we had a whopping ROF of 990 RPM ! The green buffers and the black buffers seem to work about the same . Randy said the green buffers were softer . I have sent this info on to Randy . I believe he is really onto something with these buffers . I am going to do some more experimenting with them , and I will get back to you about what I find . These buffers really allow fine tuning of your ROF for the particular ammo you are using . Since I generally use Walmart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the ROF that I want . I had been using a semi-auto buffer but found its ROF too fast , but I can not find the actual figures right now . I will test it again later . What I like about Randy 's buffer setup is that you have more than just slow and very fast to choose from as you would either using no buffer or using the semi-auto buffer . With Randy 's setup , you can adjust the ROF gradually until you reach the ROF that is ideal for you . With me , I like a ROF of around 750 RPM with a subgun . I have read that 550 RPM is ideal , but I find that with a little faster ROF , I can gett more bullets into the killing zone before the muzzle climb takes me off of target . <p> I just e-mailed Randy . He will be doing some more development of different thickness of buffers . I am going to do some testing for him . What we need to know are the various types of 9mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you a ROF for each type of ammo . I have already tested PMC 124 grain and the Walmart Winchester 115 grain . I have some PMC 115 grain and some Federal 147 grain or whatever that Federal ammo is that has the truncated cone FMJ and is subsonic . I have some in my garage but do not want to go run it down right now . I also have a few other brands . So , let us know what brands of ammo you would like to have tested . <p> I was wondering if there are any long term negative effects on your Uzi from putting in larger buffers ? Does this cause any accelerated wear on any of the components ? Thanks ! <p> MJ <p> This is my cubicle ! There are many like it , but this one is mine ! My cubicle is my best friend . It is my life . I must master it , like I master my life . Without me , my cubicle is useless . ....... ME ! 04MAY06 <p> Actually the buffers remove one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the back of the receiver . With the increase in the ROF you would increase the wear on the gun if you are tempted to shoot more ammo due to the increase ROF . So , hypothetically speaking , say you generally go to the range and shoot 500 rounds through your Uzi with your 570 RPM ROF . Now because you can change the ROF , and you are enjoying shooting your Uzi more , you might shoot 1000 rounds . So , the buffers would double the wear on your Uzi because you are enjoying yourself and shooting more , not because there is any mechanical reason for it . Remember , Uzi 's are made for combat , and as such , they are made to take a lot of use and abuse . I doubt seriously that any of us can replicate what happens in combat by our weekend shooting at the range . It reminds me about the use of the CAR15 during the Vietnam War . The Special Ops guys on MACVSOG did not have a problem with reliability of the CAR15 like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main problem of reliability , besides keeping the weapon clean , was due to magazine problems . So , to check their mags out , some of the MACVSOG guys would shoot a complete combat load ( just over 400 rounds ) through their CAR15 's to make sure all of their mags worked . So , to them , 400 rounds was no big deal and just a way to check mags . To us , who paid big bucks for our M16 's , 400 rounds was a day at the range . So , in combat , weapons are subject to much more use , and we do not have to worry that we will replicate this use by shooting on the weekends . The addition of buffers will do nothing to increase the wear on your Uzi . Dragging the Uzi through sand and leaving it in the rain and shooting 5K to 10K rounds through it a month will just push it to its combat limits . Buffers that will increase the ROF do nothing more than take the shock out of the bolt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffers . This time I only used Walmart Winchester ammo . I first tried one of the CDNN semi-auto buffers ( it is 1 1/2 inches thick ) and got a ROF of 1015 RPM . I then tried a combo of Blackjack Buffers with two of the black 1/2 inch buffers and one of the black 3/8 inch buffers ( a total of 1 3/8 inches thick ) and got a ROF of 909 RPM . I then tried two of the black 1/2 inch buffers ( a total of 1 inch thick ) and got a ROF of 814 RPM . With just one of the 1/2 inch buffers , I got a ROF of 697 RPM . Randy has been working on maybe making a kit of buffers with one 1 1/2 inches thick , one 1 1/4 inches thick , and one that would be 1 inch thick . With Walmart ammo , that would give you about 1000 RPM , 900 RPM , and 800 RPM . I personally like the 700 RPM and sometimes the 800 RPM , so for me I would want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the 1 inch buffers for 800 RPM . It is better to have a buffer that is the proper thickness rather than use a stack of buffers , as with the stack of buffers , you get some binding , and that causes the ROF to vary while the weapon is firing . <h> Great info <p> Randy has been working on maybe making a kit of buffers with one 1 1/2 inches thick , one 1 1/4 inches thick , and one that would be 1 inch thick . With Walmart ammo , that would give you about 1000 RPM , 900 RPM , and 800 RPM . <p> That would be SWEET . I also agree that 1/2 inch buffers are still nice , as the slower ROF really appeals to some folks . Personally , I 'd be very interested in a kit with the above mentioned thicknesses , that also includes a 1/2 incher for the slower ROF . Got ta have a little bit of that flavor for everyone ! <h> Wearing out an UZI <p> Local rental range has 3,000,000 rounds thru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced springs , sears , barrels and one bolt . Back end of receiver needed a reweld from stress cracks at 2,000,000 rounds . Will you wear out an Uzi ? Highly unlikely . <h> Buffer Update <p> I just picked up the first couple 1.5 " buffers today , they turned out better than I had expected . I 'm getting several more and will cut them down and have them checked for the ROF . From what I 'm reading here it looks like I 'll be offering these in .25 , .5,1,1.25 , and 1.5 " lengths with a discount available when buying an asortment of 3 or more . <p> I do n't want to start a flame fest , but I was told by a C2 friend that the 1.4 " buffer is way too much for 9mm and is especially a bad idea when shooting .45 . His explanation was a bit complicated , but it had to do with the stress on the receiver - especially the rear welds . This stress is proportional to the rate of transfer of kinetic recoil energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point loading ) . <p> An ideal scenario matches the ammo , bolt mass and recoil spring and transfers recoil energy either at reinforced hard points or over a large surface area . If you plot the energy transfer rate over the period of time it takes the gun to cycle , it would look like a bell curve with some small spikes - none of which would exceed a safe maximum . <p> If the bolt " bottoms out " on the back of the receiver , you get a big spike localized to a small area as the residual bolt energy is nearly instantaneously transfered to the receiver . Buffers alleviate this problem . <p> Can a buffer be too large ? Certainly if there are ROF related controlability or feeding problems . Certainly if the sear and safeties do n't reliably work . But what about stress on the receiver ? <p> Imagine a large buffer that encounters the bolt at a point where the bolt energy is near its peak . As an extreme example , assume the buffer were made of something hard like steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster energy spike to the rear of the gun probably breaking the welds and doing all sorts of collateral damage . Clearly , there is more energy to deal with and the demands on large buffers are greater than small ones . <p> Back to the point . Buffers are obviously made of material that is elastic and tolerant to heat and fatigue . Sort of like a very stiff spring . For a large buffer to be safe , it has to take this maximum bolt energy and store some of it , dissipate some of it ( heat ) and transfer some of it to the receiver in a manner that wo n't damage the gun . The buffer may be elastic , but not compared to the recoil spring . Not much energy is lost to heat . Most energy transfers to the receiver and over a considerably shorter interval . The buffer will also expand laterally which , if excessive , may introduce another type of receiver stress not enginered for . <p> So how much stress is too much for a well made Uzi receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collects that data point . For me , I 'll keep my buffers short and limit them to operating at lower bolt energies near the travel limit . Especially when shooting .45 . <p> I wonder if nonlinear recoil springs have been tried on Uzis with any luck ? I know they are used in some pistols designs . <p> I would not worry about the damage done to the rear of the receiver as the buffers are thick enough to absorb the energy of the steel bolt . The main thing to consider is that what the buffers do is to limit the travel of the bolt . Rather than traveling all the way to the rear of the receiver and contacting the thin factory buffer , the bolt travel is shortened by the width of the buffer . The the ROF may increase , but it does not increase the amount of energy imparted to the bolt in its rearward motion . If you are using the same ammo , then the same amount of kinetic energy is imparted to the bolt with or without one of blackjack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far to travel , then you get a faster return to pick up another round , and this increases the ROF . Using very hot +p+ ammo would impart more energy to the rear of the receiver , but a buffer used to increase the ROF does not change he amount of kinetic energy . As far as the buffer thickness goes , I tried a stack of blackjack 's buffers that were a total thickness of 1.75 inches . That was too thick as you could not get the racheting handle to come back far enough to engage the bolt and return forward without first taking out the loaded magazine . The buffer that was 1.5 inches worked like a champ . I do not believe we will have any problems with increase ROF on the receiver and I believe that the 1.5 inch buffer will work fine . I think the ROF of the 1.5 inch buffer is a bit much - 1015 RPM using Walmart Winchester ammo . Once we have the new buffers , we will do ROF tests on a variety of ammo . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each buffer . <p> Originally posted by MACVSOG ... The the ROF may increase , but it does not increase the amount of energy imparted to the bolt in its rearward motion . ... Charles Tatum Alamo Professional Arms <p> Charles <p> For the record , I want to let everyone know I 'm not picking on Blackjack ( or CDNN 's buffers for that matter ) . I 've heard wonderful things about Blackjack 's quality and and his customer service . This is about buffer size and whether or not longer buffers could in theory cause increased receiver stress . <p> I agree with the above quoted statement . However , destructive stress is caused by the rate of energy being transferred , not the amount ( the difference between the energy in a candle and a stick of dynamite is small , but the rate at which they expend energy makes a huge difference in their destructive effect ) . <p> For simplicity 's sake , let 's assume we 're using ammo that does n't overdrive the bolt . This same ammo will be used for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward bolt motion intervals for a given setup are the same ( probably not true in practice ) <p> As an engineer geek , I ca n't resist a graph even if it 's a crude hand drawn one . This graph represents the rate of energy transfer into the receiver body during the rearward bolt movement . The forward bolt would be similar , but at lower amplitude . <p> Example 1 : 600 RPM ( 100 ms cycle time ) with only a standard recoil spring . Half of the bolt 's energy is transferred and stored as potential energy in the recoil spring during the bolt 's 50 millisecond rearward interval . The spring 's resistance ( and Newton 's third law ) provides the transfer of the equal and opposite half of recoil energy into the receiver/shooter mass as kinetic energy . The rate of that transfer is over the rearward bolt stroke is shown by the black curve . <p> Example 2 : Red curve . Doubling the ROF from say 600RPM to 1200RPM by just using a stiffer spring would double the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half yet as you pointed out , the energy imparted to the bolt is the same ( i.e. the area under the different curves is the same ) . Because a spring is used over the entire stroke , the curve remains bell shaped . <p> Example 3 : Blue curve . But using a large buffer to get 1200 RPM is not the same thing . First of all , far less energy is being stored in the recoil spring because rearward travel is interrupted by the buffer . It 's the buffer that receives the lion 's share of the bolt 's energy and has to deal with it ( by compression and lateral expansion - both of which impart energy to the receiver ) . <p> At first the blue curve tracks the black one . No suprise since only the recoil spring is resisting the bolt . However , when the buffer is encountered , it is far less yielding than the recoil spring and it rapidly decelerates the bolt . As you indicated , the bolt had the same amount of energy but most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milliseconds of travel when it engages the buffer . That spikes the RATE of energy transfer back to the receiver . Depending on the buffer characteristics , the blue curve could be very narrow and tall ( bad ) or it could be wider and shorter ( good ) . <p> I doubt that it would ever approach the red curve because to do so would require it to be as elastic as a spring . <p> So that brings me back to my decision to use a small buffer as a means of avoiding bolt contact with the rear of the receiver . The bolt energy is much lower at that point because most of it 's energy is stored in the recoil spring or already transferred to the receiver as recoil energy .

Age of the receiver around 1975 **25;511;TOOLONG around 1980 , probably later since handguards are plastic and not wood , from the last batch of IDF made rifles . <p> Most all of my 80 's barrels have very definitive stamps and proof while the mid to later 70 's barrels had lighter stamps and that looks like a 12 above whatever number you pointed out to the upper left . <p> The very early barrels had some very cool lathe marks and stamping . <p> The Gasblock although I do n't  see a close up looks earlier too . Kinda depends on the right side stamping and most importantly any raised pin areas . The Roll pin area if raised will most assuredly put it in the 80 's or later . The easiest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a slant shelf or flat front with sight position lines . the flat is early the slanted is later generally speaking . <p> Take all that and also consider the armorers used any and all parts to swap and repair . <p> The Jury is out on the barrel IMO . Some shot of the Block would help but not guarantee it started with the barrel . Most likely it did though . I 'd have to see the block <p> Gas tubes has some different machining lines as time went on . <p> Not all Galil receivers in the 80 's has scope mounts from my understanding <p> Your hand guard is a later version as well as the retainer but that 's a easy switch . <p> The handle base on your bolt carrier looks early to mid 80 's but I 'd have to see it as well as the stamping and undercarriage . <p> Your bolt will tell a story too . Is it spring loaded ? Proof marks can help date one as well as the extractor claw stamp ( If its original ) <p> Argox thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good details . I reposted your bolt picture with a interest point circled in red . Could you get a shot of the pressure proof mark stamped on the bolt . I am looking to see if that is a Circle with a " P " in the center . Some proof marks are Oval shaped with a " P " inside of it . Most of the oval " P " proof marks are believed to be from the proofing house in South Africa . Israeli make proof marks can be circle " E " ( rumored to be a Tsadi character ) or just a plain " P " without a circle . Then again trying to determine where a Galil and its components is a crap shoot because these is no history on markings like you would find in Fabrique National rifles . <p> A couple more things : The recoil rod assembly looks like it has been replaced with a newer " B " stamped recoil assembly . From most indications the " B " stamped parts are associated with .308 Galil 's . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " B " stamp on your bolt carrier group that the recoil assembly is a replacement . <p> Next : I see a full auto pin in your receiver is your Galil Full Auto ( if it is NICE ! ) ? The reason I ask about FA fire is that in the picture of your bolt carrier ( with the " 69 " stamp ) it appears that the auto sear trip nub has been ground off ? This modification is usually done for semi-auto fire only rifles . Have you tried to fire it in FA to see if it works ? Did the seller tell you the origin of the rifle ? I like your rifle BTW. 
@@77050798 @5750798/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Who at this time does the best work on galils ? <p> I purchased a golani sporter a few years back and have since collected most of the parts needed to convert it to an arm and replace some of the parts that were in a lesser condition . I would like to have the rifle rebuilt and refinished as close to IMI as possible . The only person i have found so far is a guy named Clifford Stearns but i have not seen anything on the quality of his builds . From research years ago i had heard of Tenngalil but i am not sure if he still works on them . Any ideas ? <p> Sofar this is what i have for the build ; Mepro night sights Arm bipod Black thorn arm gas block Handguard halves w/bipod cut And a century golani that has a steel shell stuck in the barrel . I have not found a carry handle yet and not sure if i need to get a different gas tube and piston to convert to arm . The golani is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i bought it but i only paid $500 for it a couple years ago . Should i also replace the barrel on it ? After this project is complete i will be putting together the parts to build a sar sbr on a cnc warrior reciever . The golani was my first galil clone and i fell in love with the platform . <p> Blackthorne gas block , check for out of round inside diameter , out of spec. very possible . You 'll probably want to find a better barrel . Knock that casing out of the barrel , make sure barrel 's got no bulges , and that rifling looks good , check twist rate while your at it . AR/ARM gas tube , gas piston , are the same , SAR is different . Carry handles are not usually too hard to find , one should show up soon . The ARM wood handguards are hard to find , especially a really good one . Ironwood Designs should have some soon . Find a good builder too . Good luck brother , and " Welcome Aboard " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle , when factoring in the cost for his labor -- you 're much ahead to just go ahead and rebuild on a CNCW receiver IMO . He may tell you your receiver lacks sufficient hardness necessitating a new receiver anyways ... <p> You wo n't need to get a different gas tube and piston to convert to arm if it is the full length 9 " tube with matching piston . If you want a carry handle , I have an aftermarket one available with rear hanger &amp; also a rear hanger with bipod/ no carry handle available . You can hit me up back channel with a PM <p> Originally Posted by AresShrike <p> Blackthorne gas block , check for out of round inside diameter , out of spec. very possible . <p> Might as well toss that BlackThorne gas block &amp; start looking for another one .

Be careful when shopping for gas blocks , I see a lot of SAR gas blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARM gas blocks . <p> After considering the input you guys have givin me I am going to leave the golani set up as ar and have a local guy work on it . I have already started looking for arm parts and will have Jeff do the build on a cnc warrior reciver . Felix i will get with you next week about that cut rear hanger . <p> Does anyone know the correct inside diameter of the ar/arm gas block ? I was thinking it is something i could checkout myself with a set of calipers rather than take it to someone . Also i found a guy on ak files that is selling galil kits with barrel for $360 <p> Cheddersmojo - I 'd be very " leary " ( to say the least ) of a $360 Galil kit , with barrel . But it all comes down to how much your willing to spend on your Galils . But , me personally , I want the very best parts , no compromises . That barrel is probably junk , and the kits probably not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good plus , to near excellent Galil ARM kit , get one from 24 Hour Tactical . Not cheap , but honestly worth it , to me anyway . Full kit , no barrel . Go with CNC-Warrior for the receiver , not cheap , but well worth the cost . The only barrels I 'd consider are real IMI barrels ( 1-7 preferably ) , or ( better yet ) a Jeff Miller - Douglas Stainless steel barrel , in you choice of twist , length , diameter , whatever . For the very best , new or near new parts , you 'd have to source them individually most likely , again , 24 Hour Tactical has Excellent individual parts too . Avoid those Green Mountain barrels , unless you really ca n't afford better . They run that rifling machine of those barrels long after they should have replaced the cutters , to save money , and the rifling half way through the run of barrels is good for shit . Do n't recall the numbers on the barrel outside diameter , or the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little smaller , press fit , of course . ( I know that 's no help ) Yes , you could " mike " it yourself , ( if I remembered those numbers ! ! ) <p> Yes , you could make a cheaper build with the AWO/ORF receiver , GM barrel , and a $360 parts kit , and have Jeff check the receiver for Rockwell hardness ( which nobody else does ) , prior to the build , maybe you 'll get lucky , but there 's still that out of spec ( probably ) right rail , that 's just a little to long , so it starts to " mushroom " . That 's no small issue , you do want both bolt lugs contacting fully , with the receiver rails when locked in , do n't let anyone tell you otherwise . I do n't think all of the AWO/ORF receivers have that out of spec rail issue , but the three I 've owned did . They 're not all heat treated poorly either , but many are , and if there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heat treated to the proper hardness . <p> Get the 24 Hour Tactical ARM kit , the CNC-W receiver , find a new , real , IMI barrel ( not easy , so be real careful , a lot of scamming liers out there , learn the difference ) , or have Jeff make you up a custom Douglas barrel , and have Jeff do the whole build . You wo n't be sorry . <p> As AresShrike said , do n't skimp on good parts , or you may find yourself learning as I have that there are times in life you can not afford to be cheap . $360 is pretty skeptical with barrel . For ARM kits , it looks like John @ 24hourtactical is the only game in town unless you find the rare listing on gunbroker . They had one I was following that end yesterday that was missing the bolt , looked pretty well rusted up with a barrel welded &amp; plugged on both ends so you would not be sure you could use the flash hider . Sold for $680 . Johns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bipod . Having just purchased one of his ARM kits a month ago ( Just to get the Gas block after being Blackthorned ) I can say the like new kits are all gone . He does have great individual parts though . The kits are still good , but my SAR kits from Numrich I bought 5 months ago were in better condition &amp; really great shape ( YMMV ) . They are de-milled with receiver pieces . If you can find a true AR ( not SAR as Apex sells ) gas block , Jeff can mod it to look like the Blackthorn style . He is doing this for one of my builds . <p> Best of luck in your search . If you or anyone needs some parts , bi-pods , Muzzle breaks &amp; a bunch of left over kit parts let me know . 
@@77050799 @5750799/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Polish PPS-43C pistol <p> I ended up getting one of these and have some mixed feelings about it . I understand these are inexpensive , but I do see videos of them running and testimonials of the running . <p> Anyways , this is what happened when I got mine : -I first off , cleaned the gun and noticed the barrel was crudded up , but the rest seemed pretty clean ( I worried the corrosive ammo they used in test firing did this. ) -I took 50 rounds of S&amp;B and 4 magazines . -One magazine likes to jam ( I can bend the feedlips later ) -The first 20 rounds , the gun was like a bolt action rifle ( it would fire , but would not move the bolt back more then a half inch , as I watched video playback ) -I oiled up , on the hammer face , rear of the bolt and just a little on the extractor , working it back and forth ) -It would then fire a couple in a row ( I was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ) -I then by the last 30 had two 5 shot strings . <p> So , I left the range and noted this : It is shortstroking , and maybe the hammer face being all gritty is culprit . Then I clean it thorough and lube it . <p> Today 's range visit : -I bring another 50 rounds of S&amp;B ammo. -I only shoot the 3 good mags . -It fired two strings of 5 rounds perfect . -It then has the problem of the bolt is either not resetting the hammer , or shortstroking once again , although this time it is letting the bolt move enough back to eject the empty and feed a new round ... ( I would pull the trigger , it fires , but then the next trigger pull does not drop the hammer . It is already in the forward position and the live round is in the chamber with sometimes a light strike and sometimes nothing ) -I also experienced a new problem . I would charge the gun , loading a new round , and then pull the trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . -So , I take the bolt out and notice when I press on the firing pin , it is stuck . Really stuck , I had to press on it very hard to move it . Once moved , it was free , but if you press it in , it is once again stuck ! -What is even worse , is I have to press on the firing pin face to get it to get it unstuck . It stuck in the forward AND back position ! ! ! -Something is binding the firing pin up , either the pin itself has a burr , the bolt has a burr , or the cross pin holding in the firing pin has a burr ! -I noted that when the pin was in the correct position , it would stick more when rotated so the U shaped cut in the FP was so that it touches the cross pin . -This stinks , and it is because when I moved the FP so that it is centered , it always rotates when firing and does it anyways . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfering or the bolt has some burr that in certain rotational positions that the FP sits , makes it stick . <p> So , now I have : -shortstroking here and there -a firing pin or firing pin channel that randomly makes it impossible to pop primers depending on it 's mood ( gets stuck randomly ) -a hammer face that is very gritty ( does not help cycling ) <p> I hear people say that the hammer not resetting it because the FCG is too low , and to shim the front end up a penny thick worth of material to reset the hammer a little earlier ... But , when I hand cycle the bolt , it always resets the hammer . I say it is binding somewhere , and the hammer could be the culprit , or at least part of it . <p> I know one other post somewhere else talked about a sticking firing pin , and he fixed it by removing the FP and honed the channel . This seemed to fix it for him . <p> I am going to call IO tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a dremel and work on this , they will void the warranty and it wont guarantee that this will fix this gun . Perhaps the trunion is misaligned or something more drastic is preventing this gun from working right . It says it is a one year warranty , and I hope they do n't talk to me about " how much it will cost to fix " and just say we are sending a return label and will fix it ASAP . <p> Anyone else have one of these and have any good or bad to say about the PPS-43C ? <p> I pondered about the ammo , as I was worried it was more for the CZ52 or Tokarev . I seen some videos where people shot their PPS-43C with S&amp;B though . Either their guns are more broken in , or it is just that mine has a few things needing attention . I agree with you though , it is n't running out of the box and I should have the manufacturer fix it . <p> I 'll say one good thing , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole . I hope they do n't swap me with one that shoots but ca n't hit the broadside of a barn . Lol ! <p> I called the mfg and the number is not in service , and then I called IO and they are moving their facility and wo n't take calls until August 1st . I hope IO can do something about this as I am pretty disappointed . <p> I have a PPS as well . After I worked on it , it 's been ok . There 's still a few things I do n't like about it once I got past the firing pin lockup . The top receiver latch sometimes comes loose . And that hammer is TINY . I 've seen other pics of the hammer breaking in some guns . But I 've heard it was from bump firing . I certainly would n't dry fire it though . <p> The sticking firing pin honestly scares the crap out of me . The PPS-43 was a open bolt . The bolt in the gun is actually the same bolt from the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking bar . If you 're running hotter surplus ammo ( that 's what I run ) . The potential is there for a run away . Especially given the fact there 's no bolt lock for it . <p> I have one that was a problem child when I first got it . Runs 100% now using romy and bulgy surplus . <p> I had 2 majors issues : -Hammer would not always reset . -Weak ejection , where the case barely made it out of the receiver and many times got hung up inside the receiver . <p> Fixed the hammer follow by adding a couple of thin washers under the FCG group ( very easy ) . This raises it just a tad , but that 's all it needs . <p> I determined the weak ejection was due to a weak extractor spring ( could move it with my finger ) . I figured most of the surplus springs would not be any better than mine and with no source of new springs I took another small spring out of my parts bin that fit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAL spring ) , cut it down as a shim and forced the old weak spring back in on top of it . This made a very stiff extractor . Worked great and now throws brass 20 feet . No more cases getting caught insde the receiver . <p> I also made a new buffer out of a peice of leather . <p> Also ran it dryer , than before , with just a light sheen of oil on the bolt . <p> Last 2 times I 've taken it out its run great ( about 400 rounds so far ) . <p> Here is a question : While I understand that the shim will raise the FCG , thus make the hammer reset earlier ... My question is , why does it help ? The reason I ask , is that when I hand cycle the bolt , it 100% of the time resets the hammer . <p> But ... when it shoots , it sometimes does not . <p> So , my conclusion is , the bolt never went far back enough to reset it . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun that cause too much abrasion and friction , they need honed . Or , it needs hot ammo . <p> I noticed the inside of the receiver getting really rubbed hard by the bolt . The bolt has the cut out on top so an SMG bolt wont fit . The cut is very rough as they milled it and never honed it . <p> I just worry that when I crack out my dremil to hone the face of the hammer , the top milled part of the bolt and the firing pin channel on the bolt ... my warranty is gone . There is a chance that all my tinkering will land me a gun that still wo n't work . <p> It does give me hope that you said your PPS was problematic and then after using Romy and Bulgy ammo , it is running right . <p> I love this gun , for what it can be . I was blown away at how it shot through the same hole and it is comfortable to aim and shoot . Now if I can just get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun to teach people how to clear a weapon . Just kidding , I hope this thing will get fixed . <p> Are you making sure you 're gripping the gun strong enough ? In other words : when shooting are you stopping the recoil ? This may sound weird but I 've seen people shoot pistols and getting stove pipes all the time and then when they let me shoot , nothing is wrong . I think they call it limb wrist shooting in English ? If you move too much in line with the recoil , the bolt slows down and maybe does n't go back far enough to reset the hammer . <p> IO 's customer support has been very lacking . That 's why I tore into the gun . Well , that and I 'm a FFL . I had problems as well with S&amp;B ammo , but no short stroking or feed issues from surplus ammo . I have n't crono'ed it , but I suspect the S&amp;B is n't as hot as the surplus . <p> I would only very lightly polish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it 's already thin design . I would work on opening up the blocking bar channel there . Firing pin channel and pin as well . <p> -I am holding the PPS43C tightly , and I even bench rested it . It is also oiled up a lot more than I would do on any firearm . When I oiled it up , it started to give me more shots in a row than when it was given the standard oiling . <p> -I am hoping that the company 's move to Florida had something to do with their lacking customer service . I did hear that on August 1st , they should be good to go with taking calls , but it of course does not mean everyone is settled in . On Thursday , I will give them a call and see what is what . Hopefully they honor the one year warranty . If not , the dremil is coming out . <p> Thank you guys for the input , hearing all of this is helping me out and hopefully others that are in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of analysis and input : -The top of the bolt where it is milled to clear the receiver blocking bar has too much abrasiveness . Needs honed ... -The face of the hammer is also too abrasive . Needs honed ... -The channel for which the firing pin resides has burrs . Needs honed ... <p> I finally got a hold of I.O. , and they are telling me : -There will be no return label . I have to pay for shipping . -I wo n't pay for return shipping though . But , the return form I must fill out says I need to give them my CC info as I am agreeing on the form to pay for return shipping ! -I am told I ' might ' have to pay for repairs . That is depending on the problems , but it is a new gun and I caused none of the problems so I doubt I would have to . <p> So ... I am feeling a little jipped right now . <p> I can : Hone the stuff myself ... but run the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out a warranty and have to pay shipping , repair and return shipping . Send it in ... pay shipping , and most likely return shipping along with a month to a month and a half return time . <p> I know they are going by procedure . I know they ca n't authorize me to hone stuff and still keep the warranty . But in the end ... this just sucks . I bought the gun , expected it to work and now no matter what ... I will have to pay more to get it to run right . How fair is that ? <p> I took it out again this weekend , and me hand cycling it like 1000 times helped , but it just make it shortstroke less ... I also hand cycled the firing pin 1000 times and it only helped prevent light to no primer strikes for the first 25 rounds ... <p> This says to me , the gun really does have binding problems . I am still not 100% decided as to fix this myself or send it in . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out , I ca n't fix that . <p> I am going to call and see if I can just send the bolt back . That way it is $7 to ship and if they fix the firing pin problem , that is the worst of the problems . The gun will most likely wear its way in with the shortstroking.

But the pin does not go out the other side so I can punch and flare it .... Any thoughts ? I do n't have a welder unfortunately ....

Here 's the difference . <p> The UZI Pistol <p> Again looking towards the American commercial market , IMI designed a scaled down version of the UZI and sold it without a stock as a pistol . Action Arms began selling it in 1984 . The UZI Pistol fires from a closed bolt and used the same fire control assembly as the semi automatic UZI carbine , but is fitted into a slightly different shaped grip frame to fit the smaller sized receiver . Action Arms imported the UZI pistol into the United States in both 9mm and .45 ACP , along with caliber conversion kits between these two calibers and .41 AE . Action Arms discontinued importation of the .45 ACP version of the UZI pistol in 1989 but continued selling the 9mm version until 1993 when federal legislation put an end to it . When the trigger guard was changed to an angular style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the UZI Pistol . While it provided little benefit to the semi automatic pistol , it reduced production costs by using the same grip frame on the two guns . Since all Micro UZI 's imported into the United States were for law enforcement use only , some people converted UZI Pistols into Micro UZI 's . Any transferable Micro UZI actually started life as an UZI Pistol . <p> The Micro UZI <p> In 1986 , IMI introduced the Micro UZI - a full auto version of the UZI Pistol . Less than 10 inches long with the stock folded , the Micro UZI provided the ultimate in compact firepower . It was intended mainly for security roles , providing more potent fire power in a handgun frame weapon . Another role intended for the Micro UZI was as a Personal Defense Weapon ( PDW ) for airborne and armored crew personnel in the IDF .

Known as the Para Micro UZI or the UZI Pro , it was made especially to meet the operational needs of the Israeli Special Forces ( SF ) Counter Terror ( CT ) units . <p> Today , the Micro UZI is mainly being used by the rappelling and fast roping sections of the Israeli CT units . These elements need a compact gun to allow them ease of movement in tight spaces , yet a more powerful weapon then the average handgun . The new Para Micro UZI comes custom made to answer these demands , and is in active deployment in the Israeli CT units . <p> The Para Micro UZI features several new important improvements compare to the old version , reflecting the changes in modern firearms since the first Micro UZI was produced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration of a standard M1913 Picatinny rail to an IMI product .

Thus , an operator using the UZI only had a handful of accessories to pick from that he can mount on his weapon . The introduction of the Picatinny rail , a world standard in many different common firearms ( M16 , MP5 , and FN Minimi to name a few ) opened endless accessories ' mounting options on the Para Micro UZI . The rail has been placed on both the receiver ( mainly to host various day and night optics ) , and on a special arm extending under the barrel ( mainly to host flashlights and laser pointers ) . <p> The entire pistol grip and magazine well have been redesign . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 rounds magazines , as well as a special 33 rounds Glock like magazine .

Reliability can be improved by throating and polishing the ramp . <p> The Semi Automatic Ramp : <p> When IMI prepared a semi automatic version of the UZI for the United States , they made several minor design changes aimed at making it harder to convert the guns into select fire weapons . One of the changes was to weld in a new feed ramp that had a restrictor ring attached to it . The smaller size of the restrictor ring ( along with the smaller hole in the trunion ) prevented the UZI SMG barrels from being used in the semi automatic UZI 's .

@@77050804 @5750804/ <p> The early style Group Industries .22LR bolts are a two part bolt that in some ways resemble a 9mm closed bolt or possibly an IMI .22LR bolt for the semi auto UZI . The outer piece is a heavy steel bolt that does not move during firing . It does retract during cocking , pushing the inner bolt back , and is returned to the forward position by a return spring that is very similar to the recoil spring on a FA UZI . The inner bolt acts much like the carrier on a closed bolt UZI configuration . It has a moveable firing pin that moves forward as the bolt closes on the chamber . The return spring on the inner bolt is quite stiff and combined with the light weight of the inner bolt results in a rate of fire around 1500 RPM .

@@77050806 @5750806/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> DOE Subgun Upper Completed <p> Hey guys , I 've wanted a DOE upper since I bought my Colt RR . They were always too much money even for a rough one . I parted out a Colt 9mm LEO carbine just before the ban ended . I basically sold the parts for what I paid for the carbine and got to keep the barrel . I finally found some DOE/M231 hand guards on the EE . They were pricey but that was the key to get the upper . " tonyk " at AR15.com/subguns.com had some excellent advice about having Garrison Manufacturing building his DOE upper . I did n't get my hand guards as cheap as he did , but the cost of the other parts more than made up for it . I had Kent at Garrison cut down and recrown the Colt barrel to DOE specs . He added his copy of the DOE FSB and hand guard cap . I must say Kent did a great job . <p> Here are a couple of pictures of the complete DOE upper on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used KNS stainless steel FC pins and had M60Joe ramp the bolt . I 'm also using the lighter AAC spring from their rate reducing kit with an Enidine hydraulic buffer . I got a " Q " buffer made by " Slash " . I 'll compare that to the Enidine . I 'll post a range report after I sight it in . I think this is as close as I can get to a Colt factory 9mm subgun that I can get without paying a SOT . Thanks again to Tony and Kent . <p> Nice ! ! I 've always liked the DOE setup as well . But I like the option of using a suppressor and can never justify to myself to spend that kind of money and not have the suppressed option . I know I could have the barrel threaded or longer w/ a 3 lug but then it 's not an original looking setup anymore .... so I just do without ... Congrats and let us know how it shoots . I 'm guessing you 'll like the AAC spring w/ the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is my understanding that in the 80 's the Department of Energy asked Colt to make a shorter barreled version of the 10.5 " 9mm submachinegun to protect Nuclear Plants . Colt shorten the barrel to 7 " and created a fold down front sight and used the hand guards from a port firing M231 M16 . The port firing M16 was mounted on the door on the back of armored personnel carriers . <p> Colt did n't receive any other orders for the extra short subguns . In the 90 's Colt cleared out all the remaining parts for these uppers by putting them together and selling them as uppers . I guess some of the uppers were shipped with cracked or chipped hand guards . Original DOE uppers are quite expensive . The least I have seen one advertised was $1,100 . The hand guards had a little crack and a couple of small chips . The highest price that I have seen was $1,400 for an upper that was supposed to be new in the Colt factory box . <p> Kent at Garrison wrote me " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand guards that we had made . They are a one piece design made of delrin . I should have pictures soon . They will run in the $150 range . " I paid a little over $200 just for the set of original hand guards . They are made from the same hard black stuff that Colt standard hand guards are made from . The aluminum heat shields are riveted in like A1 hand guards are . <p> So I 've ended up with a like new DOE repro upper for a $150 worth of work and new made parts plus the parts I already had . I have n't sighted the upper in yet , but I 'm sure it 'll shoot fine . The sight radius is shorter , but the local monthly subgun matches here in Vegas are usually at 15 yards . <h> Very nice ! ! ! <p> I also like the look of the DOE uppers better than the 10.5 " Colt model 635 SMG models . Now that I have a M16 myself again I am going to look for a dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the Spikes Tactical dedicted uppers wich look good but I do not know how well they function . Where I was not on the forums ( due to health reasons ) I do not know of anything new as far as uppers for the M16 that has come out and is worth getting . 180 22LR uppers ? , ? , ? . <p> Range report : It shot great ! I added a KNS cross hair sight . It made centering the front sight so much easier . I was amazed that with as short a sight radius as the upper has , my groups were pretty tight . I also updated the grip and stock Here is a picture . <p> I normally use an AAC light RR buffer spring and an Enidine hydraulic buffer for 9mm that " amphibian " suggested . I got a " Slash " " Q " buffer in a package deal . The " Q " buffer is a little longer than a standard 9mm buffer and quite a bit heavier . The " Q " buffer was too heavy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short stroke . It would eject the shell and strip a new round but did n't go back far enough to cock the hammer . With the Enidine , it ran smooth and very well . <p> Overall I 'm very happy with the performance of the upper . This would be as close as I can get to a Colt DOE subgun without paying a SOT . The upper is great fun . I wish I had gotten one a long time ago . But going the route I did , it was certainly less money . Thank you fore the words of encouragement . <p> Now that Garrison will be doing replica handguards , I think I 'm going to build a setup like this but since it wo n't be totally " correct " I think I 'm going to do a 3 lug setup . Thanks for making me spend more money .... <p> Well , I do n't know as I would bother putting a 3-lug on it . The can would make the upper longer than a standard subgun upper . To me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A1 sights with no provision for a way to add optics , other than a rail on top of the carry handle . I choose to leave it stock . If you want to go the 3-lug route , I would build and upper like this : <p> I used a TROS 5.5 " three lug barrel and a YHM mid-length rail on a RRA 9mm upper . When used with my Gem-Tec Raptor , it gives a " SD " kind of appearance . The mid-length gives me the longest iron sight radius , but still allows me to grab the end of the can for installation and removal . I plan to have the upper reanodized gray to match my Colt lower . <p> I 've built many uppers just like that . In fact , I was one of the first to do so years ago . The first one I did was before rail systems even existed . It was a custom larger diameter free float tube w/ an I 'd greater than 2 " to go over the MK9K which has a 2 " diameter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to suppress everything . <p> Kent 's email address is garrisonmfginc@aol.com which would be the best way to contact him . He said that he would have some " repro " hand guards soon . He said that the hand guards would be $150 . I 'm very happy with the work he did for me . <p> I 've got an MP5 . While I think the DOE upper on my Colt 9mm lower with the sear installed is cool , it is not quite as smooth as the MP5 . To me the reduced mass of the HK delayed roller blow back system is smoother than the Colt direct blow back system . Although with an AAC reduced power spring and Enidine hydraulic buffer the Colt comes close . I think the Colt has the looks but the HK has the function .

@@77050816 @5750816/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> To buy a Colt M16A1 or not ? <p> I have been tempting myself with picking up a transferable Colt M16A1 . I would really like one but the fact that they are in the $13K price range kills me . Its not a question if I can afford it or not . I 'm just not sure that any firearm is worth that much money . I already own several full auto 's to include a post sample Bushmaster . I have several semi AR 's also . I had thought about selling off a couple of my duplicate full auto 's to pay for the M16A1 . I doubt that I would shoot it anyway because of its value . Any more , I do n't shot any of my transferables . I only shoot the post samples . <p> A Colt M16A1 was my first MG back in 2002 . Then I thought the $7500 asking price was absolutely nuts , but it was my holy grail . I had the chance to buy a NIB for the same price , but I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more MGs and some suppressors , but the A1 is still my favorite . I also sold all my semi-auto 5.56s . The Colt has a switch for that . <p> You have an option I do n't , the posties to shoot . I might not have bought the transferrable M16 if I was in your position .

I was under the impression that the original manufacture can recast the receiver with same numbers as long as it was a factory gun and not a conversion is these true ? ? ? ? <p> As far as my understanding of the NFA act of 1934 goes . It did not have provisions to allow for replacement of demaged or destroyed MG receivers in the law .

Without the slots , I feel your choice of stocks is going to be very limited without modifying the receiver . <p> I recieved this email in truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cobray " brand is nonexistant . <p> Yes , it 's true . <p> Many people loosely refer to any one of the many manufacturers , calibers , and sizes of these semi auto pistols , semi auto carbines and full auto submachine guns as " MACs " . MAC is an abbreviation for Military Armament Corporation . It was a name bought from Donald G. Thomas by Mitch Werbell of Sionics fame and the Ingram name was dropped from the Model 10 and Model 11 subguns and the MAC name was substituted . FWIW , the MAC name can be found on at least some of the guns mane by MAC , RPB , Texas MACs , &amp; SWD . There 's a story behind each one that I wo n't address here as it 's long and convoulted . The bottom line is a M12 was never made by any of the companies bearing the " MAC " name . There WERE some semi auto M11s but no M12s . <p> Now as to the Cobray logo ; Well , it 's just that , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " COBRAY " even though there were many companies that manufactured guns bearing the Cobray logo . <p> Bottom line is you do n't own a MAC 12 Cobray . What you probably own is a SWD Model 12 .380 semi auto pistol OR a LIENAD Model 12 semi auto pistol . Both of these have the Cobray logo but they are not and have never been registered as Cobray weapons . I consider them in the " MAC " family , but the correct nomenclature is SWD M-12 or SWD Model 12 providing that SWD was the manufacturer . <p> I understand that the so called MAC-12 is supposed to be the M-11/380 . Leinad does label theirs as the M-12 , which could just mean model 12 . <p> The original line-up of MAC weapons did have the .380 caliber M-11/9 Kurtz ( .380 ) <p> Cobray 's M-11/9 is not a MAC . It is obviously a design copy . Yes there are differences but it is not a proprietary design . <p> Cobray made the first ' closed ' bolt M-12s . These seem to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more complexity to the design ( reliability wise ) but honestly for how many M-11/9 semis I have owned and shot , they were 100% reliable . I even bought an MPA version and it too was 100% reliable . <p> Leinad is the key here . Their PM series is some scary copies of the M-11/9 and M-12 . I hear of barrels bursting due to over heat treatment , and parts cracking . I also know their manufacturing and assembly is not consistent as Cobray . <p> I owned a Leinad Skorpion and it was junk . It worked for 100 rounds and the safety broke off . I got a new safety and then the firing pin broke . It started jamming really badly after 200 rounds . <p> I had a Leinad double barrel .410 and one of the firing pin channels was too tight . This caused too much tension in where the ball bearing that transferred the hammer 's energy to the firing pins , the ball bearing started to unevenly wear and started binding up the other firing pin . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which upset me . I really liked the idea of a .410/45LC Derringer , and I might get another even though this happened . I will hone the firing pin channels next time . <p> Anyways , it is all about Leinad when it comes to jams , and barrels exploding . <p> I have not seen any problems with Cobray . So if you have a semi-auto M-11/380 , it should be fine . Just make sure the mags are not damaged , as the zytels are easy to damage . <p> If you want the best ' semi ' .380 , quality wise , the open bolt RPB is the one to get . <p> The only problem with the semi-auto OB guns I have had is they have a bad trigger pull for a pistol . But they are FUN ! <p> Bottom line is you do n't own a MAC 12 Cobray . What you probably own is a SWD Model 12 .380 semi auto pistol OR a LIENAD Model 12 semi auto pistol . Both of these have the Cobray logo but they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider them in the " MAC " family , but the correct nomenclature is SWD M-12 or SWD Model 12 providing that SWD was the manufacturer . <p> In between the SWD and Leinad timelines there is also the M12 made by FMJ in Ducktown , TN . The SWD and FMJ guns are considered " preban " , while the Leinads are usually stamped " PM12 " for postban , referring to the 1994 Crime Bill . Regarding the semi auto 's , it is generally accepted among Ingram style gun owners that the SWD and FMJ preban guns are the better quality weapons , while the PM guns need a little tweeking to get them to run properly .

At 200 yards my M4-2k shifts POI down about 3 " and right about 1 " <p> As I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bore of the suppressor , escaping gas will create pressures unevenly on the exiting bullet causing a bit of a shift . <p> Suppressors often also cause something called " free bore boost " which is about a 15-30 feet persecond increase in velocity .

@@77050827 @5750827/ <p> I heard somewhere that you can use a buffer of some type ( CDNN sells them ) that speeds up the cyclic rate of an uzi . Is this true ? <p> RoverDave <p> 02-25-2003 , 12:20 PM <p> Yes , a recoil buffer ( block of plastic that goes in the back of the receiver ) can increase the rate of fire by reducing the distance the bolt has to travel . You can buy a semi-auto buffer and use it in a full auto by trimming it down . The semi buffer is too long and wo n't let the bolt come back far enough to release the catch on a full auto ratchet cover . <p> pmf <p> 02-25-2003 , 12:30 PM <p> What change in cyclic rate are we talking about here . Is it worth the trouble ? Dangerous ? Hard on the gun ? <p> JIMBO <p> 02-25-2003 , 01:38 PM <p> pmf- <p> Am I understanding your question about cyclic rate ? What is it ? Cyclic rate in broad terms is the number of rounds per minute a FA weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weapon that is belt fed to be able to shoot a whole minute nonstop . You can figure the cyclic rate of a weapon , 16 , 20 , 32 rounds at a time . The buffer is similar to a recoil buffer you would put in a 1911 pistol . In that application the recoil buffer eliminates the metal to metal contact thus lessening fatigue on the frame and slide but not changing the return rate appreciably . In the UZI the idea is the same but the buffer is actually a " spacer " that shortens the distance the bolt must travel , thus speeding up the bolts ability to cycle rearward to extract the empty shell and return forward stripping a round from the magazine and loading it in the chamber . And on and on and on . Hope this helps.:uzi <p> Richard Cranium <p> 02-25-2003 , 01:49 PM <p> I made my own buffer by taking a 1/8 " soft rubber and trimming the outline of the hard phenolic recoil pad that holds the recoil spring .

Just ask Nick Burns , my company computer guy . <p> Tucson Dick <p> pmf <p> 02-25-2003 , 04:31 PM <p> I 've read that an uzi has a cyclic rate of around 700 rounds per minute . So if you had a 700 round mag , you could fire it all off in a minute . A better way to think of this is around 700/60=12 rounds per second . People complain this is slow . I have no idea since I do not have my uzi yet . So would a buffer appreciably speed this up is the question . <p> Deanh <p> 02-25-2003 , 05:33 PM <p> Yes , putting in a cut down semi buffer speeds the ROF up a lot .

Seems kind of silly does n't it . <p> Well it comes from places like Knob Creek subgun match where they set up a submachinegun match where the targets are 5 " diameter round disks at 50yds away . In this case a single shot is better suited but is that the type of target that a submachinegun was really designed to encounter ? <p> Try going to an IPSC style subgun match when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handgun encounter ranges . Multiple targets to engage and that slow rate of fire is really going to slow you down . Speed the gun up to around 900 and a tiny tap of the trigger and 3 pellets burn into the target before you can call them back , small tap and swing to the next target , slow rate of fire and you have to wait for the gun to cycle , anything slower than around 750 and a semi auto handgun is faster to engage multiple targets with . There is usually plenty of movement time so plenty of time to change magazines . <p> If an army of 5 " plates ever attack you from a football field away then slow rate of fire is the cat 's meow . If your CQB requirements might be multiple targets at close range then waiting for a turtle to double tap for you might not be the answer . <p> By putting in the semi buffer and milling off some extra weight from the bolt I got mine up to 833rpm . <p> I have heard stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , buffer them up and aproaching 1800 rpm . <p> I have a mini bolt but it needs the feed lip welded up before I can try it . <p> amphibian <p> 02-26-2003 , 06:15 PM <p> David , I have both the MINI and Full size Uzi .

Regards Alan ( Doc ) 10-22 ON USING THE MINI BOLT ON : patriot THE FULL SIZE UZI ( SMG ) : uzi : mg <p> Top Cat <p> 03-11-2003 , 04:08 PM <p> You can use a converted semi bolt to increase cyclic rate . Turns your registered subgun into a closed bolt fullsize with a cyclic rate of about 1400 rpm ( guess ) . runs faster than a MAC . Of course you need the buffer and semi topcover to make it work . <p> askimball <p> 03-11-2003 , 04:21 PM <p> OK , Now what do you have to do to the semi-bolt ? ? Do you have any pics ? ? ? <p> Regards : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Paul556 <p> 03-13-2003 , 04:02 PM <p> I believe all you have to do is weld the lower lip back on the bolt face and remove the striker safety . D&amp;D Sales ( http : //www.uziusa.com/ ) can do the mods to a full auto bolt for about $80 . Then you have to buy a semi strike assembly . I have thought about doing a Swiss chease job like a bolt , but then fill the holes with lead to slow it down . I wanted to do that to a .45 bolt to make it run the same speed as the 9mm . So many things to do with these little guns . <p> That is correct about the lower lip , but you also need to clearance the bolt for the subgun ejector , and the subgun extractor MUST be installed or you will get ejection failures . I never took the striker safety off mine and it ran fine , but I suppose it could n't hurt . You can also cut back the buffer to slow it down a little and make it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chinese bolt as they are much softer metal . It would probably be a good idea to anneal the bolt first and then have it recasehardend after , but I never did it to mine and I ran hundreds of rounds through it . One of the coolest things about this mod. is that accuracy is dramatically improved on the first shot , due to lower inertia of the striker compared to the inertia of the whole bolt . <p> Paul556 <p> 03-13-2003 , 04:44 PM <p> Good points Top Cat . Careful on cutting the buffer though . I cut one on a semi to try and improve reliability and I cut it too far . The bolt slammed the back of the reciever . With no buffer it actually brused my sholder it slammed so hard . I realised it after a mag or two , so no damage was done to the gun . <p> Top Cat <p> 03-13-2003 , 05:29 PM <p> I only took about 1/4 inch off of mine . Slowed it down some but not a lot . It was more reliable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't believe the mag . was ever keeping up with the extreamly fast cyclic rate , but it usually did .

The police in the US are finding out that the M4 is to much for small spaces and a subgun is a much better choice .

@@77050836 @5750836/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Review of 4 .50 bmg rifles , as requested by some members . <p> Some of you in the last few threads have asked about .50 bmg rifles , their performance , price , feel ... ect . I will give you my honest and unbiased opinion on the more common rifles . I have shot numerous .50 's , everything to the low priced ar-15 .50bmg uppers to the ultra expensive EDM Windrunner , and barrett m82 's . I just want to let everyone know in the world of .50 bmg not everything is what as it seems . I currently own a Barrett M95m bolt action repeater , a Barrett m991-a1 ( a short bbl version of the single shot m99 ) A Serbu firearms BFG carbine , and the armalite AR-50 . Each of these guns have pros and cons , however all are worthy of your money , it just depends how much you want to blow . <p> I first want to say , that .50 bmg is a totally different animal than anything else . I have mentioned here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles . As a weld failure , an oob , or any other kaboom would be catastrophic to you the shooter , as well as people next to you . So when you buy a .50 buy as much .50 as you can . Stay clear away from cheap rifles , especially the VULCAN/HESSE V50 's they are pipe bombs that look like rifles ! I have witnessed a receiver crack in person on one of these guns . Stay away if you value life and your arms . Remember you are firing a 660-750+grain bullet with a few hundred grains of powder , there is no other cartridge like it , it will fuck you up . You want a gun that is built strong with excellent welding , weight and fit and finish , you want something that can take the high pressures of a kaboom , and still have the shooter walk away . <p> The barrett m95/m95m . These are bolt action repeaters fed from an 5 round mag , in a true bull pup configuration . Cost $5000-6000 without optics , extra mags about $75-100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive for a military weapon . The action is very smooth , never hangs up and is very safe , using three locking lugs . The trigger , is good not great but good , little creep , nice and crisp but tad on the heavy side , for me anyways . It has a prince .50 bipod built into the front of the gun , which is also compatible with a m60 . The bipod is sturdy and can be taken completely off with one pull-pin for bench shooting , or if your daring enough to shoulder fire it , as the folded bi-pod can get in the way when shoulder firing . Accuracy , i shoot all kinds of ammo in it , my 95 has a hybrid bbl , it will eat match and surplus ammo and function well . However , the gun is No tac driver . Accuracy is a bit wanting , even with expensive ammo i usually score about 1.5-2inch groups at 200-300 hundred yards . REMEMBER this is an antimaterial rifle , not made for pinpoint accuracy it is ultra tough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammo well , it is a true military weapon . it is not accurate enough to shoot 1000yard comps with it but , remember it was never intended to do that . The recoil is like a 12ga shotgun with heavy loads , the butt of the barrett has a nice rubber pad on it which is easy on the body . The muzzle blast is WILD though ! being a bullpup you will experience a blast of warm gas on your face , and it will blow everything off your bench and your neighbors bench . The barrett m991a-1 is barretts new single shot , it is laid out in the traditional format using a three lug locking pattern . This gun has the smoothest action i have ever shot ! Also it loads quicker than the m95 . To load it all you do is throw a round in front of the bolt , there is no lining up or anything just simply throw it in there , it loads very fast , faster than the mag fed . Mine has the new three chamber break , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built mostly for law enforcement , has a 29inch fluted bbl , and will accept all types of commercial match and surplus ammo . Barrett claims the m99 is the most accurate barrett , which is sort of correct . The standard m99 has a 32inch bbl , while the m991-a1 has a shorter 29incher. same as the 95 is the quick detach bipod . The 99s also have a generous optics rail . The accuracy from my m991-a1 i experience is about the same as the 95. the trigger is about the same , recoil a bit less . It is very comfortable to shoot , and looks awesome . The whole gun is milled , unlike the 95 and the 82 which uses some stamped parts . The 99 looks awesome , and you could detonate a bomb inside of it and it will hold . I 've seen these for $3000-3500 . I paid $3500 for mine and it came with a leupold 4.5-14x 30mm mk4 . <p> The armalite ar-50 is a single shot bolt action priced about $2400 is a very heavy long big gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have seen . But all that weight equates to a really soft recoil , like a 30-06 , or .303 brit . The muzzle brake is the most efficient in reducing recoil , but has the largest muzzle blast out of the group . You will knock shit off your neighbors bench with it , it will blow the hat off your head as well . Accuracy wise I get the best results with it , it is a real driver . It shoots better than I do . I can shoot half inch or even better with some of the match ammo . The action is smooth , but not as smooth or as fast as the barrett bolts . The trigger is more responsive than any of the barretts and slightly smoother . The fit and finish is impressive , but not as impressive as a barrett . It has a black phosphate finish , as opposed to the glossy smooth finish on the barretts . Some of the edges on the rifle are slightly sharp as well . By far this is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cheek rest has a nice feel to it . The gun does not come stock with a bipod , but can be bought from armalite . <p> The serbu rifles are similar to Anzio ironworks , safty harbor firearms , ferret firearms , they are all tube like guns , which originate from the maddi design . The serbu cost about $2000-2200 . They are a good buy . They have the shark , or gilled break which while not as intimidating looking as the barrett or armalite break , its function does rival them . Recoil is about a 20ga with slugs , with manageable muzzle blast , less than the ar-50 . The gun has a thinner profile than any of the other guns , which makes it really maneuverable and easy to shoulder fire . The action is smooth , safe and fast . It is easier to load than the armalite , but not as quick , smooth and easy as the barretts . The only complaint is the trigger , the trigger is a bit unrefined , and creepy , however I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bother me to much . Accuracy wise it is very accurate , it is a sub moa gun . On a good day I can shoot as good as the armalite . The serbu comes in two versions the bfg , and the bfg carbine , the carbine is slightly shorter and lighter . They come with a high rise rail atop the receiver , it is a bit short but I have no problems with it . Mine came with a bipod , as I bought it through a 3rd party , i 'm not shure if they come stock with one . The serbu is the best value out of any .50 for the money , it can not be beat . The welding is excellent and the finish is a grayish/black matte . The gun is safe accurate and is worth every penny . <p> If you really want to piss money you can go for the EDM arms windrunner takedown .

Wherever you have your 10 mm barrel made , they would also need to modify a bolt for 10 mm use . <p> The biggest problem I can see with a 10 mm MAC 10/Lage blow back gun is the power of the ammo to feed the gun . There is a huge variation in the energy of 10 mm ammo . My understanding is you can buy weak 10 mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 450 ft/lbs to carry ammo at over 1,100 ft/lbs . There would be a huge difference in the mass of the bolt to make 450 ft/lbs run or 1,100 ft/lbs run . If the bolt is too light , the shell can rupture and have brass shrapnel spray out the ejection port . If the bolt is to heavy the gun is a single shot or a runaway . Some how I 'm guessing it will be tough to have a 10 mm bolt be too heavy , but time will tell . <p> So what are you looking to get out of a 10 mm subgun ? I 'd think you 'd have to use the weak 10 mm ammo or have a Lage bolt made from tungsten . But whatever ammo you choose , the gun would be " tuned " for that ammo . A little more powerful or a little weaker would be fine . But if the gun was " tuned " for 600 ft/lbs , the 450 ft/lbs or the 800 ft/lb+ stuff wo n't run . This will not be a cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That thread is ten years old . I 've just now emailed Troy to see what it 'll take for him to make a run of M-10/40 conversions . It 's not 10mm , but I 'm very interested in the .40S&amp;W conversion . Who 's interested ? <p> It should n't be an issue . Troy is familiar with what it takes to do this . I 've got a BarrelXchange .40 bolt and barrel for the Uzi . The bolt was made from a 9mm bolt . He just opened up the breach face . I believe it uses a standard 9mm extractor . It runs fine in both 9mm and .40 with this bolt . <p> My only issue is finding magazines for it , since I ca n't find a Mac 10 grip housing .

Nuff said . <p> I took my rifle to a gun smith who let me use his tools and we fixed the problem . <p> Basically we drove out the pins that hold the sight on the barrel . <p> We then slighty moved the sight to line it up . <p> We then located another pin slighty bigger than the orginal and drove it in with a big hammer and large punch . <p> I smashed my finger to hell but the rifle is fixed now and the fix looks almost as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head but they went in and held tight and the sight did not move back . <p> We did not drill a new hole or inlarge the current hole . He basically told me the larger pin would cause the other metal to expand and it would drive in . <p> I think the pin that was in it was 1.20 and we used one that measured 1.22 <p> You know : I have a 7.62X39 krink that came with a crooked front sight . I sent it back NIB and after about 6 months they returned it with a note saying it was within specs . F**k them . One of these days I 'll knock the pins out and fix it with AR taper pins . They are rude over the phone . I really like the gun but I 'm through buying their stuff . <p> I have fixed canted front sight towers many times , especially on Century AK 's . My experience is that it 's not worth all the trouble to send the entire rifle back for this , only to have someone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tap out the two small front retainer pins , but do n't remove them , just let them stick out . Buy or borrow a 1 pound BRASS hammer and tap the sight tower in the direction it needs to go . It is usually not very much needed to get it absolutely vertical . Once satisfied , tap the pins back in . I usually have someone help hold the rifle while I perform the needed blows . Go easy on replacing the small pins as they can be bent over if you are not careful . Buy or borrow a new set of drifts from Brownell 's . <p> Sometimes you may need to heat the FST up a bit to help pop it loose from the barrel . I have used propane torches and high temp heat guns like for stripping paint . Once heated , squirt some penetrating oil under the FST and let it sit for a few minutes . And , go easy on the parts , no need to get them red hot ! haha <p> If needed , touch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real paint like Norrell 's if you have it . But , most of the time , none is needed . If you are obsessed with perfection , then you may want to have it partially refinished by someone who does this sort of thing .

The Gentlemen telling how to fix were on the money and it is n't a very difficult job . I bought a Galil/Golani that was Century built with s few of their negligent building problems but over on the Galil Section of this site gleaned enough fixit info to make it into a keeper . Lots of knowledgable people on here to help us out . <p> I am curious how long is the warranty coverage on that rifle , and when did YOU buy it ? I have always understood that the warranty on an item starts counting when it is first sold and placed into service , not based on when the item was made . If you buy a brand new , leftover 2008 Ford , your 3 year warranty starts counting when YOU bought it .. not when the car was made in 08 ...... <p> I do n't know about Arsenal , but this describes the Century Warranty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen new guns at gunshows being sold &amp; the warranty has already expired . The date of mfg is on the white tag attached to the trigger guard . GARY N4KVE <p> Arsenal 's are excellent AK 's and some of the very best on the market for sure . You did not make any mistake by buying an Arsenal . <p> The older 107 's had this problem as it was widely known on the boards and was batch related . The newer rifles do not have this issue any longer . Arsenal started placing test targets in the later production runs to assure they have corrected this QC issue . <p> Sucks but if it does not have a test target you need to look at it closely for this problem . Pretty much this was with the 107 series . Maybe some 106 's but not sure . <p> I mostly just recomend that people have Will build them one for about the same price . <p> It 'll be better made , and Will 's warrenty is that ' So long as the tank tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . <p> I do n't work there anymore , but he still gets too much of my money ! <p> Will does great work . I 'm expecting my third project back from him any day . However , my first Saiga conversion he did for me had a canted front sight . I called him up and he said no problem and seemed really surprised . Fixed and had it back in no time with a target to show sight in . Good guys who do great work .

It 's a really elegant gun to collect in its pure form and practical to have in certain states .

He did not submit paperwork regarding how the FNC rifle will be modified and if the rifle can be reversed to semi auto if the sear is removed . <p> For example , if you drill the extra sear hole on an AR15 receiver , is it still an AR15 or an M16 ? I believe that ATF will rule that it is an M16 . <p> The ATF is currently try to get a ruling requiring all S&amp;H sears to be married to an FNC rifle or they will confiscate them .

I never had a noticeable problem that was n't shooter error.:roflmao Granted , Different cans , effect some firearms in different ways to some extent , but you should always shoot with and without your " Can " , to see what effects it does have for every firearm it may be attached too . I 'm lucky as my Uzi &amp; MP5 both hit the same place with or without my SWR QD3K can via 3 Lug . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use your silencer last saturday ? My Uzi shoots about 1 inch higher with the silencer when cold , but last sat it got extrmely hot . In order to duplicate the senario I 'd have to waste 5 mags and then shoot a target . I was hoping to avoid that . Jim C <p> Magoo <p> 09-16-2009 , 04:12 PM <p> Hello Jim . No I was n't using a suppressor at the shoot this year . I was n't shooting Sub Sonics . I got to thinking about your 151 's . Did you check your reloads for consistancy ? . If a few got away with a different powder charge or a different OAL , then that could have effected your accuracy . Also , was your suppressor tight when you went to remove it ? .

He still has n't beat Matt 's record ! . HAHAHA ! . <p> jim c 351 <p> 09-17-2009 , 09:40 AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happen when shooting the match or just during a casual plinking session ? I think that Andy B uses a silencer for all matches , so it must not be a problem with all guns and silencers , but maybe its a problem for my combo . I think the Gemtech is aluminium and my Vector is steel , so theoreticaly I should n't have to worry about mine breaking in half . On the other hand my silencer weighs more and might torque the barrel down more when hot . I have to point out that Tom J aka shooter was present shooting a Vector SMG and Vector silencer . Tom did not have a problem , but he is much better than I in getting off 1 shot bursts . I usually get 2-3 shot bursts . So-- I shoot 2-3 times as much ammo . If your brothers incident was captured on video , Please tell me the year so I can look it up on the ISSMC site . What is your opinion on using silencers in matches . Jim C PS problem started after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMG <p> 09-17-2009 , 02:45 PM <p> Brother Evil was using the can on his M-16 9mm setup . The " event " occurred during the stage where you must drop a series of steel targets with a single trigger pull . I think this happened during his 2nd Beta C drum . He was dumping a LOT of rounds down range very quickly so I do n't think it was necessarily the suppressor 's fault . Even full auto rated cans have a breaking or melting point . <p> Suppressors heat up very quickly , but I ca n't imagine a 9mm can getting so hot it changes the POI dramatically . My son-in-law owned a Vector Uzi and Vector can so I have some limited experience with that product . It 's weight should help with any muzzle movement . As you noted , it 's all steel construction and size makes it heavy ... especially toward the end of a match . I can tell you the front sight on my Vector SMG came loose while shooting a stage . I had n't touched or adjusted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess with it ? ) , the threads stripped and it came loose and begin to rotate . If you 're familiar with the model A sights , you can imagine the problem I had . Weird huh ? <p> FWIW , Vector made those cans with 9mm and .45acp baffles . VERY cool baffle stack ! I 'd check the teeth on your can to make sure you 're not missing a tooth which would allow it to loosen up . Also check the barrel nut catch to make sure it 's not worn and allowing the can to loosen . Different ammo can change the POI with a suppressor and you may experience some POI shift with the can as opposed to shooting without the can . My Bowers CAC-9 can with my Vector Uzi actually tighten up the groups just slightly . Your can and ammo combo may move the bullet impact . I 'd try shooting the gun with and without a can and carefully note the results . Most people feel a suppressor helps reduce recoil and the weight does n't hurt unless you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've shot several back to back mags through my Sterling Mk5 during matches with no noticeable impact shift including sweeps . Andy says not to worry about his can 's durability . <p> I 'd be interested in what you determine when the smoke settles ... <p> http : **38;730;TOOLONG <p> Here 's the 2nd stage of last Sunday 's match wich included a mandatory sweep . A couple of us used suppressors . The only issue I had was a bobbled magazine change which cost me a place or two ... <p> MP-5K with Beta C LONG ... LONG ...

The gun and silencer teeth are like new . I always hold the lock down while turning the silencer to prevent wear . Silencer still checked out tight when cooled . Load was 151 gr Rainier at 990 fps , the only load I 've used all year . I bench rested gun ( I know-I know ) with and without silencer at 25 yds , then shot standing - both ways . Like I said above , at the start misses were rare . Problem occurred on the last 10 targets out of 50 . I am old and decrepit , but -------- Sights looked " right " but target did n't go down . You 'll find video of course of fire above under heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subgun match " . That 's me with the M3 . This brings me back to the begining--targets were missed &amp; the silencer and gun were extremely hot . Thanks again Jim C <p> johnnywitt <p> 09-19-2009 , 02:21 AM <p> Cold barrel , hot barrel . Ungassed suppressor , gassed suppressor . Lots of variables . Your POI will shift . Its just a fact of life shooting suppressed . There 's another factor as well- the weight of the silencer hanging off the end of your barrel will cause a different POI due to changing barrel harmonics . You prety much have to decide if the gun will be shot suppressed , or not . Then , sight your gun in for hunting , or precision shooting , with a cold barrel , &amp; ungassed cool suppressor . With a plinking gun , or a FA SMG , sight it in warm/hot because it will get that way fast anyway . The biggest POI change , that I can tell , is with the suppressor removed and then reinstalled ( the heavier the suppressor , the more it affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why you pretty much have to have dedicated suppressed guns . With an UZI , just have multiple topcovers with optics dialed in for different calibers and keep the irons dialed in for whatever config. you shoot the most ( I keep my irons dialed in for .22 unsuppressed ) . Do n't forget to sight in an open bolt subgun without a rest , offhand . <p> dieselten <p> 09-20-2009 , 10:32 AM <p> why do n't you bench it cold , dump a few mags as fast as possible , then immediately bench it hot ?

Jim C <p> MarkV <p> 09-20-2009 , 11:09 AM <p> 4 inches of shift is a lot ; especially at 25-50 yards . Did n't you modify the barrel collar for your vector can a while back ? I remember you thought the standard collar was to loose at 0.010 inch clearance and you wanted it to be only a 0.001 inches of clearance around the barrel ... maybe the tighter collar is making the POI shift . <p> Last Sat I shot a steel plate match with a Group Uzi and a Vector silencer . At the start of firing misses were rare . Toward the finish , after firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing easy shots on plates where the sites looked dead on .

Yes , you are correct . The original alignment collars was .026 larger than the barrel . Altho the baffles were not damaged I was finding metal shaving in the tube . The collar was not fufilling its job of alignment . This condition , of course would not be beneficial to accuracy . I had a collar made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on barrel #1 . This stopped the shaving problem completely . I had barrel # 2 in the silencer at the time . Could I have solved one problem and created another ? Perhaps .

It 's brand new so it 's a single-feed bolt and I 'm confident that its magwell is the same size as my M10-9mm but with a different mag-catch location ( right ? ) . <p> I have extra Walther original M10 mags for my Ingram and it would be nice to load them all up and share between both firearms . <p> Questions : <p> Is there a modified mag-catch that I can install on the M11/Nine so it will function with unmodified Walther M10 mags ? <p> Is there an aftermarket Double-Feed BOLT to fit the M11/Nine ? <p> What about LAGE , is one of their M11/Nine uppers designed to feed from the regular ( m11/nine ) magwell using a double-feed magazine ? <p> Lage did refine and produce a DF upper for his Max-11 uppers and very few were produced . It used modified Suomi mags . <p> I copied Lage 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front legs of the bolt would not fall into the FCG . My M11/9 DF bolt used the same modified mags . <p> The DF bolts would function with DF and SF mags . The problem with the DF concept has always been the lack of a DF feed ramp in the M11/9 design .

Having said that , the TASK slow fire conversion was a viable option for around a decade before Richard started making his slow-fire uppers .

Surely I ca n't just fedex it to them , right ? This is my first NFA item and am still learning the ropes . Thanks for the help ! <p> Hello , and welcome to Uzitalk ! I had mine done by AWC quite a few years ago . ( early ' 90 's ) Mine is the SWD model two stage that uses the newer conical baffles instead of the helical style typical of the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first stage ; only the second . They swapped out the aluminum conicals and end cap for stainless steel washers , an equal number of aluminum spacers ( only one shown ) and new end cap as shown : <p> They sent me the original internals and endcap back with my suppressor . Honestly this particular conversion did not improve the sound quality ; in fact it ended up being slightly louder , so I went back to the original set up . I ended up buying some 1/4 " neoprene and polyurethane sheet stock and making a bunch of replacement wipes - only cost about $15 - $20 and a lot less hassle : <p> I do want to emphasize that the technology has changed since I had this done , and that AWC ( or anyone else , for that matter ) may use a different baffle design as the replacement internals ... personally I think the original design is just as quiet ( if not more so ) than the newer ones if you keep the wipes in good shape . Personally I would leave it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you plan on shooting suppressed a lot then it may be worth it ... <p> I might make some wipes for the time being , just to gauge how much of a hassle it really is . I wo n't have the chance to shoot all that often , but I doubt I 'll ever shoot it without the suppressor on it . <p> It seems Andy Blaschik is the man for the job if I do this . Lawbob and Timberwolf , how do your cans perform relative to the old wipes ? Also , can you still disassemble the suppressor ? AWC seals them up now , which kinda bugs me . <p> I 'm a little confused . How did they return your original internals ? I was under the impression that the old parts had to be destroyed ? I like the idea of having the option to " revert " to the classic design . <p> As far as performance ... I can assure you that I have shot plenty of original SPIRAL &amp; EYELET original MAC cans , and the AWC style upgrade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have NOT shot one of the SWD conical baffle types in years , so I do n't remember . Perhaps there was an edge ? I would try wrapping as much brass screen cloth as you can possibly get around the rear and still fit the tube over it . I 'll bet you 'll be amazed at the difference in overall performance . The key here is heat dissipation . The eyelets relied on surface area ; the screen greatly multiplies that surface area as well as acting as a better heat sink . <p> I like the wipeless end cap ( MAC END ) and it works well . However , contrary to Doc Dater 's claim to the contrary , I think a fresh urethane wipe has a slight edge . Once it starts to wear , the difference is negligible . For everyday blasting , I 'd use the wipeless . For more " serious " situations , I 'd use a FRESHLY wiped cap . <p> As far as the decision to start sealing the units ... I do n't like it either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that the biggest problem with these upgrades was baffle alignment . Both he and Dater said they used an alignment rod when packing a unit . End users would inevitably get lazy and be tempted to just drop the baffles in . After all , they drop in and rest so nicely on their own . They had quite a few returns with multiple baffle strikes . I suspect that they just got tired of it and started breaking out the Loctite . I would put a torch to the threads and break them free if it was my can . I made a wooden dowel that I turned down just under the I 'd of the baffle hole and use it to align the baffles . Never had a strike . <p> NOTE : Most of the original SIONICS cans were not only thread locked , but also had the bushing STAKED . Care must be exercised in disassembly , or they will incur serious damage . <p> Jack007 <p> " All that is necessary for evil to triumph , is for good men to do NOTHING !

Here 's exactly how I went about having mine upgraded : <p> May 1989 - I inquired to AWC about having my suppressor upgraded . <p> June 12 , 1989 - I received the Form 5 from AWC already filled out , with AWC as the transferee . Type of transfer is marked " for repair " . I signed and dated the form , and forwarded it to BATF . <p> July 13 , 1989 - I received the approved Form 5 from BATF . <p> August 22 , 1989 - I send the suppressor with the original copy , and a USPS money order for $99.95 to AWC . I made a copy of the Form 5 for my records . <p> September 10th , 1989 - I received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with myself listed as the transferee , type of transfer marked " return repair " . A receipt for the work and another receipt for insured mail was also included , along with my original parts in a ziplock bag . <p> I guess back then a baffle was n't considered a suppressor . I read in previous posts of folks sending copies of Form 4 's ... my Form 4 never came into play regarding my upgrade . I used a Form 5 for my rebuild ... I actually had to transfer the unit to AWC . Did they change how one goes about sending a suppressor in for a rebuild , i.e. a transfer is no longer required ? <p> Originally Posted by Jack007 <p> As far as performance ...

I will take mine apart and replace the eyelets with the brass screen as you suggested . The heat dissipation does make a difference in the overall sound signature . <p> If I had one , I 'm sure I would do the same thing . So no name calling here . <p> I am kind of curious that nobody seems concerned about the historical value of these suppressors . I do n't think that means nobody cares , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the low-down on why there is no point in preserving a Sionics ? <p> What Andy did with my can was to shorten the length of the endcap to accomodate two baffles and spacers in front of the encapsulator or whatever that thing is that holds the spiral baffles in place . He left the front wipe in place but expanded the hole so no bullet contact but it keeps the original look of the suppressor . It disassembles as it originally did . There is no difference that I can detect in noise increase or reduction . He did replace the eyelets but I have not disassembled it to take a look . He will replace the baffles @ a per baffle cost , do n't remember what that was but I paid $90 for the work he did on mine in December 08 . <p> D Boy : I really think any value in a SIONICS can is in the original tube with the snake .

While I do not wish to go into specifics , I can tell you that in .223 , the entrance chamber pressure is 50% higher for a 10.5 inch barrel than it is for a 14.5 inch barrel . I can also tell you that the yield strength of the series 300 stainless steels that everyone thinks is so necessary is only 30,000 psi at room temperature ( 18,000 psi at 800 deg F ) , while that of 4130 chrome moly steel of the same weight and wall thickness is approximately 2.8 times higher . <p> There are very good reasons ( of which this is only one ) for manufacturers to not warrant their .223 cans on barrels less than 10.5 or 11 inches . <p> Cannard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As an engineer , I want to base my designs on a conservative analysis .

That ratio would reduce the 35ksi peak to about 3ksi . A very conservative desgn could quit here , and design to 3ksi , while the next level of iteration might be to ratio the muzzle pressure with the volume of the expansion chamber in the suppressor . Of course , the supressor expansion chamber pressure is not ratioed linearly , but by the square of the diameters , assuming equivalent lengths .

While I do not wish to go into specifics , I can tell you that in .223 , the entrance chamber pressure is 50% higher for a 10.5 inch barrel than it is for a 14.5 inch barrel . I can also tell you that the yield strength of the series 300 stainless steels that everyone thinks is so necessary is only 30,000 psi at room temperature ( 18,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4130 chrome moly steel of the same weight and wall thickness is approximately 2.8 times higher . <p> There are very good reasons ( of which this is only one ) for manufacturers to not warrant their .223 cans on barrels less than 10.5 or 11 inches . <p> I did n't know you were on our Board , Phil . Welcome ! ! <p> The modifications you made to my suppressor made it work flawlessly with my G30 , and my Mossad has always been great ! <p> I look forward to seeing you again at the SAR Show in December . <p> Take Care , my friend . <p> phd <p> 05-31-2009 , 10:19 AM <p> I did n't know you were on our Board , Phil . Welcome ! ! <p> ... <p> Been here several years , but I am not overly active . Boards are something I do occasionally when I have time , and not on a regular basis . <p> Cannard <p> 05-31-2009 , 12:25 PM <p> ssoooooooo .... how about giving us some ball-park idea of what expansion chamber pressures your instrumentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 05-31-2009 , 03:08 PM <p> Thanks for your response . <p> As an engineer , I want to base my designs on a conservative analysis . In lieu of test muzzle pressure data , I been inclined to proceed based on peak pressure information , widely available for specific rounds . <p> For instance , beginning with the 9mm para . and a peak pressure of approximately 34ksi. ; If the pressure is proportional to the lengths of the volumes involved , with constant x-sectional area , one could conservatively say that the length of the volume at peak pressure might be 1/2 inch , while it could be 6 inches or so as the round leaves the barrel . That ratio would reduce the 35ksi peak to about 3ksi . A very conservative desgn could quit here , and design to 3ksi , while the next level of iteration might be to ratio the muzzle pressure with the volume of the expansion chamber in the suppressor . Of course , the supressor expansion chamber pressure is not ratioed linearly , but by the square of the diameters , assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative design pressure hovering around 300psi , assuming a 2x2 inch chamber . <p> I have specifically targeted my particular weapon in order to get an order of magnitude of the loads involved . As noted , these numbers would change dramatically when viewed from the perspective of shorter barrels . I 've also not considered obstruction issues , and have ignored heat transfer concerns due to rapid fire . <p> Someone experienced in the field might well say that , due to the small time frame involved in the event , the simple ratioing of the volumes is not appropriate , at least within the barrel . I guess this is where I am seeking input . <p> What muzzle pressures are ' folks ' using for their designs ? <p> I typically secure the weapon to a tree and use a long piece of string . <p> hotbrass <p> 05-31-2009 , 07:10 PM <p> Isnt it easier to secure it to a large tire with a long string ? <p> MPA guy <p> 06-24-2009 , 11:12 PM <p> I secure my form 1 suppressor test fires with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long string . Works great for that . : ) <p> Here 's one I 've waited to build for about 5 months to get the approval back . It 's in 45acp and I just finished it 2 days ago . <p> http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=GFmZRFSEhoQ <p> As far as the chamber pressure , Just start from the max Saami pressure of the round you 're making it for . I 'm pretty sure that 9mm is closer to upwards of 38K psi , but I guess that could be ammo dependent . <p> Some baffle designs are more effective ( restrictive ) than others , so saying that a 9mm can ( any 9mm can ) will have the same pressures , just ca n't really be done because there are too many variables . Chamber length x inside diameter , baffle design , bore size , etc . <p> And for what it 's worth , a 2x2 inch expansion chamber is HUGE from my experience ! My 9mm suppressor has an expansion chamber of 1.5 inches in length , and 1.37 " interior diameter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're only going to increase first round pop . <p> Your mileage may vary of course , but mine does just as good as commercial models . Here 's my 9mm form 1 can . http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=p786wzS7BtA <p> hotbrass <p> 06-24-2009 , 11:42 PM <p> What kind of baffles did you use ? <p> MPA guy <p> 06-25-2009 , 12:29 AM <p> The 9mm can used nothing more than car engine valve retainers that were over bored to prevent baffle strikes . It is a very simplistic design , but works quiet well ! <p> The Tactical Innovations Tac-16 is very similiar . <p> LONG ... <p> I do n't have any pics taken of the 45 baffles , but they 're completely unique to themselves . They 're a partial cone , and a partial reflex chamber , but backwards the way that regular reflex baffles work , which usually is directed behind the muzzle of the barrel in the expansion chamber . <p> Mine has a place in each chamber that allows the gas to expand well past the exit bore and then some has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next chamber , then repeat throughout the stack until it exits into the atmosphere . <p> hotbrass <p> 06-25-2009 , 12:14 PM <p> Nice , what tubing did you use on the spacers and outside ? <p> Did you thread the end caps or weld them to the tube ? <p> Thanks ! <p> MPA guy <p> 06-25-2009 , 12:36 PM <p> The outer tube on both suppressors are 4130 Chromemoly . <p> The 9mm can has very thick walls due to making it strong enough to withstand anything that will fit through the bore ( including 223 , 7.62x39 and 308 ) <p> The wall thickness of the 9mm can is .085 after it was turned down . It 's a heavy beasty , but you ca n't just go out and buy a 9mm can that will hold up to rifle calibers too and is why I chose to build it myself to get the most out of it as I could . Most 9mm cans are aluminum and they 'd eventually blow apart under that kind of stress . The spacers are also 4130 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tigged . <p> The 45 can , I only plan on pistol calibers through it , so I used 4130 Chromeoly on it too because I do n't  ' like that distinct " ping " that is often associated with aluminum , but the wall is a lot thinner . .058 . <p> The rear cap is tigged , but the front cap is threaded 40 tpi since the wall is so thin to give it as much " bite " as I could , and so I can still take it apart to clean it , and I used 6061 Al for the spacers in it since Aluminum can hold up to those pressures and to save some weight this time around .

Well , when I rocked it in I found there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to put it more simply , it did not lock in rock solid . i could insert it and it would lock , but light pressure on the mag would rock it in even further and it would engage on something else . <p> Undeterred , I pulled the charging handle and ... failure to feed .

I think you would be pleasantly surprized . <p> I 'd put my old Sionics HE can up against any of the newer high dollar cans ... only drawback is replacing the wipes , which may be a big deal if you shoot suppressed a lot . <p> Even with the wipes blownout you can still shoot without ears . I do gree that it is a real pain replacing the wipes in the H.E . cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original sionics two stage was that the H.E . cans had two sets of wipes . One set was at the first stage and they did n't  hold up as well as the wipes at the second stage , so you had to replace them on a much more frequent basis . Anyway , they still work rather well compaired to recent technology in suppressor design . <p> I have an original Sionics 2-stage Powder Springs 9mm can . It cost me $299 . As far as performance goes , it does what I need it to do - allows me to shoot w/o hearing protection . I change out the wipes after 3-5 mags - it 's no big deal . It takes a couple of minutes ( gives the suppressor time to cool down too ) . And wipes are NOT considered a suppressor part and are replaceable .

Once I got it apart , I put anti-seize compound on the threads to make taking it apart in the future easier . <p> I 've found that the best way to get the second stage to come apart from the first stage , is to gently tap with a rubber mallet after using the suppressor tool . It may take a while but it will eventualy come loose . I aplied greese to all of the threads and it is no longer an issue to disassemble .

@@77050894 @5750894/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> The myth of the 7.62 X 39 chambered Factory Galil , Could it be real ? <p> Hi Guys , We had discussed before about the possibility of IMI/IWI ever making a factory Galil chambered in 7.62 X 39 . Of course IMI/IWI would never admit to anything So I was going thru pictures of South &amp; Central American weapons ( I know get a life ) and I ran across an interesting picture of a table of captured weapons by the Colombian Military . One Galil stood out that was different . <p> In this picture you can visibly see a Galil that has a stamped reciever , why ? my theory is that possibly IMI ( or someone ) designed this to shoot AK ammo ? So I highlighted the rifle in question in the first picture and next to it is a milled Galil to compare . So here are things that stand out to me on this rifle first it has a standard Galil gas tube on a stamped reciever ( most Galil clones from a AK I have seen have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle also has a standard Galil gasblock and lastly no extended trunion for adapting a Galil style stock to a stamped reciever . Could this be a fabled AK Galil ? It sure looks well put togther ( More Galil than Ak-47 ) <p> The second picture is that of the Mexican Prison service team holding a Galil with a AK-47 mag inserted . There has always been speculation wether this picture is an authentic AK 7.62 X 39 chambered rifle . So what I wanted to point out on this rifle in the Mexican picture is the lack of a lightining cut on the ejection port side of the weapon ( could this be a stamped reciever ? ) I wish the picture was a little clearer to be able to look at position of the axis pins on the ejection port side . <p> Both rifles have the INDUMIL folding stocks . <p> So there you have it a new theory on the AK chambered Galil with pictures to hopefully support it . I would be great to hear from the members here on Gtalk after they review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on youtube with an IMI guy showing a 7.62x39 Galil . He showed how the front trunnion to muzzle was galil then everything else was AK . But his had the underfolder stock . I found and like this . http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=DvccUuJ0i-4 <p> Lou The top rifle is definitely a AK receiver The bottom pic is milled if you look closely you can see there are no rivets to hold the front or rear trunnions in to a sheet metal receiver plus the distinct second angle on the bottom of the receiver points to milled you can not bend a piece of sheet metal with the second angle ( the area where mag is inserted ) without welding . Now with that said could a 7.62x39 milled Galil have been made by a competent gun smith as a one off absolutely by using a modified 5,56 bolt or a AK bolt and a custom barrel and its done . <p> Thanks Vito for the input . I see what you mean by the angle on the the milled reciever vs. stamped one . good eye ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamped reciever Galil on the table ? INDUMIL factory made or a lone gunsmith in Colombia making a rifle out of spare parts ? All I can say is that its a hell of a Galil clone . I would love to have a rifle like that ! Thanks Lou <p> P.s . Here is that picture unedited so you can see it better . Peace out ! <p> Lou if you come across a demilled Galil receiver ( locking lugs intact ) i 'm sure one can be fashioned to a AK receiver with milling work then riveting . I have to say though its not a inexpensive project . I have to admitt the timing of this post is a coincidence as most of you know i 'm working on reproduction Galil trigger guard mag latch assembly and as this process has played out I put one of the prototypes next to a AKs and the rivet holes lined up and latch height are the same . So I figured what the heck i 'm going to build a AK Galil clone with a AMD65 parts set with the 12 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is even a AK gas block front sight combination that can be used . If you have to skills this can be Built for around $600 vs ? for a Galil AK <p> .... you can not bend a piece of sheet metal with the second angle ( the area where mag is inserted ) without welding . DV <p> The stamped receiver Valmet rifles have a dual angle along the bottom . Straight at the rear half of the receiver , then pitched upward toward the front trunnion . I 've had several demilled stamped receiver Valmets , the outer shell is all one piece , no welds . <p> I am sure that special forces in several countries had 7.62x39 versions of weapons made that could use AK mags and soviet bloc ammo . They confuse the enemy , because they sound like their own guns and the ammo is not traceable . It is also easy to " acquire " ammo when behind enemy lines . <p> I stand corrected They must use a stamping method to make them vs a folding method like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMI produced this sheet metal receiver I would think they would have had to used a stamping process also there would be lots of these rifles on the market . I guess I 'm saying that the tooling to stamp a piece like that is a fair investment to make to not mass produce . So as I said you can not bend a piece of sheet metal with 2 angles without warping the side , try it with a piece of paper and you will understand

I will use your table top as an example . First , clear away all that background stuff on the table . From your picture , it looks like your camera focused on the stuff in the upper left corner ( clearer image ) . Next , do not put the subject item(s) on a dark surface . I like to use cardboard because it is a constant light color and nonreflective . Next , take the pictures in a well lit area . Sometimes the area lighting makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of small objects close up , fill the frame with only those objects . Move the camera closer to the subject , or if stiff fuzzy , move back a little and use the optical zoom ( but not too much ) . Take 2 or 3 shots of each setup because one or more might be fuzzy . Try with and without the flash . Watch out for flash glare if the subject has shiny flat surfaces . And last , use photo editing software to crop , straighten , resize , and lighten the best shots . <p> Try my tricks and post another picture of your 7.62x39 ammo ...... <p> FYI : My camera is an Olympus C-730 ( 3.2MP &amp; 10X Optical Zoom ) . <p> SubGunFan <p> UZI SBR AWC <p> 08-05-2006 , 10:02 PM <p> The PRC stuff ( has a copper wash case ) is what got restricted . <p> Easy way to identify if it is indeed the steel core stuff is to look at the cannelure groove on the bullet ...... if it is a square cut groove and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , then it will likely have the steel pin inside the jacket riding in a layer of lead . Also came on stripper clip , not in a 20ct box . <p> You can pull a bullet and look at the base , it will be shiny , and it will not scratch if you try to scratch with a nail or screwdriver tip . <p> I have a small stash I have had since 1993 , and scored some ( 60 rounds ) off a shelf at local FFL recently that likely unknowingly tossed out on the shelf for sale , I bought it all and walked quietly out the door and drove off . <p> bodybagsryan <p> 08-30-2006 , 02:59 PM <p> Just put the bullet in a vice with the base of said bullet canted down at an angle .

@@77050896 @5750896/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> a choice of Kahr MK.40 and Colt mustang 380 please help <p> Hey guys , I just got my CHL yesterday and i 'd like to get some information on the two guns i listed above . I'v heard lot of limpwristing on the Kahr mk40. the recoil is crazy as well . I never shoot any of these guns . But since i want to have something small and easy to carry like in the pocket and such . So any one who have experiences on the colt mustang pocketlite and kahr. please feel free to chime in . <p> Interesting choices . I shoot .380 acp a lot , and carry a Ruger LCP when I can not carry a Glock 23 . The big question is : would you rather shoot an assailant with a .380 , or something more substantial ? Do n't get me wrong ; shooting .380 is like eating candy- it 's fun for a while , but wears off . .40 S&amp;W is a much more substantial caliber . The Kahr is a very well made pistol that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in the way of a footprint . <p> A couple of things about the Kahr- when using the lasergrips , and you have your finger on the side of the frame ( to keep it out of the triggerguard ) it obscures the dot . Not a big deal , but I found myself doing it a lot . The trigger on the Kahr is a little different . It is light , easily managable , but very long . It has a lot of take-up , I presume as a safeguard . <p> thank you , you'r right on the grip . I assume it will add a bit of wrapping around the grip . But with the crimson trace laser along with this gun , it is $699 on gunbroker. so i guess it is not a bad deal at all . I normally use the sight instead of the laser . I suppose i will get the Kahr. and i 'm told that it would take around 2k rounds for it to break in . For the colt mustang , is the receiver really thin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a Mustang and it 's a great pistol . No recoil because its a locked breech , not a blowback . It really does make a difference . BUT .... I also have a Kahr PM9 ... and that 's why the Mustang spends most of its time in the safe . <p> I had a Colt Govt .380- just a little bit longer than the Pony . They are nice and thin ( narrow profile ) , easy to conceal , and really not that heavy . I did n't like the plastic trigger , though . It had a lot of play , and just did n't seem right on the Colt . <p> ShortGirl 's carry gun is a Colt Gov't .380 . As gunbunny said it 's just a little longer than the Pony . She really likes it . There are replacement triggers and recoil spring rods -- the original plastic bits do seem junky on a Colt . She and I both like the " cocked and locked " simplicity . <p> We looked at a PM9 at the same time , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As far as having a thin receiver ... she has tiny hands and loves the slim Colt . Her hands are so small she ca n't correctly hold a CZ75 . I have more than once considered getting one for me too as a pocket pistol . <p> Official Zionist Conspirator <p> " We shall not cease from exploration . And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started , and know the place for the first time . " -T.S . Eliot <p> guys , thank you for all the feedbacks . I 'm just trying to see which one is right , i'v seen them in person , and it 's suck that i like them both . However the smaller the better . something easy to carry around especially in the pocket . I'v seen several series on Colt Mustang , For example : there is Colt mustang MK IV , Colt mustang plus II . Are the handgrips longer than the regular mustang ? how about the parts available ? <p> The plus II has a longer grip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the one you have pictured . The only problem I encountered was getting the safety off left handed . I carried it as a BUG in my left rear pocket . I think you 're going to find the 40 in that package is too heavy in the pocket and uncomfortable to shoot often or well . Do n't get me wrong , it can be done ... but you 'll work at it . I just think there are better choices . JMHO <p> The plus II has a longer grip and same slide/barrel as the pocketlite you have pictured . You want the one you have pictured . The only problem I encountered was getting the safety off left handed . I carried it as a BUG in my left rear pocket . I think you 're going to find the 40 in that package is too heavy in the pocket and uncomfortable to shoot often or well . Do n't get me wrong , it can be done ... but you 'll work at it .

Kahr on the other hand is a bit of weight to it . How about the polymer frame on Kahr ? how do you carry your PM9 ? . And by the way , i just noticed that the colt pony is different than the colt mustang. in term of the safety switch , trigger , double action and i do n't  see the hammer on this picture . is it even more light weigh than the colt mustang ? <p> Close to the same weight , just double action.I like the idea of the double action for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reason I recommended the Kahr PM 9 is the lighter weight and the 9mm is more controllable in the light weight pistol . You will find the 9mm will get back on target a whole lot quicker.I carry the PM 9 in the same place I carried the Mustang ... left rear pocket . You will find the Mustang/Pony is still a lighter/smaller package than the PM 9 but I like the upgrade to 9mm . Do n't let the little bit of difference between the .40 and the 9mm mess with your mind . You take on a considerable amount of recoil for very little gain in stopping power ( in real life , not in print ) . <p> I 'm told Kahr did recall the pm9 model for the barrel issue if i 'm not mistaken . But yes you'v given me all the choices that in my consider and same pick . How does the plastic trigger on the Colt mustang holding up ? as far as another plastic part which i believe is the firing pin ? Plus i 'm told that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the firing pin , even if it 's half way . it 's still can be dangerous ? In this case , what if the situation is so quick for you even to withdraw the gun out and may be remove the holster ? it sounds a bit tricky here . but i still like the guns itself and alot of people say it 's nice . And thank you for your time to reply most of this thread . <p> Aside from the two very different cartridges ( 380 vs .40 S&amp;W ) , it 's already been said that the Kahr is quite massive ( heavy ) for its compact size . Also , I do n't particularly care for the loooooooooooonnnnnggg trigger pull on Kahr pistols , but that 's me . <p> I have a SS Colt Govt Model 380 and it is a sweet-shooting carry piece . The POI is POA at 25 yds and that 's OK by me . I 've never had a failure to feed with either FMJ or JHP ammo of any flavor . Mags are expensive and hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory mags and I found two more SS Colt factorys at two different shows for $25 and $30 ea . I do n't carry it much , but when I do it 's as if it 's not there . <p> Mustangs and Govt Models are getting very dear in these parts . The prices I 've seen start at $700 and work up to $900 for guns in the box with all the usual paper and accessories . Of course , I keep seeing the $900 guns month after month in the same display case , but there it is FWIW . <p> I have been carrying 1911 's for 30 years ... cocked and locked is not the Safety problem the double action crowd would have you believe . The only reason I liked the double action of the pony is because I carry in my left back pocket and have to sweep the safety of the Mustang by crossing my left thumb over while drawing . A pocket holster will stabilize the pistol in your pocket and keep it from rotating . I would n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Kahr is n't the best . A little time at the range solves that problem . As I use it in the bellygun/BUG role it does n't have to be target quality . <p> Sorry , did n't answer all your questions .... The plastic trigger has given no problems . the firing pin is n't plastic . I 'd have to pull it out of the safe to see what else is . I 've had no problems with the pistol at all .. Like the others have said . shoots great and functions with everything . I 've used Winchester silvertips for carry . I had the front sight replaced with an XS standard tritium express sight . that 's all I 've ever done to it . <p> so i got the chance to try to MK40 already , that thing is a beast , it 's not easy to control . and the bullet case just ejects right to the back instead of side way i do n't  know if you'r experiencing it with your PM9 . Anyhow , i think i will pass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustang , currently place $760 on the NIB colt on gunbroker , but the bidding is not ended yet , i think other folks want this gun as bad as i do too . i do n't  think it will settle with that amount . <p> Yes , the price of these has skyrocketed lately . At a show this past weekend a Pony was for sale for $800 ... wow ! You might want to look at the new SIG 238 .... Why no love for the 9 ? If you get a chance to shoot the PM9 you 'll find its a completely different gun . Looks the same ... acts different

The only correction is that they were not the first semi-auto UZIs made . Production started at number SA01001 .

I 've seen a factory cutaway with model B sights and it was serial number SA00423 . Action Arms sold 36,000 carbines before they got to the Model B so clearly the early numbers were not produced in order . I 'm not saying that AHF lied . They may have just assumed the guns were produced in strict serial number order , but they were n't . <p> They are on the C&amp;R list because the primary purpose of them is a collectible , not a shooter . I think AHF has petitioned to get some of their guns on the C&amp;R list , which makes them more attractive to some buyers . <p> cvasqu03 <p> 03-02-2016 , 05:20 PM <p> They start at SA00001 wich was presented to the king him self of course ... <p> Sorry , which King are you referring to ? <p> SecondAmend <p> 03-02-2016 , 05:42 PM <p> Sorry , which King are you referring to ? <p> I thought the reference was to Elvis Presley .

@@77050903 @5750903/ <p> thanks . I love a gun that 's obviously been used .

If I had an engraved bird gun , or a commemorative on the wall , that would be one thing . But my working guns are given no cosmetic consideration .

The paint is worn , and it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot and its hidden in my hand it 's the perfect companion . And if I never see another tricked out omni double dura coat epoxy bake sharkskin ninja finish AR-15 it will be too soon . Some haggard warrior with a beat up , wired down G3 or AK is going to garner much more respect from me . For me pretty guns and working guns are two drastically different things . My carry and shtf guns are purpose focused , barely cleaned and never babied . If I ever had a delicate AR type weapon , I would probably break it a hundred rounds in due to the " real world " conditions that I try to expose them to .

The WWII/korean war guys wanted fancy deep polished blued finishes and fancy walnut stocks . They considered a fancy finish to be a mark of high quality . <p> Around 1990 the AR15 became hugely popular and it sort of ushered in the era of tacticoolness , where people put a lot of importance on making everything look bad ass and military . <p> It 's just a matter of looks though . <p> As far as engraved guns go , i never liked them .

Who knows what happened along the way .... <p> title ii <p> 04-18-2012 , 08:49 PM <p> Did doing this in effect " reset " the waiting period to 0 , or did you still get the stamps approved within the originally-expected time-frame ? <p> No , your place in line stays the same and I did receive the forms within the originally expected time frame ( except it looks like my forms were processed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I had sent them back the second time ) . I can speak for myself and say the NFA Branch does a good job of tracking pending forms . They ask that you return the forms ASAP so they can be placed back in line . I emailed my examiner to verify receipt and she confirmed when my forms arrived on her desk . Excellent group of overworked folks at the NFA Branch in my opinion . <p> title ii <p> 04-18-2012 , 08:59 PM <p> Another note I would add ... I would say the key to my success was due to my follow up communication ( email and physically speaking to the examiner on the phone ) . Remember they deal with a lot of people on a daily basis . Keep it sweet and to the point when you call and leave your message on their voice mail . Also when you send your forms use a priority mail mailer with delivery confirmation . If you choose to email your examiner the email record become retrievable via a FOIA request . My advice to you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the DOJ/ATF server and stored somewhere electronically so it can be accessed at a later day if needed via FOIA should you encounter any issues . This is your best bet for insuring your forms are not lost and you can hold someone accountable .

Any tips on buying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shooter , not a collector 's piece necessarily . <p> Would you do it again ? ...... Yes , I probably would have saved a little more money and purchased a lend lease or Military M1 . Its a good time to buy Thompsons right now . What should I look for when buying one ? Matching upper and lower would be cool / rare in a Military gun . Any tips on buying the full auto Thompsons are appreciated ! Find a Thompson that fits your price and character . Thompson nuts do n't consider Pearl or West Hurly guns true Thompsons . I have seen some really nice Pearl receiver M1 's , but in my opinion they arenot worth as much as a West Hurley . Its my opinion that West Hurley M1 's are superior to the WH 28 's . An M1 Bridgeport gun would be the shit . Colts .... well Colts are the real deal plan on spending more for the name . I am looking for a shooter , not a collector 's piece necessarily . Is n't everybody ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get shot . They are open bolt machine guns ... simple and go boom 99% of the time when you pull the trigger . <p> West Hurley guns manufacturing tolerances and building materials left many of the guns needing some work . Most by now have been fixed but there are a few NIB guns that might need work . <p> I would only purchase a Pearl Thompson if it was offered at a SUBSTANTIAL discount . <p> Pearl receivers were actually built out of good hard steel , but in my humble opinion the resale value is n't there . ( Its an aftermarket gun unlike a West Hurley that was actually marketed and sold to LE and Prisons ) <p> Right now you 'd be surprised what you could get w/ $14,0000 cash . I 've seen mismatched Colts and Bridgeport guns being offered for thousands less than what they were asking 12 months ago . <p> Lastly ; .45 ammo is easy as hell to reload and today purchasing a machine gun means loading your own ammo . <p> Good luck . <p> GUTTERRATT <p> 06-29-2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thompson I would go for a 1928 , The M1 savage was made during WW11 to speed up production and to cut production cost , Also the M1 does n't use drum magazines so you 'll be limited to using a stick magazines . Some guys have cut slots in the receiver to receive the drum magazines but that is not the best idea for 2 reasons , 1st the M1 receiver has less metal in the receiver and the cutting of the slots could weaken the receiver considerably and the 2nd reason is it would lessen the value of your M1 if you ever decided to sell it . Some guys have welded stick mag catch rails on their drums so they can use their drums with their M1 . IMHO a M1 is kind off a generic thompson , But if you are low on funds you can pick up a M1 for about the same price as a good West Hurley 1928 , And I mean a good West Hurley not the cheapest one you can find .

They are both super guns . In the M1 I shoot cast lead bullets . In the 28 I only shoot plated bullets , either Ranier or Berry . The reason for this is that lead bullets foul up the Cutts Comp , which is very time consuming to clean . This makes the M1 much quicker to clean and much cheaper to shoot . In addition I do n't use drums much . I 'm a steel plate shooter rather than a noise maker ( drum dumper ) . Therefore I find myself shooting the M1 more than the 28 . Whether you buy a west hurley or a military , you will have less trouble with a M1/M1A1 that a 28 . The 28 with a drum has a super impressive look .

I 'd take over a 28 any day of the week . <p> FYI All M1 's or M1A1 's ( except for Pearl ) are C&amp;R weapons . Even the West Hurley M1 's ( there is only 300 of them ) are usually very good weapons . <p> The Ceiner .22lr Thompson conversion kit will fit in both the M1 and 28 series .

The gun is an absolute terror with the 9mm upper . If you likewise use the original wire stock , it is even more terrifying . Although it might not be per se unsafe , I would never allow anyone other than myself shoot it . <p> There are other options for 9mm in an M11A1 . Look for the recently discontinued Max 11A1 or the Max 31A . I purchased one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since . Other than the Lage products you could also look for the uppers by AA or one of the old SCA slowfire uppers . <p> If you are absolutely adamant about a 9mm original style upper , any skilled gunsmith could make one . I may be selling my complete M11A1 package with all the uppers in the near future . Do n't bother contacting me , if I end up selling it , it will appear on Uzitalk first . <p> My gun collection is one murderous rampage away from becoming an arsenal <p> Oh , I thought it was going to be a complete gun . Never mind ... I do n't want to be testing the fail strength of the rear welds on my factory M11A1 lower . <p> I certainly do appreciate the offer , though ! <p> I 'll open this up to any other longtime Uzitalk members . If you have an m11a1 upper and a desire to shoot it in 9mm in a stock upper , I 'll ship the upper to you on my dime as long as you promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail back the upper . I 'd do it myself but I do n't have any means to videotape it nor any means , like a pact timer , to get the rof . <p> My gun collection is one murderous rampage away from becoming an arsenal <p> I agree . The G-18 is n't bad . Maybe the poly frame ? My M-11/9 with a MACJack is a handful . I 'd imagine the the 9mm conversion upper on a small frame M-11 is about the same . I need to fab up a MACJack for my M-10/45 one day ... Just because . 
@@77050910 @5750910/ <p> I sold my model b about 2 years ago because I mostly shoot my mini sbr .

An unregistered machinegun is illegal in Ohio , a registered machinegun is legal . A registered SBR is legal , an unregistered one is not . The catch is that a semi-auto with the large capacity magazine ( a centerfire capable of shooting more than 31 rounds without reloading ) is considered by Ohio to be an " automatic firearm " under ORC 2923.11(E) , and an SBR is considered by Ohio to be a " sawed-off firearm " under ORC 2923.11(F) . <p> The prosecution theory was that the registration as an SBR would make it legal as a " sawed-off firearm " but not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to register a semi-auto with a 31+ round capacity as a machinegun so it 's illegal under Ohio law . I never did follow up to see what happened in this case or whether the legal issue was appealed . i do remember there was a link on Uzitalk to another forum ( AR-15 ? ) on which the case was being followed . <p> Edit:I did a quick search and found a court of appeals case out of Lucas County affirming the trial court 's dismissal of the charges in State v. Timothy Terrell on the basis that the Defendant 's AR-15 with large capacity magazine was an NFA registered firearm . I THINK this is the case I had heard about and , if so , apparently the prosecution theory was rejected . For some reason I have n't been able to access the trial court case on the internet.

Why is n't any of the manufacturers selling a product like this ? They could silver solder it- that way we send it in for service ( Barrel exchange , baffle repair .. etc. ) and they can disassemble and reassemble once completed . I would think this is a great opportunity for manufacturers since it provides them a repeatable market just like the old wipe style suppressors .

Since your ammo is non corrosive , are you using water in the suppressor ? Water will combine with combustion nitrates to produce nitric and nitrous acids which corrode steel barrels . The back pressure of the suppressor sprays these byproducts into the firearm . <p> I personally prefer synthetic oils as an ablatent . <p> TH <p> 11-16-2004 , 01:28 PM <p> &gt; what would 1000 rounds of 9MM cost in Finland <p> Ca n't say , its been years since I bought ammo in bigger quantitys ( when price comes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lapua are something like 0.26 USD each , S&amp;B subsonics 0.24 USD each .

When its cooling down moisture from air condenses ( ? ) between the silencer and the barrell surface where it sits until it evaporates and/or corrodes the barrell from the outside . I am not alone with this problem , after my barrell was slightly marked I found out that even silencer manufacturers do not recommend leaving the silencer on the gun when storing it . Well , not a big deal , takes about 3 seconds to remove it . <p> bornhard <p> 12-06-2004 , 07:13 PM <p> Here 's the email I got from Vector : <p> Rex Merrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a little involved . The problem to over come is that the suppressor needs to screw off but the barrel ca n't turn when it is installed in the gun due to the flange at the front end of the barrel . You would have to cut a ring in the barrel right in front of the flange on the barrel . Then make a small collar that would fit inside the back of the suppressor that had a pin that project thru the collar into the cut ring . That way the suppressor could spin off the gun but the barrel could not come out of the suppressor . We could do this . It would cost $100 if you are suppling the barrel .

There is also a $18 shipping charge extra on these options . <p> Thoughts ? ? ? ? <p> tommygun2000 <p> 12-06-2004 , 07:52 PM <p> Originally posted by bornhard Here 's the email I got from Vector : <p> Rex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it would be a little involved .

So I am looking for a home for it . <p> peabody <p> 12-08-2004 , 01:37 AM <p> Actually what Vector would do is pin the barrel to the back end cap of their suppressor . It can screw off the suppressor so you can clean the barrel and the suppressor . This would not cost $100 but around $50 if you supply the barrel . This would include the end cap of their suppressor . If Vector supplies the barrel , $80 . Just a note , with this configuration make sure you remove the entire suppressor from the gun first and then unscrew the suppressor tube from its endcap , especially in public .

The bolt rarely would go back into full battery after first shot and I would experience failure to feed on several occasions . It always felt like the recoil spring was too weak to do the job . I got a new spring and experienced the same . <p> I read an article about the importance of " removing burrs " on the bolt , retracting the bolt partially when changing modes of fire ( ? ) , and the importance of having spare firing pins .

@@77050925 @5750925/ <p> I have heard rumors that Vector is running out of receivers to make Uzi clones . That is not true . We bought up the remaining receivers from Kentucky Imports which numbered in the 1000s . We have plenty . What we are short on is parts . We have been trying to import parts kits from around the world and are still working on that . We are also making more and more U.S. parts because of the lack of kits coming in . It is cost prohibitive to make all the parts in the U.S. We have been making Uzis all along but our waiting list got soooo long that we stopped putting people on it . We are about caught up . Our order takers ask me not to have waiting lists anymore because they are so hard to handle . This might sound odd but it really takes a lot of time to call people and try to get them to call back . We now have a blog on our website that is updated weekly as to the status of our various products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest is that we are producing Uzi clones with 18 " barrels now . Not that we think the longer barrel is really neat , ugh , but with the folding stock folded , the overall length of an Uzi with a 16 " barrel is only 24-1/2 " long . Since we are manufacturing these , to comply with the rifle rule of 26 " , we are putting in the 18 " barrel . We stilll have 16 " replacement barrels for those of you that need them . <p> Peabody <p> B Wood <p> 02-20-2007 , 05:56 AM <p> I think you need to clarify which states require the 18 " barrel .

What is the real word on UZI Mini Pistols ? Does Vector still have pistol receivers ? Are they still making them ? Specifically the short barrel , no stock version . Thanx to Peabody for taking the time to join in on this forum ! Bruce <p> Vector ran out of IMI mini receivers about three months ago . We told everyone we did n't have any more which is true . But , due to my nature of wanting to make money and having quite a few mini parts left , and the fact that we can shrink the full size Group Industry receivers , and since several individuals have begged me for a mini , we have done just that . We have made a few more minis from full size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 6 shop hours to make one receiver but we can do it . In case any of you are wondering , we made around 800 full-auto mini Uzis this same way and I only remember getting one back that had a small crack where we welded it . We heat treat them after they are welded . We do n't know where there are any more IMI mini receivers . <p> Also , I get calls periodically , if we can make Micros or Uzi pistols . I have never seen any receivers by themselves for micros nor do we make them . <p> We have been shrinking down full size registered bolts to mini and micro size but you have to buy an Uzi pistol to use it in . We do n't have any pistols . To make it clear , when I refer to the Uzi pistol , I mean the small , micro size , original Uzi pistol . We invented the full size and mini Uzi pistol and they were never made by IMI so they are not the real Uzi " pistol " .

There 's nothing like ' em ... but , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a movie prop house somewhere , might have been Stembridge 's out of Glendale , CA . It runs like a top with any type of 9 " silly-meter " I feed her . I have one OEM S&amp;W 36 rounder and purchased 7 more Suomi 36 rounders . Four fit just fine and the other 3 had to have a little " meat " taken off the two little shims in the top front of the mag . But , look at it this way ... they 're an outstanding investment . With ALL C&amp;R NFA going up in value , surpassing regular NFA MG 's ... they 'll be over 10K in the next 3-5 years . I do n't know what stock ( in the Exchange ) that you can buy out there that will give you a return like that . Plus , while you have it , you can shoot the crap out of it and never hurt the gun . That 's what they 're made to do ... SHOOT ! The only parts I would get as spares would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get those from Scott Andrey there in NC fairly inexpensively . <p> They 're a robust , incredibly well-built SMG . With Soumi mags at $5 a piece , you ca n't go wrong . My gun is fairly accurate , too ... on semi-auto , I can bounce a oil can all over a backstop at about 80 yards ... and that 's out of an OPEN-BOLT SMG ! ! The only other gun that can do that would be a Colt 635 or a HK MP5 , which both fire from a closed bolt . <p> If you can find a decent one on the boards ... and " IF " is the keyword , you ca n't make a better buy than a S&amp;W M76 SMG . You 'll fall in love with it as soon as you empty a magazine out of one . They run at about 750 RPM . Mine runs about 650 RPM ( about as fast as an MP5 ) with WalMart Winchester 9 " silly-meter " , it seems to be a little less powerful than other 9mm . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammo out of one , it 'll beat up the gun . The Hirtenburger 9mm ammo is made specifically for British Sterling SMGs .. and will shoot a S&amp;W M76 SMG loose if you shoot enough out of it ... they run about 1,000 RPM , about as fast as a MAC-10 . <p> All in all , I 'd recommend going the full-auto route . Plop down the money . Yes , that much money , plus the $200 tax will be a feat in and of itself , but again , they 're an excellent investment . The semi-auto versions are going to be come " ho-hum " after a while . <p> Our plan is to sell ours in about 10 years , buy an inexpensive Winnebago , put the Corolla on the back , put the dog up on the dash and " Mama " and I are gon na go see the USA . Hope it works out that way . Our S&amp;W M76 SMG is our little " retirement " fund . <p> Hope this info is helpful in making you decide to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M76 SMG ... you 'll be glad you did in the long run . <p> If all of us here can asnwer anymore of your questions , please feel free to ask ... all of the gentlemen here seems to be just that , gentlemen and have a combined vast knowlegde of the S&amp;W , so ask away . <p> Thanks for posting ... kim ... out . <p> kanewtervalve <p> 02-18-2005 , 06:33 PM <p> UPDATE Got my SW 760 today and it shoots great with modified Suomi mags .

Are they not under warranty ? <p> I would send it back for repair asap ! <p> The pics of the striker and bolt for the semi auto SW760 makes me strongly feel that these parts might be parred up with springs that are too high in tension . If the little 9mm ca n't overcome both springs and the weight of the striker and bolt on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slam fires . <p> The slam fire is from the bolt flying back just far enough to open up the ejection port and toss the empty out but it strips a new round in where the striker has not even caught the sear . The bolt simply did not go back far enough . <p> On the machinegun version I was told that my MK-760 was jamming because I used standard 115 grain 9mm ammo and should have went with +P . It never worked because it was not built right . The trunion was off , and the bolt feed lip kept on cracking . <p> But , this is not an MK Arms manufactured gun . There is hope , and I am hoping it is all in the recoil and striker springs . <p> Tight fitting magazines can make one gun shoot better and another worse . Some guns need a little play , it can be a from one gun to another or by design . Not saying yours does n't  need tight fitting magazines to get your SW-760 to work . <p> Another thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good idea . The reason being , have you ever tried holding a gun where you could get it to jam ? Like if you do not give a Glock a good tight hold , it might jam for example ? I have gotten a few guns to jam by holding them more loosely than they should have been . It happens mostly when hip firing . <p> The pistol configuration does not have a good backing to let the bolt and striker reset , because as a pistol there is no stock to let the shock of the recoil perform its function . The guns recoil is dampened by the looser hold on the gun is the best way I can describe it . <p> patm41 <p> 12-19-2005 , 07:23 PM <p> LONG ... here is a shell casing from the last time it detonated out of battery this was Wolf ammo .. <p> I have had this happen twice the first time i found a burr on the firing pin where it was welded to the larger carrier .. stoned it down and i figured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather i dig this gun back out of the safe i do n't  know .. <p> cookie <p> 01-01-2006 , 08:35 PM <p> I ordered one of these from Wade Bailey ( Top-Notch ) at S.A.R .

@@77050934 @5750934/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> My review of the Akins Accelerator 2 springless *with videos* <p> Okay , so I 'm a new here . My name is Tony , and I am an addict . I like almost anything that throws lead downrange . This affliction relates to everything from muzzle loaders to machineguns . <p> Recently I picked up one of the " new " Akins Accelerators . This is the springless version , not to be confused with the original . <p> The thing is : <p> Expensive . Wasteful . useless . The best &lt;$1000 I 've spent on gun stuff in years . <p> The LMA is well made and slick , and the Kidd trigger is Awesome . I tested a bunch of magazines , but maybe that 's for another thread . <p> My opinion ; This does not replace a machine gun in any way . It is however , a lot of cheap fun . I ca n't say that anyone else will appreciate the thing , but I 'm glad I bought it . My Wife , who has historically been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to go shooting almost every week since getting the thing . She now has her own . <p> The thing is as much fun as I was hoping it would be . And honestly a lot better than I had expected . I , long ago , learned the difference between hope and expectation ... <p> I 'm expecting more BX-25 and BC Steel lips magazines this week , along with a threaded barrel and " carlson thruster " thing . No idea if the thruster thing will help at all , but I do n't suppose it will hurt anything . I needed the barrel anyways for my incoming can , so I figured the $35 for the thruster would be worth experimentation . <p> A friend is getting married Saturday , so this weekend I 'm unlikely to go shooting , but once things slow down at the office , I 'll take another afternoon off , and go do some more shooting . <p> Is this the one that runs around $700 as I ca n't remember what the exact name of it is , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read somewhere I thought the special trigger was about half the cost it seemed like . Thanks for the review and videos ! <p> Is this the one that runs around $700 as I ca n't remember what the exact name of it is , who is selling it or who is making it now ? I read somewhere I thought the special trigger was about half the cost it seemed like . Thanks for the review and videos ! <p> Yup , this one is the " Akins Accelerator 2 " it runs about $650 , including the $320 Kidd trigger . <p> I bought mine from a mom &amp; pop shop , but they can be had from the distributor/ manufacturer Fostech Here . <p> If you decide to get the " Carlson thruster " do n't bother buying it from fostech . The same thing is $35 at brownells and other places . <p> I found that the magazines work almost exactly the same with the stock as they do in the standard carbine . This 10/22 was never too ammunition picky , but has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Best magazines are the Ruger factory 10 round and BX-25 mags . Followed closely by the Butler Creek " steel lips " mags . The 10 round mag goes quick , but it 's also been the easiest to dump consistently for first time shooters ( probably due to light weight ? ) <p> For ammo , so far , the best bulk stuff I 've found for consistency in this and other guns is the Federal " auto match " ammo . It 's $13 for 325 rounds , it 's been as reliable as mini-mags have been , at less than half the price . <p> Glad to see you and your wife enjoying your Akins Accelerator version 2 . Available from Fostech for $629.00 including the $320.00 Kidds trigger that is sooo much better than the unmodified factory trigger . Some of mine work okay with my volquartsen hammer modified trigger , but with each 10/22 being slightly different , Fostech wanted them to work correctly right out of the box , with no tweaking and no dissatisfied customers . So they included the Kidds trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying about $300.00 for the stock and the rest is for the Kidds trigger pack . Yes the Kidds trigger pack is expensive , but I 've used unmodified factory triggers , volquartsen parts modified triggers , but the Kidds trigger is great and no muss no fuss nor fitting nor lapping of parts . It 's worth it . <p> Also hello to Garrett . I 've seen your videos at other sites of you using my old AA minus the spring by you just pushing against the magazine . The reason the isometric tension of my AA2 seems to work better with the forward grip as opposed to you pressing against the mag with your thumb , is slightly complicated . But basically it has to do with leverage . With pushing forward against the mag with you thumb like that , you have a short leverage and limited amount of muscle control due to such short leverage . With using your entire arm , it improves that ratio . Kinda hard to explain . You 'll have to trust me . But still , you do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed . <p> Garrett , since you were one of my original accelerator customers , did you know that ( except for the cost of the Kidds trigger pack ) I will pick up the bill for retrofitting your original Akins Accelerator to " AA2 " configuration , to enable it accepting a movable forward grip where you can push forward on the forward grip instead of having to push against the mag ? Just call Judd at Fostech 's website and tell him you were an original AA customer and have a wooden stock you 'd like retro-fitted . If for any reason he ca n't retrofit your wooden one , I will swap you out a brand new plastic one already retrofitted . Sending you a p.m. with my number so you can reach me if needed . Although I am not personally in the Fostech company itself , and as such I do not corporately advertise for them , ( although I have wrongfully been accused at several websites as doing just that even though it is n't true ) , I am however close friends with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former AA customers of mine that I see online know they can send their old AA 's in to Fostech and have them retrofitted at MY cost and all they will have to pay for is the Kidds trigger pack . Just something I wanted to do for my former customers who suffered along with my old ( now dissolved ) company when the ATF rescinded its previous two approvals on my Akins Accelerator and made everyone turn in their springs . <p> Here 's a pic of one of my personal AA2 's with the muzzlebooster shroud design I developed for it . I only have four of these muzzlebooster shroud prototypes built right now , so they are n't available to the public for now . Works just like any other muzzlebooster. 1/2x28 tpi threaded barrel screws into cupped piston head end . Shroud end acts as a cylinder and traps gas between exit hole and cupped piston , giving more impulse rearward to the barrel . Just like a muzzlebooster on a Vickers , Browning or MG34/42 . In addition to adding more rearward impulse to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being burned on a hot barrel and also your sights or scope stays stationary instead of moving with the barrel plus sights and scopes being mounted on the shroud will not add weight to your barrel . You can also use the factory sights by just tapping them out of their dovetails on the barrel and re-installing them onto the shroud . Or you can use different sights or scope , etc . <p> The shroud mounts on top of the linear motion assembly using the same holes already in the linear motion assembly , but using special screws that replace the ordinary LMA screws . Also uses a rod aligner to make sure the barrel 's muzzle is perfectly lined up with the bullet exit hole on the screw off booster cap . The shroud also does an excellent job of filling up the space you can see around the barrel in the stock . Kinda looks like a Bingham or a Beretta subgun from WW2 . I loosely based the cooling hole pattern on the 1919a4 . Even though in 2006 I designed it to go onto my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no problem . Not available to the public as an AA2 accessory yet , but hopefully one day in the future . Anyway , thought you 'd get a kick out of seeing it . <p> Shroud/muzzlebooster on original AA back in 2006 , me test firing it . Note empty cases in air . <p> Someone else shooting my AA with shroud/muzzlebooster back in 2006 . <p> Another 2006 photo . <p> Kind of a blurry pic , but shows the two piece piston with delron ring screwed onto barrel . <p> A few pics of the muzzlebooster/shroud on my personal AA2 . <p> And here 's one of the shroud/muzzlebooster prototypes installed in my first of three prototype mini MG dress up kits designs for the Ruger 10/22 mounted on a camera tripod . This one has that " tongue " projection going forward under the front of the receiver to hold the linear motion assembly and back in 2006 I designed it for use with the original AA as well as intended it to have a pistol grip behind the factory trigger . I changed the pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly so it would n't reciprocate and added a BMF crankfire trigger attachment to it . I 'm going to keep the spade grips but install a trigger in front of each spade grip and unlock the now springless linear motion assembly so the barreled receiver can reciprocate within the faux mini mg receiver . Then attach a transfer bar to the right spade grip trigger that goes to the factory trigger . Then by drilling a hole in the rear faux receiver plate , a rod coming from the left grip trigger will keep isometric tension against the receiver . So it will be a tripod mounted , dual spade grip , isometric tension , bumpfire , mini mg dress up kit for the Ruger 10/22 . That will also utilize the same muzzlebooster shroud as described above . But got to get the shroud produced first , so the mini mg dress up kit for the 10/22 is down the road a ways yet . <p> First mini MG dress up prototype for Ruger 10/22 . Mounted on camera tripod . M60 MG spider sight adapted to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front sight which is adjustable for elevation . I plan to easily adapt this one to bumpfire using right grip trigger to a transfer bar to factory trigger and using the left grip trigger to a push rod going into hole in rear of faux receiver to push rear of Ruger receiver forward which enables bumpfiring . But likely this one will be the only version for bumpfiring . As my second and third prototypes do not lend themselves to bumpfiring but to crankfiring only because of the way the water jacket is mounted . But both proto 's 2 and 3 will eventually be crankfired in a way that both hands can still grasp the spade grips . <p> Second and truly water cooled , mini MG dress up for Ruger 10/22 with cone flash hider on my MG3 tripod . <p> The terror of all gophers ! Grin . <p> 3rd prototype mini MG dress up kit for 10/22 . I took everything I learned from protos 1 and 2 and changed a lot and made it an interchangeable in under a minute to be either air or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both use a water jacket , it was too hard to make them able to bumpfire . So proto #3 will be a crankfire only but I plan to adapt it to where both hands can grasp the spade grips while bumpfiring . <p> My 3rd prototype in air cooled mode . I can use either rear ladder sight or spider sight with tall front sight . Rear ladder sight base is quickly removable . No crankfire setup on it yet when these pics were taken . <p> As can be seen below , ladder sight rear sight base is quickly removable by removing one knurled nut and pulling threaded rod out just slightly , then entire base can be taken off gun if I want to use the spider sight without the other rear sight on the gun . But I can also use the spider sight with the ladder rear sight base still attached . <p> My third prototype is interchangeable from air to truly water cooled in seconds . My 2nd and 3rd proto 's are the only truly water cooled 10/22 's existing I believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress up the 10/22 to look like a browning 1919 or 1917 , but they use fake water jackets , ca n't be crank fired , can not use anything other than a 10 rd rotary magazine , and require heavy machining of the receiver and trigger guard . My design requires no modification nor machining of the Ruger 10/22 in any way . I designed my dress up kit around the existing Ruger 10/22 design instead of requiring modification to the 10/22 . Then of course there is the Tippman made by Lakeside Machine . A fine mini copy of the Browning , but that is n't a 10/22 but a miniaturization of the Browning . Tippman parts can only be gotten from Tippman and are not as inexpensive as 10/22 parts , .... which are available everywhere . <p> Third proto in water cooled mode changed from air cooled in seconds ( except for time filling up with water naturally ) . Using 50 rd MWG magazine . No crankfire setup on it yet when these pics were taken . <p> Mister Akins you sir are a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look towards what comes out in the future ! I am now becoming very interested in the AA2 from Fostech which unfortunately means I need to start looking for things to sell . <p> Any idea if Fostech will start selling some of the folding stock versions of the AA2 ? That 's what I was really looking for . <p> No idea at this time Tony . When I transferred my patent and existing stock inventory to them , I sent them a jig that holds the stock so the rear portion can be precisely milled off so a Choate folder could be attached like on my personal stock in my above pics . Currently they are using that jig to hold the stock so it can be retrofitted by relieving the fore end to accept the retrofit . In the way they have that jig set up currently , I do n't believe it can be used to retrofit the fore end AND mill off the rear portion to accept a Choate folder . What really needs to be done is an insert placed into the mold so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the jig could be used for milling off the rear of the stock as it was used originally to make the folding versions . It is also maybe possible that in addition to a fore end insert in the mold so retrofitting is n't necessary , that another block insert could be adapted to the mold so that the rear of the stock would not have to be milled off to accept a folder . Perhaps one day in the future . I have some ideas I 'm going to share with them about that . But for right now , they are just trying to keep up production to meet demand and modifying molds is n't cheap , so it 's not something that will happen in the short run probably . <p> Bill , I got ta say thanks for your idea .

Most guys like to replace the entire lower with a factory Micro lower but they 've become impossible to find , so instead you can remove the block that 's in the bottom of the semi lower . <p> Once you do that you 're rock to rock , although you probably want to consider installing a folding stock to keep the gun under control .

You 'll have to decide if you want to register an open or closed bolt . A closed bolt would be like an original factory Micro . The open bolt would run slower but you have to deal with the feet that stick out on the front of an open bolt . <p> You 'll also have to decide if you want to put a stock on the gun . A full auto Micro without a stock is n't much fun to shoot . If you put a stock on the gun , then the bolt MUST stay in the gun or you have to register the gun as an SBR.

Thanks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OP . <p> Apparently , I was looking for the wrong thing . Or I had thought the clearance cut was something else . I 've never really played with a semi-auto so I was apparently assuming in the wrong direction . Having looked at the pictures in the Library , I think I do have the clearance cut on both my Group bolt ( and yes - it does have a G followed by a 6- or 7-digit number ) as does my bolt from BarrelXChange . I 've got a bolt from an Israeli parts kit which is a standard SMG bolt , and does not have the relief cut . We 're not talking about much material here , are we ? <p> I was going to respond , along with a couple of pictures . I thought I 'd clean it first so people did n't have to guess what was hidden underneath all of the carbon buildup. : eek <p> More to follow . 71163 @qwx691163 <p> 03-31-2010 , 11:52 PM <p> yes please , I do n't  have much to remove , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restrictor ring . I think it will work fine w/ a modified restrictor ring , but I do n't  have the host yet . <p> More pictures the marrier . <p> Garrett <p> 04-01-2010 , 12:05 AM <p> Okay try this . <p> The part that blocks the restrictor ring appears to be a small chamfer at the outer circumference of the area adjacent to the boltface. ( help me out if I 'm wrong here , Amphibian ) . <p> The amount of material to be removed actually appears to be fairly minimal . This picture shows the differences between the bolt without the clearance cut , and the two with . <p> LONG ... <p> If you had a relatively large diameter cutter , you could almost just do a straight plunge cut and take it in one swipe . It looks like something with a 0.830 " diameter would work . I would think a 3/4 " or 13/16 " cutter would be stiff enough , even extended out that distance to do the work you need . <p> Also , once you get the host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will need to remove . <p> The difference is more noticeable when you see the barrels in place with the bolts . Notice the Israeli SMG barrel ( top ) has a 45 degree chamfer at the chamber end that matches up with the chamfer on the bolt . The Group barrel is squared off and fits into the squared off recess . <p> LONG ... <p> There is apparently enough slop that the Israeli bolt works with the Group barrel . It would seem the semi-auto restrictor ring is slightly larger diameter , or extends back a little farther . <p> I actually prefer the configuration of the Group barrel . Every other SMG barrel I 've ever seen had the 45 degree cut at the chamber . These all feed round-nose ammo just fine , but choke on JHP or FP bullets . The Group barrel eats them all reasonably well . Here 's an end-view I took a few years ago . The Group barrel is on the left and the Israeli barrel in the middle . Notice how the Group barrel has more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right is a surplus barrel that appeared to have been over-polished . <p> LONG ... 71163 @qwx691163 <p> 04-01-2010 , 12:13 AM <p> That was exactly what I needed . <p> Yes I have a 3/4 cobalt bit that should work if I take it slowly . I 'd get a carbide end mill if I need too but I really do n't  think its nessecary . <p> I 'll cut the slot w/ a carbide cutting wheel on my bench grinder and then clean the slot up w/ a 3/8 crowning endmill . <p> I think that 's about it , the bolts are hard but I do n't  think they are over 60r . Most likely 35-40r so if I take my time and use a sharp well lubricated end mill it wont be a probblem . Its all about taking small amounts off at a pass . Like less than .3000 <p> I 'll post some pictures once I start working on it . <p> Thanks a lot for the pictures ! 71163 @qwx691163 <p> 04-01-2010 , 12:35 AM <p> Well , as I feared its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNC shop in Dallas and see if they have anything 11/16X5/8 or 3/4X3/4 that has a shank longer than 10cm . <p> I 'll need a minimum of 1.25-1.50 in the collet to hold solid .

Tomorrow night I 'll start cutting the slott w/ a 3/16carbide key cutter . It will probably take about 30 passses to get'er done but its simple enough .

Well , my kids are getting old enough that I have been able to shoot more again this summer and I have regretted selling my 45 Parts and not just getting it to work so I purchased a Vector Arms 45 ACP Grease Gun conversion and these days I have a decent digital camera so I can share pics . <p> Oh yea , sorry so dirty ... I got to go shooting and wanted to take pics in decent light ... <p> Ejector location with 45ACP bolt and barrel and IMI 16-rd UZI mag : <p> Ejector location with 45ACP bolt and barrel and IMI 16-rd UZI mag : <p> Ejector location with 45ACP bolt and barrel and IMI 16-rd UZI mag : <p> Factory UZI magazine well with no mag . NOTE that the hole in the receiver is the SAME size as the UZI grip assembly ! <p> Different Angle <p> Different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion group on the right . Note how the Grease Gun lower has a larger opening then the UZI lower . <p> Same as above - whole assembly . <p> First problem - This is the grease gun lower pinned to my receiver with a Grease gun magazine . Note that I need to remove 1/16th to 1/8th of an inch for the grease gun mag to fit into the receiver . <p> Second problem - The grease gun lower does not pin to the receiver . It looks like the something in the grip is hitting the ejector plate or the ejector rivet ( ca n't really tell were the contact is but this can not be pushed down ) . <p> Other side of description from above . <p> Here is a photo of the bottom of my Vector . Obviously , if 1/16th to 1/8th of an inch just needs to be removed from the rear there is room in front of the rivet to do this . I just do n't want to take the dremmel to my UZI ! <p> So , I am looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UZI looks different then other Vector UZIs that use these grease gun conversions ? <p> I am trying to get some oppinions if I should send the Vector UZI with my 9mm and 45 ACP parts back to Vector Arms and have them modify things and then refinish the gun ? <p> I have a few 45 ACP mags that I have purchased so I can use the Vector in 45 ACP but the 30-rd Grease gun mags sure look like a lot more fun then the 16-rd UZI mags . Just the same , my MAC 10/9 has an UZI mag well conversion and I am working on that this summer as well to get it running in 45 ACP using the 45 ACP UZI mags .... ( Very strange how that works out ) <p> I welcome any feedback or comments from others that use these grease gun conversions . I might also be able to modify my grease gun mags but the amount of metal I would neet to remove seems pretty extensive hence I am leaning towards adjusting the UZI receiver itself . <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bend the tab on the front of it UP a little this should give you the added room to install the retaining pin , do n't worry if you go to far , you can bend it back to remove slop if needed . <p> Once you get the trigger group on you might not have any mag problems but if you do : <p> 2 . For the mags , I have worked on a few 100 of the GG mags for the UZI , due to a small variance from manufacturer to manufacturer and lot to lot , some work and some do n't . To fit the mag you have to grind off a little on the rear of the mag to get it into the receiver and lock up . It does n't take alot but a belt sander is the fastest way and you can touch up the mag with cold blue when done . ( hope this makes sense ) <p> I know it 's been said before that for the money you should n't have to make any mods to the mags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt a mag from a different gun to the UZI , some possible fitting should be expected , though I know there are others out there that have worked without a hitch . <p> Most of the problems have to do with the way they are welded . I have seen the magwell about 2 degrees off and canted forward at the bottom . This will make the top of the mag tip slightly to the rear , hence needing to grind off a little on the rear of the feedlips , Kind of a hassle but it only takes seconds to fix and once it 's done that 's it . <p> Ihofeld You have a Chris Humphries lower , the main difference is the mag catch , Vectors is thinner <h> Send it to Vector <p> First off ... you still have the 9mm Feed ramp in the gun ... your gun will be less finiky if you get the solid semi feed ramp installed ... It is a recommended fix for the 45 acp cartridge .. There are many many threads here on the subject ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out my options as I have no problems with the 9mm UZI but now is the time when I should get the 45ACP stuff figured out if I am ever going to get it done ... in a few years Vector may forget how to do full auto UZIs .... <p> The UZI runs fine with the 16-rd 45 ACP mags ( I did n't shoot a lot but 3-mags went without an issue ) so I am having a tough time deciding . I also have a semi-auto Vector on the way and if the grease gun lower fits on there perhaps I will use it on the semiauto but boy is that anticlimatic compared to the Vecor SMG ! <p> If I can do this by modifying just the M3A1 lower and minor mag work I will be happy ... If it still requires getting the receiver altered I need to think hard ... I will try to play with this soon but I had to work all weekend .

What is the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mod the mags ? I am really leary about grinding the mags . I specifically bought a GG lower Uzi so I could use the same mags in other platforms . Will modifying the mags so that they fit the gun give me any problems if I want to use those same mags in ( say ) a MAC or a USC with GG conversion ? <p> I ca n't tell what is keeping your lower from seating . I had the same problem , but it was not that the lower would n't seat it was the pin hole . Vector welded up the 9mm pin hole in my lower and re drilled it to 8mm. when they did they missed and plased the pin hole .020 to high in the lower . this caused the lower to sit at an angle like yours . when the lower is not tight against the bottom of the upper it causes the round to catch on the bolt face ring . I do n't weld so it is at Vector now being rewelded and remachined . I machined approximately .060 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper so that it would use unmodified GG mags . Otherwise you 'll have to modify your magazines . I 'd send the hole thing to Vector and talk to Rex if I were you . I do n't know if they will open the upper for unmodified GG mags but they probably will if you ask .

What makes the Mite hard to take apart after a lot of use is that the caked-up foulings collect along the inside of the tube between where the monocore " holes " do n't touch the tube ... you have to twist the monocore vs. the tube for removal .... not easy if the fouling is all around . <p> this is why SilencerCo invented the Sparrow .

Am I reading you right ? There is a copper based form of anti-seize available . Never used any in a suppressor myself , so I 've no opinion on its usefulness . <p> I 've also heard of people coating their baffles with a variety of " lubes " in an attempt to make cleaning easier . I think the jury 's still out on that one . <p> BTW , using OIL inside a suppressor will cause it to smoke like crazy , so you really do n't want to use any actual oil-based lubricant . <p> ETA : Just read your last post .

It is a product for shooting black powder rifles . He posters said that they coated the internals with this product . They could pull the can apart and simply wipe the carbon off with a rag . <p> A few years ago I used to shoot a lot of cast lead bullets . Shooting cast lead through a 1928 Thompson would plug up the slots in the compensator . We used a product called " Carters Compensator - Muzzle Brake Spray " All that was required was to spray it in and on top of the compensator and the lead would not stick to it . It also worked to keep lead from forming around the cylinders on revolvers . I THINK Midway USA sold it . I have n't seen it for a few years . Maybe someone here knows if its still available . Never tried it in a suppressor . <p> One problem with suppressors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be hard/impossible to get apart .

If you ca n't physically get your hands on the RR to check , ask what other uppers have been on the gun and if any were tight , etc . <p> Basically you 're dancing around a question that the seller might not want to volunteer the answer if it 's not milspec .

Not only is a hole drilled through the receiver for the USGI auto sear , extra clearance must be made inside the receiver so the USGI auto sear can function . Many Class II manufacturers did n't have the receiver reanodized after the clearance work .

There is such a HUGE difference in these weapons and folks frequenting this forum should spend a few minutes to acquaint themselves with the model numbers and designations between manufacturers , guns , and calibers . Both MAC-11s and M11A1s are .380 calibers and if you 're purchasing spare parts , magazines , or ammo you damn sure need to know what you have when you order ! A simple glance at your Form 4 will tell you exactly what you own . Calling your M11/9 a MAC-11 around inexperienced folks with little or no title 2 knowledge and experience may help them understand what it is they 're seeing/shooting , so heck , go ahead and call it a MAC-10 sinse everyone knows that model . I 'd like to think that owners of these transferable weapons know and understand exactly what they own and represent them as such especially in this forum where many RKIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , and hopefully they can learn from this forum just as I have . <p> FWIW , Vector advertised in SAR magazine for several years using full page ads . They called their product " UZI style " weapons . Yeah , it 's an Uzi , but in reality , they 're Group registered receivers finished by Vector and if it 's not made by IMI , it 's really not an Uzi ... it 's an Uzi style weapon just as Vector advertised them . They do n't list Uzi anywhere on the receiver or Form 4 . That 's why most people will say they own a Vector Uzi , or GI Uzi if it 's not an IMI . Just saying ... <p> The Ingram MAC-11 ( Military Armament Corporation Model 11 Advancement 1 or M11A1 ) is a machine pistol designed by Gordon Ingram at the Military Armament Corporation ( MAC ) during the 1970s .

Its only $400 . <p> farmallsh <p> 02-03-2013 , 12:33 PM <p> Yes , there were several companies that made an " over the barrel " suppressor such as LaFrance Specialties , Surefire and Advanced Armament . The most extreme of the was the LaFrance M4 which was made to slide over an M4 profiled barrel about 5-6 " s . I have a couple of these at the shop . Older design but very cool . The others use a mount that cantilevers back over the barrel about 2.5 " s . Ironically both AAC and Surefire have discontinued that design . As far as an over the barrel suppressor for a 16 " UZI I 've not seen anything . Like others have said , SBR it and buy a regular Uzi can . <p> K2 <p> 02-12-2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAC made an Uzi can that used a perforated 16 " barrel . At first it was a head scratch as to why he did that until you consider a S/A carbine is legal with this can and the OAL of the Uzi is just like a SMG . I 've shot the can . It works . Not as quiet as modern designs but you sure will never get a baffle strike with it either : ) 
@@77050949 @5750949/ <p> Okay , I really do n't need this gun . If anything in a 9mm handgun , I would like a Glock 17 . But , I went into the local sporting goods store and found a Tec 9for $395 . I have n't been in the market for one in a loooong time . That 's kinda ' why I want it .... reminds me of being young and drooling over the counter with my younger bro .

Kinda strange for this dealer ... they had a Century Golani in last week for $1100 ! ! ! The stupid thing is that it was n't in there today . I do n't know what it actually sold for , but I bet it was way too much . I stopped at all the gun shops today . In all , I saw one AR15 on the wall . Getting silly . On a happy note , Walmarty had 9mm WWB in so I grabbed a case . $199.99 and no sales tax is pretty good these days . <p> My hope is that it 's a shooter and the novilty would not wear off too quickly . Like I said , that 's really why I 'd buy it . <p> MrM4 <p> 02-14-2009 , 12:02 AM <p> I would strongly recomend buying somthing else , plastic receivers are never good .

Do n't waste your money unless you just have to have the paperweight ( Tec 9 ) to fill a void in some kind of collection you have . <p> sunnybean <p> 02-14-2009 , 06:00 PM <p> Wow ! There 's a lot of hatred for the Tec 9 here . I missed all your negative comments while I was out shooting it . I ran 150 rounds down the pipe without a single hiccup . Hell , that 's better than my MAX11 could do today .... or Norinco 320 ... or my Saiga 12 for that matter . Now , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , I have to say I 'm happy with it . Recoil was light , it went bang every time I pulled the trigger , mags seem well built , the plastic is fine ( for now ) , sights are poor and accuracy is shit . I did n't buy it for the last two . <p> I guess you can all go ahead and flame me for buying a " POS " . I where nomex most of the time , so I 'm used to a the heat . Like I said to begin , this purchase was strictly for nostalgia/novelty . I guess it 's hard to get opinions on whether or not to buy a gun when you 're dealing with old feelings . When I was very young my little brother and I would drool for hours over these . Actually , the gun store had MACs and Tec 9s . We 'd go home and tell my dad that we HAD to have them . Of course , his response was , why would you ever want a " gangster machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , 20+ years later , I guess I still wanted one . I do n't see my brother much and this gun will always remind me of him . It will remind me of my dad and his constant bashing of EBR 's . It will remind me of where I grew up . All of these things ... good or bad ... bring a smile to my face . I do n't think the novelty will wear off as quickly as MrM4 's did ( one week ) . I doubt I 'll ever sell this gun . Actually , now that I know it works , I 'll tear it apart , clean it , lightly oil it , and probably never do much with it other than let it sit in the safe and remind me of simpler times . <p> Thanks for the replies , even though I went against most of your advice . <p> : soapbox Look , these are ' fun guns ' . Nobody buys one of these for accuracy or full auto conversion or law enforcement . Along with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V-10s ( the only Vulcan arms gun that actually works ) , Specialty Weapons MP-5s and YES ... I have a once fired Tec 9 ! I stuffed 30 rds of 124gr in it and let er rip:uzi . OMG what fun . Ran like a Ferrari . Accuracy was ... well ... : cry . But , at the 30ft that I was shooting it , all the rounds would have hit a human target . Not too bad considering I was pulling the trigger as fast as possible . Just wait to the new bans come . Your $400 investment will go up to at least $1k and then up each year . Ya want quality , buy an original Galil or Sig556 . Want fun ? you just got it for a lot less . I would give you your entire investment back to you in a heartbeat , I 'd hang it on my wall next to my other one.:wiggle <p> firefighter <p> 02-14-2009 , 08:12 PM <p> Well heck , you never told us you wanted one for the sake of memories . It sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fine . If it makes you that happy and brings back that kind of positive memoreies , I would have bought one too . And yours seems to shoot good so that 's a plus ! ! ! <p> Before I even got into guns like the Macs and Uzis , I was at a gun show and saw the Tec .22 . It just looked evil . I liked that . The price was right so I bought it . It is ammo sensitive but it shoots and my kids love it . It ai n't worth squat , but I 'll keep it . It was my first evil looking gun . <p> I 'm glad you 're happy with your purchase . I 'm glad it rekindles the positive memories for you . Keep it . It is now what memories are made of . Congrats . <p> sunnybean <p> 02-14-2009 , 10:04 PM <p> mhpdblue , Zombie , and firefighter . Thanks for those posts . Maybe someday I 'll reget it . For now , I really happy I bought it .

It 's been a good Valentine 's day . <p> Hey what ever makes you happy , I own guns that donr EVER get shot , just for the fact I can say I own 1 . I hope you have good luck with it . I would n't make a habit of disassembling it though , the more you mess with it the more likly it is to break the plastic receiver . I probelly would n't bet my life on it ; ) <p> sunnybean <p> 02-15-2009 , 09:02 AM <p> MrM4 , <p> Copy that . When I pulled it apart last night I had the same thought . Also , the rubber buffer fell out and is becoming pretty cracked and deformed . Probably look for a new one . Everything else looks good internally . Overall it is well broken in , but does n't look to be abused . <p> I wish the upper was the registered part . Seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a aluminum or stronger/better plastic lower for those with cracked/broken lowers . Being that the lower is the registered part it kinda voids that whole idea . <p> MrM4 <p> 02-15-2009 , 12:43 PM <p> If you need parts you may want to check gun broker from time to time you will find complete rebuild kits , usally from someone who damaged their receiver beyond repair . <p> Replacing frames on plastic hand guns is nothing new . It is fairly commmon with Glocks , Brownells sell replacment frames in Stainless Steel and Aluminum both , I suppose if you wanted to get serious with the tec 9 you could make yourself a Aluminum frame if you had the mechineing tools and know how . I bet it would never break . <p> davep32618 <p> 02-16-2009 , 06:24 PM <p> I owned one for a few years in the mid 80 's early 90 's . I liked it , it was n't an Uzi , but it was fun to have around .

It 's not a bad gun at all , the mags are the cause of the jamming issues . The sights on the later ones ( stamped steel as opposed to round buttons on early TECs or the thick blade sights of the KG-99s ) are n't in alignment with the bore that good . I installed a Pro Point Red Dot on mine and it would hit everything I aimed at after it was bore sighted in . I modified a picatinny rail and screwed it to the upper and mounted my red dot to that , but I found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope mount attach right to it . Red Dot on a TEC = gansta looks with accuracy . <p> I have one of the rare MP-9s , a RR early TEC-9 , CATCO registered KG-99 bolt , a NIB KG-9 , several NIB KG-99s &amp; TEC-9s , several VGC shooter KG &amp; TEC guns all in my evil black gansta gun collection . The good mags allow the shooters to function as intended and a " bad " mag only needs to have it 's feed lips adjusted/tweaked back into proper position to restore functionality . Back in ' 04 joeblack ( m60joe ) suggested a small tack weld where the lips fold over to stop them from spreading out . I 'm going to see about getting all of my mags in alignment in the upcoming months and getting the tack welds in place . Right now I have some mags that will run 1200 rpm in the FAs ( proper feed lips ) and others that are spread and allow the bolt to hit them in forward travel effectively stopping the bolt travel and causing a partial strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% on the magazine . <p> Repairman , impressive collection . I have a few but not nearly that many . You are right about the mag . Usually the issue with the gun not functioning correctly is a direct result of the mag . I had issues with a couple that I picked up and switched out to mags that I knew worked and bingo . No issues . <p> sunnybean <p> 02-20-2009 , 07:48 PM <p> Repairman , <p> That is is sick collection of Tec 9s ... and that 's only part of it ? Wow .

The 18 " fixed stock is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the HOWCO/Gun South 16 " paratroopers that sat in a warehouse for over 12 years because the NJ state police cancelled their order before delivery . Arms &amp; Ordnance had Curtis Higggins convert it and I bought it NIB w/2 factory mags , sling , cleaning kit in grip &amp; factory sighting in target . <p> I originally bought the semi auto fixed stock at a good price as a parts source for the machine gun but when the bankruptcy court ordered the disbursement of the last of the full auto trip sears , I was lucky to get one of the first offered ( at a decent price ) and another working machine gun was born.:fal <p> Repairman , ... and that 's only part of it ? Ya know , you got me thinking about it and I really did n't know the exact number of TEC style guns that I owned . I bought the whole NIB collection in one shot and others here and there and I would just tuck them away , so I went down stairs in the basement , pulled them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it I recorded all the serial numbers , something I 've been meaning to do for a few years now .

Did you get a photo of ALL of them together ? That would be sweet . <p> Repairman <p> 02-22-2009 , 12:27 AM <p> Here 's a pic of the total TEC/KG collection .

The first model sold in the US was the semi-auto open bolt KG-9 . I have n't seen one recently for sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very common to see them with prices in the $1800 to $2200 price range . Condition dictates , of course , and a shooter will always be less . Mine is unfired in box as it came from Interdynamic ( upper right gun in pic ) as should fetch at least $2500 in front of collectors . <p> The last two FA TECs that I saw listed online in the last year both had $6500 on them and the listings went away real fast . That tells me someone bought them quickly and for close to asking $ . Before Aug ' 08 , I hade n't seen a FA TEC up for sale in over 2 years , rarity commands a higher price than a M11/9 . <p> ***EDIT*** Ha , in the time I was composing , Surly posts up a FA TEC ! $6800 is where I 've seen them and this guy probably had a hunderd or so on top to cover the stainless host gun . Stainless makes it no better than a non stainless , except it 's prettier . My choice would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OR any TEC-9 that has the threaded end cap , which would reduce the threat of receiver cracking to zero . <p> And to answer the cracking issue , AFAIK , cracking comes with using above 115gr ammo and the risk increases with the buffer pad missing . I 'd bet the cracked receiver stories are from the missing buffer pads and using 124gr NATO rounds . <p> prebans <p> 02-22-2009 , 12:13 PM <p> ( snip ) <p> And to answer the cracking issue , AFAIK , cracking comes with using above 115gr ammo and the risk increases with the buffer pad missing .

I did use the cheap Wolf steel case for a while , but that stuff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primer caps would stick to the firing pin , so when I used it up I never bought any more . My favorite is the Winchester 124gr NATO 9mm in the Vector UZIs and the M11/9 because it runs faster . I used to think that $65/500 was pricey , but at the gunshow today the current price on that stuff was $149/500 and the .556x45 that I crabbed about paying $165/1000 is now $440/1000 , so F them , I did n't buy any . <p> I have enough ammo for bad times , just not enough to waste at washing machines and freezers , so not having a BulletFest is n't bothering me as far as the shooting goes , not seeing all the regulars , that 's another story . 
@@77050950 @5750950/ <p> At one point I used to know how to tune &amp; time the ejection path for AR 's , but it seems that I have forgotten . I think it had to do with the length of the ejector spring , and the length of the ejector . I ca n't remember what I was using for extractor springs &amp; extractor spring buffers . But at one point about 15 years ago , I could get all the brass into a nice little pile forward and to the right of the AR at about the 2 o'clock position . There was no need for any kind of shell deflector etc. because the brass shot forward rather than backwards or sidewards ... even if someone was standing to your right the brass would not hit them in the face or get down their shirt etc . If someone knows how to do this , then please refresh my memory : ) <p> Vegas SMG <p> 09-28-2009 , 05:48 PM <p> Loren Brunton designed the integral pyramid shaped fired cartridge and gas deflector during the development of the Colt A2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction you want and keeps the gas and spent shells away from left handed shooter 's faces .

Then you can shape the ejector and extractor to put the brass where you want it . <p> amphibian <p> 09-30-2009 , 08:10 AM <p> In my experience , brass goes forward in an M16 when it is being overgassed .

Here 's a pic of both gas blocks : <p> As pictured on the site : http : **25;2209;TOOLONG <p> What I actually got : http : **25;2236;TOOLONG <p> Notice that the pin hole on the gas block is in the center instead of towards the back . It prevents the handguard from being pinned . Not sure what to make of it . <p> The butt stock I got is the one with the rubber pad that you usually see on micros . Not sure what to do yet about the gas block pin , if anyone has more information it 'd be much appreciated . <p> base64 <p> 06-22-2013 , 04:46 PM <p> Here 's an image of the stock I received , in case anyone was curious . It is compatible with the micro however not the same stock pictured . <p> The sticker is marked IMI , Israel with a date of 2001 . <p> http : **25;2263;TOOLONG <p> adipose <p> 06-22-2013 , 06:52 PM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case anyone was curious . It is compatible with the micro however not the same stock pictured . <p> http : **25;2290;TOOLONG <p> The kits they are selling come with both kinds of stocks ( rubber padded one and skeleton old style ) ; I guess it comes down to preference . <p> if you want the other one ; I would ask if you could switch . Send me a PM if you want me to ask them . <p> As for the position on the hole ; that the bolt goes thru on the gas block ; If the barrel is in good shape ; especially with the threads ; I would just drill ( 2 ) new holes in the correct spot . If not ; ask if you could get a correct one . <p> Machinegun Messiah <p> 06-23-2013 , 12:14 AM <p> Chances are , they just got the handguards confused . I actually asked them about this possibly happening . Asked if the guns were cut up separately , and bagged . As to avoid mixing em all up . FSB hole must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that road , lol . Easy to confuse if not purposely aware . I 'm sure they will try to help you out . Dan seems like a decent fellow . <p> base64 <p> 06-23-2013 , 05:35 AM <p> Thanks for the info . My exact thought was that they got mixed up during some larger demilling/shipping process so I sent an e-mail to AU . <p> I actually prefer this stock over the other one so for me that was a big plus . It 's in *perfect* condition and has a barcode sticker on it marked IMI Israel with a date of 2001 . <p> I was more worried about the gas block so I did a little research here on the forums and found out that this is an early style gas block that was referred to as " Hadar " pattern or style . <p> I have 2 micro handguards which fit over the gas block fine and have indentations on them where the Hadar cross bolt holes should go . Not sure if this was to create a guide for adapting them to the Hadar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by the same machine . <p> Also , the gas block is marked TMC . Does anyone have an idea what this means or if it is a factory code ? <p> base64 <p> 06-23-2013 , 05:56 AM <p> I was surprised to see that the night sights had a good bit of glow left in them , here 's the best picture I could manage to get in a dark room : <p> http : **25;2317;TOOLONG <p> Machinegun Messiah <p> 06-24-2013 , 02:27 PM <p> I wonder if they have any kits with this type of HG ? <p> Also wondering what year ( aprox ) was this transitional micro HG produced ?

@@77050952 @5750952/ <p> They guy seems to be selling an IMI UZI FA receiver and boasts it 's not demilled . I got worried until I saw he was in Germany . That seems OK , but then in his description , he says he 'll cut it up for you if you need it shipped to the US , but he says he 'll make nice clean saw cuts instead of torch cuts .

The moment a receiver is cut ( per BATFE specs ) it is no longer a gun or machinegun . It could then be imported as scrap metal .

You have a minimum of 3 months to legally aquire some more money ! Get a second job , which you will need anyway to support your new ammo expenses .

Do you have a 401k that can be cashed at significant penalty ? Rake leaves , shovel snow , , , , it can be done ! How bad do you want it ? There are a bunch of guns on the C+R list that I really like ! The M3A1 " Grease Gun " is cool , 12-13K . If all you want is an M10 or M11 , , , , it will mean you move to another state about 10 minutes away . Your friends will have to come over to shoot it because it is n't allowed in Michigan until it is listed on the C+R list . It will have to be at least 50 years old ( relic ) or originally manufactured with some unusual attribute like gold plating ( curio ) . The earliest MAC10 's were produced around 1966-67 and if you could find one of these registered as " transferable " , you could petition the BATF for its inclusion on the list in about 11-12 years .

You also need to make sure it goes back far enough to catch the sear ! ! ! After you try a buffer mod , stick a few rounds in the mag and try a couple short bursts ... That way if it does n't catch the sear you do n't have to ride the hose .... <p> You wo n't get a mac11 speed out of it , but you should get a good increase ....

I am in no way any type of expert , everything I posted is my 2 cents . Cag <h> I 've owned three DLO Sten mkII 's <p> They always ran flawless . All three had the markings on the left side of the trigger group . The only downside was that in order to get them to shoot to point of aim I had to move the front sight very far over to the right , so much so that it hung over the sight channel . Sometimes , when welding the front trunion it can draw over to one side . The only thing I 'll say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my welds were much cleaner and the weld along the rear of the tube was much shorter . Makes me wonder if the gun was at some point rebuilt . Andy at KGB in Ft . Lauderdale rebuilt mine and corrected the point of aim problem and did a beautiful job on the welds along with the rest of the gun . The only other thing is because of the location of the serial number you may not be able to convert to Sterling in the future . Best Regards JB

@@77050961 @5750961/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Building a bowling ball mortar . <p> Got bored and started on an old project that got back shelved . <p> I started out with an old helium/argon/oxygen ( do n't really know what it was cause it was absent of paint ) . I torched the top off and cut the tank in half . A 8-1/2 " bowling ball would n't quite fit down it so I split it lengthwise , added a small piece of metal the thickness of the cylinder and welded it solid . I then welded a 2 by 1/2 " thick strip of metal over this for insurance purposes . <p> I then took a 3-1/2 " thick piece of solid round stock and bored a 1-1/2 " hole in it 2-3/4 " deep . This will give me a powder chamber for 2-1/2 oz of ( BLACK POWDER OR SUBSTITUTE POWDER , NO SMOKELESS ! ! ! ! ) powder . I drilled a small hole near the cone shaped end of the chamber I drilled earlier just so a canon fuze will fit in it . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end I cut the top off . ( I tried earlier to just put some powder in the concave shaped bottom of the gun without a powder chamber thinking that the weight of the ball would let the powder build up an explosion but found out that you must make a powder chamber for the charge to go off and work properly . ) The gun is upside down looking at it when you cut the top off . I am gon na weld this inside and outside with a very hot weld of at least 2 passes and probably 3 . A 2 " ball for a pickup will be the cascaball at the bottom of the mortar which will set inside of a small piece of pipe welded to a 1 " thick plate kinda like the base plate for the 81 mm mortar . I 'll have a bipod type of system for elevation and a rifle site setup which will be mounted to the side of the tube . <p> I had heard from a guy that 200 grains of black powder was all that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long ways . Little bro and I found out earlier with the prototype mortar I built a week ago that we could throw a ball further . Found out it was supposed to be 1200 grains instead . With 1200 grains of powder we were sending 16 pound balls 1/4 mile with a very high angle , so 1/2 mile is very probable . It goes off with a hell of a loud boom followed by a funny whistling sound . You can see the ball go up and damned near out of sight ..... then watch the tiny black dot decend with the funny whistling sound the air makes going past the finger holes in the ball , followed by a pretty impressive thud with a cloud of dust . We did n't use a t-shirt patch like some guys do and had great results . Our prototype had a 3/8 " base plate and it caved in after 6 shots . <p> I 'll post pictures and hopefully some video this weekend or so . <p> Jim <p> Attached Images <p> Last edited by jarhead jim ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pissing me off ! <p> I was Beat by a cute GIRL at the UT6 SMG Match and I did not even get a lousy T-Shirt <p> You can get DOM tubing that is really close fitting but expensive as all get out .

Unlike an 01 FFL , my understanding is they can not just show up and demand an inspection from an 03 licensee .

Although I am unaware of any compliance inspection of a collector , this is an option to be considered seriously . The simple truth is that you never want a BATF employee in your home if it can be avoided . <p> This was obviously written before the current rash of C&amp;R inspections , but the law itself has n't changed , just their tendancy to exercise the inspections . <p> You should have read up on the regs before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to better deal with the situation . <p> Good points already made above . To recap : 1 ) Agent was an idiot that not only did n't understand what he was sent there to do but did things NOT authorized . Sounds like he thought you were an 01FFL as well . 2 ) You should NOT have let him in in the first place . C&amp;R audits are not done based on " business hours " as an 01FFL . The regs are pretty clear that they MUST make an " appointment " and that the audit can take place at other than your licensed address . Now they can stop every day and ask to come in , but they are not " permitted " to make un-announced checks - period . It is up to you to know this and not WAIVE your rights . <p> 3 ) Agent had NO business asking , checking , or commenting on your non C&amp;R guns -PERIOD . Now he can ask to see them but the CORRECT answer would be a prompt , polite NO . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blatantly violated your rights by means of what appears to be deception ( I assume you did not know you did n't " have to " let them in ) And the ridiculous and unwarranted questions such as " armor piercing ammo " .

You could have seriously incriminated yourself being how stupid this particular agent was ( not knowing an AR15 upper is not a " receiver " <p> Evidence found against you would be entirely admissable in court if you waive your rights and invite them in . Even if it is BULLSHIT you will still need to go to court and spend the $$$ to defend yourself . <p> Not trying to pick on you I just want to use your situation to hopefully she 'd some light of concern on this situation for others . <p> I agree with PA Patriot about filing a complaint . This guy wasted a lot of your time and violated your rights . I 'd write them , explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and feel wronged by this incident . I 'd then request a formal letter of apology . Do it politely . If you ask for a written response , they have to provide one . That 's the rules of the govt .

Absolutely no ATF or anybody else comes in my house to look at my stuff unannounced without a search warrant . <p> I 've printed a copy of the law and will have it handy to give this guy if he shows up at my door . I 'm not " in the business " and I do not have to give up my personal privacy rights . <p> GDOG1 : No offense , but Pa . Patriot is right . C&amp;R licensees do not have hours .

It does NOT authorize a person to engage in the business of dealing in curios and relics . <p> I do intend to write a letter to The local ATF in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . It was BS and partly my fault , but that really does n't matter in the end . <p> I am not sure if I told you all or not , but the reason he said he had to look at my personal weapons was because all of my guns were all placed together and it was difficult for him to tell what was what . So he needed to go through them all and see what C&amp;R weapons I had in relation to my bound book . <p> Just to make things clear , He did not snoop around my entire house . I stayed with him the entire time and we went through the process together . That is why it took so much time out of my day-days . I was not about to leave him at my house alone . He asked about mags , and I showed him a few I had lying around on the floor . He did not go through the entire stash I have .

The first round fires fine but then I am getting a fair number of light primer strikes . The hammer drops , the round fires , the action cycles , strips a new round and the breech locks . I pull the trigger and get click . Examination of the round shows a light indentation on the primer from the firing pin . The gun is clean and well lubricated . <p> I am using old Russian military surplus ammo ( hard primers perhaps ) . When I look at the bolt and firing pin assembly , I can see that the firing pin floats ( i.e. it is not held back by a separate spring ) . When the weapon is tilted up , the firing pin falls back and there is a fair amount of it protruding behind the rear surface of the bolt . Plenty for the hammer to hit and drive forward . <p> When the gun is level , or tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No spring and no gravity assist due to the orientation of the gun . The rear of the firing pin looks about flush with the read of the bolt assembly . Seems like the hammer comes forward and hits the rear of the bolt , but the ass end of the firing pin is not protruding back far enough to get a good whack . <p> This would seem to be a normal consequence of the design , but obviously , since AKs are legendary for reliability , the system must work . Seems like maybe the firing pin needs to be a little longer , so more of it would stick out past the back of the bolt assembly . I also read somewhere that you can file the front of the pin to a point which decreases the area of the primer that is struck , but increases the force applied to the area that the sharpened pin hits . This was listed as a cure for light primer strikes on hard primer military ammo . <p> So I thought maybe my firing pin is worn ( this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The front of the pin is blunt . Maybe it needs to be sharpened , or replaced . So I started digging around parts sites and have found that there is more than one type of firing pin - some are round and some are triangular ? ? <p> I have several other AKs and all their firing pins look about the same as the one that is acting up ( round , blunt front ) . I have not had time to try swapping them around . This is all semi-auto , by the way . Any advice is appreciated . <p> Sometimes the rear of the firing pin , over time gets hammered enough that it starts to mushroom , this makes it shorter , and also may prevent it from going all the way forward .

I 'm going to say the top three ( in no order ) are the GM hydramatics , Colt 602 , and the m16a2s with m16a3 reinforcements and finishing .

@@77050971 @5750971/ <p> I 'm fascinated by the history and evolution of different firearm designs and I 've recently done a lot of research on the first generation of sub-machine guns and familiarized myself with the mechanics of the simple blow-back action of guns like the sten , PPS-43 , and many other very similar guns . <p> I 've now decided to try and learn more about the next generation of sub guns like the CZ-26 , FMK-3 , Kommando and of course the Uzi . At first glance it appears that this generation of sub-guns works in a very similar fashion except with the improved design of a telescoping bolt allowing a more compact overall package while keeping barrel length around the same . Also the magazines that insert through a hollow pistol grip which in combination with the placement of the barrel farther back and the bolt design I assume would make for a more compact and better balanced gun . Do I have this about right ?

@@77050976 @5750976/ 71162 @qwx691162 <p> Why do n't we evaluate the Galil against the actual rifle that Israel adopted in its place , not the current version of the M-16 ( which is the version everyone refers to when extolling the M-16 's virtues ) . <p> Remember that until the mid-80 's , the only form of the M-16 available for adoption was the M-16A1 . The US did n't adopt the M-16A2 until the mid-80s , and when they did , US aid to Israel and other countries were still of the A1 so that we could get rid of all those surplus rifles . So , when Israel decided on the M-16 over the Galil , they were adopting the M-16A1 , not the M-16A2 or subsequent designs . <p> Now let 's look at the supposed advantages of the M-16 over the Galil : <p> Accuracy - The superior accuracy of the modern M-16/AR-15 over the Galil is really not relevant to the purpose of an assault rifle , but is the primary " advantage " usually argued by M-16 supporters . However , it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current M-16/AR-15 design is a result of changes made with the M-16A2 update . The DoD requirements that resulted in the M-16A2 included an increased effective range ( both for accuracy and penetration ) , for which the SS109 projectile was developed . However , the rifling of the M-16A1 was not ideal for use with the heavier bullet . So the A2 design incorporated a heavier barrel with a different rifling pitch , which gave the bullet more stability . As a side note , this increase 1 ) was not as high as the original demands of the DoD standards , which were changed to favor the M-16 when the M-16 could not meet the standards , and 2 ) decreased the effectiveness of the M-16 , since the lethality of the round is due largely to its instability , causing it to tumble . The increased stability decreased this effect , and led to widespread complaints by combat troops that the new bullet/rifle combination was less effective . So , the M-16A1 , the version originally adopted by Israel , was not any more accurate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . <p> Mounting of Optics - Another big argument of M-16 supporters is the wide variety of mounting options for optics/lights on the M-16 . However , again , this was not the case at the time of Israel 's adoption of the M-16 . The only way to mount optics on the M-16A1 available at the time was through a special mount , not adaptable to other rifles , that bolted on top of the carrying handle . Not only was this just as inconvenient as the situation with every other rifle of the time , the M-16 mount did not return to zero when re-mounted , and its high placement on the rifle caused any mounted optics to have a higher parallax angle with the bore than optics mounted on any other military rifle . This meant that optics mounted on the M-16 were less versatile than when mounted on any other rifle . Even today , except for the flat-top versions of the M-16/AR-15 receiver ( which are a very recent change ) , the mounting options for the M-16 are all add-ons that could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concern of the IDF . So optics mounting options were not in any way a consideration by Israel at the time . Another point is the night sights of the Galil . No such option was available for the M-16A1 . The only way to add low-light capability to the M-16 was to mount a Starlight scope on it , an option that added significantly to its weight , threw its balance WAY off , prevented the use of its integral sights , and cost several times more than the rifle itself ( raising its cost above that of the Galil ) . In sighting options , the Galil was significantly superior to the M-16A1 . <p> Reliability - Even M-16 supporters have never been able to argue BETTER reliability for the M-16 . The best they 've been able to do is argue acceptable reliability . The M-16 is not , and never has been , as reliable as the basic AK design . The firing group is much more lightly constructed , especially the springs , and it does not handle sand well . And while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-round burst feature , the modern versions have abandoned that and gone back to the A1 firing group . The question is n't whether the M-16 is AS reliable os other designs , but whether it 's reliable ENOUGH . In the view of government bean-counters , the answer is YES , but it is not as reliable as the AK/Galil , and that 's been demonstrated many times , including by Israel 's own official testing . <p> Cost - The M-16 is cheaper to manufacture , there 's no argument about that . During the time that Israel was making its choice , one could buy an NIB Colt AR-15 for under $500 in the US . A new IMI Galil ARM was going for about $900-$1000 at the same time . Plus , Israel was getting M-16s for virtually nothing , while they were having to pay full-cost for producing their own Galils . Clearly , price was a big factor in the M-16 's favor . I 'll leave it up to you to decide if you think it influenced Israel 's decision . <p> Ergonomics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Galil . Except for the charging handle , all controls can easily be operated with just one hand without releasing the pistol grip . That really is a big advantage , although reloading will usually include using both hands , so most of the time the ability to carry out a one-handed mag drop is n't as big an advantage as it seems ( but it IS still an advantage ) . But the Galil 's ergonomics are n't very bad either . The left-side safety is quite good and easily activated , even with it 's " backward " action . The mag release , while generally requiring use of the weak hand , is placed right where the hand would naturally go during reloading , and the magazine locks up much more easily than the M-14 , and much more reliably than the M-16 . I 've never had to worry about whether a Galil mag was positively locked , whereas it 's quite easy in a stressful situation to insert an M-16 mag and not have it lock completely . Also , the folding stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available on the M-16 . It allows for a much shorter configuration , without sacrificing barrel length , and is completely out of the way when folded , unlike the collapsible M-16 stock . Also , many people find the loud " boing " that vibrates through one 's skull when firing an M-16 , due to the placement of its recoil spring in the buttstock , to be quite unpleasant . A minor complaint , but as valid as the difference between the Galil and M-16 safeties . <p> Weight - Weight actually is a significant advantage of the M-16 . While we 're only talking about a few pounds , the unloaded weight of an M-16A1 is roughly half that of the Galil . And that much weight does make a difference . If you doubt this , do an hour of rifle PT with each . As Jetsktal noted , the weight is the only actual complaint I have ever heard in person from IDF soldiers . But I doubt that weight played much of a role in Israel 's decision . The Galil is comparable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M-16 is still at the light end of what is available , and at the time that was even more true . This may actually have been a consideration for Israel . It does affect the effectiveness of troops . But I doubt seriously that weight , all by itself , would be adequate justification for switching , whereas price could easily be . <p> Now , despite the fact that I believe the Galil to be a vastly superior assault rifle than the M-16 , that does n't mean I think Israel made the wrong decision in going with the M-16 instead . Cost is very important in this case . Israel was spending more than twice its GDP to fight wars with its neighbors , wars it had no choice but to fight if it was going to continue to exist . Free rifles are just too good to pass up under those conditions . Also , despite some people being indignant about it , governments very rarely give their soldiers the best available equipment . Claims to the contrary are strictly political spin to satisfy those same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are going to do their best for their military , and country , as a whole , they should supply them with the cheapest option that is good ENOUGH to get the job done on average . This means that more of that particular piece of equipment can be produced , and more funds and resources are available to produce other items the military needs . That is the strategy that wins wars . While the M-16 is n't as good as the Galil one-for-one , it 's good enough , on average , that from an army-wide perspective , it 's good enough ( though the individual soldier whose weapon malfunctions at the wrong time may not think so ) . It 's a simple cost-benefit analysis that every military does ; at least those that win wars do . Those that do n't tend to lose wars and then complain later that they should have won given their " obvious " superiority . It 's not a slur against Israel or anyone else to say that they went with something less than the best available equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one which in the long run saves lives because it leads to improved over-all capability of their military ; in other words , as long as other considerations make the worse weapon the better choice . That 's what the Israelis did when they chose the M-16 . But that decision does n't then automatically make the weapons they choose " better " . <p> Excellent Gary , you posted some good points that I wanted to bring up . Its funny how some proponents of the AR family will argue against gas-piston operaed ARs.The CEO of Colt claims there 's nothing wrong with the M-4 which has shown to be considerable less reliable than the M-16A1 or A2 , yet Colt has produce and has now a new gas-piston operated AR design for which there is a proliferation of these days . I imagine is I was a modern neophyte Isreali conscript and lugged a rifle around all day , I would say the M-16 especially a CAR-15 is a superior weapon also . But slightly better accuracy shooting at the range and having something light to carry all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galil and M-16s have seen better days . The M-16 being the most prolific by the 5.56mm weapon out there ( by the number of nations using it I mean ) with the Galil being second followed by the Steyr AUG . Its odd but many nations use the both the M-16 and Galil ( which I 'm sure they did n't  purchase at bargain basement prices from Israel ) prefer the reliabilty of the Galil AR ( the ARM being heavy ) over the M-16/AR design . Columbia for example uses the M-16/M-4 and Galil and has set up Galil production in that country . I believe both these vintage weapons have their good and bad points . If for example I was some country X 's special forces soildier and was going to be tasked with a short duration mission to parachute in at night and be extracated by helicopter within 48hrs , I 'd choose the Colt M-4 over the Galil . It would be the right tool for the job , since its light , I 'm not going to be expending to many rounds anyway , adaptable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lowly general conscript of country X and spent weeks at a time in the field , maybe the Galil would suit me better as far as my lesser training is concerned , and the need for reliabilty being greater since I 'm not going to place any long shots or clean my rifle in an intensive jungle firefight . I guess its having the tool avilable to you for the right job . My personal choice for a modern assault rifle would be a Robinson Arms XCR or ZM weapons LR 300 , but I do n't  think any nation has adopted these weapons . Something I do n't  see people mention anymore is automatic rate of fire of assault wepons . The AK/Galil , early HK models and Steyr AUG clearly have lower ROF ( 600-700 rpm ) in automatic than some of the newer assault rifles on the market ie FN 2000 , IWI Tavor and others . I 'm not a fan of burst trigger machanisms and it seems these are becoming out of vogue which is good . <h> out of whack <p> England turned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Italy and Germany . Every body thinks hk forced it 's g series rifle down the throat of the bundeswehr which is not true , the german armed forces used ar18 's , m1 carbines along with the g3/g33 because germany was limited on how many arms they could produce . hk does supply other nations with arms pof= Pakistan , south America and a lot of Europe . and is to replace the m16 with the us armed forces . My friends that are in the gulf at present think the m4 is a pos and have stated they would rather have a sks then their m16 for reliability , also why was the m14 brought back into service if the range and accuracy of the 16 is so great . Fact : the US forced 308/7.62 and 223/5.56 down Natos throat " look it up " so why would n't we do the same to Israel as being are #1 ally in the region . <p> As to 7.62x39 &amp; ak47 's in Israel 's service : They could acquire the ammo through themselves ie : IMI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yugoslovia or south Africa , Israel did n't like the ak47 out of the box that 's why the made the galil is it not ? <p> I have a tendancy to think anyone who praises m4/m16 's is just a fan of the rifles ' reputation ' . A rather selective reputation at that . I do n't understand how anyone can praise a rifle that requires the addition of a specific part for clearing jams . The very fact that the bolt driveing mechanism is needed is the reality facing those supporters that the entire system is wholey inadequate in reliability . <p> Get both and see which one you prefer . I have both and for SHTF , the Galil has my vote . Never had a problem with my AR 's , but do n't want to either . Love my Galil .308 . Just sold my preban M1A to pay for my Galils . Need to find some more cheap .308 ammo to play with . <p> Get both and see which one you prefer . I have both and for SHTF , the Galil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AR 's , but do n't want to either .

I also like the M16 to an extent.I will be buying one after I sell my M3A1 Grease Gun . <p> With this in mind " Google " - cracked Galil receivers- and you will find an article by Kokalis ( opinions vary about him ) that while he was in Israel he saw piles of Galils with cracked receivers . Take this as you will , they could have been run over by a tank , but shortly after this article Israel was flooded with M16s from the U.S. <p> I 've got to get in on this . Take it from a guy who just spent the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POS , with 203 , peq-2 , aimpoint and tac light it weighed almost as much as a m249 . You can clean it 3 time s a day and still have malfunctions . Try this , mid summer temp is about 132F , you 've been in a fire fight for about an hour , your shells will not eject ... why ? THe outside temp plus the internal temp= expanded caseings . It got so bad that after every 3 or 4 rounds I was having to slam the stock on the ground and pulling on the charging handle at the same time to eject the spent caseing . Or should I have asked the SOB on the receiving end to wait a minute while I oiled my weapon again because the the oil that was there an hour prior had burned off . Every Grunt in my Platoon said the same thing on many occasions ... give me an AK style weapon over an M4 any day of the week ! <p> Here 's what I found on the cracked recievers . Quote- A long time ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he observed a large pile of cracked 5.56mm Galil receivers in Israel . He said the reason the receivers cracked was due to improper usage of the Galil . He stated that the IDF used the Galil as a SAW and that it was not designed for that job . It was designed to be used as an infantry rifle , not a SAW . <p> A few months later , a concerned Galil owner wrote to him concerned that his semi automatic Galil was not a good weapon .

Un-quote <p> I can see distroying a Galil Barrel useing it like a SAW , I would think wood would catch on fire before cracking the receiver , I heard it was do to over tighting the IMI Galil scope mount , I have see it done before on a new semi 392 model , punched a perfect hole all the was trough the side . <p> Originally Posted by jetskrtal <p> Here 's what I found on the cracked recievers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in Soldier of Fortune that he observed a large pile of cracked 5.56mm Galil receivers in Israel .

In fact sold the M16 over it . <p> Prior to having the Galil designed , the IDF had M16 's which did not function well in the sandy environment during the six day war.Many of the IDF infantrymen were taking AK-47s off dead Egyptians as their M16s were failing in the Egyptian desert.Since they switched back to the M16 's with a rigid cleaning regamin and the fact they were getting them free.Politics and dollars .....

@@77050981 @5750981/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> MAX-11 vs . TASK Slow-Fire M11/9 - with video <p> Everyone is aware of the effect the MAX-11 has had on the sport of subgun competition ( as well as for informal blasting ) . You can essentially take a stock M11/9 bullethose , swap uppers , and have a match-winning subgun . It makes an affordable alternative to buying a Sterling , Uzi , M16/9 , MP5 , or about any other subgun you can think of . <p> Of course , it was n't the first method of slowing down the M11/9 . There were a couple of different drop-in rate reducers that slowed the gun down ... a little . There was the rarely-seen Urbach heavy bolt . Probably the most successful early on was the TASK slow-fire conversion . This consisted of threading an op rod to the rear of the bolt and using it to actuate a buffer and spring in an M16 stock . For this to work it was necessary to drill a hole in the rear of the receiver for the op rod to protrude through . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing buffers . I remember considering getting Lage 's original upper when I was setting my gun up . It used a longer upper , but did not have the added weight . It was intended to be used with the TASK-style conversion . As nice as it looked , I ended up getting an Autowerkes side-cocking upper instead . In the end , it did essentially the same thing for a couple hundred dollars less . The MAX-11 did n't come on the scene for a few more years . <p> I always thought the MAX-11 was an elegant solution , which made the lowly M11/9 a very competitive gun . But I had not planned on getting one , as I already had my gun set up for competition . <p> But recently , I found a used one at a pretty good price . So I figured , why not ? In comparing the MAX-11 to the Autowerkes upper - or any stock-length upper - the MAX seems a lot bigger . While it is longer , I think this is mostly because the upper is taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to modify the rate of fire on a TASK-style gun by swapping buffers . One can also play with springs to change the ROF as well . By swapping buffers , I can go anywhere from around 630 rpm on the low end to 1250 rpm . <p> If that 's not fast enough , use the factory spring setup and add extra buffers . With three buffers , I clocked the gun at 1776 rpm. ( maybe not so good for competition - but it 's a lot of fun ! ) <p> I 've got my gun running just slow enough that I can pull singles on demand . There 's not really any reason to go slower . I use the AAC rate-reducing buffer , and add a short section of the factory recoil spring . Without the extra spring , I would sometimes get light primer strikes , depending on the position of the weights with that particular buffer . It gives a nice , smooth ROF . <p> The few times I 'd shot someone 's MAX-11 in the past , the recoil always felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how an Uzi feels . I thought it may have had to do with the different geometry - where the weight was located . Now I think it was just the slower ROF . <p> I did some testing today , using both uppers . Ammo was some 147 gr. handloads , and 115 gr . Win White Box . I did n't really think the ROF was all that different . But you can see - and hear it in the video . I 've got an extra bolt weight for the MAX-11 . I 'm thinking I might start drilling holes in it to drop weight until I can find the sweet spot . <p> The other thing I really like about the MAX-11 is that I 'm not stuck using an M16 stock . I use the A1 stock so I can get a longer ( heavier ) buffer in there . But because of where the grip is located on the M11/9 , this gives a slightly excessive length of pull . An M4 stock is better , but a little faster than I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock to go with the Lage upper . I like the more compact package for going to and from the range . I find I do the same with the Uzi . For matches or when I 'm doing a lot of shooting , I use a solid stock . But for the quick trips back and forth , I put the folder on . I 've got a couple of smaller soft cases where I can put in the gun with either a can and the folder , but not with a solid stock . <p> Here 's some info regarding ROF from another thread . Your numbers will obviously be different because of the suppressor , but it might make finding the right weight easier . <p> Originally Posted by dogon1013 <p> So the real question is what ROF will I get from the extra weight . I Did some searching for ROF and bolt weights and found some good info that Richard Lage posted earlier , when he was developing the Max 11 it looks like : <p> Awesome . Great video . I was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I really wanted a max-11 . Mostly just for more of a rifle feel . I decided to stick with the TASK style and I 'm having an adapter made for AR free float rail . Hopefully it gives me what I want out of it . 
@@77050982 @5750982/ <p> There 's a guy over at the AK forum that 's touting a nice bug-out bag for his SBR 'd krink . I got to thinking about it . The Uzi offers a lot of advantages for having a high-capacity , easily-concealed carbine without having to go through the SBR process . I do n't think you can find this kind of Uzi-like compactness anywhere else - unless you are intent on SBRing the rifle . And in a SHTF situation , 9mm is the most common stuff going . The Uzi just might be the ultimate doomsday piece if you are concerned about ever having to scavenge for ammo and simultaneously concealing the smallest possible package from the Mayor Nagins of the world . <p> ORinTX <p> 09-06-2008 , 02:06 PM <p> I 've always thought an Uzi SMG would make a nice vehicle gun , but for anything else I 'll take an 10.5 AR any day . <p> chili17 <p> 09-06-2008 , 02:14 PM <p> it is still just a 9lb 9mm pistol .

But assuming you do n't want to jump through the hoops for an SBR , and you want to stay legal , then it seems to me that an Uzi carbine with the 16 " barrel removed from the gun would make for an ideal piece to throw into a very small pack and cut out of town . I 'm concerned primarily with concealability and keeping the whole thing legal . I do n't know of any other carbine that offers this kind of versatility .

It is much more accurate ( especially at distance ) , easier to control and shoot fast , and more lethal . Probably would be more reliable to boot . The 16 " UZI is also MUCH quieter . <p> I think the UZI ( SMG for me ) would be a great bug-out gun . Besides an invasion by a foreign power , you are not going to be gunning it out with everyone you see . In almost all situations it is going to be about surviving and personal protection .

Do n't get caught up in the fear of zombie attacks , it probably wo n't happen . <p> chili17 <p> 09-07-2008 , 01:34 PM <p> There 's no need to take this personal . <p> Disagree without being disagreeable . <p> Mike <p> Your right , I took the bait . <p> dantheman <p> 09-07-2008 , 03:09 PM <p> though i write songs about zombies taking over the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SHTF are a fullscale invasion ( china 's all i 'll " worry " about when it comes to that ) , natural disasters , and total anarchy . <p> fullscale invasion : considering something like the muslems or the taliban , i do n't  worry about at all . since youd probably have to ' bug-out ' in an instance like this , an UZI carbine would be an excellent tool in the hands of a US partisan/freedom fighter for reasons already stated ( ammo availability , **25;2946;TOOLONG , **27;2973;TOOLONG , etc. ) no it does n't  have the terminal performance of an AK or AR , but its a killing machine none-the-less , NOONE on here should give it any less .. if the chinese ever decide to invade , however , none of us will have enough ammo COMBINED to even hold off a single wave .. we 'd all perish in flames .. <p> natural disaster : a hurricane , tornado , or earth quake would probably not force people to ' bug-out ' rather than force people to defend whatever belongings and property they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat would work in this senario , which does n't  exclude the UZI carbine .. <p> total anarchy : this is where it would get crazy .. this would force people to unify in their own " gangs " , so to speak , for protection and survival .. an ideal weapon in this type of senario would have to have an aboundance of ammo , which a 9mm UZI carbine certainly has .. <p> bottom line : the UZI carbine is an excellent piece of hardware that 's worth its weight in gold if the need for it should ever arise , i bought mine for a reason .. though it would n't make a very good main weapon , it is , imho , a great ' in-between ' weapon , worthy of praise in this regard . i personally feel a great sense of pride and security with an UZI 9mm slung around my shoulder/back .. <p> Trigger <p> 09-07-2008 , 03:13 PM <p> I would think that for a bug out gun the UZI would be the best . 9mm very avalable round , mags cheap enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried and reliable . Though I would prefer the SMG to the semi . Though I do think that a 30 cal hunting rifle and shot gun would also be necessities . <p> Ne-waza <p> 09-07-2008 , 03:34 PM <p> ... it is , imho , a great ' in-between ' weapon , worthy of praise in this regard ... <p> I whole-heartedly agree . I 've never been a big 9mm fan , for all the reasons previously set forth ( such as the benefit of a rifle caliber ) , as well as some reasons of my own ( I 've traditionally preferred .45 for handguns ) . But the ease of finding 9mm is a big plus . The Uzi also breaks down very easily , to conceal in a small backpack , if you will . <p> Obviously , there are a lot of SHTF scenarios . But aside from holing yourself up in your house , where you may have an abundance of guns and ammo at your disposal , I tend to think that the guy walking down the street with a rifle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a VERY BIG target for our own government . If you have to get out of your house and get somewhere safe , you 're better off not being Mayor Nagin 's target . In order to effect this , everything must be concealed as much as possible , and you must be able to access ammo . <p> I 'll sink back into my armchair now . : ) <p> Jerry799 <p> 09-08-2008 , 10:10 AM <p> Interesting thread . If I " bug in " , I 've got almost a hundred firearms and tens of thousands of rounds of ammo available . Plenty of time and opportunity to pick the " perfect " weapon . <p> If I had to " bug out " for a short term disaster , I think a FA Mini with a Glock 17 would be almost perfect from a concealability standpoint . And I accept the premise that short of an invasion or EOTWAWKI , concealability will likely be very desirable . I 'm sure you guys have seen the shoulder sling sold by Galco for the Mini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under your arm . ( and hidden from view ) <p> If a SHTF situation happens when I 'm away from home , I always have a 45acp snub revolver on me , as well as a 9mm Walther P1 in the car with a Norinco SKS paratrooper and a couple hundred rounds of ammo for each in the trunk . I feel confidant that I 'd be able to get home with these preps , unless something really extreme happened . <p> Noah Zark <p> 09-08-2008 , 11:02 AM <p> I have a 16 " 9mm IMI/AA carbine , a 16 " 45ACP carbine with GG lower on a NHM-imported reciever , and a 9mm Norinco 320 SBR . Any of them will hit repeatedly a 2-liter soda bottle at 150-200 yds . Given a bag or pouch with six or eight full 32s ( or full 30s in the case of the 45 ) , an Uzi Carbine in the hands of a competent owner would be suitable for protecting oneself or family if necessary , IMO . Personally I would not feel undergunned against certain adversaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or general peasant rabble , no problem . <p> Ideal ? Certainly not . Way better than a 9mm handgun , because of the inherent stability of a shoulder-fired weapon , and the extended sight radius as compared to that of a 9mm handgun . But there are other weapons and cartridges that would be more desirable in a firefight , and there 's much to be said for the old adage , " Use enough gun . " I would not want to engage competent shooters armed with 7.62x39 or x51 at ranges above 150-200 yds with an Uzi Carbine in my hands . In fact I would not engage them unless forced to , prefering to GTHO of there . After all , an Uzi Carbine is essentially a 9mm or 45 subgun permanently stuck in " semi " mode . And as many of us know , if you want to hit a target with a 9mm subgun at 150 yds , you 'd best have the selector on semi , or be good at toggling off singles . But I can chase a 2-liter soda bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute of torso is certainly possible . And 2-liter bottles do n't shoot back . ; ) <p> That said , if I had a choice ahead of time between an Uzi Carbine and something else , I 'd take a 7.62 AK clone , 16 " AR , or an FAL . But if a 16 " Uzi Carbine was all that I had , I 'd definitely make the best of it . <p> Noah <p> Quarterbore <p> 09-08-2008 , 12:07 PM <p> +1 <p> Most SHTF scenarios I 've seen ( on the news ) in my short life , involve about three days TOPS . Authorities usually have the situation under control long before anyone has to bug out with armloads of guns , ammo , and food . In reality , short of an invasion , a pistol is about all you will need . If you do have to evacuate , an UZI under a jacket would be ideal , so would an AR pistol ( with a short buffer and a 7 " Bbl ) , or a Krink pistol . Long guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property ( at a distance from your target ) , but in a truck , or on the streets , it is not easy to wield a long gun for up close work .

I do n't leave my ARs , AKs , FALs , or UZIs unlocked and in a crisis I have to rely on what is available then and there at least to defend until I can open the safe and pull out more firepower . <p> Now , if Iran was to invade , well then I would have the rifle on me 24/7 <p> : spam : 50cal <p> Ben <p> 09-08-2008 , 12:45 PM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking field day .

Problem solved . Deploy as needed . <p> There 's no way that an Uzi beats out a shortie AR for general SHTF purposes , but as I said earlier I do think an Uzi SMG is an ideal defensive vehicle gun in such a scenario -- high volume of fire for a very close range , allowing you to ass out . <p> the difference is I do n't have to re-assemble the uzi to fire it .

Think legal guys ! <p> Anyway you look at it - the Uzi can be a comforting companion and a serious consideration in a world of evil gooks , goblins and other eat you 're ass up zombies when the SHTF .

I have a 7.5 ' ' AR I keep by my bed . 2nd a real SHTF we 'd be under marshal law and the controlling faction would attack at nite while we sleep . Next there WOULD BE NO BUYING of ammo that 's total BS . We would be stealing everything and anything we could . We would have to kill other Americans to get there . Most SHTF scenarios are pipe dreams . You 're going to have to be harder and faster than the next guy or you 're not going to win . SHTF wo n't be a game it will be for keeps . So wrapping it up the best ' ' bug out gun ' ' is the one you grab 1st and you 're going to steal ammo not buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah I know that this thread is pretty old but in light of recent events since then like our own economic/housing situation , rioting oversees , the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan , the Occupy Wallstreet events around the country , etc. it sort of stirs up possible senarios and one must wonder - " what if " ... <p> So ... in response to the original post about the advantage of having an Uzi in a bug out bag for a doomsday senario , I would say hell yes ! The Uzi was designed exactly for such a situation . It is robust and battle proven , few parts and easy to maintain . I agree with piratesover40 's assessment regarding a true SHTF/doomsday or bug out situation . There would be no government as we know it ; no economy , no banks , no grocery stores as we know it either . We will be growing and hunting our own food , and stealing other provisions like ammo and fuel and transportation as well ... and everyone of us will also be in the same boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even killing each other if it means surviving . There is truly no " best weapon " ; just what you have . All this talk of worrying about " keeping it legal and SBR 's and ATF regs " .... SERIOUSLY ? ? ? ? ? All that will be moot in such a situation . I personally do n't see it happening . Yes there is a lot of unrest right now , but even still that is a long way off from a true SHTF . <p> Actually that was a lie . I went back and saw that had responded to the thread when it was first started . : rolleyes <p> piratesover40 <p> 11-06-2011 , 02:57 PM <p> Tunnelrat you 're still around . You hit on one thing I forgot to mention . There will be no playing nice and worrying about if my gun is legal or if anything is legal for that matter . That RR , RDIAS , RLL , RGun period will be gone unless you can read the signs of SHTF early enuff to be gone before they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have the family in LE or the military that are in the loop . Hopefully them here that have early warning will pass on that info . But trust me folks it will be ugly and viscous . And I 'm sorry but I have to disagree . It would be better to carry a MAC-10 in your bug out bag . Anytime you have to have a screw driver , hammer , and a square to keep your gun in tune that 's not good . And talk about a gun with few moving parts that 's a MAC . Yeah , yeah I know but the 1st strike will be at very close range trust me . The men in black will upon us before we can breath . So a small gun able to spray a lot of ammo to keep them off balance and heads down will be the one to have . Of course my running days are over . But I wo n't go quiet . <p> SemperGuy <p> 11-28-2011 , 10:13 PM <p> A thought to consider when thinking about an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firearm to defend yourself/your family with is this ; energy exchange . The best round is the one that delivers the most energy on your target . The formula for figuring this out : 1/2 Mass x Velocity squared <p> So I think of it this way : 115 gr. 9mm round traveling at 1300 fps or 55gr .223/5.56 round traveling at 3000+ fps <p> It is important to remember that over a distance the round will lose velocity and thus , lose energy . All in all , your situation decides which might be better suited . As a good pal of mine and myself say , " It 's good to have options . " The best thing we all have going for us is that we pay it thought . <p> MPA guy <p> 11-29-2011 , 11:48 AM <p> I agree that if it 's a true SHTF , barrel length and MG laws stuff will go out the window and will be un-enforcable at that point in time . <p> I have several choices of guns to use at this time , I do n't  ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean toward a 12 gauge . <p> Slugs give you decent enough range and excellent power . <p> Buckshot gives you good self defense ability <p> and shotshells give you a better chance killing supper . <p> Down side , they 're loud . <p> I do n't think shotguns are the perfect weapon for everything , but I do n't think any gun is perfect for everything . <p> A good shotgun has a lot going for it though . <p> Bunker Hill <p> 11-29-2011 , 10:31 PM <p> Anyone care to ask the Israelis why they fielded so many Uzis when they also had rifles available at the time ? Apparently the rifle does n't trump the SMG completely , judging from the historical record . <p> chead <p> 12-04-2011 , 04:41 PM <p> Regarding carbine vs. pistol : I can shoot fast and have all the holes touching at 25y . I definitely could not do that with a pistol . It 's not impossible but to " bug out " I would take the Uzi . If it was real dire I would just sling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's no reason you ca n't have the best of both . <p> streetfighters <p> 12-04-2011 , 09:14 PM <p> There 's a guy over at the AK forum that 's touting a nice bug-out bag for his SBR 'd krink . I got to thinking about it . The Uzi offers a lot of advantages for having a high-capacity , easily-concealed carbine without having to go through the SBR process . I do n't think you can find this kind of Uzi-like compactness anywhere else - unless you are intent on SBRing the rifle . And in a SHTF situation , 9mm is the most common stuff going . The Uzi just might be the ultimate doomsday piece if you are concerned about ever having to scavenge for ammo and simultaneously concealing the smallest possible package from the Mayor Nagins of the world. /QUOTE <p> I have the utmost respect for the law but , Guys , in a SHTF situation , and by that I mean a real SHTF situation , not a virtual game-boy situation , are you really going to be guided by current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I can find a way to attach razor blades and Draino to projectiles fired out of a full auto weapon I will .

Regular Dracos are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that someone kept as a Long Rifle by adding an extension . I 'm personally debating on a SBR Draco or building a SBR Semi-Uzi . The Draco seems more practical and cost effective , but the Uzi is different and cool . I already own a bunch of AKs . <p> As I posted in another thread , the Uzi Carbine/SBR fills a unique niche , at least for me . All the talk about ' bugging out ' pre-supposes-at least for most-that you have been forced to leave , or chosen to leave , your home or place of retreat . <p> Problem being ..... that not always will you have STARTED there if/when SHTF . <p> Where the Uzi fits , for me , is in two main categories , with a third very important category right behind . <p> First the Uzi is quite small ( and flat as the stock does not side fold ) for a long gun so concealment , which I believe will be paramount in all but the true end of the world scenario , is easier to acheive with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Uzi uses the same ammunition as does my handgun . While some see this as a potential minus , for me it is a plus in that I have less of a load to carry/pack . <p> Finally , and in the end the most important , the Uzi is dead nuts reliable . Something that is a must no matter what else it might bring to the table . <p> Now , to explaining my points . <p> First , concealment in all but the most dire circumstance means there is less of a chance you will be identified as a potential threat to others and thus dealt with accordingly . Second concealment gives you options . You can engage or simply choose to walk/run away and no one is the wiser that you had any capability at all to ' do battle ' . Finally concealment means that you can have the weapons system with you a greater amount of time than you can with something that does not conceal as well . An Uzi fits in a messenger style bag , an AK , does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world right now you could literally walk down the mall with one over your shoulder and no one would think twice . In a SHTF scenario you could carry one just about anywhere and not recieve a second look either . Always a good thing when you are just trying to get home . <p> Next , the Uzi uses the same ammo as my pistol . Again , if I am starting from home then it does n't matter as much since I have no space/weight restrictions , but if I am traveling there is only so much room for equipment-ammo included . What ammo I can carry will give me duplicate use and thus improves flexibility . Yes the same ammo gives me essentially the same pluses and minuses when it comes to ballistics but as I have said before in a ' bug out ' carbine I am not looking for the 200+yard capable battle rifle , I am looking for the 50 yard , quick to the shoulder carbine . <p> Finally , reliability . Again , the Uzi has proven itself on just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-guns what the AK is to rifles . You do not-generically- get any more reliable . Yes some individual guns run better than others but design wise both are at the top of the heap . <p> Is the Uzi the best ' end of the world ' gun ........ nope <p> Is it the best ' I might have to fight my way home to my end of the world gun " ......... yep <p> Options perserve lives and the Uzi gives me more options than other systems . <p> johnnywitt <p> 12-14-2011 , 02:51 PM <p> it is still just a 9lb 9mm pistol .

My Family enjoys shooting them and my wife does well with one and they are still pretty good for the avg. home defense scenario with the right flash suppressant ammo and if you do n't want to bother with the weight and length of a sound suppressed weapon . They are so compact and because they are so heavy they stay on target very well- all perfect for home defense inside a tight space . Chili 's right though about a rifle caliber weapon IMO .

In fact the USSS started using the Uzi not too many years prior to this attempt . They , and several other federal-and state , local agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar circumstances , i.e. concealed until needed . <p> And agreed that it we are talking combat or near combat conditions then the Uzi would not be my first pick mainly due to lack of range . While range ( distance ) is not terribly important to me in a ' bug out ' scenario , it may be useful , at least 0-150/200 yards in an open carry situation .. <p> Honestly , I think that the short barreled 7.62x39mm AK , commonly known as the Krink , is probably the best all around bug out gun as it offers the right size , coupled with both a rifle caliber and a somewhat better range than the Uzi . That being said however , size ( the Krink is larger , although not by much ) and most importantly commonality of the ammo ( with my pistol of choice-Glock 17/19 ) makes the Uzi-for me- the best all around choice as I place a premium on space while I am traveling . If I had the AK as my bugout then I would have to carry two kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uzi mag <p> I look at guns more or less like a golfer looks at his clubs . There are many specific clubs that do specific things for you , you just have to know what the strong/weak points are of each of them . <p> If we are talking all around , no holds barred combat/survival use in an urban environment my choice would be a 10.5-12.5 " barreled AR . If we are in a suburban or other setting then a 14.5-16 " barreled AR gets the nod ( due to improved range and ballistics ) . In both of these scenarios however concealment does not enter into the mix allowing for these choices . <p> An AK would be very useful as well and I would not hesitate to choose one however the Gov't has spent the last 20 years teaching me to the use the AR15/M16 series of weapons so I am much more proficient with it as well as being an armorer for them . Habitual familiarization is a term that I once learned , I spend a great deal of time using and teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brainer for me-in a non-concealment scenario . <p> The Uzi gets the nod when I ca n't or do n't expect to be able to open carry . While light ( in terms of weight ) it is not , it is very size efficient and as such is useful to me . Not to mention that , as I have said before , the Uzi is to subguns as the AK is to rifles , meaning that they are the most rugged ( design ) of their particular breed . <p> TigerMule <p> 12-24-2011 , 03:35 PM <p> Hello DDMAU , <p> What size Hogue Handall grip sleeve did you use on your UZI ?

@@77050987 @5750987/ <p> Not too long ago the discussion of the Uzi closed bolt conversion and its cyclic rate was discussed . Since this topic surfaced again , it renewed my interest . My opinion was that the higher cyclic rate is attributed primarily to decreased length of bolt travel caused by the semi auto buffer . The opposing opinion is that increased spring tension ( due to the striker spring ) is the primary reason for the high cyclic rate . The information presented below will show that the closed bolt semi auto buffer is the primary cause of this cyclic rate not increased spring tension . <p> If unfamiliar with this conversion , click on the link for a review I had written of my closed bolt conversion : LONG ... It provides an overview of the closed bolt and how it differs from the open bolt . <p> CLOSED BOLT CONVERSIONS TWO TYPES : There are two closed bolt conversions : ( 1 ) an open bolt modified to accept a striker assembly and ( 2 ) a semi auto bolt modified by welding a lip onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These two conversions are similar except for one important aspect : the guide rod hole is deeper in the open bolt . Open bolts use longer recoil springs than semi auto bolts and factory closed bolts . For reference , the modified semi auto bolt most closely resembles the factory closed bolt including the depth of the guide rod hole . <p> The closed bolt conversion used in the testing is a converted open bolt . Therefore , both the closed bolt and the open bolt used in the tests possess the same guide rod hole depth of 5.543 inches ( as shown in the following photo ) . <p> When the sleeve is inserted into both of the bolts tested , it produces a guide rod hole depth of 3.933 inches an almost identical depth as found in the semi auto converted closed bolt . The semi auto converted closed bolt and the factory closed bolt possess a measurement of 3.929 inches . Using this sleeve allows testing of the converted open bolt and the converted semi auto bolt . Since my bolt is a converted open bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configurations . <p> http : **29;3242;TOOLONG <p> The following photo shows the closed bolt with striker assembly and the full auto bolt along with the semi auto recoil spring . Notice the sleeve partially inserted into the guide rod hole of the open bolt . <p> http : **29;3273;TOOLONG <p> SPACER : The spacer , resting on the striker in the photo below , is used with the open bolt to simulate the portion of striker width found between the bolt and the striker spring . By using the spacer ( with the open bolt , and recoil spring , and striker spring ) tension will be the same as the closed bolt conversion using the striker assembly . <p> http : **29;3304;TOOLONG <p> Spacer , recoil spring , and striker spring are shown below with the open bolt and ready to be inserted into the Uzi receiver for testing . <p> http : **29;3335;TOOLONG <p> WEIGHT COMPARISON OF ALL PARTS USED IN TESTING : The following assemblies and parts used in the cyclic rate comparison were weighed using a US Post Office scale : <p> The difference in weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when the sleeve and spacer is not calculated , the two bolt assemblies are within 1.1 oz of each other . In my opinion this slight difference in weight is not a factor when comparing cyclic rate . <p> RECOIL SPRINGS : To provide additional data , two open bolt recoil springs were tested . One open bolt recoil spring possesses greater tension than the other open bolt recoil spring . Due to the differences in strength between the open bolt recoil springs , one spring is referred to as " strong " and the other as " weak . " To ensure accuracy during testing , the " strong " recoil spring was marked so it was not mistaken for the " weak " spring ( although , just pushing on the springs I could tell which was which ) . Through the use of two open bolt springs , I was trying to see if a trend in cyclic rate could be established when making comparisons to the semi auto spring . <p> The semi auto recoil spring , shorter than the open bolt recoil spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs were not tested with the sleeve ) . The semi auto recoil spring is the same length as the one used in the factory closed bolt conversion . Going forward , the semi auto spring will be referred to as the closed bolt recoil spring . <p> Note : no modifications were performed to the three recoil springs tested . <p> http : **29;3366;TOOLONG <p> BUFFERS : As will be shown in the cyclic rate comparison charts , the standard red buffer plate and the semi auto buffer were used . The red buffer plate was removed from each recoil spring when the recoil springs were used with the closed bolt and semi auto buffer . A hole was drilled through the semi auto buffer so as to allow the recoil spring to pass through and contact the rear of the receiver . <p> SPRING TENSION MEASUREMENT : Spring tension , calculated in lbs , was measured for each combination used in the cyclic rate data found in the colored charts below . Spring tension was obtained when the open bolt touched the red buffer plate or when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the closed bolt , the overall tension was obtained when the striker assembly touched the semi auto buffer . The weight of the bolt assemblies were not added to the spring tension results . <p> The bolt assemblies , buffers , and springs were tested outside of the Uzi receiver so as not to calculate flawed data due to the top cover spring . Reason : pulling on the top cover charging handle to obtain recoil spring tension , or recoil and striker spring tension , would be incorrect as the top cover spring provides an additional 5.5 lbs of tension . The top cover spring does not affect the cycling of the bolts whatsoever and should not be included . <p> A combination of 5 lb and 3 lb arm curl weights were used to calculate spring tension . These weights did not prove perfect as they were weighed using a US Post Office scale . Example : one 5 lb weight was 3 oz under and another was 1 oz over . The 3 lb weights were within 2 oz . Although not perfect , the weights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences of the arm curl weights , and judging the contact or close contact of the open bolt touching the red buffer plate , or the striker contacting the semi auto buffer , or the open bolt fully compressing the striker spring , I feel confident the comparison measurements of spring tension are within half a pound . <p> http : **29;3397;TOOLONG <p> AMMUNITION USED : For the cyclic rate comparisons , Winchester 100 round Value Pack ( 115gr ) from Wal Mart was used . A sound suppressor was not used while generating any of the cyclic rate data . <p> CYCLIC RATE MEASUREMENT TOOL AND CONDITIONS : A P.A.C.T MKIV XP Championship Timer was used to obtain all cyclic rate data . The test results presented below were obtained on two different days . Open bolt comparisons tested with strong and weak recoil springs ( with red buffer plate only ) were tested on a day with a temperature of 55 degrees ( see blue chart ) . Temperature was 66 degrees on the day when the open bolt with spacer and striker spring was compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The timer was worn on the right hip while the Uzi was fired right handed . All cyclic rate data included 12 rounds fired in one burst . The timer recorded the number of fired rounds perfectly . <p> Test One demonstrates that the closed bolt conversion yields a higher cyclic rate than the open bolt using the same springs . The closed bolt has a higher cyclic rate of 217 rounds per minute <p> CLOSED BOLT COMPARISON TEST TWO : <p> http : **29;3428;TOOLONG <p> Test Two also demonstrates that the closed bolt conversion yields a higher cyclic rate than the open bolt using the same springs . The closed bolt has a higher cyclic rate of 271 rounds per minute . <p> CLOSED BOLT COMPARISON TEST THREE : <p> http : **29;3459;TOOLONG <p> As shown in Test One and Test Two , Test Three demonstrates that the closed bolt conversion yields a higher cyclic rate than the open bolt using the same springs . The closed bolt has a higher cyclic rate of 101 rounds per minute . <p> REASON FOR HIGHER CYCLIC RATE OF CLOSED BOLT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate due to the semi auto buffer restricting rearward travel . To prove this point , Styrofoam was used after the cyclic rate testing ( with PACT Timer ) had concluded . Five round bursts were used with each spring combination and a cut-to-length piece of Styrofoam . The spring combinations used with the foam are the exact same from Test One , Test Two , and Test Three . <p> The following photo shows the length of the Styrofoam . Notice how the foam rests against the red buffer plate . The length of the foam takes into account the semi auto buffer and the portion of the striker between the buffer and the bolt . When the foam was inserted into the Uzi receiver , it was pushed rearwards so it would rest against the red buffer . During the Styrofoam test , the bolt was retracted just far enough to engage the cartridge in the magazine ( to ensure the bolt did not make contact with the foam ) . <p> http : **29;3490;TOOLONG <p> As the following photo shows , all three foam pieces were easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the foam pieces show that the open bolt travels farther rearward than the closed bolt with the semi auto buffer . The letters on the foam indicate which configuration was used : <p> The closed bolt cyclic rates from Test One , Test Two , and Test Three demonstrate a reduction in cyclic rate as spring tension increases . Based on this data , increased spring tension ( when used with the semi auto buffer ) actually results in a lower cyclic rate . This was surprising as I had assumed an increase in spring tension would lead to an increase in cyclic rate . This proved to me that spring tension is not always predictable and a PACT Timer must be used for confirmation . <p> SUMMARY - BUFFER : <p> Unfortunately , the semi auto buffer is needed with the closed bolt conversion to prevent binding of the striker spring and to prevent the rear of the striker rod from impacting the rear of the receiver . Due to spring binding and the striker rod impact issues , the length of the semi auto buffer can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the semi auto buffer , the closed bolt would possess a slower cyclic rate ( from 101 to 271 rounds slower as shown in the test results ) . This confirmation applies to both bolt configurations the semi auto converted closed bolt and the full auto converted closed bolt . All three tests show , without a doubt , that the semi auto buffer causes a higher cyclic rate than if the recoil and striker springs were used alone . <p> RAW DATA FROM TESTING : http : **29;3521;TOOLONG <p> http : **29;3552;TOOLONG <p> RoverDave <p> 12-20-2006 , 08:50 AM <p> Wow ! <p> Dan , you did a tremendous job on this article . Thanks for taking the time to put it together . It clearly shows the relationship bewteen springs , buffers and bolt travel ; and it proves what we said earlier - that the buffer is the limiting factor that drives up the ROF on the closed bolt setup . <p> It 's also very interesting to see that sometimes added spring tension can decrease ROF ( like the comparison you did between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Looks like good material for the library ! <p> amphibian <p> 12-20-2006 , 09:17 AM <p> First of all that was a lot of work to do . I think we can all appreciate it . I find this all very interesting . I never knew how much shorter your closed bolt spring was from your open bolt springs were . Mine are not that much different . I assume your closed bolt springs came from D&amp;D . <p> I also find it interesting that I or anyone else can go out with a handful of springs and a PACT timer and get results to conflict with yours . I know I have taken the same spring and when I cut more coils off the SAME spring the ROF will go DOWN not up . Your tests seem to say that you get faster ROF with a weaker spring which is opposite to my testing . <p> I guess there must be some variation in the actual springs that we are using for testing . <p> That last test perfectly shows my point . You already proved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STRIKER SPRING ALONE . Adding the buffer yielded an additional 100 RPM increase . Looks to me that the MAJORITY of the increase is because of the STRIKER SPRING . Which you proved me to be correct . Thanks ! <p> RoverDave <p> 12-20-2006 , 09:43 AM <p> The length on Dan 's closed bolt spring is normal . I just compared my factory closed bolt springs and they are the same as Dan 's . If yours are significantly different than they must not be factory . <p> Regarding the weak spring vs. the strong spring , it appears that Dan 's results are consistent in three different tests that a stronger open bolt spring resulted in a slower ROF . It would be foolish to disregard all of those results . <p> But of course the main point is the open bolt vs. closed bolt ROF and again you 've missed the point . The ROF correlates to bolt travel . Dual springs do decrease bolt travel and thus increase ROF . However , the springs do not limit bolt travel as much as the buffer and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closed bolt that results in the high ROF . As you said , the last test is really the most telling . Despite using the same spring setups , the closed bolt is still faster because it uses a buffer to shorten the bolt travel . It 's incorrect to say that the buffer " adds " 100 RPM because the buffer alone is capable of driving the ROF up to the maximum . The results are clear . <p> amphibian <p> 12-20-2006 , 10:32 AM <p> No , its the both of you that are clearly missing the point ... AGAIN . <p> Look , everyone knows decreasing the bolt travel causes the ROF increase . You keep bringing that up and I keep telling you the same thing that we already know that . People buy the Blackjack buffers or make their own to get this increase . <p> You said so yourself , " Dual springs do decrease bolt travel and thus increase ROF . " And why is that ? Because they resist the bolt from going back further . <p> As I stated earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan with some springs and my PACT timer to conflict with his open bolt weak vs strong spring test . <p> So you 're telling me that those 300+ RPM increases with just the striker SPRING and spacer means nothing ? ? ? You have got to be kidding me ... You are just going to IGNORE THAT DATA once you put the semi buffer in ? ? ? To do so would be foolish . <p> If you run the closed bolt setup w/o the striker spring and just the buffer alone by welding the firing pin forward and just use the buffer sure you 're going to get a 1k RPM ROF due the reduced travel . I never argued that . But since you have to use the STRIKER SPRING it has to be considered since it can not be removed from the closed bolt configuration . <p> RoverDave <p> 12-20-2006 , 12:05 PM <p> As I stated earlier , I can go out and get different results than Dan with some springs and my PACT timer to conflict with his open bolt weak vs strong spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Here are a couple of things you might want to keep in mind if you 're playing with cut down springs as opposed to various factory springs . One is to make sure you base the results on spring tension ( as measured appropriately per Dan 's comments ) and not spring length . Spring length alone can be misleading . Second , make sure you do n't use springs that are so light that they are bottoming out . That would clearly introduce a factor beyond just the spring tension . <p> So you 're telling me that those 300+ RPM increases with just the striker SPRING and spacer means nothing ? ? ? <p> Yup , exactly . In this specific case of a closed bolt configuration , the buffer stops travel before spring tension does . So the fact that the spring tension COULD reduce bolt travel does n't come into play . The buffer stops the bolt first . <p> The really interesting thing about Dan 's data is when you look at the three closed bolt tests . In all of those cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case where the spring tension is the highest ( 20 lbs . using the closed bolt spring ) , the ROF is slowest ( 1099 ) . Switching to lighter springs ( 13.5 lbs and 16 lbs ) resulted in a higher ROF ( 1259 &amp; 1232 ) . It 's incorrect to state that greater spring tension ALWAYS results in faster ROF . It CAN give you higher ROF if it 's reducing bolt travel , but wo n't always if other factors are involved like springs bottoming out or buffers in place . <p> amphibian <p> 12-20-2006 , 05:30 PM <p> You 're still missing the point . The buffer does NOTHING until the back of the bolt hits the front of it . Both springs are ALWAYS working . If my test or Dan 's test showed like a 100 RPM or so increase with just the striker spring alone , you guys would be right . But since both tests show that a large majority of the ROF increase is reached with just the striker SPRING and NO semi buffer , then it IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons behind the ROF increase in the closed bolt configuration . <p> rlowe <p> 12-20-2006 , 07:28 PM <p> Dan 's " weak " spring probably is n't weak . I would be curious to see the weight of that spring across the total bolt travel . I 'd bet it starts off heaver at the beginning of the bolt travel than the " strong " spring . This would reduce bolt travel and increase ROF . As the Amphibian said bolt travel dictates the ROF weather it is the spring or a buffer shortening the bolt travel . The only way to make a closed bolt have an acceptable 750-850 RPM ROF is to use a mini striker system and use the lightest striker and recoil springs that will function reliably . <p> Just My O2 Richard <p> Dan0341 <p> 12-20-2006 , 08:41 PM <p> I have more test data to continue our discussion , but unfortunately I do not have time to post it tonight . I 'll be back tomorrow . <p> Thanks , Dan <p> RoverDave <p> 12-20-2006 , 09:53 PM <p> The only way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to use a mini striker system and use the lightest striker and recoil springs that will function reliably . <p> Are you talking about a Mini striker used with a full size bolt ? If you could get that to work ( and I do n't think you can ) , I 'm not sure how that 's going to help slow down the ROF . The ultra light springs probably wo n't help either because the bolt/carrier will still be striking the buffer resulting in a short bolt travel . Dan 's test showed lighter springs increasing ROF when used with a buffer . <p> sofltodd <p> 12-20-2006 , 11:58 PM <p> A lot of stuff to digest .. nice work Dan . I have to say that my own experience playing with various spring lengths and strengths has shown that the stronger springs cause a ROF increase not decrease as your test shows . <p> With less force pushing against the bolt as it moves rearward with a weak spring , and with less force pushing a bolt forward with a weak spring I can not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is counter intuitive . I 'll do some more playing around next time I am at the range but I swear there was a discussion on here at one point and time about the shorter and weaker springs reducing the ROF on closed bolt guns . <p> -Todd <p> amphibian <p> 12-21-2006 , 08:10 AM <p> Look at the bolt travel . The bolt has to travel approximately 2.75 " BEFORE IT EVEN GETS TO THE SEMI BUFFER . Then that is another 2.75 " going forward . A total of 5.5 " that the SPRINGS are working and the buffer is n't doing squat . Dan/Dave seem to be forgetting/ignoring that this is all going on before it even gets to the buffer . Dan 's test showed the bolt squashed the Styrofoam a little - what maybe 1/4 " ? This AFTER the bolt has traveled the 2.75 " . Dan 's test showed that the additional striker SPRING increased ROF by 300+ RPM while my test showed it increased RPM by 536 RPM . Bottom line is both tests show the ROF was increased by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both tests make up the MAJORITY of the increase of the CB conversion which is what I said from the beginning . All Dan 's test proved was that he is using weaker springs than I am . <p> RoverDave <p> 12-21-2006 , 08:25 AM <p> A lot of stuff to digest .. nice work Dan . I have to say that my own experience playing with various spring lengths and strengths has shown that the stronger springs cause a ROF increase not decrease as your test shows . <p> With less force pushing against the bolt as it moves rearward with a weak spring , and with less force pushing a bolt forward with a weak spring I can not see how physics would allow for a higher cyclic rate . It is counter intuitive . I 'll do some more playing around next time I am at the range but I swear there was a discussion on here at one point and time about the shorter and weaker springs reducing the ROF on closed bolt guns . <p> -Todd <p> It 's not counter-intuitive at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffer faster . How fast it returns forward is less clear . The spring wo n't drive it forward as fast , but it 's probably rebounting off the buffer faster . It 's too complicated an interaction to apply intuition to . <p> As for your previous tests , that issues was mentioned above . If you 're doing an open bolt test , the weaker spring will allow greater bolt travel ( unless it 's so weak that the bolt or spring is bottomin out ) and thus a slower ROF . Things start acting differently when the bolt travel is interrupted by a buffer . <p> RoverDave <p> 12-21-2006 , 08:38 AM <p> Look at the bolt travel . The bolt has to travel approximately 2.75 " BEFORE IT EVEN GETS TO THE SEMI BUFFER . Then that is another 2.75 " going forward . A total of 5.5 " that the SPRINGS are working and the buffer is n't doing squat . Dan/Dave seem to be forgetting/ignoring that this is all going on before it even gets to the buffer . Dan 's test showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high correlation with ROF and both springs and buffers can affect bolt travel . But to argue that the springs play a bigger part because they are engaged longer than a buffer is the most bizarre argument I 've ever heard . It does n't matter how long a factor is engaged . It matters what the effect is on bolt travel and a buffer does it quickly and efficiently . <p> There are two things that are clear from this test . <p> - The buffer restricts bolt travel more than the springs . - Within the limited travel impossed by the buffer , heaver springs DECREASE ROF . <p> amphibian <p> 12-21-2006 , 09:24 AM <p> to argue that the springs play a bigger part because they are engaged longer than a buffer is the most bizarre argument I 've ever heard . <p> Not " bizarre " at all . The point of mentioning it was to further clarify to you that the majority of the ROF increase is happening which does not involve that 1/4 " or so of length that the Styrofoam was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain from both tests w/ NO SEMI buffer other than it does n't mean anything which is ridiculous . It is clear from both tests ROF was gained with just the striker spring . No matter what you say , nothing can refute those results . Believe what you want .... <p> Whatever ... : rolleyes Both tests with the added SPRING INCREASE ROF . Regardless of the strength of the springs , the minimum increase in ROF with the Striker SPRING alone was at least 300 RPM which is the majority of the ROF increase . <p> rlowe <p> 12-21-2006 , 10:18 AM <p> Are you talking about a Mini striker used with a full size bolt ? If you could get that to work ( and I do n't think you can ) , I 'm not sure how that 's going to help slow down the ROF . The ultra light springs probably wo n't help either because the bolt/carrier will still be striking the buffer resulting in a short bolt travel . Dan 's test showed lighter springs increasing ROF when used with a buffer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but without all the buffers . I have some parts , but just have n't gotten started on this project yet . I 'll use a full SMG recoil spring and a longer striker spring tube with a longer but lighter striker spring . This will hopefully allow the bolt full travel because the striker spring will be contained within the bolt at full travel . The recoil spring only needs to be heavy enough to pick up a round and of course the striker spring only needs to be heavy enough to light the primer . If you could get both of these springs to weigh about the same as the SMG recoil spring then the ROF would be very close to an open bolt ROF . I still have n't decided what to do with the feet on the front of the bolt . They can be removed like a mini or welded up and cut at a shallow angle in order to press the sear down as the bolt travels forward . I need to get off of my but and get started on this project but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 11:07 AM <p> If you 're doing an open bolt test , the weaker spring will allow greater bolt travel ( unless it 's so weak that the bolt or spring is bottomin out ) and thus a slower ROF . Things start acting differently when the bolt travel is interrupted by a buffer . <p> Exactly . So with a open bolt and weaker spring you have more bolt travel rearward and less force on the forward push ... Yet some how Dan has a higher rate of fire from the weak spring than he did from the strong one . 636 RPM from weak spring and 597 from strong spring ( blue image ) . How is that possible ? <p> Velocity = Distance/ Time <p> If you increase the distance it will simply take longer to get back to where it came from . The same can be said if the force causing the acceleration ( spring ) is less ( weaker ) then the time will be more causing less velocity ( slower ROF ) <p> This entire OB/CB spring/ buffer debate can be solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> Theoretically could n't someone use a timing gun for an automobile or even a laser radar gun to calculate the velocity of a bolt ( open or closed ) traveling rearward and forward ? If you knock those out you can calculate D = 1/2 ( Vo + Vf ) T with out even having to remove the top cover and derive exactly how far back the bolt is going ( distance ) . Everything can be derived from there . This whole debate can be summed up into a couple equations and each of you can plug in your own data and you should come up with results pointing in the same direction . <p> How can you argue against your own data ? <p> I 'd also suggest that ammo a little more consistent than winchester white box be used , perhaps reloads or higher end factory . WWB is n't know for consistency and the results could vary quite a bit . <p> - Todd <p> RoverDave <p> 12-21-2006 , 11:08 AM <p> Yes a mini striker and a full size bolt but without all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't gotten started on this project yet .

I 'd also limit testing to one single magazine to eliminate any possible spring pressure variation or misaligned feed lip issues with the magazines that may result in a slight difference in the test results . A baseline number should be established prior to beginning the tests and that number reconfirmed at the end of the testing . <p> : 2cents My unsolicited two cents . <p> RoverDave <p> 12-21-2006 , 12:26 PM <p> Both tests with the added SPRING INCREASE ROF . <p> I think what you 're trying to say is that the dual spring test runs faster than the single spring test .

If Dan wanted to duplicate that test and time it we 'd have a good comparison , but of course it 's a dangerous test since it causes a run away . The video suggests that the ROF on that single spring test is even higher than the dual spring test , which would be consistent with Dan 's other tests . <p> amphibian <p> 12-21-2006 , 12:52 PM <p> That ca n't be concluded from Dan 's test because he did n't post numbers for a single spring test that is limited by the buffer/carrier conditions that exist in a closed bolt setup .

Ammunition has been known to account for some significant +-rpm depending on the setup . <p> The reason I posted my last comment was to inquire how Dan got the results he did on the open bolts which contradict many dicussions and experiences I have had in the past . I 'm not saying throw out his data but some explination on how a weaker spring caused a higher ROF would be great . Either I am missing something ( a good possibility ) , something was wrong in his test , or he had his results for the two springs swapped . <p> As far as the whole equation is concerned , Distance is not known acording to amphibian since if indeed the springs are the culprit in ROF then the distance is dependant on both spring length and strength since a stronger spring could in face stop the bolt from ever reaching the buffer . Travel distance of the bolt is dependant on the spring characteristics . <p> If you want to get all white and nerdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you calculate the actual strength of a spring . I do n't have a horse in this race but I find the amount of work being put into this very intriguing . Somebody needs to get a trophy when this puppy is put to bed . <p> Vegas SMG <p> 12-21-2006 , 06:15 PM <p> I can put a MAC Jack in my M11/9 and without compressing the recoil spring , it *seems* to short stroke the bolt and increase the ROF by 472 RPM using WWB on my PACT timer . I 'm not all sophisticated and shit ( ASAS ) , and do n't own a fancy closed bolt Uzi , so perhaps someone can explain to me what 's *actually*occurring in my primitive subgun when I insert this small piece of nylon . : thinking <p> Golovko <p> 12-21-2006 , 07:51 PM <p> The testing seems incomplete to me . As far as I understand , the test was intended to compare the effect of the striker spring on ROF to that of the semi-auto buffer . However , the semi-auto buffer was n't isolated in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the tests , it was with the striker spring . One can not determine with certainty which part is more effective if each part is not isolated in testing . It is necessary to test the semi-auto buffer without the striker spring . If each component is tested alone , the relative changes to cyclic rate can then be compared against each other . <p> In order to isolate components , the following tests should be done at a minimum : <p> Test 1 determines the base ROF from full travel and only the recoil spring . Test 2 determines the ROF increase from simply adding the striker spring to the Test 1 configuration . Test 3 determines the ROF increase from simply adding the semi-auto buffer to the Test 1 configuration . Test 4 determines the ROF increase from having both the striker spring and the semi-auto buffer installed . This test should help determine how much " overlap " there is between the effect of the striker spring and the semi-auto buffer on the ROF , or if there is a cumulative effect . <p> Similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is important that all four tests are performed as described above . <p> Dan0341 <p> 12-21-2006 , 10:39 PM <p> I appreciate everyones input and look forward to hearing more . My original idea was to perform some basic comparisons , but the testing continued to grow . The more I thought about it , the more interested I became in the comparisons . I took the actual spreadsheets you see ( shown as " Raw Data " ) to the range and filled in the blanks . I am sure that the combination of springs and buffers used are 100% correct . It helped that I was the only person shooting at the range on both days . That way I could concentrate on what I was doing accuracy of data is absolutely important to me . Just to confirm , the same 25 round magazine was used for all tests on both days . I used Wal Mart Winchester ammunition because it is widely available to others for testing so they could compare results to mine . Hopefully we will see others perform cyclic rate tests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of tests , I want to show the actual bolt travel of the closed bolt . The photo below shows a comparison of the open bolt ( with red buffer plate inserted ) to the closed bolt ( semi auto buffer with striker inserted ) . As you can see , the closed bolt conversion cycles half the distance of the open bolt . <p> In addition to the spring comparison tests in my initial post , I also tested the results of spring tension when using the open bolt with additional buffer material ( to simulate the rearward travel of the closed bolt conversion ) . To do this , I added a total of 2.396 inches of buffer ( This will be referred to as the 2.4 inch buffer ) . This comparison is necessary in proving that the striker spring of the closed bolt conversion has no influence on increased cyclic rate . You will see in the " Raw Data " below that the 2.4 inch buffer was tested on the day with a temperature of 55 degrees . As stated before , the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased bolt travel caused by the semi auto buffer and the striker assembly . <p> This 2.4 inch buffer material is composed of a semi auto buffer and a cut portion of another semi auto buffer . <p> In the two photos below , the purpose of the caliper measurements is to show that the closed bolt and open bolt both travel the same distance rearwards . During testing the small buffer was located behind the semi auto buffer to ensure the small buffer remained in place while shooting . <p> The striker spring and spacer were not added to the recoil spring when testing the open bolt with the 2.4 inch buffer material . By performing this test , my intent was to confirm the cyclic rate of the open bolt when using less spring strength and the same rearward travel of the closed bolt conversion . Since the rearward travel of the closed bolt conversion is fixed and can not be modified , it is necessary to duplicate the rearward travel of the open bolt to isolate the effect of the springs . Notice that the 2.4 inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have the rearward travel to compress the recoil springs . Each spring combination resulted in a cyclic rate of over 1200 rounds per minute . <p> Open Bolt using Recoil Spring and 2.4 inch Buffer <p> http : **29;3583;TOOLONG <p> Even though the following data immediately below had been previously shown in my first review at the top of this thread , it is used again for comparison to the 2.4 inch buffer data . The data below ( compared to the 2.4 inch buffer data above ) show that the overall spring tension is more than double and the cyclic rate is considerably slower . Even though each recoil spring possesses the striker and spacer , it was proven with the Styrofoam test that the bolt cycles farther rearwards than what the closed bolt conversion allows . This longer length of bolt travel , even when the spring tension is double , allows for a lower cyclic rate . It is obvious through these comparisons that reduced rearward bolt travel plays a greater role than increased spring tension . <p> I have nothing to add , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good way . I do n't own a FA Uzi and unless fortunes change , probably never will . I have my SBR IMI Model B and am a happy camper . However , I just wanted to let all paries know that I am endlessly fascinated with this thread ... Thank you for some great reading .... <p> DoctorEvil <p> 12-22-2006 , 02:08 AM <p> The testing seems incomplete to me . As far as I understand , the test was intended to compare the effect of the striker spring on ROF to that of the semi-auto buffer . However , the semi-auto buffer was n't isolated in any of the tests . Every time the semi-auto buffer was used in the tests , it was with the striker spring . One can not determine with certainty which part is more effective if each part is not isolated in testing . It is necessary to test the semi-auto buffer without the striker spring . If each component is tested alone , the relative changes to cyclic rate can then be compared against each other . <p> In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum : <p> Test 1 determines the base ROF from full travel and only the recoil spring . Test 2 determines the ROF increase from simply adding the striker spring to the Test 1 configuration . Test 3 determines the ROF increase from simply adding the semi-auto buffer to the Test 1 configuration . Test 4 determines the ROF increase from having both the striker spring and the semi-auto buffer installed . This test should help determine how much " overlap " there is between the effect of the striker spring and the semi-auto buffer on the ROF , or if there is a cumulative effect . <p> Similar tests can be conducted with a closed bolt , but it is important that all four tests are performed as described above . <p> Actually , in this case ... such a separation could not be done due to the factor of bolt " bounce " . <p> When you all look at the first two factors by themselves ... they are very easy to understand : <p> - Bolt travel ... the further that the bolt has to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming all other factors are equal . - Spring forces ... the stronger the spring the higher the rate of fire . <p> Ah ... but here is the curve ball .... why is it that there is a higher rate of fire with a stronger spring again , assuming all other factors are equal ? <p> Well , there are actually two factors to this . The first is that spring force is : <p> Not constant and also ... nonlinear . Example ... how easy is it to load the first round in a mag ... and how hard is it to load the last ? A spring actually becomes exponentially stronger as it is deflected ( or compressed in this case ) . <p> The second is actually related to our first " simplistic " factor . Assuming the bolt is not bottoming out or " bouncing " the stronger spring overcomes the force of the bolt after firing .... sooner . This means that bolts on stronger springs .... TRAVEL a shorter distance ! <p> Now , returning to the third major variable of our overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens it means that 1 ) the distance that the bolt travels is limited ( so no rate of fire increase will occur soley to decreased travel ( caused by a stronger spring force ) . 2 ) Some portion of the return energy will be deflected or added to the return ( or firing cycle ) . This means that the firing portion of the cycle will befaster than if just the spring force were acting on the bolt . <p> Sooooo .... <p> Without actually trying to run the equations ( which would require A LOT of data that I do n't have ... and I am not really sure even how to obtain ) . My hypothesis is as follows : <p> There is " knee " in the curve for a bolt operating with a large enough buffer ( or short enough travel distance ) to allow for bolt bounce greater than the spring force . Whereby in this very small range of the curve ... bolt bounce exerts a stronger force on the bolt than the spring during the initial portion of the firing phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent if this force is larger than the spring force . This would further mean that the " work " that the spring would exert on the bolt would be greater during the ejection or return phase than the firing phase . In this case a stronger spring would slow the return of the bolt more than a weaker one and the bolt bounce would negate some of the spring energy exerted on the bolt during the firing phase . <p> I believe that this is a very special case with a small window . <p> I can geek out more and expand that further ( or parts of it ) if someone would actually like a longer discussion of the topic . <p> Happy Holidays ! ! ! <p> Doc <p> p.s . I realize that I ignored frictional forces in the above discussion . This factor is the same in all cases except that in the case of longer bolt travel ... there are additional frictional forces ... which only helps the case of the distance of bolt travel as the major factor . In the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frictional forces are the same . <p> rlowe <p> 12-22-2006 , 11:09 AM <p> Dan : <p> Well the 2.4 " buffer kind of settles the argument . the rates of fire for the open bolt and only the 2.4 " buffer are very close to the cyclic rate of the closed bolt with the same spring and a striker spring . You did n't list the cyclic rate for the closed bolt spring and the 2.4 " buffer , but I 'll bet it is approximately 1100 the rate you show for the closed bolt . <p> Again when you put 2.4 " of crap behind the bolt Buffer , striker , striker spring bottoming out or a small cute fuzzy animal the cyclic rate increases . I believe the rates that both you and the amphibian are getting when you place the striker spring around the recoil spring are caused by shortening the bolt travel when the striker spring bottoms out or has so much resistance that it can travel no further . <p> I do n't have a functioning closed bolt at this time but I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the striker spring is approximately 1.4 " when it is bottomed out . It appears that you could remove approximately .400 " from the closed bolt SA buffer and lower the cyclic rate some . It would probably help to remove some coils from the striker spring and possibly shorten the striker spring guide when attempting to slow the closed bolt . I believe that through shortening the buffer and trimming coils you could get this thing to run below 1000 RPM , but the way to get a decent cyclic rate from a closed bolt is to use a mini striker . <p> Just my o2 Richard <p> RoverDave <p> 12-22-2006 , 11:23 AM <p> Richard , I 'm still curious to know why you 're interested in slowing down a closed bolt . Unless you have a registered closed bolt or a registered receiver that is married to a slotted closed bolt , it 's much easier to slow down the ROF by switching to an open bolt . <p> rlowe <p> 12-22-2006 , 12:47 PM <p> Richard , I 'm still curious to know why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a registered closed bolt or a registered receiver that is married to a slotted closed bolt , it 's much easier to slow down the ROF by switching to an open bolt . <p> Rover Dave : <p> My gun is registered receiver Broadhead Armory BAU113 bought prior to the ban .

At Knob Creek there are 4 classes open bolt and closed bolt in both optics and irons . A 600-700 Rpm closed bolt suppressed full auto uzi would walk all over the colts and mp5 's in my opinion . <p> Vegas SMG <p> 12-22-2006 , 01:01 PM <p> A closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that was coming .

I would expect the difference in match results to be due to the difference in the rate of fire , magazine capacity and the number of mag changes required to complete the stages . What the match results do reflect are the individuals mastery of purpose built and refined SMG 's that were ideally suited for that course of fire . Put start and stop plates at 100m with hard set , heavy targets in the middle and you will have a winner that was shooting a Reising ! <p> tony k <p> 12-23-2006 , 11:06 AM <p> Using match results to dispell the " myth " of the difference in first round accuracy is n't valid , IMHO .

But match competition seems to fuel a lot of the modifications discussed here at uzitalk.com . ; ) <p> What would be an advantage for match shooters is to be able to use the same SMG in all four classes on the same course , simply by swapping bolts and top covers ( with and without optics ) . There 's a definite learning curve and increase in speed as you repeatedly run the same course that is offset when you are forced to use different makes of SMGs with different balance points , ergonomics and mag-change routines for each category .

Point taken , but if we ca n't factor both speed and accuracy into the equation , what is a valid test ? Simply shooting for accuracy at 100 meters off sand bags ? PLEASEEEE ! These are subguns not bench rest rifles . <p> There IS a learning curve in controlling an open bolt subgun in both accuracy and trigger control . Both of those essential skills can be " bought " with a gun like the MP5 with burst control and closed bolt . In the end , there 's no substitute for practice and skill with either , but an open bolt gun in the right hands is just as accurate as a closed bolt gun .

This picture is of a Colt 6921 Semi-Auto . Please notice the sear area is not properly machined to accept an LL or a DIAS . I was quite disappointed when I took delivery of this rifle , but I learned my lesson regarding which questions to ask before making purchasing decisions . The machining of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> raffica <p> 06-30-2008 , 07:01 AM <p> It will come down to money . how much do you choose to spend . a registered receiver ( the big money colt you refer to ) or a receiver converted before May , 1986 is likely the most expensive.Cost from around $9500-$25,000. put any upper out there on it ( any mil spec upper , all that is generally available ) and it will run full auto , semi , depending on where the selector is set . there are some Colt SP1 receivers with a large dia. front pin that were converted , they will be about $$11K-$12500 , IMHO. for a DIAS , the semi lower you put it in may need a one-time machining to allow it to fit , same as the Lightning Link . A DIAS or registered receiver will work with a ciener style 22lr conversion , a Lightning link wo n't . A dias or a RLL can be moved from semi lower to semi lower , in different configurations of barrel lenght &amp; caliber. a difference between registered receiver and the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , on , and then change to a 20 " bbl .223 upper . makes no difference . with a semi lower , the DIAS or RLL must be in the receiver before you put the shorty 9mm upper on , or the ATF says you have a un-registered short barrel rifle . there is lots of opinion on how to deal with this , and best IMHO is to use common sense . I 'm gon na let someone else add to what I 've mentioned , I " m tired of typin ' . buy as much as you want to spend , discretionary income-wise. do n't buy it for an investment . buy , shoot , enjoy , if ya makes money when ya choose to sell , spend it on something fun . <p> DBinTexas <p> 06-30-2008 , 11:40 AM <p> Thanks guys ... great input . db <p> BrotherEvil <p> 06-30-2008 , 02:12 PM <p> The answers above are mostly correct IMHO . You can install a LL in any lower that you want . But , as pictured above , depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more expense in setting it up properly . To my knowledge the companies that sell " low shelf " lowers are Aztec , Bushmaster , CMMG , early Colt ( pre AWB and early gray post ban , but some would have to have the steel sear block removed ) , and DPMS . I 'm sure there are others but these are the larger companies that I 'm familiar with . <p> " High shelf " and " low shelf " refers to the depth of the area where the rear lug of the upper receiver goes into the lower receiver . Stag Arms , Rock River Arms , and Tactics ( they make a cool retro gray A1 lower ) are a few companies that make " High shelf " lowers . <p> Here is a photo of two Bushmaster lowers . The one on the left is unaltered . The one on the right has had some relief work done to give the LL plenty of room so that no extra stress would be applied to the link . <p> LONG ... <p> You will notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the rear lug of the upper fits into the lower ) has been squared off compared to the radius of the unaltered lower . The original Colt SP1 lower , which the LL was originally designed to fit , had more of a squared off end . <p> You will also notice , at the bottom of the photo , where the fire controls are there is also some extension of the larger opening . The LL would hit the very back edge of the larger opening for the fire control . If that stress broke the side at the serial # , a Class II manufacturer would have a very difficult time to repair the link from the back side . <p> If you add the KNS LL protector , which I would highly recommend , the rear lug of the upper must be shortened . The protector adds thickness to the link so there must be extra clearance under the lug . <p> Quarter Bore has some excellent information about the AR-15/M16 family of firearms at http : **40;3614;TOOLONG if you are interested .

@@77050992 @5750992/ 71162 @qwx691162 <h> Squib load . Uh oh <p> So I took a buddy to the range today to introduce him to some nfa fun . I brought my m11 and lage max 11 along and it ran like a champ as always . I brought along my sig 226 and tirant 9 and noticed a fail to chamber after one round . Stripped the gun and found a squib lodged just outside the chamber . Definitely a sobering experience . My question is have any of you experienced this in a Mac ? It seems that with an open bolt a kaboom would result . For those interested this was a reload . I 'm a careful reloaded just like we all are . Never had trouble like this in tens of thousands of rounds . <p> An M11 will happily fill the rest of your barrel up with bullets and then have an OOB if you do n't catch it . Sucks , but not much you can do about it . Luckily the M11 is built pretty tough .... the barrel , bolt , and upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worst case scenario . <p> I 've had a couple squibs in my 14 years of reloading . I started at 17 though and I 'm a lot more careful/knowledgeable now than I was then . I 've never had one in my open bolts though but in other guns it was very obvious so I immediately checked . <p> Almost . I had a case fail in the chamber . Only the back half was extracted leaving the front half still in the chamber . The next round slammed into the case front , pushing it all the way into the chamber . Of course there was n't room for all of the new round but it did go bang . Overall a very unpleasant surprise . Unfortunately I had purchased a case of the faulty ammo . Now I only shoot it with my Ruger Blackhawk . <p> The barrel was the on with Mac threads in my Max-11 upper . It is now on a shelf and still has that brass ring stuck in the chamber . <p> Case rupture/separation seems to be the most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a squib . If all you do is pick the case out before you start shooting again instead of checking the bore too , you could very well fill the barrel with lead . <p> Out of several dozen mushroomed cases and ruptures , I 've only had two instances where the case web ruptured early enough to leave a bullet in the barrel . One was with a 9mm and the other with a .22TCM barrel , but so far I 've never had an actual squib round . Scares the hell out of you if you 're running suppressed , but fortunately the M11 just shrugs it off ... it seems to be built like a tank in that regard . The case tends to split on the ejection port side and opens up like a tuna can , forming itself to the inner side of the bolt . Easy enough to pick out with a knife , quick visual check of the bore for obstructions , silencer for baffle strikes , verify chamber does n't have any pieces of case left inside , then slap a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .22TCM went , the previous round was the culprit . Case neck had separated and stayed in the chamber , the rear half of the case ejected , the bullet cleared the barrel , and it cycled the next round . With the case neck still stuck in the chamber , the next round did n't have enough case web support . The case ruptured quickly and did n't build up enough chamber pressure to push the bullet out of the barrel . The 9mm bullet was easy to get out of the barrel , but I had all sorts of trouble getting that .22 out doing my best to not damage the bore in any way . <p> Do n't get me started on .22LR , half of those things want to be a grenade and the other half wants to be a squib . <p> Over the years I have had a few case failures in my M11/9 . The gas would go through the magazine and blow off the baseplate and blow all the rounds and spring out of the magazine . Luckily these were the Zytel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other damage . When I reload I check all cases for cracks and put the loaded round in a test chamber to make sure they are in spec . I have had a few case failures in my M10/45 but this caused no damage at all other then spraying my face with some of the gas , this is why we wear eye protection when we shoot . <p> The only Ammo I ever used where I did n't have at least one case separation is Steel case . Imho . I 've had a Squib/separation with 22lr/380/9mm , of course not all at once just at least once since I 've been shooting . 
@@77050993 @5750993/ <p> I guess this is the proper place to file my question . I am not very well educated in the field of MAC type guns , and I just got an M11/9 today . As I inspected it at home , I noticed the lower had some sorta " hole " that either looked punched through from the outside ( because it is sort of dented around the hole ) , but dremeled out from the inside . Is this common ? It is not a precisely cut hole , but rather looks like the aftermath of a terrible malfunction . Is this something I should be weary of ? Or rather something somewhat common ? The hole is about an inch in front of the trigger guard , toward the barrel . I really appreciate all the help , and it also came with a disclaimer from SWD that suggested not to use Chinese surplus ( Norinco ) ammunition . Is this a piece of documentation worthy of a " golden frame " , or merely stuck behind the padding in the case ? Thanks again everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Factory Paperwork adds to the value of an item , but it really depends on whether the buyer cares about it . Can you post pics of the Hole ?

I do n't see myself doing that any time soon so 1/9 twist is fine for me . <p> I recently built an AR with a 16 inch light weight barrel ( 5/8 inch dia. ) and mid length gas system . I wanted a 1/9 twist , but could not find one . I had to settle for a 1/7 twist .

If you were only going to shoot 55 gr bullets or less then a 1/12 twist or the original Eugene Stoner 1/14 twist would work fine , although harder to find . <p> Not a concern for many , but the faster the twist the shorter the life expectancy of the barrel . There are a lot of twist rates out there and 1/8 and 1/8.5 are becoming very popular . For most of us 1/9 is the best compromise .

I happen to have a R/R H&amp;K 53 MG that I got not to long ago . I just spoke with Denise Brown ( The NFA agent who can tell you if this can be done according to all the other NFA agents ) . I recently inquired about with her if divorcing my sear pack from my host was possable ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said it could be . Register my 53 as a SBR and the sear pack is registered but she said to mark the sear with the first 3 serial# 's of the host with a letter S afterwards to indicate sear and put it in detail what you are wanting to do . I recommend this , If they say it can be done get it in writing from the NFA administrater in the department as I plan on doing . Good luck .

Well , a week later two gestapos showed up at my door ( without notice ) wanting to see my house(s) , firearms , where I slept , and asked me a lot of goofy personal questions that had zero relevance as to whether or not I was a criminal , anything that would prevent me from owning an MG , or anything pertaining to any kinda legalities ... just very personal questions about me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , but I have nothing to hide &amp; did n't mind the company . Besides , I like my area &amp; plan on living here indefinitely so getting familiar with the local law enforcement sounds like a good idea and wanted to know what they knew . <p> From talking to them I believe they are just grossly misinformed . I tested one of them by very carefully wording a statement where as I assumed that when a person who owned a legitimate registered MG dies , that machinegun automatically becomes an illegal weapon because it has no owner , can not be transferred , &amp; must be turned over to the authorities and/or destroyed . One of ' em said " Yep , he 's right " ....... All the while I was well aware of the ATF 's form #5 . I caught another of their screw-ups of information over the phone ( it could n't result negatively for anyone and it would be a good idea and still lawful even if it was applied in this misinformed manner ) , but I just agreed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him the truth without having to correct him : ) ) . <p> Honestly , I may seem a little odd and do constantly worry about everything . Maybe the sheriff picked that up from my voice while I was talking to him , and thought I was up to no good ? Before the storm-troopers left I said something like " I hope he signs my Form 4 so I wo n't have to spend anymore money to form a corporation to get this gun " , so they know I 'm not dependant on their services , but I 'm apprehensive about their possibly unconstitutional conduct and understand that never ends well . The only fear I have left is the CLEO deeming me as " suspicious " or whatever and possibly having an influence on the ATF agent assigned to approve my transfer .

LONG ... <p> I 'm in the process of buying my first class III gun , and I 'm 99.99% sure I can own this weapon . I 've bought a new handgun two months ago with no problems , and have a very clean record . I live in SC ( NFA friendly state ) , and understood that I should check to see if there were any local laws in my county that would n't allow ownership of a machine gun , so I called my local sheriff to ask him . After explaining who I was and what I was doing , I asked him but he did n't know and said he 'd find out &amp; get back in touch with me . As expected he immediately asked " Why do you want something like this ? " , and I told him I viewd it as a collector 's item and a long-term investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two days later a lieutenant from the sheriff 's office called and informed me he understood I was planing on buying this to resell and just wanted to make sure I knew I could n't sell this gun to anyone except a class III dealer ..... I politely told him I was well aware of the laws pertaining to NFA guns and thanked him for getting back in touch with me ( even though he did n't give me an answer about the local laws ) . <p> This morning two local deputies showed up unannounced &amp; wanted to chat with me . They asked all sorts of questions , some very personal ones like : What do you do for a living and recreation , names of my friends and where they live , how many guns do I own , do I go to church , how old was my dog , what high school/college did I attend , etc . They also wanted to view my small collection of firearms , which I let them see and they proceeded to recorded their serial numbers . They filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , but not one of their queries had anything to do with my ( nonexistent ) criminal record , and/or whether or not I was allowed to own a firearm , tittle one or two . They still could not answer my simple question . <p> The two officers where very nice as so was I. <p> I 'm a self-employed 23yr old and may seem odd compared to my age-group and those around me because I have kept to myself most of my life &amp; have made smart choices so far which have allowed me freedoms &amp; luxuaries such as this . I understand the local police want to be aware of what 's going on and have no problem assisting them in any way I can , but ca n't help but to feel a little violated . I 've never heard of this happening to anyone buying a tittle II firearm . What do you guys think ?

The dust cover is similar to the original but I 'm not sure about this part . <p> My guesstimate for parts compatibility is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrel chamber threading/dimensions ; so barrels may interchange 2 ) Bolt and recoil rod are identical in all likelihood 3 ) I have read that the FCG has been improved over traditional Galils , however , the FCG should be interchangeable in all likelihood . 4 ) Also original magazines will fit as Mr. Folgers notes . However , the Ace versions we are likely to see in the U.S. will probably not take standard Galil mags in 5.56 or 7.62 Nato . 5 ) While the thumb safety appears outwardly different , I conclude that the time-proven internal linkage is identical . 6 ) Ace top cover would need to be trimmed near port for RH bolt carriers . 7 ) Various pins , springs , etc. will interchange . 8 ) Barrel threading for flash hiders has not been changed in all likelihood . <p> I believe that the IWI parts boon will really benefit those who own Micro Galils . For example , in addition to above : <p> 1 ) The Ace sights ( with tritium inserts ) will interchange with a Micro Galil. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily swap onto Model B versions . 3 ) The spring loaded LH dust cover and parts are identical to LH-charging Micro Galils. 4 ) Although it looks different , the gas block appears to be the same configuration and location as a Micro Galil. 5 ) The polymer " lower " MIGHT be made to fit a Micro Galil , if you were inclined for some reason . 6 ) The Ace RH selector will probably fit micros , too . <p> I 'm still trying to determine whether Ace stocks will be an easy cross-over or not . <p> Sidewinder <p> 01-24-2015 , 02:00 PM <p> Rudddiger , <p> Your estimate certainly seems plausible . Even if only a few parts are interchangeable , we obviously will benefit from that . Soooo , things are looking up . <p> adipose <p> 01-24-2015 , 04:58 PM <p> OK ; it was a great trip , since the whole purpose was for the IWI booth . <p> Meeting Darth Galoni was great ; as it is fun when his mission was the same for the show . Show was incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IWI folks ( that I have talked on the phone with for a few years now ) and meeting the Israeli Shooting instructors who have shot all models ; including the Galatz 's .

But if so ; not sure why you want to swap out barrels ; as this is added task ) . *Was told the left handed dust cover is slightly different in dimensions than the micro 's ( I guess I 'll have to measure when I have 2 models side by side ) . *ACE Parts will become available down the road ( just like they are starting to appear for the Tavor ) *They will be offering a few different other stocks ; including a Korean Wire one . They will interchange for swapping purposes . <p> Standard traditional Galil parts : *They have a large batch of old new stock parts that will be available in the next few weeks ; that have been sitting for a long time . *Do not know what exact parts or their prices ; as that info was n't available . <p> Hope this answers the questions . Hope you are excited like I am . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is IWI introducing a new line of weapons . They are also proceeding with re-introducing IMI ammunition with a booth at the 2015 Shot Show in Las Vegas . In the next pictures Adipose displays his foreign relation skills with the female Israeli IMI reps : love Little do they know Adipose has the largest collection of Galil 's in the west coast . He is the Izzy " Lord of War " ! We have to admit Chuck is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to Galil 's . Thanks Adipose for letting us live vicariously thru you passion for the Galil rifle and providing us with thes great pictures from the 2015 Shot Show . It has been very exciting for me to post all the great pictures you took . <p> If you guys have noticed the Israeli Military Industries LTD " Samson " brand 5.56 X 45 ammunition is available at Brownell 's ( from Iowa ) in 30 round boxes LONG ... it is made to military spec . I personally just bought 5 boxes and as soon as the weather allows I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you UZI lovers , IMI also sells the SAMSON 9MM ammunition which they seem to be out of right now . Brownell 's is also selling the SAMSON 7.62 NATO 50 round box for $36.99 which is not a shabby price for NATO grade ammo . The 7.62 can be found on the next line item under the 5.56mm ammunition on the link I posted . I just realized while posting this thread that the 5.56MM ammo is temporarily out online : ( but make sure you stock up on your 7.62 before its to late . Peace out ! Lou <p> I 'm pretty stock on Independence XM193I ( IMI 55gr ball ) right now , but if you 're looking for IMI boxed stuff , Wideners lowered all their IMI boxed 5.56 stuff at 1.2k quantity quite a bit a month or so ago from where it had been since the 2012 panic ... 1200 round case is $349 ( was $479 if I recall correctly ) .

Gas tubes are probably rifle/gas port location dependent , with pistols likely having SAR length gas tubes ... ( They look to be roughly the same length as original tubes . ) I guess a complete swap is likely a question of whether you want to drill out to put in that spring loaded cover on the left side ... Personally , I 'm most interested in part #25 that appears to make the top cover more stable than our original gen 1 setup . <p> Question -- since these ace receivers are close to the micro -- do micro and full size galil 's FCG hot swap ? If so , they likely just made the trigger a little lighter and with shorter reset ( from what I 've read in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 922r ... ) . <p> RSR <p> 01-24-2015 , 06:38 PM <p> Thanks for the info adipose ! <p> Sounds like IMI will be producing some US components for rifles to meet 922r .

BUT I think 7.62x39 vs 5.45x39 in military ammo options , the 7n6 projectile is a pretty fantastic piece of military engineering . The lighter weight , flatter trajectory , less recoil , great penetration , and engineering that allows for rapid tumbling in flesh all makes for a pretty compelling case ... 7.62x39 , militarily , can only really make a compelling case vs 5.45x39 when you 're talking about barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that you need a really heavy projectile to get through ... The 7n6 ban hammer came down before I got into any weapons/ammo stocks in 5.45 though . So I 'm keeping myself to 5.56 and 7.62x39 exclusively . <p> -Regarding reliability , 7.62x39 has a more tapered case than 5.56 leading to greater reliability in feeding and extraction . <p> -7.62x39 costs 1/3rd less than 5.56 or 5.56 costs 50% more than 7.62x39 for " mil-spec ammo " . -Well-performing self defense in 5.56 usually runs the 50 cents range for the high 60 to high 70 grain bthp rounds -- also good long distance rounds ... Self-defense , some of the best is soft points that run the 25 cent per round range , but Hornady and others make some more expensive US Made ammo that rivals the 5.56 . <p> -Range/trajectory -- 5.56 flies flatter , but 7.62x39 has more energy http : **30;3960;TOOLONG *Recall that 5.56 ball requires 2500+ velocity to reliably fragment , and that 800 ft-lbs energy is recommended to humanely kill a deer ... **Also , this chart is 5.56 out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M4 carbines , you 're only above 2500 fps in 5.56 w/in 100 yards or so ( around 2700 fps at PBR if I recall correctly ) . <p> If I 'm stuck w/ one round , there 's a lot about 7.62x39 to like -- I think it fills almost all .308 vs 5.56 roles w/in 300 yards or so . Especially if I do n't need to have a lot of ammo . If I 'm planning to do a lot of walking and/or anticipating extended combat , there 's a lot about 5.56 to like . For my wallet , there 's also a lot about 7.62x39 to like . But for more compact storage , there 's a lot about 5.56 to like . For humane hunting , there 's again , a lot about 7.62x39 to like . For a shorter barrel length that optimizes round performance , there 's a lot about 7.62x39 to like ( 5.56 being designed for 20 " barrels , 7.62x39 for 16 " ) . <p> There 's more to the caliber debate , but this is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts : *They have a large batch of old new stock parts that will be available in the next few weeks ; that have been sitting for a long time . *Do not know what exact parts or their prices ; as that info was n't available . <p> Now this is getting interesting .

I think that if you are a manufacturer inside of the U.S. ( like now IWI and the likes of H&amp;K ) some of these importation bans do not apply . Think about it the Tavor barrels are military grade barrels ( stamped made in Israel ) being sold on a rifle assembled in the U.S. with imported Izzy parts .

I prefer the original CZ look and feel . AT 's and EAAs have the rails continuing to the end of the slide . The Sphinx Cheska and BRNOs have this milled off , ala Browning , or original CZ . If you look at the MR CZs , Eagles and Jericho , you will see the frame extending to the end of the slide , providing a Desert Eagle type appearance .

I 've heard that people between 18-20 were allowed to slip in quietly if they were otherwise legal ... Guess that 's not true . Talk about depriving you from the use of your property ! One thing , though-- blame must be given exactly where it is due . Clinton put them into the AWB , but it was then Sec'y of the Treasury Lloyd Bensen who made the administrative change at the urging of the Brady Foundation ( formerly Handgun Control , Inc . ) . Recent documents came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclassification of the Streetsweeper , Striker , USAS-12 and the Mossberg bullpup shotgun . The Bensen saw eye to eye with them on 3/4 of the weapons and the rest is history . I know that the FOIA documents were scanned and posted somewhere ..... Very interesting reading to see what happened behind the scenes ! <p> Stymie : Your words about cracked Sweepers mirrors what I 've heard from other current and previous owners . Looks like I 'll definitely be advising my client to seek out a Striker over a Sweeper . Too bad that an original Protecta ca n't be easily imported ! : ) Your Striker is a good looking gun , too ! <p> Brian Ski and Muzzleflash : I 've heard that a C3 can do anywhere between 1-3 transfers per year , and I 've heard that they can/can not do it if a DD guy is in the state . I know there are two DD guys within 40 miles of here ( a manufacturer and a dealer ) , so hopefully the one transfer does n't go away because they exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information .

Cobray.com has spare parts , but no 12 " bbl 's for sale : Who makes a 12 " barrel for one of these DDs ? <p> My owner 's manual lists FMJ as the manufacturer . I am guessing that you have the exact same model as I do . <p> 2 . This shotgun utilizes a spring driven revolving 12 round cylinder made of aluminum , housed in a steel drum . The ammo specs call for 2-3/4 " plastic shells only , no magnums The front and rear grips are made of glass fiber reinforced polycarbonate . Mine has the optional Armson OEG red dot sight . <p> 3 . Actually pulling the trigger is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety mechanism that moves horizontally from left to right , located behind the trigger . If you are right handed ( gripping the gun ) , your thumb will be able to push the safety to the right ( safe mode ) , and your index finger will be able to push the safety to the left ( firing mode ) . You will need to be in safe mode to unload the gun . If the mag is not wound up you will need to wind it by turning the winding key that is in front of the drum . It should ratchet up as you turn the key . It is the " unwinding " motion that allows for mag unloading . Open the aperture cover located on the back side of the drum , opposite from the spring loaded ejector rod . Making sure the safety is engaged ( pressed in with the thumb ) hold the weapon with the barrel up , and then squeeze/release the trigger . The mag will index , and the shell will slide out ( if you are unloading unfired shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't just fall out ; you will need to pull the ejector lever back to push the shell out . Advance the cylinder by squeezing the trigger , and repeat until all shells are removed . For storage , I like to unwind the spring completely . To reload , simply insert shells and turn the key to advance the drum . Once you load all 12 rounds finish turning the key until it is fully wound . When you are ready to fire disengage the safety with your index finger , and pull the trigger . The gun has a built in " drop safe " mechanism . Basically the cylinder stays out of alignment with the firing pin in either mode . In firing mode when you pull the trigger the cylinder will advance slightly to align with the barrel/firing pin before the hammer drops . In safe mode pulling the trigger only advances the cylinder for loading/unloading . No hammer drop will occur . <p> 4 . I will be happy to copy my manual and mail it to you . There 's not much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions and specs , it tells you how to remove the drum , pistol grip assembly for cleaning , and it has a parts diagram . Let me know . <p> 5 . The barrel that is pictured in the manual is the short 12 " barrel . I am not aware of a 12 " barrel for sale ; just the 18 " ones . I think most folks buy the 18 " ones and cut them off . <p> The cool thing about this design is that it allows you to shoot a variety of ammo that probably would n't cycle in semiauto 's , such as the specialty rounds like the flamethrower , flechette or bolo rounds . Down side is the reload time sucks , as the cylinder has to be advanced to extract the shells one by one . It 's cheaply made ( typical of Cobray ) but it does have a high cool factor , and it 's something different . <p> tunnelrat <p> 06-18-2006 , 10:12 PM <p> Regarding the reloading procedure : when the drum if fully wound , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few clicks . You can take advantage of this to enhance reload time by flipping the safety on after shooting a drum , and ejecting and loading as you continue to advance the drum by squeezing the trigger ; as opposed to ejecting them first , then reloading as you wind up . Having two full revolutions plus a few extra clicks gives you the option of loading/unloading by winding or by trigger . Either way will work ; just depends on your personal preference . <p> SC-Texas <p> 09-06-2006 , 04:10 PM <p> Got my paperwork last week . <p> Here is a video .

Help please ? <p> 1 . Importation is next to impossible . All NFA firearms imported or re-imported on or after Nov 1968 ( as per the GCA of 1968 ) are restricted as sales samples . They can only be owned by active SOT payers , law enforcement , or gov't entities . Most folks are familiar with " presample " rules for MG 's but do n't know that there are such things as SBS , suppressors , etc. , that also follow those same " presample " rules . ( We currently have a local SOT who found out that his two-dozen PD trade-in Benelli 14 " SBS are all " presamples " and not transferrables-- AFTER buying them . As you might suspect , this definitely lowered their value quite a bit . ) In addition , even a licensed importer has to go through the equivalent of getting a PD " love letter " ( much like a post-sample MG ) to get approval to import any NFA weapon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with .

A South African by the name of Stapleton emigrated to western PA and set up a factory in Ridgway , PA in the 80s to make a US version under the Sentinel name , about 15 miles from where I type this .

I was aware of the gun 's origin when I sold it as an FFL/SOT . Many people bought SWD Streetsweepers , which they considered to be " the same " , but I found to be inferior . <p> Penn Arms ( formerly Sentinel Arms ) has adopted a " politically correct " policy with regard to selling their product to the public , which I sincerely hope becomes their undoing ! <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still be made and transfered , but not DD LONG ... ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> I agree , labeling a 12 guage shotgun with a crap trigger-pull as a DD is pathetic . <p> The Saiga-12 with a 10 round magazine is a better set-up IMO , and is not a DD , yet . <p> Whoever made the USAS-12 and Striker-12 a DD is a complete moron . <p> There are H&amp;K and Beretta made shotguns that will shoot faster on semi than even a full auto 12 guage will fire and they hold 8 or 9 rounds , and yet they are not DDs .

I have a Striker-12 and wanted a manual . I e-mailed them ( even offered serial # as proof I had one ) and they charged me $15 plus shipping ( if my memory serves me ) . I would think they'de want to send one for free due to possible liability issues . I can even see charging $1 plus shipping , but $15 is just them being dicks . <p> prebans <p> 11-23-2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still think it is ridiculous that a 12 guage shotgun could be classified as a D.D . What prevents other shotguns from ending up with the same classification ? <p> Except for the .410 gauge , nothing prevents ANY common shotgun from being declared a Destructive Device ( DD ) . A DD is defined ( among other things ) as a weapon having a bore diamater greater than 0.5 " with " sporting shotguns " exempted . You 'll note that being .410 gauge is the only thing that saved the " Ladies Home Companion " , the .410 Streetsweeper . <p> What 's " sporting " ? It 's whatever those in charge want it to be . <p> In the case of the 12 gauge Streetsweeper , Striker-12 , and USAS-12 , the Brady Campaign ( formerly Handgun Control , Inc. ) specificially petitioned then Sec'y of the Treasury Lloyd Benson for the reclassification along with the factory Mossberg Bullpup . This info came to light after a lengthy FOIA request was made by NFA researcher Eric M. Larson . ( I 'm having a horrible time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them up some time ago so we could all see exactly what really happened . ) <p> Why the Mossberg Bullpup escaped classification may be of some importance when thinking into the future . I commonly hear two schools of thought in this discussion . The first is solely because it 's owned and used by more PD 's than all three of the others combined . This may or may not have played some importance in the determination . The second is the one that might be more important to our purposes ; its lack of " evil " features when compared to the other three . I 'll dispense with their shared characteristics ( &lt;sometimes multiple&gt; pistol grips , heat shields , etc. ) and concentrate on the differences . <p> 3 . Mossberg bullpup held 6 or 8 shells ; the other three held 10-20 shells . <p> Looking into the future , I definitely wonder about the future of the Saiga-12 ( and perhaps the Saiga-20 ) . The Saiga 12 is a semiautomatic ( #1 ) shotgun that uses detachable magazines ( #2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While VERY nifty , the alterations made to get them as pistol-grip and/or folding stock guns also makes me wonder . It 's legal now-- but could that " help " any DD reclassification ? ( This should NOT be taken and is NOT intended as an indictment of those who do this work ; it is ONLY something for us to consider IF we are n't vigilant at the polls . ) <p> Frankly , should the 2008 Presidential elections go wrong , it would n't surprise me if the new Treasury Sec'y got a request to reclass the Saiga series . It 'd surprise me even less if it became the fourth shotgun to fall into the DD class as a result of that request . <p> FWIW , <p> Mike <p> prebans <p> 11-23-2006 , 12:22 PM <p> While Penn Arms ' internal policies are maddening , I ca n't holler at them overly much . Let 's look at the facts of being in business as a DD Manufacturer . <p> 1 . Insurance . Think it 's hard to get insurance as a standard FFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DD manufacturing ! I 'd hate to know what their liability policies are . <p> 2 . Lawsuits due to misuse . If they sell to a civilian and dumb happens , they get sued and its all over the news . If they sell to a PD and dumb happens , they generally do n't get sued and the article will be small . Further , their insurance company might not cover lawsuits brought about from civilian sales . ( That small print never brings good things . ) <p> 3 . The DD classification undoubtably ruined their civilian sales . Do they want to deal with selling to a PD ( direct ) or sell to civilians ( F4 BS for those in PA and trying to find a DD dealer for those outside of PA ) ? <p> 4 . The BS factor ( individuals who have no chance of a signoff and/or those from non-DD states calling in and wasting time trying to get stuff they ca n't legally have ) will rise exponentially . <p> Basically , how much more would they make for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected increases in time spent on individual sales ? Further , would that additional profit justify the possible legal/lawsuit ramaifications ? <p> I submit that we should be less angry with Penn Arms for wanting to cover their own rear stemming from these legitimate concerns and more angry with those who have necessitated this climate of fear-- the brady bunch , the million mommy march , activist judges , etc . <p> Mike <p> SC-Texas <p> 11-25-2006 , 03:41 PM <p> Form 4 is the taxable form . : ) <p> Form 3 is the tax-free SOT-to-SOT form . <p> FYI , <p> Mike <p> Being an FFL/SOT I know that ( or should ) . Not that you could tell form my post . Thanks for clarifying that for the rest of the thread . <p> crunker <p> 11-28-2006 , 10:04 PM <p> So there is no way to buy a new shiny Striker-12 ?

One thing I noticed about the gun : not only is the drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since it is anodized I never paid much attention to it until I decided to cut the barrel down with a tubing cutter . I would be careful about shooting high brass/magnum loads because of this . Aside from the heavy trigger pull it shoots pretty good .

@@77051017 @5751017/ <p> Hi all , I 'm new to the forum and have a question , I just got a new to me ohio rapid fire galil and am noticing some play in the top cover ( very little really ) . I was wondering what is an acceptable amount of play in the top cover if any . <p> If this is bad I 'd like to get it fixed before I start pouring ammo through it given todays prices ofcourse , any point in the right direction is greatly appreciated . <p> slick24 <p> 02-26-2013 , 03:53 PM <p> I ca n't tell you about whether there should be any play , but my TennGalil build is super tight with no play in it . <p> Ed24601 <p> 02-26-2013 , 04:00 PM <p> Welcome . : waving : waving Need a further bit of info . This is a CAI rifle or some other ? CAI used ORF receivers and some pretty tired South American stuff for many of their builds , most of which were less than OK . How much play do you have as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tight on the top of the receiver . If it 's rocking side to side , you can put the squeeze on the top cover to get it to tighten up a bit . Is the recoil spring guide tight in the cover ? Is the cover tight against the gas tube ? Take the recoil guide rod/spring assy out and check the cover fit side to side , front to back . Is the rear of the cover tight in the recess on the back of the receiver ? Are the sides of the cover tight against the receiver . If the answer to any of the above questions is NO , then think about replacing . I had a CAI Golani that the top cover was loose and ended up replacing it . It had been stretched and abused too many times in the past . Sometimes , the covers are just tired and need to be tossed for a new one . All of mine are TIGHT ! ! My : 2cents <p> lcastillo <p> 03-01-2013 , 03:17 AM <p> Brouhaha , <p> Welcome to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acceptable amount of play on a Galil topcover . It should be close to none . Here is why . The development of the Galil rifle was loosely taken from the AK-47 design so in a effort to improve accuracy the Israeli engineers moved the rear sight further back on the Galil 's topcover opposed to the AK-47 sights which where placed much closer together . The AK 's rear sight was fixed on the upper receiver making it a more stable platform . The Galil 's rear sight of course is removed when the top cover is taken off for cleaning . If you have a slight play when you move the topcover by hand you will surely have even more play during firing affecting accuracy down range . <p> The Galil/Golani/ORF topcovers are notorious for being a S.O.B . to put back together and many new/novice Galil owners will break out hammers , mallets trying to get the damn thing back on . Sometimes this will lead to warping the topcover and giving this type of play you described . Start first by laying your topcover on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the topcover . If you are good and flat there the next thing I would check is for a worn gastube ( yes gastube ) My CAI Golani came with a loose topcover and I noticed where the topcover and the gastube meet ( channel ) there was quite a bit of wear . I bought a new gas tube ( with less wear ) and my cover was tight again and problem solved ! Congrats on your new rifle !

Front sight moved far right to compensate . <p> Will adjusting the back strap fix this or do I need to bend it , or just try to source a new top cover ? <p> I thought about JB welding a metal shim , but I 'd really like to fix it correctly . <p> Thanks Tennagalil . Plan on sending it your way eventually anyway to raise/fix Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's advisable .

Once I have the three builds completed , I 'll probably configure this differently however , but it 's currently fulfilling the role of a general purpose intermediate tactical rifle for me .

One on the left is an unaltered factory Bushmaster . The Bushmaster lower on the right has had extra relief work done to keep horizontal stress from squeezing the link . <p> LONG ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a SP1 lower to compare . The LL was sold to me in a Bushmaster host . The link would work without a KNS protector on the link . The original Bushmaster lower would push the link together from either side . Since the link has a split down the middle , it was flexing the link toward the center . The LL protector has the exact same shape as the LL , but is solid in the center . So the protector ca n't flex toward the center , so the link/protector would bind on the radius where the fire control opening narrows over the selector . <p> There was also the same issue at the end of the take down opening where the buffer retainer is . There were marks on the link from the small amount of use from the previous owner 's use of the link . He had bought and used the link long before the KNS protector existed . He told me that the dealer he bought the link from apologized that the sales price for the link was $700 . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the stamp . <p> I would highly recommend the MGI lower . Like " amphibian " , my favorite AR set up is 7.62X39 . I have an 11.5 " upper that I use with an AAC M47-2000 can and EBR 220 grain 7.62X39 subsonic ammo . I had some " Franken " mags and a drum with a feed tower . Standard ball ammo would work fine . But the soft point 220 grain ammo would n't feed . But with the MGI with the AK magwell , AK mags and some feed ramp work in the upper , the MGI would feed the subsonic ammo . It is about as loud as my 9mm 5 " TROS upper with 147 grain and my Gem-Tech Raptor . Two of the three MGI lowers I have are marked " SAFE " and SEMI " . It is too bad that MGI does n't offer a lower already marked " AUTO " . <p> Scott <p> piratesover40 <p> 12-11-2008 , 02:04 PM <p> I am looking to buy a lightning link soon , so I was wondering if anybody knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that dpms and bushmaster are , but I would like to know if anybody knows of some other factory low shelf choices . <p> I 'd be leary of buying anything from Anvil Arms .

The markings you see on the left side were added by Vector , which is why they do n't look like other IMI markings . <p> Realnutjob <p> 12-11-2012 , 06:25 PM <p> Green Mountain makes the best UZI barrels ....... . <p> I have a GM barrel cut exactly like yours that did exactly what yours is doing , that I tried in two different NDS receiver guns with IMI model B bolts correctly fitted and one IMI Action Arms gun with model A bolt correctly fitted . All three of these ran correctly with an IMI barrel and FTF with the GM barrel and I used several different mags also . I could only draw one conclusion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the only one to have this problem , well maybe until now . I 'm sure GM is a fine company with great people running it . Does n't change the fact , I could not get their barrel to run in three guns . I 'm not bashing any company or anyone , but , expressing my experience with a GM barrel , since someone here has asked what people thought was his problem . I really hope you find another issue going on with your gun . I personally would not buy another GM barrel machined like this , others here quite strongly would disagree with me , might want to listen to them and try something else to fix your issue . <p> Jack007 <p> 12-12-2012 , 09:20 AM <p> Okay , let 's jump in here before this becomes a " trash Green Mountain " thread . <p> Anybody can make a mistake . When GM first started making Uzi bbls. they unwittingly used some out of spec bbls. as models . Since the bbls. belonged to a C3 , who was using them in guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take long before the phones started ringing and it was back to the drawing boards . Dennis is a first class guy who stands behind his products . I can personally vouch for that . If you have an issue , ask to talk with him directly ( yes he 's more than happy to talk with customers ) and he 'll make it right . I had some of his first run chromed Mini bbls. and the chambers were slightly tight . He personally made them right , and not only fixed them , he sent me an extra bbl. free with an apology for my troubles . You do n't have too many guys like that in business today ! That said , GM is n't the only company making Uzi bbls . Maybe others might be more to your liking . Personally , I love my chromed bore . I 've put literally thousands of rounds downrange through my Green Mountain without a hiccup since , and that chrome still looks like a mirror . Once you go chrome , you never go back . : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Your ammo appears to me to be reloads ? <p> The pictures seem to show a bit of an open crimp to me . If nothing else solves the problem , try just a tad more crimp and see what happens . Hope this comment is helpful to you . <p> westford86 <p> 12-12-2012 , 03:22 PM <p> Your ammo appears to me to be reloads ? <p> The pictures seem to show a bit of an open crimp to me . If nothing else solves the problem , try just a tad more crimp and see what happens . Hope this comment is helpful to you . <p> The ammo is factory , fresh out of the box . The reason that it may appear as if there is n't enough crimp is because the jamming issue is dislodging the bullet from the case ( knocking it out of alignment , they 're visibly skewed ) , so it 's flaring the mouth of the brass . Keep in mind I 've only posted pictures of damaged and fired brass ... <p> Okay , let 's jump in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Anybody can make a mistake . When GM first started making Uzi bbls. they unwittingly used some out of spec bbls. as models . Since the bbls. belonged to a C3 , who was using them in guns , they ASSumed they were okay . It did n't take long before the phones started ringing and it was back to the drawing boards . <p> I am by no means trying to bash GM . I decide to go with one of their barrels because they were the only ones offering chrome lining . When I bough the barrel they provided fantastic customer service , and they are certainly a stand up company . I can also say that the quality of the product I received is top notch too ; but even companies on the top of their game make mistakes , look at all the Ferrari 458 's that have burned to the ground ... <p> Anyway , the problem is without a doubt the barrel . I went to the range today with the factory 16 " barrel installed , and I had no stoppages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to waste any more ammo with the gun clearly back to perfect functionality ... <p> I am still surprised that the barrel does n't function , as it 's one of their most recent production runs from only a few months ago . I figured by now any flaws would have been worked out . The barrel should have been the first thing I checked , as it 's the only thing I 've changed about the gun , but I guess I was still in disbelief that my shinny new uber-$$ component could be flawed ... Whatever it 's worth for making excuses about poor troubleshooting skills , I had n't touched the gun in almost a year as I was waiting for my tax stamp to come back and it was at the engraver forever . <p> So I guess it 's time to contact GM and see if they 'll re-profile it to IMI spec . <p> Slapshot <p> 12-12-2012 , 05:13 PM <p> westford86 , <p> Sorry , my error on the reloads . <p> Best of luck and I hope you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great video you made there ! <p> Realnutjob <p> 12-12-2012 , 07:34 PM <p> " I am still surprised that the barrel does n't function , as it 's one of their most recent production runs from only a few months ago " <p> I was surprized mine did n't function as well . The rest of the barrel fit the receiver so well , nice and tight . Mine is a year or more old and just does not function 100% even with smoothing the sharp ridge left in machining process by GM .

I recently sent them my barrel to reprofile . I had a similar problem that i believe was caused by the sharp edge .

I just completed my Uzi build last Wednesday when the receiver arrived from NoDak . I took her to the range yesterday and had failure to feed issues . I was using Federal 9mm at first and would get a FTF every other round . I switched to some Remington 9mm and would get FTF when hand cycling in the first round but then it was firing fine after that . I too have a recently purchased GM barrel and it does fit the Uzi very well but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to send it back . <p> Southern Raider <p> 02-12-2013 , 10:33 PM <p> And you get a thanks from me too for posting this . I also have a GM barrrel from the batch a few months back , and everything you posted here looks just like mine . ( Except the gouges in the brass are a bit further back ) Looks like I know what to do . <p> rhouston8 <p> 02-14-2013 , 05:39 PM <p> great thread ... and awesome pro quality pics . Thanks so much for sharing . Dang .... I 'm embarrassed to even post a how to fix thread after reading this . I guess " It just jams " wo n't cut it . Gentlemen the bar has been raised . <p> -HH <p> BrownTrout <p> 06-25-2013 , 07:37 PM <p> Some years ago I purchased a " new in box " full auto Vector Uzi . Have been using it ever since and failure to feed is very common with the gun , generally every other magazine . The cartridge typically gets half way or more into the breech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FMJ is jammed down into the brass . Are the original barrels from Vector the GM barrel ? Does the barrel issue discussed in this thread also apply to full auto ? <p> Thanks in advance for replies . <p> JT-AR-MG42 <p> 06-25-2013 , 09:14 PM <p> Pretty vague description BT , <p> How can a round halfway into the chamber come out with bullet set back ? The only thing I can think that would cause bullet set back on either a factory round or a quality reload would be for the nose to contact the edge of the barrel . <p> Do you get this issue from both sides of the magazine ? Does the gun shoot to the sights with the front sight centered ? It should be very close . Take it back out and check . <p> My guess is that it occurs on one side of the mag only . That would indicate sideways trunnion mis-alignment . Trunnion mis-alignment would cause the gun to shoot to either the left or right in a pretty big way . <p> An unfortunate ailment of some FA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I believe GM started making barrels as surplus stocks of nice barrels dried up , not before . <p> My take without more info , JT <p> BrownTrout <p> 06-25-2013 , 09:30 PM <p> Thanks for the reply JT . Gun is very accurate . All ammo is brand new . Will snap some photos , check mag side , and repost in 2-4 weeks after visit to range . 
@@77051029 @5751029/ 71162 @qwx691162 <p> Vietnamese K-50M submachine gun is a conversion of a Chinese-made Type 50 submachine gun ( a license-built version of the Soviet Shpagin PPSh-41 ) . During the sixties , China supplied many small arms to North Vietnam , including Type 50 submachine guns , many of which were later converted into more compact and maneuverable K-50M versions by local Vietnamese workshops.Conversion included shortening of the barrel jacket , installation of the new front sight , removal of the wooden stock and installation of the pistol grip and telescoped buttstock made of steel wire . All internal components remained the same as in Type 50 / PPSh-41 . K-50M submachine gun is a blowback-operated weapon that fires from open bolt , in single shots and full automatic . Fire mode selector is located in front of the trigger , safety is built into the bolt handle . Receiver of the weapon is stamped from steel . Gun uses PPSh-41-type 35-round curved box magazines , use of 71-round PPSh-41 drums is possible only if the telescoping butt is retracted .

I 'm getting sick of checking back with Botach , they 'll never get more . <p> ericzs1 - What was your question , maybe I could get it answered . <p> I 'll double check , but I 'm quite sure it is Teak . <p> The wood used on Galils is the same type used on the IMI Romat FAL , so I 'll see if any of the FAL experts can give a more precise identification . <p> RSR - Yes , I think the Osage Orange would be considerably harder to work , but in the end , it 'd be much stronger , and decay resistant . And , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ta see if they 're willing do it in the Osage Orange . Real nice color too . Another consideration is the possible difference between " old growth teak " and " new growth teak " . The old growth is said to be extremely decay resistant , as the new growth is about average , not great . Others say teak is teak , no difference . Not easy to tell the difference by sight , and I 'm sure the seller would say it 's whatever they think I want it to be . Any Teak experts out there ? Beech is n't nearly as decay resistant as either of them , or nearly strong , and much less stable . <p> Confirmed with the FAL guys it is Beech and not Teak , sorry for the mistake . <p> That said I think it might be some type of Beech native to the region that give it the unique look . The typically Beech furniture I have seen made for rifles is typically more of a cream/tan color , rather than the distinctive golden-yellow . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galils when new , most of the new old stock galil handguards I 've gotten have been pretty well soaked in oil and more of a midway between tan and brown .

But , the oil soak will darken . <p> Very true ! I picked up a few NOS handguards over the years ( that I stupidly sold for the most part ) that came covered in grease ... I recollect buying one in 2011 that was new in the packaging , covered in cosmo . However I have also come across some that showed up with a different kind of preservative , more viscous like a standard motor oil , and in these cases I found the wood to have a more orange look to them . The cosmoline-covered examples typically were more golden-yellow , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood at some point . <p> I sort of have this theory that wood used on pre-bans was treated/sealed differently than the military production ones , since pre-bans normally show the golden-yellow shades versus the orange/brown of IDF examples . It could be lots of different factors that cause this , but I think both look quite good . <p> Ironwood designs just contacted me .
