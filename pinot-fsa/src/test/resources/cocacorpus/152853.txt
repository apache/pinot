At the same time , there has been little talk about how exactly managers can implement this in practice . <p> Its essential that new and experienced managers alike learn exactly how to give advice that fuels self-motivation , rather than blowing it out . <p> Here are seven tips to keep in mind : <p> 1 . Are you looking at feedback with a growth mindset ? <p> A recent Gallup report highlighted that what millennial employees actually want is more feedback , though only 15% routinely ask for it . The report also found that only 19% receive it regularly . Its not just praise that they 're looking for either . A study byZenger/Folkman found that 57% of people would actually prefer to receive constructive over positive feedback . A further 92% agreed that , if given appropriately , constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider the personality of each individual <p> While there are certain rules to giving feedback correctly , if you get to know each of your teammates well you can more easily adjust your approach to fit their personality . For example , some people like to receive feedback in person so they can talk it through on the spot . Others may prefer time to reflect on their feedback before discussing it with you . If you 're having trouble figuring out the feedback personality of your team , check out our guide ondifferent personality types in the workplace and how to give feedback to each of them . <p> 3 . Focus on improvement , not mistakes <p> For all personality types , its important to frame your feedback in a constructive , rather than reproving manner . Rather than dwelling on the past think about the future . Rather than taking it from the perspective of , " This and this did n't  go well " instead speak in terms of " next time if we change or add this I believe we can improve performance on this project/task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best way to do this is to help them recognize their strengths and past successes so that they can leverage them to overcome obstacles.Gallup found that employees who use their strengths everyday are 3 times more likely to report having an excellent quality of life , 6 times more likely to be engaged at work , 8% more productive and 15% less likely to quit their jobs . <p> 5 . Avoid killing projects altogether <p> Sometimes it may not be a mistake or failure of a project that causes it to be shut down . Sudden shifts in strategy or focus can also lead to realignment in your company and thereby team goals . In an inspirationalTEDTalk , Dan Ariely describes a situation he encountered at a large tech company in Seattle . A tech team had been tasked to create a new cutting edge product . Suddenly , in the midst of its execution , the team was told that the company decided to go in a different direction and the project was shelved . <p> 6 . Allow for creativity <p> Not everyone will approach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new things ( and most importantly , eliminating fear of failure ) is the best way to generate innovation . If you find yourself saying " we always do things this way " or " let 's not rock the boat " it could be a signal to step back and allow for more risk taking within your team . <p> 7 . Learn by doing <p> Think about the impact of the decision your employee is making . Remember that you can teach someone how to do something but ultimately the best way to learn is by doing . If its a small decision that could serve as a learning opportunity , let them make it and be ready to give advice on how to improve next time . Getting the chance to decide and then seeing the results will make them much more likely to come to you and be open for feedback . 14767 @qwx874767 14769 @qwx874769

When an entrepreneur sets out to make a difference in the world through leadership , the motivation often stems from a desire to be of service to others , which is an undeniably powerful intention to have , " she said . <p> " However , in order to embody conscious leadership , you must start by looking at how you can be of service to your own growth , your own expansion , and your own willingness to step outside of your comfort zone over and over again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , is " not to run around trying to save the world " . " Your job is to go within , do the inner work that allows you to show up as your most powerful , authentic self which will in turn inspire others to do the same , " she said . <p> " Conscious leadership requires you to identify , plan for , and move through the patterns that come up every time you 're about to step out of your comfort zone .

You know that you 've picked up some patterns over the years that do n't  serve you ( procrastination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-sabotage , etc. ) , but what 's the point of spending time with the stuff that holds you back ? <p> Think about it this way : The most detailed roadmap in the world is useless if its not marked with a " YOU ARE HERE . " <p> So , if you want to be able to draw out your roadmap for success , you 've got to be willing to start right where you are . <p> Gather your tools and create safety Once you 've identified where you are , its important to give yourself the tools that can support the kind of growth you want to experience . So often we pick up tools throughout our lives that are designed to numb out the " bad stuff " and eliminate fear or pain . Drinking , gossiping , avoiding responsibilities , and playing it safe are a few ways we do this that come to mind . But your fear and your pain are n't  the enemy .

Working with a coach , finding a good therapist and surrounding yourself with other people who practice this type of radical responsibility are all wonderful places to start . <p> When you 've got the right tools in your tool belt , you 're unstoppable . <p> Stay in your own lane Authenticity is your x-factor that thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .

" The person who has danced with their shadows and still knows how unconditionally worthy she is . This is what attracts people to you , your self-proclaimed permission . <p> Everyone is running around asking for permission to dream , to build , to start and yet , were the only ones who hold the power to give it to ourselves . <p> So , as a conscious leader , while its impossible for you to grant someone else permission to be themselves , its your duty to show someone what that looks like , that its safe to shine , that being different is something worth celebrating . To be a walking invitation for others to grant themselves permission to step into their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its how you do it Your audience , followers , fans and clients are inspired by how you show up in the world .

But it is your hill . Its a strategic hill . You do n't  know if you want to be a hero . And if you really need to be a hero to keep this hill , you could be dead already . Let 's get concrete for a moment ! <p> This hill could be that your boss caves every time a client criticises your area and you have to pick up the pieces , backtrack and rework things . It could be that you need to take time off outside normal days and your boss does n't  believe in that kind of stuff . Maybe you are convinced that following current strategy will shut off the companys main source of income . <p> Its not about the hill as such . Its whether you will be the hero who takes the hill and goes off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight another day . <p> Here are five questions to help you decide . <p> Question 1 . Who is your buddy ? In every good war movie the hero has buddies . From The Magnificent Seven to The Dirty Dozen via Platoon and Saving Private Ryan , its the people supporting you in taking the hill that make the difference . So , the first question to ask is , who is your buddy ? Who is on your side ? <p> If you are the only soldier standing up to the corporate psychopath , the only one trying to fix the supply chain problem or to reconfigure the roster , then you need some buddies before you start your assault . <p> Question 2 : Who will see ? The second question is , who will see you ? And who should see you ? If you are behind enemy lines and are about to blow up the bridge before dawn , then its important that no one sees you . On the other hand , if this assault is an action designed to flush out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who understand what your action means can find you . <p> In real-world terms , if you want to be seen , consider some well-placed , strategically crafted questions at a work in progress meeting as a first salvo . If you do n't  , then ask the same question one-on-one , starting with the lowest-ranking person with power . Ideally you will gain an ally , and you wont be blamed if they ask the question again themselves . <p> Question 3 : What 's the escape route ? The third question is , what 's your escape route ? Do n't  blow up the bridge if you have no way of crossing it yourself . Or at least blow it up from the side you want to end up on . In corporate terms this means you need to put your feelers out to the market . Update your LinkedIn profile . First turn off those notifications that tell your boss you 're updating ! <p> And talk to agents . Often . Just in case . Do n't  wait to be found . Have lunch with your old boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need more allies , a safe house or an escape route ! As a sidebar : if your boss is part of the problem , consider giving their name to the agent ! <p> Question 4 : What does reconnaissance tell you ? Before soldiers blow up any bridge , they go on a reconnaissance . Reconnaissance is French for recognition . It literally means re-know . <p> So , if you have a political issue that you want to broach , a hill you have to take , go check out the territory . Re-know current policy . Re-know who supports it . Re-know the players in your industry . Is what you want already happening somewhere in your organisation ? Is it happening somewhere in your industry ? How does what you want align with industry best practice ? How do your systems and procedures support it ( or not ) ? Check out how big this hill really is . If you do n't  know anyone to ask in your industry , then that 's a weakness you need to patch up pretty quickly ! <p> Question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a special skill . Can you whistle , are you a ventriloquist , or do you have a friend in intelligence ? Do you have a good heart , an eye for a bargain , or a lot of great connections ? Ask yourself what makes you different , not just in terms of solving this political problem but also in terms of your value to the organisation . How can you use this special skill as leverage ? <p> This is n't just about your LinkedIn profile . It may be your family that will get you through . Or your loyalty . Maybe it is your ability to find the positive , transform peoples ideas , or just that you are resilient . Find your strengths and play to them . And let your weaknesses alone . They wont help you here . There are also some things not to take into account in your hill assault . <p> When considering whether or not to take this hill , these things should not come into the equation : I cant afford to be a hero Its not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen Why me ? <p> Every time you weigh up the pros and cons of taking that political hill , assemble your buddies , make sure you 're seen ( or not ) by the right people , get your escape route clear , do some reconnaissance , and work to your strengths . <p> In the end hills do n't  matter . Integrity , courage and connections within your platoon matter . Get to it , soldier ! <p> Rider : I have never been to war . All I know about war I have learnt from my slim knowledge of war movies .

@@98364548 @2564548/ <h> How to be a better negotiator <p> by Insurance Business21 Apr 2017 <p> SHARE <h> How to be a better negotiator <p> The art of negotiation is one that is truly underestimated in the corporate and small business world many professionals fixate on playing either good cop or bad cop when it comes to sealing a deal . This turns what is actually a science into a gambling game where the high stakes do n't  always pay . <p> The basic premise of negotiation is to work together with another party to achieve an outcome that works for you both . Rather than come from a traditional stance , where there 's a winner and a loser , its best to think flexibly . <p> In closing hundreds of deals throughout my career as a professional property buyer , I 've learned a number of techniques to master negotiation that will have you getting what you need without damaging any relationships along the way . <p> Create a third position Its important to remember that a negotiation is an exchange of energy . Place two people face to face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ego can get in the way because each person feels they 're being threatened personally . <p> Creating a third position , where both people turn to face the problem , diverts the intense energy of each person away from confrontation and focuses their attention on solving the issue . Separating the problem from the person avoids any personality clashes and reduces the chance of offending the other person . Rather than reacting harshly to the other party not wanting to budge from their original offer because they 're stubborn and unreasonable , you can instead focus attention on the problem . Take personality out of the equation , and focus on finding a solution rather than becoming defensive and equally unreasonable . <p> Look for the why Most people will make a decision based on reason . Finding out what that reason is can be an invaluable strategy , as it gives you the opportunity to create a solution , often in return for what you want . For example , if a colleague has asked for a three-month extended vacation during the business busiest time , you can negotiate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period . <p> Avoid getting personal No one likes to be attacked personally . Even when you 're negotiating through a third party , you have to assume that this third party may communicate your every word to the person you are trying to settle a deal with . So keep it polite and remember that you 're trying to get them to cooperate . <p> Playing the blame game or reacting negatively will work against your goals . Even when something does n't  go your way , stay calm and be respectful , and remember that you may lose in the short term , but as long as your eye is on the prize , your long-term goals should come to fruition . <p> You also need to avoid thinking the worst of the other party . For example , just because they request that you make an upfront payment before receiving the goods does not mean that they 're going to steal your money . This can be difficult , as you do n't  necessarily know the background of the person you 're dealing with in a negotiation . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive and remember , they may actually be thinking the same about you ! <p> Be flexible The more flexible you can be toward the other party , the more likely they will be willing to give you what you want . <p> If you can decide what you want before you go into the negotiation , such as your best offer and what terms you can and cant waver on , you often can give the other party what they want without having to sacrifice your position . <p> Think of the other person At the end of the day , a negotiation , however brief , is a relationship . If you fail to consider the other persons feelings or what they want , then it is unlikely you will have much success . <p> If they are resolute about particular terms of the negotiation , it can be beneficial to withhold your judgment and put yourself in their shoes . Is there a reason why they 're being so firm ? Is there something important to them that you have n't considered ? After all , you might very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . <p> Having some empathy for the other person will often ease the pressure in a negotiation enough to get them across the line on the other things that are important to you . <p> Using if One of the secrets to a successful negotiation is to never give anything up without asking for something in return , even if its small . Using if through your negotiation is a good way to handle this . <p> If I give you then I would like I 'm happy to give you if If you can then I 'd be more than happy to ... <p> Use silence One of the most effective ways to negotiate is to stay quiet . This may not be appropriate in situations where there are five other parties all trying to win over your potential customer , but it can be invaluable when the other party is poised on a favorable outcome . <p> When you remain silent , you automatically get the ball in your court , so to speak , which leaves you with the power to make the next call . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may achieve their outcome . This can create the impression for the other party that the negotiation process may soon end with a good result and they can walk away happy . When you do come back to the table with a counter offer , their anticipation of closing the deal immediately will make the seller more willing to sacrifice items that they may have fought hard to get earlier , all because they 've seen the light at the end of the tunnel . <p> Silence can be useful for difficult negotiations , as it can give the time needed for both parties to cool off . Sitting back can give you the perspective you need to get a better understanding of the situation and provide you with a long-term view . <p> Avoid any confusion Sometimes it can be difficult to draw the line between offering help and asking for business , especially with people with whom you have developed a relationship within a casual setting . <p> If you feel you 're approaching a level of information that you think you should be charging for , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would like to work together on something , or This is the sort of information I often provide to my client base ; that way , you 're being clear on your expectations for the future without severing the lines of communication altogether . <p> Strike a pose While most of us have come across an overbearing tyrant trying to win power by force , an equally destructive force can be approaching a negotiation lacking confidence and presence . <p> Harvards Amy Cuddy has a wonderful presentation on conveying presence in front of peers , which shows that it can be as simple as the way you hold your posture before you enter the room . Two minutes with your head up , shoulders back and hands on hips can really provide the confidence you need to stand your ground and muster the courage to ask for what you want . <p> The biggest misunderstanding surrounding the art of negotiation is in its actual definition . Its important to remember that negotiation is not used to get the best deal possible or get the most out of someone for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most positive outcome for all parties involved . The origin of the word negotiation comes from the Latin term negotiates , meaning to carry on business , and with the right techniques , you will carry on closing deals , securing clients and building relationships . <p> This is a slightly amended version of an article written by industry expert Josh Masters .

@@98364713 @2564713/ <h> All you ever wanted to know about mortgage default insurance <p> by Kimberly Greene25 Jan 2017 <p> SHARE <h> All you ever wanted to know about mortgage default insurance <p> For most people , especially first-time home buyers , mortgage default insurance is a necessary evil when buying a home . Mortgage default is also known as just mortgage insurance , and although you are the one who gets the insurance , its not to protect you ; its there to protect the lender . <p> What is mortgage insurance ? <p> Mortgage insurance is in place to protect your mortgage lender in the event that you default on your mortgage . Whether or not you need mortgage insurance depends on the amount of money you have upfront for your down payment . If you have more than 20 per cent of the purchase price of the property to pay upfront in cash as a down payment , then you will get a " conventional " mortgage and do n't  need mortgage insurance . If you have anything between five per cent and 20 per cent , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( If you have less than five per cent down , then you wont be able to get a mortgage at all , so keep saving ! ) <p> The percentage of money you need upfront as your down payment is what determines whether or not your mortgage is high risk or low risk , more commonly known as high ratio or low ratio . If you have less than 20 per cent as a down payment , then the mortgage is considered having a high loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratio ; that means that the ratio of the amount of the loan to the value of the property is high . <p> Conversely , if you have more than a 20 per cent down payment , the amount of the loan relative to the value you have in the property is lower . The lower the LTV ratio , the less risky your loan appears to your lender , and so if you have a high LTV ratio its seen as a risky loan , requiring private mortgage insurance . The LTV ratio is calculated as your principal mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if lower . <p> Technically the lender pays for mortgage insurance , but that cost of those premiums anywhere between one per cent to upwards of three per cent of the total amount of the loan is passed onto you , the borrower . The insurance provider calculates the premium as a percentage of the loan principal amount , and that percentage is based on the LTV ratio of your mortgage . The premium is generally rolled into the mortgage but can be paid upfront as part of the closing costs . If the insurance premium is added to the mortgage amount , then you will pay interest on the total amount borrowed , including the mortgage insurance premium . Premiums in Manitoba , Ontario and Quebec , however , are subject to provincial sales tax , and this tax can not be added to the loan amount ; its due at closing . <p> Mortgage insurers <p> In Canada , there are three bodies responsible for providing mortgage insurance : Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation ( CMHC ) , Genworth Financial Canada , and Canada Guaranty . CMHC is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guaranty are private insurers . CMHC is the primary insurer for housing in small and rural communities , and the only insurer of mortgages for multi-unit residential properties , including large rental buildings , student housing and nursing and retirement homes . It is the largest provider of mortgage default insurance by far . <p> As a borrower , you generally would n't have any contact with the mortgage insurer because your lender selects the mortgage insurer , not you . Each mortgage insurer has its own criteria for evaluating the borrower and the property , and it decides whether or not a mortgage can be insured . Because of this , its possible that your lender may approve your mortgage application , but the mortgage insurer wont . In that case , you wont be able to get a mortgage unless your lender decides to try another insurer . <p> How it works <p> When you default on your mortgage , someone has to pay off the remainder of your loan . If you have mortgage insurance for the property , the lender can make a claim on the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're still responsible for any balance remaining to the insurer . <p> " If a borrower defaults , the insurer may oversee all legal proceedings and payment enforcement . In addition , the insurer compensates the lender should there be a shortfall after the property has been sold and expenses paid . The defaulting borrower remains responsible for any shortfall on the mortgage and the lender or mortgage insurer may pursue the borrower for any deficiency following sale of the property , " according to Scotiabank . <p> In other words , if the sale of the property is n't enough to cover the balance of the mortgage owing to the lender , then you wo n't get away scot-free your lender or insurer are able to pursue legal avenues to come after you personally for the remainder of the balance . <p> Mortgage insurance exceptions <p> If you are buying an investment property , that property wont be eligible for mortgage insurance .

If mortgage insurance does n't  exist , then lenders would n't be able to offer competitive mortgage rates to borrowers who are getting high ratio mortgages . Rather than assuming all of the risk , lenders share the risk with mortgage insurers . So although you 're paying mortgage insurance , you 're benefitting from paying less interest on the total mortgage amount . <p> Obviously having as big of a down payment is the best option if you 're buying a home , as it ends up saving you money in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that cash or do n't  want to use all of your available cash up front , then mortgage insurance allows your lender to rest easy that theyll be taken care of should you not be able to afford your mortgage . <p> SHARE 14767 @qwx874767 14769 @qwx874769

In a nutshell , new regulations include lower accident benefit limits in standard insurance policies , new options to increase coverage , new procedures for payment and a mandatory Winter Tire Discount ( up to 5% ) offered by insurance companies across Ontario . <p> The winter tire discount came into play as of January 1 , while most changes come into effect June . <p> " Its important consumers understand that Ontario Auto coverage is changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These changes continue the trend of more choice for consumers products can be tailored to suit individual needs and budget . <p> " Client lifestyle is a real focus of this campaign . This is a tremendous opportunity for brokers to lead the conversation with their clients and ensure they have the best coverage for their lifestyle , " Murphy added . <p> But the IBAO acknowledges that car insurance can sometimes come with negative connotations , but remind consumers that insurance is a safety net , protecting against risk ; insurance is a critical factor in individual and collective welfare . <p> The opportunity with this new set of measures is to step back and look at what your client really needs . Does their employer provide a Group Insurance Plan ? Look into what that policy covers , as most benefit packages are limited to $500/year per practitioner , which can be exhausted quickly even in cases of minor accidents . <p> Client with dependents , like children or elderly parents , who would care for them in the event of injury ? <p> The IBAO reminds brokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't  include benefits like dependent care , and that gaps might exist depending on the lifestyle . The good news is there 's opportunity to fill those gaps by increasing coverage or adding options to cover specific areas . <p> The IBAO campaign will include broker education , including an on-demand webinar that reviews changes and the transition process and a panel discussion featuring insurers , legal experts and brokers that takes a more in-depth look at the implications changes will have on consumers . <p> In related news , the IBAO is addressing concerns over MTO and Service Ontario , after broker feedback indicated instances of delayed connectivity between a broker 's issuance of an auto policy and proof of insurance when the client arrives at the MTO or Service Ontario office . <p> A directive from the MTO will be sent to Service Ontario offices to reconfirm that proof of insurance by way of a liability certificate ( even a faxed copy ) will enable your customers to renew their stickers . <p> If your clients continue to have problems getting renewal stickers , the IBAO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help the MTO identify those areas which may require further training . <p> Ontario auto insurance has definitely changed since 2010 and continues to change for the worst . Under the guise of fighting fraud , all benefits continue to be dramatically cut with many cuts implemented this June . But worse , almost one out of every 2 claimants does n't get them when necessary in any case . Even if upgrades are made to standard policies , the upgrades are also insufficient . So what " safety net " are we talking about when far too many legitimate claimants have to fight for years to receive these ever-decreasing benefits , no matter the policy enhancement . The policy upgrades are touted as providing choice - tailored to individual needs and budgets - tell that to a seriously injured motor vehicle accident victim who gets put in the MIG ( minor injury category ) and ca n't " escape " the $3,500 maximum treatment in order to access the benefits for the seriously injured : now $50,000 in treatment benefits down from $100,000 . Tell that to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $185 per week for two years maximum and then end up on ODSP .

The IBAO 's Alice-In-Wonderland up-is-down-and down-is-up fraud fighting rhetoric has managed to overtake even that of the IBC . How do brokers benefits from vilifying the injured ( even the most seriously injured ) in the way the IBAO has - and in the way this journal has ? Do you people people really believe quadriplegics are exaggerating their injuries for secondary gain . Of course you do n't .

Cooper explains below why you should become an AR ... <p> Being an AR is the most efficient and effective way to still be an insurance broker , while getting " back office " support and become self-empowered . You are also your own business and utilise the skills and experience you have generated over many years for very unappreciative employers who fail to either promote you , reward you appropriately or make too many demands on you . <p> Providing you are organised , have a strategy or plan and are motivated enough , it is a recipe for great success and a much happier lifestyle . <p> Sadly , not everyone has caught up with the huge growth in this area . Some mainstream insurers grapple with how ARs should be serviced or how they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or only the licence holder who in many cases are simply administrating and providing IT and compliance support ? <p> The fact is that insurance is very much a relationships business , whether you are an employee , employer or an AR of an insurance broker . If insurers put aside how the broker is employed , they should be treating each and every broker the same way . <p> NIBA has been very slow to embrace the AR concept . However they appear to be accepting the fact that this is a natural evolution of the intermediary area , and for good reason . <p> There are two main types of AR model . There is the type that is used by the internationals and some national insurance broker models . This is where the broking firm owns the business and pays around a third of the total commission to the AR . An advantage of this is that you are given a book of business to manage . However there is quite a great deal of control from the licensee and pressure to grow the book of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is their relationship with the client that keeps it with the broking firm . <p> Then there is the other model which is starting to prove very successful and creating strong growth . This is the model used by broking firms such as Insurance Advisernet , NAS , Westcourt , United , the Winley Group and others , where they are allowing the AR to own their client portfolio and only retain 15% to 30% of the ARs commission . When a brokers career has stagnated , this is a great option to open a new chapter in your career . <p> The difference is that with only a $300,000 brokerage book of business , the first model you might earn $100,000 but the principal owns the clients . With the second model , you could earn $240,000 from your own portfolio that belongs to you . <p> I have been an AR for twenty two years starting off with Brookvale Insurance Brokers ( onya Oly ) , then with Insurance Advisernet ( thank you Mr Carr ) and now with Westcourts ( thanks Jeff ) . Hardwork never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a General Insurance Adviser , then the AR Model is for you . Do n't wait for your career to stagnate or be up to your armpits in debt or school fees , do it early and gain the upper hand .

Having the support of your licencee and either Austbrokers or Steadfast takes the worry out of it . Make sure the " Systems " and the " Culture " is right for you . Margins by licencee vary greatly and so does the control over your book . Like they say , if it sounds too good to be true it probably is , but the AR model at Westcourts is best for me . <p> Well spoken Robert , and I agree totally .
