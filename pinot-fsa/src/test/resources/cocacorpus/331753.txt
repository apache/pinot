I 'm sure most of you will have heard of it . <p> Whilst this is- an awesome little plugin designed to make it simpler to create more elegant looking forms for your WordPress site , one small thing that has really bothered me is the lack of any ability to style- the " submit button " . <p> Now you would think a premium plugin of this kind would automatically have a simple setting for you to style the buttons , or even the forms itself , but it does n't  and you literally have to start messing around with CSS to create the desired- style and effects you want for your Gravity Forms . <p> I wo n't dive into the styling of the forms itself in this tutorial , I 'll perhaps write about that in another post . However , I do want to show you how to change the color and style of the " Submit " button inside your Gravity Forms . <p> Maybe its something you 've been trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier way , please do let me know . <p> The code I 'm using- below will affect the global styling of the Gravity Forms on your site ( all your forms ) , however , I will show you how to change the color of just a single " Submit " button for a form as well . <p> Let 's begin . <p> If you want to check out Gravity Forms , by the way , you can do so by clicking here . Do n't  worry I 'm not an affiliate for Gravity Forms . <p> OK so just to make you aware of the theme I 'm using right now , I 'm using a custom-built theme for Genesis . However , tt does n't  really matter what theme you 're using , just as long as you have access to the style.css file which you can usually find under Appearance &gt; Editor . <p> If the Gravity Forms plugin is conflicting with your theme for any reason , it might be best to consult the plugin creator or theme creator . <h> Step One : Create and add your form shortcode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saved it , just drop the shortcode for it into a static page of your choice . <p> In the image below you 'll see that I have dropped the " new client questionnaire form " shortcode that I created , into a static page on my site . <p> Click here if you want to view a useful video tutorial on how to create a form using Gravity Forms . <p> Once the form is embedded into your page , hit save and view your page . <p> As you can see with my form , whilst it looks reasonably clean style wise , the " Submit Form " button does n't  look so great . See image below . <p> Oh , before I continue with this tutorial , I want to just quickly show you the CSS and HTML5 settings I have for my forms . Here is a screen shot of it . <p> The reason why my forms look reasonably clean is because I 've selected " yes " for the Output CSS . If I selected " no " for Output CSS , the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points next to each line for some odd reason . <p> OK so let 's continue . <p> So to add style and to change the color of the " Submit Form " button in my client questionnaire form , all I would need to do is add some custom CSS code to my style.css- file inside the Editor for my theme . <p> So I would go to Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Stylesheet ( Theme stylesheet ) . Once again , I 'm using a custom Genesis theme so I would do this in my themes style.css file . <p> If you 're using something other than a Genesis theme , perhaps you 're using a Thrive theme . Thrive themes have a dedicated area where you can add custom CSS . Not the style.css file . <p> I highly recommend you backup any page in your theme before you start manipulating it in any case. - Simply copy the existing content and paste it into a notepad or something should you need to revert to it later . <h> Step Two : Adding The Code <p> Here is the code you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now as you can see from the image above , and compare it with the image at the start of this post , my " request quote " submit button now looks more matching to the rest of my site . <p> You might want to break up the code so it looks more like this below : <h> Additional Styling <p> If you want to change the height of the button , adjust the percentage values for both static and hover codes for height : 60px ; <p> If you want to change the width , do exactly the same as you did for the height . <p> If you want to nudge the- position of the button slightly , adjust the value inside margin-left : 12px ; <p> If you want to move the button from left to right , simply change the float : left ; to float : right ; <p> Now as I said at the beginning , this code will affect the global styling of all your gravity forms buttons . If you want to just make changes to a single form button on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top line of each code . <p> Replace everything on the top line of each code , before the input : with the following code : 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 <p> Hey Don , yeah sometimes I do that too . and it means I get to make the button look exactly how I want it . I 've done this on several posts where I 'm using custom buy it now buttons , it saves a lot of time and effort messing about with CSS . <p> This is very helpful , but it only works for the regular form submission button . The css class does n't  work for the " next " button when you split the form into multiple pages . I had to add the following : . gformwrapper . gformpagefooter . button.gformbutton , . gformwrapper . gformpagefooter . button.gformnextbutton <p> Quick update on this post . If you 're using a Thrive Themes theme , the code does NOT go into the Rise stylesheet ( style.css ) as I outlined in this post . This is an error on my part and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will just be overridden when the theme is updated . <p> Instead place the code inside the themes custom CSS box in theme options . I will update this post shortly to reflect this . Fabrizio. 
@@76508597 @5208597/ <h> First year of blogging : Goals <p> I focused very hard on writing massive value posts . I 'm talking about 2 , 3 , even 4,000-word blog posts like this one . <h> First year of blogging : Google and SEO <p> The mistake I made with my first blog was to focus too heavily on SEO , backlinks , keywords and all the rest of it . I paid far too much attention to Google and SEO , and not enough attention to content quality and building an audience . <p> My new focus was to simply write content that mattered . Content- that people would love and find incredibly useful and valuable . <h> Changes in the first year of blogging have been ? <p> I think the most notable change I 've made as a blogger has to be my posting frequency . <p> When I was running Magnet4Marketing , I was writing and publishing every single day . Sometimes I would write two posts per day . <p> Over the last 12 months , I 've only been writing a few posts per week , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Because once again , I- really wanted to focus on providing better quality and value , and the only way I could do that was if I had more time to spend crafting each post properly . <p> Also , - blogging is n't just about creating great content . Its about doing marketing and content promotion too . <p> Its about connecting with readers , responding to comments , engaging with your audience etc . I had to make more time to focus on those things too . <h> Redesign and rebranding transformations of the last 12 months <p> In the first 12 months of building this blogging business , I went on a mission , searching for the perfect custom design for my blog/website . <p> The screen shot above shows how Magnet4Blogging looked in the first few months of its life . <p> The theme I was using at the time was called the Outreach Pro theme by StudioPress , you may still be able to- find that theme here , actually . <p> In June 2014 , I decided to completely rebrand and redesign blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I continued to use the same Outreach Pro theme as before for , just with a few modifications of my own . <p> In January 2015 , - I decided to redesign the front page completely for Magnet4Blogging again , as shown above , only this time using a WordPress plugin I had just discovered for the first time called Thrive Content Builder . <p> In late May of 2015 , I made a few more tweaks to the homepage design , including creating a brand new logo for Magnet4Blogging . <p> At this stage , I was also discovering and learning about many new WordPress development and front-end design tools . <p> You might be thinking , goodness me , how many changes did you make to the design of your blog in the first year Fabrizio ? <p> The truth is , I was n't really happy until I found what I was looking for . <p> If you look at the front-page of Magnet4Blogging today ( Now being 2017 , when this post was revised ) , you 'll see that I 've tried to maintain the brand identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> First year of blogging : Traffic report from March 2014 to March 2015 <p> OK , so we finally get to the traffic stats for the year . <p> Once again I 'll remind you that I 'm sharing with you just the traffic for this blog . <p> From the start , traffic has been steadily increasing . <p> The traffic took a bit of a nose dive over the Christmas holidays as expected , but it slowly climbed back up again over the last three months as you will see in the screenshot below . <p> I did sweat a little bit when- Google Penguin update 3.0- was rolled out late last year I must admit . <p> I did n't  really know what to expect , especially having experienced first hand how an algorithm update can quickly change everything overnight . <p> But , as it turned out , traffic increased ever so slightly a few weeks after the update , I was happy about that . <p> OK , so here 's a quick overview of the traffic stats for the first 12 months . In brackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Total sessions : - 23,676 ( 9,118 in last 3 months ) Total users : 18,038 ( 7,075 in last 3 months ) Toal page views : 41,267 ( 16,435 in last 3 months ) Average time on site : 2:27 ( 2:34 in last 3- months ) Bounce rate for year : 72.44% ( 71.07% in last 3 months ) <p> Now let me share with you some of these numbers in greater detail . Check out the screen grab below . <p> As you can see above , overall traffic has been increasing very steadily . <p> You can see the dip I was talking about in late December and early January . <p> I also took a little while to get back into the swing of blogging just- after the festive period . My motivation for writing was a bit low . <p> If you look at the screenshot above , you can see that organic traffic dominated my top sources . Remember what I said , I do n't  pay a great deal- of attention to on-page or off-page SEO . <p> I rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't  been bad at all . It just goes to show you do n't  really need to do much to get your content ranked . As long as its epic , its valuable , its shareable and all the rest of it . <p> In the- above image , you will see- that Facebook was the 3rd biggest traffic provider to my blog . <h> Income Report March 2014 to March 2015 <p> OK so , finally , finally , finally Below is a list of the income streams that I 've been able to create through Magnet4Blogging . <p> Disclaimer : The following income report/list may contain affiliate links .

Im impressed most by your plans for the next quarter you 've inspired me to do a lot more . <p> Do n't  be so hung up about your expenses , weve all got them . I do n't  know how other bloggers present this information but ( as you may know ) the way you 've listed your investments is not how you calculate profit . This may seem a little technical ( depending on your accounting knowledge ) but when you buy a piece of hardware such as a laptop that you plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third of the cost to each year . <p> So your deductions for the last year should be nowhere near as high as you 've listed and you 're definitely in profit . <p> Hi Donald , ah thanks man that comment is really uplifting , I totally appreciate you , thank you .

When I started out with this blog , I felt determined and motivated without a doubt , but I also felt some sadness that I had to start over . Being back to square one with a new blog is a bit of a lonely feeling , but I 'm so glad I stuck it out because I got to meet and connect with so many lovely people , you 're one of them of course = <p> Yeah its a real challenge juggling different things with my little family , but I honestly can say Ive never felt so content with life . Thanks for the kind words and support Carol , I 'm still learning so much from everyone which is awesome = <p> No Thrive does n't  use a Framework like Genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a child theme like Genesis . <p> But I think if someone is going to hack into your site , then they 're going to do it regardless whether you have a child and parent theme or not . There are many things you can do to prevent that of course , but no theme is truly 100% safe from harm . <p> This report is over a year old now since then I 've gone back to Genesis , one of the many reasons being security , but moreover , I think Genesis child theme have a more professional finish to them .

Add something new to the subject matter , something that has n't  been talked about before . <h> #04 Write your content <p> As I said at the beginning of this post , writing cornerstone content articles takes time and a serious amount of effort . <p> Were talking about hours maybe even days or weeks depending on how much time you have to write . <p> Do n't  be in such a hurry to finish writing your cornerstone posts either , just so that you can get something out on your blog to promote . <p> If not then use something like NinjaOutreach- or LinkedIn to help you find and connect with top influencers . <p> Get them to answer a few questions to put into your cornerstone post . Maybe a few useful quotes , or how about doing a mini interview even ? <h> #07- Be resourceful with your external links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , not just to other content found on your own blog or blogs , but also to content on other authority sites and fellow blogs . <p> You 'll notice that Ive already mentioned several other articles outside of this blog . This is to add additional value to what you 're already learning about . <p> Pick sites that have a lot of weight in authority and credibility . For example , I tend to link out to sites like CopyBlogger , QuickSprout , Search Engine Land , Social Media Examiner and so forth . <p> As well as linking to top level authority blogs , I also like to link back to sites- maintained by bloggers that Ive connected with and have a- good online relationship with . Because more often than not , those blogs also offer a ton of value that not everyone gets to read about . <h> #08 Edit and proofread , again and again <p> Once you 've written your cornerstone content post , and you 're happy with the way it is structured and organized <p> Once you 're happy with all the additional value you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images and so forth <p> Once everything is done and dusted its time to start editing the raw stuff and polishing up your cornerstone article <p> Editing is refining your post , making it not just good , but super epic- for your readers to read , interact with , and take action upon . <p> This can take just as much time as- writing the post itself . <p> here 's a little tip which I 've probably mentioned a million times on this blog already : <p> Do n't  edit your post straight after you 've written it . <p> Take a break , take a long break actually . <p> Heck , why not even take a day or two ? Come back to it and start proofreading , I guarantee you 'll end up making more changes than you thought . <p> Read it again and again until you 're satisfied that your cornerstone article reads and sounds not only great- but convincing too ! <p> Then take another break Maybe sleep on it for one more night . Go back to it the next day and make your final edit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to proofread it out loud for you . Ask them to provide productive criticism . <p> Tip : If you 're too quick to get your post published without proofreading it properly , I guarantee you that you 'll lose sleep over it , trust me I know Often Ive published a post and gone back to it to edit it again because I was n't happy with it . <h> #09 Get your cornerstone content optimized for search ! <p> Once everything is in place and you 're 110% happy with your piece of cornerstone content , search engine optimize the post or page the best you can . <p> I use WordPress SEO by Yoast for this website- for my on-page SEO , but whatever SEO plugin or solution you use , make good use of it . <h> #10 Hit publish and promote <p> With your proofreading and final edits behind you . With your post- optimized for search engine visibility ( without overdoing it ) . - Only then should you hit the Publish button , or you might want to schedule your post . <p> Once your cornerstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can start the onslaught of promoting it to the masses . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Love this !

In this way your cornerstone post will take your readers to the most relevant other posts of your blog . So far I have n't written any such posts on my blog , but after reading your post here I got lot of motivation to write some cornerstone posts soon . Thanks buddy . <p> I see these comments are a bit dated , so I hope this comment reaches you . I have one big question about this that I can not wrap my head around . It has to do with cornerstone content and structure . Cornerstone content is so good , it reaches page 1 of Google because it is thorough and in-depth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader engaged ? Stop me if I am incorrect . <p> If your cornerstone piece gets hit after a Google inquiry , then great . But what if people visit your brand page directly ? Where do they start ? I have read that cornerstone content should be front and center , as in its the first thing new visitors read . So that would mean , this post here should be easily front and center for new visitors who have done a brand seach ? I guess that is what the sidebar is for ? This must be cornerstone content LONG ... Easily accessible via the sidebar at all times . <p> I am a real estate agent in the US . I 've had my site structure all wrong . But I am torn between cornerstone post or cornerstone page . Say people want to Buy a House . My cornerstone page should be a complete , 5,000 word Buyers guide , explain the process from start to finish . But how do they find this content ? Leave it on the sidebar within the blog , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Google crawl bots ? Getting started on structure is what I am missing . <p> I guess , the other option would be like what you have here . The main menu would say Buying , Selling , but would consist of my servicesmy expertise in these areas , a sales page for you to hire me ? All cornerstone content within the blog ? <p> Thank you for this great post . I 've searched and searched to see if cornerstone content should be a page or a post and you are the only one that has answered that directly . I know Yoast says he uses Pages for cornerstone content ( although when I right click on Yoast cornerstone page , and " Inspect " page , it says single-post , hmmm ) <p> Hey thanks for your comment and a very good one at that . Now this is something I 've actually thought about so many times myself . <p> When I started structuring cornerstone content , I was putting everything in a blog post . I thought it would be easier for folks to find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my posts , so three years down the line , someone might find my content and think " ahh this is well dated , forget it " . Even thought the content may have been valuable to them . <p> So quite some time back I removed the comments from my blog , it was my choice and I 've had much better reader engagement and time on site since doing so . I know this wo n't work for everyone and some folks have their own views with removing dates from posts . <p> What I do in addition to having some of my top cornerstone content featured in my sidebar , is also have them featured on the homepage . I also have a dedicated pages where I 've consolidated the cornerstone content for specific topics and subjects . <p> If you have pages dedicated to selling something i.e. sales pages , services pages , its also a good idea to have links to some of the related cornerstone content too , something solid to encourage buyers . I 've found this to work great . <p> Then there 's the argument that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how on earth do you make them all visible to folks landing on other pages , i.e. your about page , blog archive pages , testimonial pages etc . I mean there 's only so much you can stuff in the sidebar right ? <p> Interesting question and I guess there 's so many ways around it . <p> I would most definitely opt in to creating cornerstone content posts , and use static pages to bring together the collection of cornerstone content . Say you have 20 cornerstone articles on buying a home , like finding a property , organising a solicitor , exchanging contracts , etc . You can consolidate all of these cornerstone articles in a pillar page and add it somewhere visible on your site . 
@@76508601 @5208601/ <p> As some of you may know , I 'm a huge fan of the WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin . I have in fact been using the- Yoast plugin ever since I started my blogging venture- way back in 2010 . <p> I hate making changes and usually , I 'm pretty loyal to something , especially if its working for me. - This is to say that the <p> This is to say that the WordPress- SEO by Yoast plugin has been amazing over the years , and the improvements and updates just keep on getting better from Yoast . <p> All that being said , curiosity did get the better of me some years ago , and so I wanted to try out the SEOPressor plugin as well . <p> I had read a lot of great reviews about this plugin , and so I wanted to see for myself whether SEOPressor was actually worth paying money for since Yoast SEO was and still is free ( Even though there 's now also a premium version of Yoast SEO available ) . <p> I committed myself- to purchasing- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the day and my initial thought on price ? <p> Pretty steep for a single license plugin . At the time of purchasing , I thought the plugin would have been perfectly priced at around- $37 , that was just my opinion . <p> Anyhow , I 'm well aware that SEOPressor now offers a single subscription plan of $9 per month , which they are calling SEOPressor Connect . <p> When I initially purchased the SEOPressor 5 plugin back in 2012 , I had it- installed on my- now depleted- blog Magnet4Marketing . <p> A lot has changed for both of these two SEO plugins over the years , and in this comparison post , I 'm going to be looking at some of those changes and reveal what both plugins now have to offer in 2017 . <p> Let 's first dive into the SEOPressor Connect plugin . <h> The Main Features Of SEOPressor Connect <p> So like I said , SEOPressor Connect is now available on a single subscription plan priced at- $9 per month . <p> For that- you 're able to use the plugin on- multiple domains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely affordable and very competitively priced , at $108 per year . <p> Heres what you get : <p> #1 . More flexibility and super fast on-page options and SEO analysis SEOPressor Connect- now offers improved on-page analysis , taking into consideration common things like word count , content readability , keyword density , LSI and more . Much of these features can be found in both- the free and premium Yoast SEO plugin . <p> Much of these features , by the way , can be found in both- the free and premium versions of Yoast SEO plugin . <p> I love the suggestions on where and what to improve on in SEOPressor Connect . In addition , the plugin responds very quickly as you work with it , with little lag . <p> When you 're working on your content with this plugin , there- is no need to keep saving to see the changes , you- simply refresh the analysis tool itself , and if you 're happy with everything you can go ahead and save changes you 've made to the entire post itself . See image to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was particularly drawn to in SEOPressor , 5 back in the day , was the over-optimisation feature . This is still present in the new version I 'm happy to say . As we- know Google can penalize- a website if they believe it appears to have too many over-optimized pieces of content . I.e. posts and pages with stupidly high keyword density , excessive anchor text etc . So this little feature let 's you know when youve- over-optimized your page with a warning . <p> #3 . Multiple keyword analysis In comparison with Yoasts single focus keyword , this was another feature that caught my attention. - SEOPressor 5- allowed the user to optimize for multiple- keywords/phrases , giving them a better overall chance to rank for other keywords and phrases . This feature is still present in SEOPressor Connect . <p> You could probably try and do the same with the free version of the Yoast plugin by changing the focus keyword each time you 've optimized for it , however , that would really be quite time-consuming and a bit of a pain . <p> And yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin , you 're able to optimize for multiple keywords as well . <p> #4 . Insights and audit tools - You can get real SEO insights and tools to help you optimize for SEO sitewide . Includes features like SiteWide SEO audit , SEO score manager , and trends . <p> #5 . SemantiQ builder As the world moves more towards the Semantic web , helping you to improve search relevancy for your content- is becoming increasingly critical . SEOPressor has built-in tools to help you control how the internet sees your site , without you having to touch a single line of code . Pretty cool stuff right ? <p> #6 . Crawler manager and smart link manager This is a great improvement to this plugin , something I do n't  think the previous- versions of SEOPressor plugin had . You now have access to tools to help you to create XML sitemaps , control robot rule settings such as 301 redirection and canonical URL , customize Facebook OpenGraph and Twitter Card and more , all without needing additional plugins installed on your site . <p> The Link Manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to build and manage a flawless link structure for your website , again a critical step- towards helping you create- a more user-friendly website . You can easily identify broken links quickly so that you can fix them quickly . <p> #7 . LSI Keywords analysis and density check - An awesome feature that allows you to analyze other keywords or phrases closely related or linked to your target keywords . This is super useful for helping you create content that flows naturally and is readable by humans . And of course , create content that will rank for relevant and related- keywords that users might use to- find your content in search engines . <p> OK so I 've just looked at- some of the main key features in SEOPressor Connect , there 's simply way too many other features for me to list here folks . Youll have to go and check it out for yourself here . <h> Final thoughts on SEOPressor Connect <p> This new SEOPressor is a vast improvement on previous versions of the plugin , at least in my opinion . <p> I 've not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local SEO , you 'll no doubt discover for yourself that SEOPressor Connect has a lot of features to offer . <h> Main Features Of WordPress SEO By Yoast <p> OK peeps , so let 's take a look at some of the key features inside the all-amazing Yoast SEO plugin . <p> WordPress SEO by Yoast has been downloaded over 3- million times from the WP repository , and there are good reasons why . Its free and its feature packed ! <p> Yes there is a premium version of this plugin available too which I 'll talk about in just a moment , for now , here 's what the free version has to offer : <p> #1 . Powerful snippet editor - The snippet editor allows you to create the perfect and most compelling search engine search result listing possible . <p> As you make changes in the snippet area , you 'll instantly begin to notice your SEO score improving , based on how you incorporate your focus keyword into your content and snippet content . <p> The beauty with this is that you can see how your listing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more compelling to web searchers . <p> #2 . Focus keyword With the Yoast plugin you 're able to optimize for one main focus keyword or key-phrase only . Remember , though , this is a free plugin . <p> #3 . Detailed content analysis The content analysis feature allows you to easily check your content to see how well its optimized for various ranking factors against your focus keyword . <p> Changes happen- in real-time as well , so as you create your content around your focus keyword you 'll see more of those green blobs appearing . You do n't  have to keep saving the page to see the changes happen . <p> #4 . Advanced meta robots The Yoast plugin has built in advanced settings for meta robots and canonical URL , yes the free version has this ! <p> #5 . Social integration With built-in social optimization tools for Facebook OpenGraph , Twitter , and Google+ you can ensure your content makes the most impact across social media . <p> Once again , these are just some of the built-in core features you get with the free version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paid-for- SEOPressor Connect- plugin has a ton to offer in terms of tools , features , and usability , even the free version of Yoast SEO is pretty darn hard to beat . <p> With the premium version of Yoast SEO by the way , you get a host of additional features including a redirect manager , ability to optimize for multiple keywords and premium support . <p> So WordPress SEO by Yoast is the clear winner then ? <p> No , not exactly , keep reading . <h> Prices <p> The free version of Yoast SEO already has a ton of built-in features as I mentioned . <p> If you want a redirect feature , optimize for multiple keywords and premium support you 'll have to fork out $69 for the premium version . Plus if you want to continue receiving updates and support , you 'll have to keep paying that each year . <p> Moreover , the $69 you pay only gives you a license for 1 website/domain . If you want to use Yoast Premium on more sites you 'll have to purchase more licenses . This can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , has all the built-in features of the free and premium versions of Yoast SEO , and a few- more additional features , again way too many for me to list in this post . <p> The price you pay for SEOPressor is a one single monthly subscription fee of $9 , and that gives you a license to use SEOPressor on multiple domains/websites . <p> So , SEOPressor Connect is the clear winner then ? <p> Well , I 'll leave that for you to decide . However , its a pretty darn good deal for what you get for your money . <h> So which plugin would I personally use and recommend then ? <p> I use the free version of Yoast SEO for this website and SEOPressor Connect for my parenting niche website . Both of these plugins are serving me very well . <p> With Yoast , you have the option to use a free plugin or a premium plugin at $69 per year for a single license ( $5.75 per month ) . If you go premium it will cost you a bit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version to use , however for just $9 per month you can access all of the tools and features , and use SEOPressor on multiple domains . <p> From using both of these myself , I would go as far to say that Yoasts SEO plugin is an easier plugin to install and use . The SEOPressor plugin is a little more complex and takes a little bit of getting used to , especially getting around all the cool features . <p> So which would I personally recommend ? <p> Either one , in all honesty . I know this is probably no help to you , but both these plugins are exceptional in their own rights . <p> Though the SEOPressor Connect seems to be a little more attractive for all the newly added features , and the new one-plan monthly subscription fee of just $9 . <p> I hope you 've enjoyed reading this little comparison review post , I 've been as honest as I can be about both of these awesome SEO plugins . <p> If you 're using either of these yourself , do let me know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEO plugin ? Perhaps its something else entirely ! <p> If you cant leave me a comment below , feel free to tell me your experiences with this post and with the SEO plugin of your choice on my Facebook page here . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Great post Fabrizio . I also have SEO Pressor and have seen a growing organic rise of targeted visitors . Do you have any experience with the Yoast Video SEO plugin ? I 'm a musician and singer and wish to optimise my music videos in Google as well as get rankings for my offline business sponsors who back my shows . <p> Hi , I 've heard cases where some people are using both plugins perfectly fine . I used to use SEOPressor alongside with Yoast plugin on a personal blog , it worked fine because I could take the on-page capabilities and score factors of SEOPressor and still benefit from the site wide options in Yoasts plugin . So yeah I do n't  see why not . Your best bet to be sure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nice post . Thanks . What do you think of the " content OK/not OK " which has just been added to Yoast SEO ? Its trying to give you tips as to how to write a blog post . I 'm not overly fond of that , but I just wanted to know what you think . <p> Hi Yann , thanks for your comment . Yeah Ive seen this on the latest update of the plugin . <p> From initial thoughts , its more work and more time involved in making content great , or OK in this case . Whilst I was doing a content audit for my blog recently , I came across several posts that were ranking well in Google , but the content and SEO score Yoast was giving me was very poor , like in the red poor . So its a little bit confusing when you have content ranking well , but the scores does n't  measure up . <p> I think this new feature will certainly help content creators hone in on making their content better , as in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in my mind .

@@76508606 @5208606/ <p> A while ago I shared with you some tips and ideas for growing your Facebook audience . If you missed that post you can read it here . <p> One of the strategies I shared with you in that very post was something that a lot of bloggers are doing more of right now , and thats- paying for likes , or more appropriately , running Facebook ad campaigns to build their targeted fanbase . <p> From my own personal experience , this has been one of the most effective ways to grow my Facebook page audience . I 've tried many other tactics and Facebook ads can be very effective when done correctly . <p> I 'll repeat that . When done correctly . <p> Since starting to run a few small ad campaigns to grow my companys Facebook page audience , I 've also seen a notable- increase in- engagement , comments , likes , and shares , - which is all good news right ? <p> Anyway , in this post , I want to share with- you what I 've been doing to optimize my Facebook ad campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Per Click , or Cost Per Page Like ) . <p> Higher CTR ( Click Through Rate ) . <p> Hopefully , you 'll be able to take something away from my efforts and results , and apply it to your own strategy , so let 's get to it ! <p> Disclaimer : - Achieving low CPC depends on several factors , some of these factors may include the niche or industry you 're in , or the type of audience you 're trying to target with your ads . I also depends on how targeted your ads actually are , which I 'll cover in more detail later on in this post . We 'd all love to achieve- 1 penny CPC , but whether that 's possible or not , I 'm pretty sure that a lot of ground work , testing and experimenting is required beforehand. - Regardless , with a little optimization , testing and tweaking here and there , I 'm confident that you 'll be able to lower your CPC a little bit more when running your Facebook ad campaigns . <p> When I started using Facebook ads last- year ( 2014 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20p per click , I did n't  really know any better , to be honest . Today I 'm able to achieve anything between 0.02 and 0.05 pence per click , so here 's how I 'm able to achieve this . <h> How To Optimize Your Facebook Ad Campaigns For Optimum Results <h> #1 . Text and images <p> The text and image you use for your ad will obviously determine the success of your campaign . Do n't  just settle for some poor quality , mediocre looking stock photography image , and description . <p> Combine your powerful marketing message with a relevant image that describes what your business is truly about , and one that demands to be clicked on . <p> I would also recommend doing some additional editing of your photos and graphics before adding them to your creatives . Add some- interesting elements to capture audience interest . Use a really nice filter and make the image stand out and so forth . <p> I like to take my own photos for my ad campaigns . If you 're handy with a digital camera , try doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you add a personal touch to your ads . <p> As for your marketing message , think clarity . Make people understand what your ad is about without confusing them with too much text . <p> I love to use questions in my campaigns . Questions get people thinking about their situation and how clicking on my ad might help them solve a problem they might have . <h> #2 . Targeting audience <p> Next , let 's think about targeting and demographics . <p> In the very beginning when I started using Facebook ads , I 'd target a broad audience without question . <p> However , after experimenting with different demographics and interests , and really understanding where my target audience was on Facebook , I found that my target audience- laid directly- in between broad and specific . <p> here 's the audience definition that I use for my Facebook ads today : <p> Demographics : - For my ads , Ive- selected English speaking language ( UK and US ) , people living in the UK and USA and of the ages of 25 to 54 . <p> Interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and creative marketing and online business . I could probably add a few more terms to be even more specific , however , I 'm continuing to test with other- relevant terms- using different ad creatives , to see how much more targeted I can make my ads . <p> Tip : - Take the time to refine- your targeting audience- the best you can , think about customer base and readership . Select as many terms related to your niche or business as you possibly can , to target a specific audience for your fan page . The more targeted the better . <p> Additionally , do n't  just create one campaign and be done with it . Create several of them , make each one focused on different demographics and interests to find which works best for you . Its not an overnight process I know , but a little groundwork now will go a long way for future ads. <h> #3 . Budgeting and finding the best days to run ads <p> I do n't  run my ads continuously anymore , though I did do in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , time of day etc was best to run my campaigns . <p> During my early experiments I found that my ads performed better on Wednesdays and Thursdays , where I was able to achieve 0.02 -0.05 pence per page like and around 18% CTR , whilst on the weekends they did n't  perform so well with 0.09 0.12 pence per page like and just 7% CTR , this is still the case today . <p> I would recommend that you- do n't  slap a massive budget on your ad campaigns , to begin with . <p> When experimenting or doing A/B testing , start small and increase your budget over time as you begin to perfect your ads . <p> I started off with just a few dollars per week , when I figured out which days were best for my ads , I increased my budget to $5 and then $10 . <p> I also keep a calendar handy above my desk specifically for scheduling my Facebook ad campaigns and keeping track of my budget and performance , I 'd highly recommend you do the same too . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my social media planner , check out my blog planner workbook here . <h> Facebook Advertising Tools <p> There are a number of other advertising tools you can use . Instead of me just listing them all here , check out the following useful article on Amanda Webbs website RazorSocial . <h> Organic Likes <p> One great thing about paying for Facebook likes to grow your fan base , and its something I 've personally noticed on my page , and that is- using Facebook Ads more frequently promotes growth organically . <p> I notice when I stop my ads for a few days , the number of fans to my pages still continues to increase organically , and then gradually slows down . <h> Wrapping things up <p> You do n't  need to be a social media specialist or expert- to run successful , low CPC , high-converting ad campaigns on Facebook to increase likes ! <p> You do n't  need to throw your entire lifes savings to fund your campaigns either . All you need to do is learn , experiment and analyze to see what works best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared with you what is working for me in this post , and yes I 'm well aware that what works for one person , does n't  mean that it will work for someone else . Nevertheless , hopefully , you 've been able to take something valuable away from reading this post . <p> Take your time refining your campaigns , I ca n't stress enough on this importance , and when you achieve a satisfactory CPC and are getting more targeted likes to your Facebook page , and you 're starting to see increased activity on your Facebook page , the rest will be plain sailing Well almost <p> The best of luck . <p> Post Views : 4,112 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 
@@76508607 @5208607/ <h> Thrive Themes vs Genesis Theme Framework : Which One Should You Use ? <p> If you 're a frequent visitor or reader of Magnet4Blogging , and you know me well enough too , you 're probably aware that over the years Ive gone from using Genesis theme framework to Thrive themes , and recently back to Genesis again . <p> I 've had ample of hands-on experience with using both of these companys themes and plugins , which is why I 'm writing this detailed comparison review of Genesis theme framework and Thrive themes . <p> I already wrote in-depth reviews of both of these themes in the past , so what I 'll be doing in this comparison review is comparing the following things : <p> Qualities <p> Customization ability <p> Notable features <p> Installation <p> Price and affordability <p> Now let 's dive straight in . <h> Genesis Theme Framework <p> I want to start with who I consider being the undisputed King of premium WordPress theme creators , StudioPress , the creators of Genesis Theme Framework and a whole bunch of amazing child themes- to go . <p> Any website owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a framework to work with . It truly makes building websites with WordPress an absolute joy . <p> As a WordPress web designer and developer myself , I 've thoroughly enjoyed working on many client projects using Genesis . <p> The first theme I ever installed into a hosted WordPress site was the Freelance Child Theme . <p> StudioPress , again who are the creators of the Genesis theme framework software and Genesis child themes , have put in a lot of time , money and research into developing what is considered the industry standard ' in premium WordPress themes . <h> Qualities <p> Genesis boasts the following qualities : <p> Rock solid security . <p> Blazing fast performance . <p> Out-of-the-box SEO tools and options . <p> Mobile responsive designs . <p> Ultra flexible foundation code . <p> I mentioned child themes for Genesis , well the StudioPress marketplace boasts a large library of these premium child themes . Each child theme looks sleek and professional just as they are , without additional customization . <h> Customization <p> So from my experience with using Genesis over the years , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new users . Especially for those with no knowledge or experience with basic HTML and CSS . <p> That being said , you do n't  need to be a developer to use a Genesis theme on your website , and once you start playing around with a little bit of CSS , you 'll soon discover that modifying a Genesis child theme is n't actually that difficult to do . <p> In any case , StudioPress offer a dedicated plugin that allows you to customize child themes very easily called Genesis Design Palette Pro . This is a premium plugin which gives you complete control over the aesthetics of your website . But it comes at an additional cost being a premium tool . <p> That being said , things like adding a custom header logo and site icon is very simple to do , amongst other basic customization . <p> If you wanted to take customization a step further , such as make changes to typography , background colors , link colors , adjust paddings and margins youd have to either start hacking into the style.css file for the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro plugin mentioned above . <p> Adjusting footer credits also means you have to install an additional plugin ( Genesis Simple Edits ) if you do n't  know how to do it manually from inside your theme . <h> Other notable features of the Genesis software <p> Genesis is built on lightweight coding , and you immediately notice that when you download the software after purchase . It is such a small file compared to a lot of other premium themes out there . <p> The file size for most of the child themes is also relatively small . So faster page loading is a definite notable feature for any WordPress site that uses Genesis . <p> Lightweight code and blazing fast loading times are one of the reasons why I decided to switch back from Thrive to Genesis . <p> Other features include : <p> Custom widgets . <p> Plenty of theme layout options . <p> Comment functionality . <p> Ready for advertising and monetizing your blog . <p> Auto-sized featured images . <p> WordPress and theme tutorials . <h> Installation <p> Installing Genesis parent and a child theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if you do happen to take the Genesis route , I 've created a useful installation video you can check out here- on my YouTube Channel . <p> The video is quite old now , but the installation process has not changed at all . <h> Cost <p> Now we get down to the cost of the Genesis Software . <p> Genesis theme framework alone ( the parent theme ) will set you back a cool $59 . It has been that price for as long as I can remember . <p> You also have the option to purchase a theme package , ( Genesis parent + 1 Child theme ) , which varies in price from $99.95 upwards . <p> Or you can purchase the Pro-Plus theme package ( Genesis and all available child themes and future child themes ) for- $499.95 . <p> The one thing I love the most about Genesis is that you get unlimited everything ( updates and support ) for what you pay . <p> There are no options to purchase a developer license , or no annual fee even . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your own or your clients . <p> Many other theme creators will have you pay for a separate developer license , not StudioPress however . <h> Conclusion <p> If you 're looking for an extremely robust , lightweight , flexible and affordable theme , Genesis is definitely one option to take . <p> StudioPress currently has over 50+ child themes available to choose from , so you 're bound to find the perfect one for your business . <h> Customization <p> Customizing a Thrive theme is a lot less challenging than customizing a Genesis child theme , that I will say . <p> This is because each Thrive Theme comes with tons of customization options , in addition , you also get a custom CSS box which you can add your own CSS rules to override the themes default CSS . <p> Things like adding a custom logo , uploading a custom Favicon , changing footer credits , adding custom menus , changing typography styles , changing font sizes and color , background colors can all be done easily using the built-in style and layout settings , and without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Installation <p> Installing a Thrive theme is very easy to do , just like you would install any other bulk-standard WordPress theme . <h> Cost <p> Unlike Genesis , where you have to pay for a parent theme and then a child theme , with Thrive Themes you can either purchase a single site license at $49 per theme , or an unlimited personal site license at $67 per theme . <p> Genesis might seem like the slightly better value to go for as there is n't an annual membership fee to burden you . <p> You pay one fee and you get unlimited everything forever . Plus access to all future theme releases . In addition , you can use the themes you purchase not just on your own sites , but also your clients sites . For you web designers and developers out there , this is awesome news , right ? <p> With Thrive Themes , although you pay a $228.00 or a hefty $588.00 annual membership ( even more if you decide to go for pay monthly option , $300 per year and $708 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your buck . Themes plus award winning plugins . <h> Theme Choice Comparison <p> Genesis Theme Framework : 50+ current available themes and growing.Thrive Themes : 10 current available themes and growing . <h> Ease Of Use And Theme Management Comparison <p> Genesis Theme Framework : Simple to install and manage . In-depth customization can be a little challenging even thought Genesis comes with a lot of widget options and theme layout options . Also , a little knowledge of HTML and CSS will help you get the most from your Genesis theme , but absolutely not essential . <p> Thrive Themes : Very simple to install and manage . Simple layout options for site customization , without needing to install additional plugins . <h> Conclusion <p> To be fair , both Thrive Themes and StudioPress ( Genesis ) have a variety of unique things to offer . <p> StudioPress have been on the market for much longer than Thrive , where over 200,000+ website and small business owners trust and run on Genesis . <p> Thrive are still relatively young with around 12,000 members , but they 're growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preference and what you really want to achieve with your blog , website or online business . If its conversions you 're after then go for Thrive , you get a lot more than just themes . <p> If you 're looking for a more refined professional look and feel to your website , then go with Genesis and a child theme of your choice . <p> I hope this comparison review has been helpful to you , I 'll leave you to decide which is best for you . <p> Post Views : 3,815 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 <p> Thanks for visiting . Your comment is very useful and its great to get different perspectives on either Genesis or Thrive , or indeed as you 've shared something else entirely . <p> I 've not heard of Marketers Delight before so will be sure to check it out . <p> When I started using Thrive Themes some years back I loved them , and I still do for the most part . But I switched back to a Genesis theme ( Digital Pro ) with some of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some elements inside of the Thrive custom builder looks a little bit dated . <p> Some of Thrive ready-made themes looks a little dated too I might add . <p> I 'm not a code snob , but I do like to have more control over the development of my website and my clients websites too , and Genesis fits the bill for this well . <p> Thrive themes on the other hand is simple to hack into as far as styling goes , but I feel there 's some limitations there .

I hear you say ! <p> Yes of course , absolutely ! - <p> Regardless of whether you blog for the fun of it or you blog for business , you 've got to enjoy it- for it to be rewarding in some way . Otherwise what is the point in it ? You might as well start up knitting or something crazy like that . <p> If you 're blogging to generate income , part-time or full-time , think of it as job satisfaction . <p> I stopped blogging entirely for a few weeks , because all I was doing was- procrastinating- like a bad ass . <p> So what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Ill share with you my- list shortly , before that I 'd like to share with you- some of the things that I think can take the fun out of blogging of anyone , just so that you can be aware of some of the signs in the future . <p> These are just some of the things that can take the fun out of blogging for you , and I 'm sure there are many more that Ive missed out . <p> So now let me share with you what I did to make blogging fun again for myself , after taking a well deserved break : <h> 10 Ways To Make- Blogging Fun Again How I did it <p> #01 . Become better organised- In life as in business- our circumstances can change , and we can easily become less- organised as we take more on . <p> I 'd be lying if I said that I did n't  take all the free time that I used to have- for granted , before my children came into this world , because I did . <p> So whilst family always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot better , separating life , work and blogging . <p> I 've learned to utilise my blogging time and prioritise my- tasks much better too . I now dedicate 5- to 6- hours each day , four- times per week to working on my blog and business . I- have nothing else interrupt me during that time , not even clients . <p> #02 . Set myself realistic goals- Its important to set goals in blogging . Setting small goals and making a conscious effort to reach those goals is like taking small steps to your ultimate goal in blogging , which is to find success for many , or get to a point you want to be in blogging . <p> I set myself 1 small blogging goal each week , with one goal I can achieve so much over a period of time , instead of trying to multitask 5 or 6 big goals and achieving none of them . <p> Also , having something to aim for makes the whole blogging experience- much more fun . <p> If I set myself 52 small goals each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right direction to reaching my long term goal in blogging . <p> #03 . Invest in new tools Investing in your blog financially really helps to boost your motivation and can make blogging fun again , take my word for it . I 've invested in a lot of new tools over the last few months that I 'm excited to try out . <p> You do n't  have to go out and spend a lot of money either if you do n't  have it , perhaps a new WordPress theme or a new plugin to enhance your blog and user experience . <p> Or , a new piece of hardware or software to enhance your blogging experience . <p> This investment has- certainly helped me to become more productive online , and has also given me the freedom- to manage- my blogs on the go too , - since these days I spend far more time away from the desk . <p> #04 . Learn new things- Blogging is n't just about dishing out advice and information to others , its also about taking a little bit of your own advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn new things yourself- along the way , not just to better yourself and your skill set , but also to- help you provide better information to your audience . <p> What I like to do when I 'm not writing is to read a lot of Amazon Kindle books and eBooks . I like to read and learn- anything that can help me improve my blog and my blogging , and help me serve my readers better . <p> I also love taking on new Udemy Courses , and currently I 'm having a lot of fun learning how to use Xcode and coding using Swift . <p> #05 . Reach out to other bloggers and readers Blogging can be a lonely old pastime- at best of times , especially when you 're just starting out and no one really knows who you are . <p> Sure you 're building an audience and engaging with the few of them- on your blog and social networking sites , - but sometimes it pays to reach out to one or two of your new or regular readers . <p> Or to reach out to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building relationships online is so important in blogging , and can help put a lot of fun back into doing it . <p> #06 . Stick to a posting frequency I like to write two or three blog posts per month , and I usually stick to that frequency I 've said that numerous times before I know . <p> Sticking to a regular blogging frequency- can make blogging a lot more fun , as you 're almost always looking forward in- writing your- next post , especially if your last post was well received by your readers , and attracted a lot of comments and social shares . <p> Blogging on a daily basis ? Well from my own experiences Ive found that blogging daily can become more of a chore than a fun activity . Especially if you 're struggling to find new things to write about each day , its really not a great tactic unless you have others writing for you each day . <p> The benefit of writing a few good power posts each month- is that you can promote them properly because as you know , blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating content . <p> #07 . Simplify my content writing strategy and style Its so easy to over procrastinate over your content writing and style , you can literally edit your post a million times and still feel as if it does n't  sound or read quite right . <p> You can spend too much time dwelling on whether others might think your post stinks or not , and that can take the fun right out of blogging altogether . <p> I 've learned to simplify my blog writing and develop a style of my own , and not to overcomplicate things too much either. - The best way to do that Ive found is to just write the way you would talk to someone normally . <p> #08 . Escape the office or desk from time to time Four walls , a desk and a computer is great , but its not a life . Blogging in the same environment- can get pretty boring at the best of times , well it did for me- anyway . <p> There is nothing inspirational about staring- into a blank wall space behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why I recently invested in that Macbook Air . I can- take my trusty little Macbook it to my local coffee shop with WiFi ( as you do ) , and sit to write my posts in a new and fresh environment , which really helps me to get creative . <p> Of course you do n't  have to have a Macbook to get out of the house or the office , any old laptop or portable computer will do really , as long as it has long battery life . I seriously recommend taking your blog mobile from time to time , its a lot of fun . <p> #09 . Write for the benefit of my readers , not for the search engines ( at least not that much ) I 'm not against writing for the search engines , after all search engine traffic is critical- if you want your blog to grow and new readers to find you and your amazing content right ? <p> Eventually however it becomes more about writing for your readers and less for the search engines , and that to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people that come to your blog with a problem , looking for for a specific type of content , that 's a great feeling , to write blog content that resonates with your audience . <p> #10 . Create content that I- love to share Whilst I 'm a strong believe that you should write for your readers , I also believe that from time to time , you should create content- that you enjoy creating and want to write about . You should share something that makes you love to blog . <p> PS . On a final note , I 'd like to recommend an inspirational book which I read some time ago called 31 Days To Find Your Blogging Mojo- by Bryan Allain , its an amazing little book and well worth the read if you ever get the chance and the time. - You can find this book here on Amazon . <p> Post Views : 669 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Simplify !

You can find the list of books that Ive read and recommend- here and here . <p> Health <p> As much as I did n't  want this to happen , my health also took a hit at the start of 2016 . <p> A visit to the doctor , because I was constantly feeling tired , drained and sometimes i 'll , resulted in me having to make- some serious lifestyle changes . <p> So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , but also with my health and lifestyle too . <h> What has changed ? <p> 25-Hour work week solid ! <p> 5- hours each day and no more than that , is what I 've been spending working online on average . <p> This will continue because I am at my most productive when I spend less time working at my computer . <p> Youd be surprised how much I can fit into those 5 small hours , everything from taking Skype calls with clients , doing social media , marketing , web design projects to blog writing . <p> I do take a 30- minute break with 2 hours or so of work each side of that though . <p> Also my health , the kids school runs and family commitments- has to fit in with my work , so the 5-hours work perfect . <p> Posting frequency <p> At the start of the year ( 2016 ) - I was writing a post each week , sometimes two posts . <p> That frequency has reduced over time- and- Im now averaging 1 to 2 posts per month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its been working- fine for me , plus I simply could n't find the time to write more posts than that . <p> The reduction in number of posts being published , has n't  affected my traffic numbers in anyway whatsoever either . <p> If anything , traffic has been steadily increasing , but more on this later . <p> Working on myself <p> Sometimes when were so busy working on our blogs and businesses , we forget about working on ourselves . <p> I 've realised that if I wanted to continue doing this whole blogging and online thing , I needed to take time to work on myself . <p> Like I said , I 'm doing a lot of reading and learning new things these days . <p> Diet and exercise <p> Boy how much did I underestimate the importance of this ? <p> I tell you , if you run a blog or an online business from home , where you 're sat down for long hours each day , and you 're not doing any exercise or watching what you eat , you could be heading- for trouble . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago , was simply because I was overdoing it , and I did n't  realise I was doing it either . <p> I would sit on the computer until 2 or 3 in the morning working online . <p> During the day I had to be there for my family and kids , but eventually this caught up on me and I became exhausted . <p> I was trying to fit everything in , trying to balance blogging and my business , family life , all whilst not really taking care of myself . <p> Anyhow I 'm pleased to say that about 5 months ago , I decided to take evasive action after taking a break . <p> I joined the gym back at the start of the summer , which I 'm still loving very much . <p> I also run a mild 20k each week over three running sessions . <p> I invested in an Apple Watch to help me track my activities , and of course to help keep me motivated throughout the day with important notifications . <p> Anyhow Ive been feeling epic as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more focused . <p> I would absolutely recommend anyone working from home to take a step back and analyse their health and lifestyle . <h> Milestones reached <p> I reached one of my ultimate blogging goals a few months back . One of my goals has always been to try and- earn more than $1,000 a month , just from passive income , and I did it ! <p> In July I earned $1,114.91 from affiliate marketing , which was truly awesome . <p> I also reached 1,000 email subscribers to this blog last month as well . <p> Ive been averaging between 60 and 70 new subs each month , so I 'm really thrilled- with that . <p> If you recently subscribed to my blog by the way , I really appreciate you ! I hope you 're loving the content so far. - Please do feel free to send me an email and tell me what you 're up to with your blog or online business . <p> Also let me know how I can help you- reach your goals , or perhaps overcome a particular problem that you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that have happened <p> First and foremost , the best thing to have happened in the last 12 months is that my girlfriend and I got married ! <p> It was truly a magical day and one well bother remember forever . <p> I also got mentioned in the Huffington Post twice . Thanks to two unique opportunities to participate in a couple of awesome expert roundup posts . <h> Blog income report ( Full income breakdown ) <p> Right , so now let 's dive into the income I was able to generate through Magnet4Blogging in the last 12 months . <p> Once again , the income marked in brackets is the previous years income to compare with .

A full breakdown of the income and expenses for my blog Magnet4Blogging of the last 12 months . <p> Again , whilst this might not be- the most impressive thing you 'll see as far as income and traffic reports go , for me its a step in the right direction . <p> I do n't  invest a huge- amount- of time with Magnet4Blogging . I work 2- to 3- hours each day maximum with this business. - The rest of the time , I 'm either focused on my other business in art , or building some niche websites , which is a bit of a hobby of mine at the moment . <p> The site practically paid for itself as far as web hosting goes . I paid $180 for the Grow Big plan on SiteGround , and earned $191.50 in affiliate commissions . Not bad going I think . <p> Overall I 'm happy with the results of the last 12 months , but I know I could potentially make this business more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have some new goals and exciting new ideas in store , which I 'll share with you shortly . <p> I do n't  include things like " make more money " or " increase blog traffic " to my list of goals , because essentially those are " results " of achieving some of my goals . <p> Heres what I plan to do before January 2017 arrives . <p> Redesign landing pages for my web design services . <p> Add a new feature to capture client testimonials to the website . <p> Fine tune my marketing message on the homepage . <h> Thank you list <p> So I want to finish off this mammoth yearly review post by thanking the following peeps in my community and of course the blogging world. - Just a few of you as I know there 's many more of you I owe thank yous too . <p> Thanks for all your continued support , opportunities , frequent visits , comments and emails as always , I appreciate you . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 <p> Thanks so much , yes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results so far , so thank you .

I applaud the way you treat your blog so meticulously like a business b/c really , a lot of my coaching clients struggle b/c they do n't  do that . <p> Im excited to see your upcoming " first product " that 's my specialty and I love working with people on doing that , partly b/c its such an exciting journey for them . <p> Feel well , stick to 25 hours and I 'd love to hear how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're an incredible blogger , and person . Im blessed to know you and be a tiny part of what you do . <p> I 'm so pleased to hear that you 're working with your partner to help you get through , and that its helping . Health issues suck does n't  it ? <p> I cant spend too long looking at a computer , Doctors orders . Though I do wear glasses now which helps , but still get very tired quickly . <p> The burnout I suffered was intense . Just felt so drained and demotivated . The break I took was very much needed to help me get back on track and focus on me . <p> Yes Samantha and I are excited about hopefully working together in the future to grow the little business that I have with Magnet4Blogging . Lots of ideas exchanging across the table . Fingers crossed the plans fall into place in 2017 ha ha . <p> Thanks for your kind words about me and my blog and business . Thanks for your awesome continued support Donna , its great to be connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working and inspiring people like you . <p> I sure will be sticking to 25 hours per week , I 'm always looking for ways to optimise my work and play time . <p> Hi Fabrizio , What a review of the year ! I am sure you had a journey worth it ! <p> I respect and love your decision about staying with the family and yet doing enough work to help them live an awesome life . So happy you 're married to your dream girl . You both look gorgeous together and I wish you both an awesome journey ahead ! &lt;3 <p> On the personal front , kudos for taking a decision in improving your personal self . Something that is long time dweller in my to-do list . <p> Professionally , you 're doing really well . I am so happy that conversions are great and you prove that we do n't need to have millions of visits to earn a standard income , just the right visits . Haha the Thrive themes comparison post has gotten you some nice conversions , I am saying because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a similar article for my client , who is also ranking in the top 3 for the same keyword and am wondering he must be making some pretty awesome sales too ! = <p> Congrats on the awesome journey , glad I could be a small part of it . Wishing you a fabulous third year and yes loved your new design = <p> Yeah I love spending time with my family , its one of the reasons why I love working from home and being my own boss so much . <p> I 'm constantly working on myself . I love learning new things for the first time , I think the ability to learn something is amazing , education is amazing if its something you enjoy lol . <p> Thanks for your complements about my income , yes I 've always been one after conversions rather than trying to boost traffic . <p> I think too many bloggers and marketers focus too much on trying to boost traffic , though its critical for a business to succeed , but if you have targeted folks then conversions should be reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , yeah its really pulling in some sales . But its just one of the posts that contributes to be honest . I 've reviewed every Thrive product there is , including creating tutorial videos for each of them on YouTube . I think the whole combination of this has helped to boost my Thrive aff sales . <p> Now I just need to do the same with the other products I 'm using and recommending lol . <p> Thanks for being part of my journey Swadhin , I really appreciate your support . <p> As you probably already know I do n't  have a lot of time either . I still work full time and my drive to work is at least one hour going and leaving . <p> That struggle between business and non business is no joke LOL . <p> A lot of us tend to forget some of those important non-business things in our life . One thing is our health . I 've had health issues in the past , which is basically from lack of enough sleep and sitting down at work . <p> Although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of injuries and get sick at the most twice a year . So something had to change . <p> You 're results are great being that you work part-time . When you work smart and find a rhythm then you tend to get improve a lot . This is what working smart does . <p> I 'm very sure that this post will be a great inspiration to a lot of other bloggers who are struggling and going through some challenges in their daily personal lives . <p> I 'm glad that you shared this with us and I look forward to your upcoming changes with your blog . I 'm always looking for some ideas ! <p> Hey man thanks for visiting , and your continued support , and always finding time to leave a great comment on my blog . I appreciate you a lot . <p> Time is a funny thing right ? We cant see the darn thing , feel it , see it , smell it yet its the most valuable thing in all our lives . <p> Every single one of us . <p> I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . And having a full time job whilst trying to build a business as well . <p> When I started in 2006 with my art business , I was working 9 to 5 in an office , commuting for 12 hours a week , then going home to work on my business until the middle of the night . <p> It drained me so bad that I ended up losing patches of my hair , and being constantly i 'll at the age of 26 lol . <p> Keep going mate , but never sacrifice your health or valuable time with loved ones for nothing . <p> I love the gym now , it feels good to have run a few miles first thing in the morning or late evening . I do n't  feel so guilty when I 'm sitting down for 5 hours a day working lol . <p> Thanks for your words of encouragement Sherman . Some new changes will certainly come and I 'm excited about them , and I know some new challenges await too . But I cant wait to share them here in the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read this wonderful report . I appreciate your relentless hard work to reach this level . Great journey indeed . Amazing growth , keep going my friend . Thanks for mentioning our joint effort of ours on Huffington post . You forgot to mention the first HP post of LONG ... Nice to be part of your activities . Thanks for the kind mentions . Will be making a note of this in our Bloggers who honored Philipscom page . Keep going . Keep in touch . All good wishes for a wonderful future . Have a blessed weekend Phil <p> I remember first connecting with you sometime last summer I think it was , and since then we 've had so many conversations about every single business , marketing , blogging , entrepreneurship related topic I can think of lol <p> But I 'm also glad you made the decision to start fresh , because you 're absolutely knocking it out of the part with yourchicgeek.com <p> I 'm so glad that I started over a few years ago with this blog , and I think that if anyone can hold their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , this is n't working , I need to go back to the drawing board " <p> That takes dedication , passion , ambition and the will to not give up and be defeated .

Nothing works until you understand your audience . Well . Meaning , listen to them . Ask questions . Listen for answers . Assess which posts do well on social media , with comments , with overall engagement . Easy way to increase your profits but most blogger put little thought into the process . Why ? <p> They are desperate to make money so they repel money-making ideas . Which is why I am huge on doing the mental work . The inner game of blogging . My blog , eBooks and courses stress how money really flows from within . Your income is a subconscious conviction , ultimately . Fab post Fab = Have a great weekend ! <p> Thanks for checking out this post . And yes , you nailed it with reinforcing the " understanding your audience part " . If anyone knows more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of us who started out was caught in that mind-set of being desperate to make money . I hold my hands up and say yep , I was looking for the easy route . <p> Did n't  exist lol . But <p> When I started out in 2010 with this whole blogging thing , I remember seeing a lot of hype about how those celebrity bloggers were making huge income and living the dream lifestyle . Whilst almost none of them would actually share how they were making their money . <p> New bloggers would get caught up in that hype and their eyes would light up like a rabbit it headlights , and often forgetting the critical piece of advice they got about " knowing their audience first " , building connections and nurturing relationships online . <p> All of these types of posts work very well . But as Ryan said , the first two steps makes a big of a difference . If you do n't  know who you audience is and what they deem valuable , then you 'll definitely be running in circles like many bloggers. 
@@76508611 @5208611/ <h> Disqus vs WordPress Comment System : Which Is Best ? <p> ( Update : 5th March 2017 I decided that after three years of using Disqus on this site that I would disable it . My reason is not because Disqus is bad in any way , but because one of my goals in 2017 is to use as fewer plugins on this site as possible ) . <p> Many moons- ago I made the decision to get rid of the native WordPress comment system on this blog . <p> I now run two- blogs that- use Disqus comments for engagement and interaction , and if you 're thinking about making the switch for your blog too , let me share with you some of the pros and cons- of using either of the two commenting platforms . <p> Now I am well aware of the downfalls of using a third party commenting system plugin in WordPress , yes Disqus may be more difficult for some users to get used to , yes page loading time might increase ever , ever , ever so slightly , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Increased engagement <p> One of the things- that I immediately noticed within- a few weeks of installing and using Disqus on this blog , was the level and depth of engagement received . <p> As you know- engagement is critical- for any blog to thrive and grow , and I 've had nothing but positive engagement since making the switch , I do n't  just say that to be biassed at all , because I did have some doubts . <h> Almost zero spam ! ( Update 26/05/2016 ) <p> Spam is now almost at zero . <p> Disqus has learned over time what I consider to be- spam and what I do n't  , and now I get almost no spam whatsoever . A few months ago I was running Akismet alongside Disqus , I actually disabled that plugin a while back , and still zero spam . <p> Its obvious to see that Disqus gets better with time , and as I 've moderated comments , whitelisted comments from trusted folks in my community , blacklisted many , the platform has recognized over the course of time what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very useful and clever feature if you ask me . <p> OK , so Ive shared with your some good points and bad points , all based on my personal experience with using Disqus on my blog . <p> Next , let 's look at some other more common benefits and pitfalls that people often talk about when considering using Disqus . <h> The benefits of using Native WP Comment System <p> 1 . Simple layout and easy to use , that 's a big plus ! 2 . Encourages more people to comment with their email address and URL , since they 're getting a backlink in the process of leaving a comment , regardless whether its no-follow or not . 3 . Features can be extended with the use of various plugins ( i.e. CommentLuv , GrowMap anti-spam , TwitterLink , Akismet ) 4 . Comments are indexed by search engines . 5 . Responsive ( mobile friendly ) 6 . Comments are saved inside- your WP database . <h> The common pitfalls of using Native WP Comment System <p> 1 . Invites a ton of spammy comments , poor quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use various other plugins to add features that Disqus already has built-in , putting more weight on page load times , CPU usage and all the rest of it ! 3 . Looks messy and unprofessional on some blogs ( arguably I guess ) . 4 . No social media integration . <h> Benefits of using Disqus Comment System <p> 1 . Compatible with most web platforms such as Blogger , Tumblr , and Drupal , not just WordPress. 2 . Looks and feels more professional 3 . Smart at detecting spam , no need for additional plugins ( Since integrating Disqus on my blogs , spam have been almost non-existent. ) 4 . Integrates social media engagement into your blog , a very big plus point . 5 . Built-in reply to comment ' email notification . 6 . Google indexing of comments . 7 . Mobile responsive . 8 . Comments are backed up to your WP database . 9 . Users do n't  need to have a Gravatar account to use a Gravatar image ! 10 . Other fantastic built-in engagement features such as share comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . Related articles widget at bottom of comments allows users to explore more of your content or should you prefer , other content from around the web . 12 . Ability to monetize ( Make money baby ! ) . 13 . Have I missed anything out ? 14 . Oh , I almost forgot Ability to upload and share images in comments ! 15 . And its Free ! ! ! <h> Pitfalls of using Disqus Comment System <p> 1 . Occasionally slows page loading , however , check out this amazing tutorial I found on TechGlimpse. 2 . The fact that you have to register to leave a comment might frustrate and discourage some users , however , users can register with their social media profiles ( Disqus- supports Twitter , Facebook or Google+ ) 3 . Known errors with loading from time to time , this admittedly has frustrated me at best of times . ( Update 14/04/2016 : in the last 12 months of running Disqus , I 've not had any problems with slow loading or comments not loading at all , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WordPress Comment System ? My conclusion <p> Changing from native WordPress comments to Disqus or anything else is a big decision to make , especially if you 've built up a decent community on your blog where- your audience is- used to what you already have in place . <p> In an ideal situation , you might want to get their thoughts and opinions first before making the switch . Simply send out an email asking for their thoughts . <p> There are some pitfalls of using Disqus as I 've outlined above , however , and noticeably , there are a lot of bloggers making the switch- from the native WordPress comment system to Disqus , and not just big popular blogs , but the smaller blogs are doing it too . <p> Of course , that 's not to say just because everyone else is switching over so should you , it 's to say that Disqus works. - It 's a complete solution , and probably the best alternative solution to WordPress native comments . <p> I understand that Disqus is n't for everyone , but if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it a try at least , you have nothing to lose , and if you or your readers cant get used to it , just switch back to the native WordPress comment system at any time . <p> Ive been using Disqus now for almost 3 years , and I 've not looked back . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> I 've used Disqus on &amp; off . I love it personally but for me my biggest gripe is that for any that for readers who do n't  want to create an account there is no url link for Guest users . Therefore if someone I do n't  already know comments as a Guest I have no way of knowing where their website is to be able to visit them . <p> After reading your post in deep i found that i took good decision to choose disqus on my blog . Otherwise i am looking for migrate from disqus to WP comment . A huge thanks for this informative post buddy . = <p> Thanks for this . Im having quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is very interesting . Its reassured me that if i have to lose CommentLuv it may not be the complete disaster I thought it would be .

I 'm tech person who really want to know that which comment system is best for my website. so Finally ive decided to choose this platform for my website . Thanks to you for sharing your knowledge and experience . <p> I 'm glad you found this post useful in helping you make a decision on which commenting platform to use . You will no doubt reap a lot of benefits from Disqus that I have no doubt . Ive been using it for a good while now and never looked back at WP native comments .

In fact , I wrote a lengthy article a while back on how to drive referral traffic to your blog , you can find it here- too bookmark for reading later . <p> One of the strategies- I mentioned- in that very post was- creating videos and using YouTube as a major source for targeted website traffic . <p> In fact , YouTube is really just the start . <p> These days you can upload video content to most of the popular social platforms on the web . <p> We 've now got- Facebook , Vimeo , DailyMotion , MetaCafe and SlideShare just to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also cross-promote videos on these platforms as well . <p> So let 's get back to YouTube for the time being because- YouTube is considered to be the third- largest search engine on the internet . <p> Being owned by Google you 'd expect it to be I suppose right ? <p> Youve probably noticed that when you run a search for some things on the internet , often than not- its YouTube videos that grace the top of page one in the search results . <p> I 've always done this for all of my videos , again so that folks who know me through- my blog or through my social media profiles , can instantly recognize my videos when they see the thumbnails with my website logo and branding colors . <p> Before you run off to create some custom branded thumbnails for your videos , here are some thumbnail design tips to keep in the back of your mind . <p> If you 're going to add an annotation , make sure its some type of call-to-action . For instance , asking folks to subscribe to your channel at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Like the one shown below . <p> You already have a subscribe button placed in your YouTube channel for the public to see . What I like to do in addition to increasing the chances of getting viewers to hit that subscribe link , is do add my custom link . <p> If you look at the image below , you 'll see that I 've created an additional link to subscribe , and named it Subscribe To Channel . <p> I really recommend doing the same with yours . More chances are better right ? <h> Tip #6 : Link your associated website or blog <p> YouTube allows you to connect your associated website to your YouTube channel , this helps to improve their search results and to also verify your channel as the official representation of your brand on YouTube . <h> Tip #7 : Promote your videos on other social and content platforms <p> Probably the most effective way to grow your YouTube audience is by promoting your actual videos . <p> When you create a brand new video and upload it to YouTube , who 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing subscribers ? <p> And are your subscribers- likely to share your videos around ? <p> Hopefully ! <p> But if you want- to get as many views to your new videos as possible . If you want to get as many peeps visiting your channel and hitting that subscribe button , you 've got to do some marketing and promo work yourself . <p> I know Facebook prefers it if you upload the video content on their platform instead of sharing a YouTube link , so perhaps you could do that , then- link to the original video on your YouTube channel . <p> Where ever you are online , where ever you have an audience , promote your video there . <p> Do n't  forget to cross-promote your videos as well . Here are some ideas for promoting your videos on social and content platforms : <p> Upload your videos to your Facebook page , then- add a link back to the original video on your YouTube channel . <p> Share your videos in relevant groups and communities around Facebook , Google+ and LinkedIn . <p> Pin your videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scoop.it , and suggest your videos to other relevant topics on Scoop.it . <p> Add videos to your presentations in SlideShare . <p> Link to your videos from your free reports , eBooks and PDFs etc . You can do this by screen capturing the video and linking to the video itself from the image . <p> Create a dedicated custom video landing page on your blog like this one , and promote it like your life depends on it <p> Blog about your latest video . <p> Add your videos to related articles on your blog . <h> Tip #8 : Create a compelling channel trailer video <p> YouTube allow its users to create a channel trailer to welcome new visitors and entice them to subscribe . <p> Your welcome video does n't  have to be long , just around 30 to 60 seconds long , however , this is a great opportunity for you to really let people know about who you are , and what you 're passionate about , and how they can benefit from subscribing to your channel updates . <p> For more information , tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click here . <p> You can also do a search on YouTube for " channel trailer " for some truly inspirational ideas of how others have created their welcome intro videos . <p> Since my channel is mainly about blogging , WordPress and web design , here 's my channel video for some inspiration . <p> I have a new one coming out in early 2017 so keep an eye out for that one . <h> Tip #9 : Do n't  be shy <p> I fully appreciate- how important it is for you to promote your brand , and like I pointed out in tips #1 and #2 , branding your channel and videos are critical- elements for helping you to strengthen your brand , and to help you grow your audience on YouTube. 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> I think that some of these tips will contribute to increasing your YouTube audience , but I 'm not sure how well they would contribute to the speed in growth . Optimising your YouTube channel ( all points except #6 ) is essential in setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YouTube audience relies more on your promotional activities . <p> I see it the same with blogging you can have the best designed blog and most compelling content in the world , but if you do n't  promote it and no one knows about it , it will never create value . <p> Hi Stuart , thanks for your great comment , very true . Promotion is equally as important , could n't agree with you more on that . <p> Not all of these tactics will get you more subscribers over night I appreciate that , however let 's take creating a channel trailer for example , that strategy alone if done right , has the potential to help entice more viewers to take action and subscribe a lot quicker than most other methods , especially when combined with your video content promotional activities . 
@@76508614 @5208614/ <h> Genesis Theme Framework Review For 2017 Why Choose Genesis ? <p> In this post , I share with you my honest , unbiased review of Genesis Theme Framework . As a user of Genesis for more than 6 years , this review will ( hopefully ) help you make a better decision whether to use the software to build your website , or not . <p> Before I discovered Thrive Themes back at the end of 2014 , Genesis Theme Framework powered all of my web properties . <p> In fact , I started my blogging venture in 2010 with a Genesis-built WordPress blog . <p> Back then , Genesis was the talk of town as far as premium WordPress themes was concerned . The company , StudioPress was setting new standards by crafting extremely well coded , bespoke and very stylish child themes at a very competitive price . <p> Well its now 2017 , and so many new premium theme companies have come along , and I 'll be honest , I 've tried many of them myself . <p> But , at the end of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain why later on in the post . <p> OK so before we start , let 's begin with what makes Genesis unique , and still the best in the business . <h> What is Genesis anyway ? <p> So for those of you still learning about WordPress , themes and plugins , let me explain briefly what Genesis is . <p> Genesis is a premium quality theme framework that works with WordPress ( Open source WordPress and not WordPress.com websites ) . <p> The software- was created by StudioPress , a company created and run by CopyBlogger Media . <p> The Genesis theme can actually be used as a stand alone parent theme , however , it is when used with a child theme that users get the most from Genesis . <h> Why do I need a parent theme and a child theme ? <p> One of the most asked questions by clients Ive worked with using Genesis , is the above . Why do you need two themes ? <p> As I mentioned earlier , the parent theme can work perfectly as a stand-alone theme , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you do get with the parent theme is a robust framework with <p> Theme options <p> Theme customizer <p> Customizable header <p> Custom page templates <p> featured content widgets <p> Multiple layout options <p> Custom menu <p> Mobile responsive design <p> Using a child theme with Genesis will give your WordPress website a more unique look and feel . <p> A child theme is all about the visual design and appearance , moreover , you can customize a child theme to give your website a unique identity , maybe use your own branding colors and logo ( with some limitations ) . <p> You can do this manually inside of the style.css file ( if you 're savvy enough with CSS ) , or by using another plugin called Genesis Design Palette Pro . <p> Check out the screen capture of one of the child themes available from StudioPress . This theme is called the- Digital Pro theme . <p> Magnet4Blogging uses a heavily customized and modified version of the Digital Pro theme ( With a custom built homepage using Thrive Content Builder ) . <h> Dedicated plugins available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a host of cool plugins available from both the WordPress repository , and the StudioPress Marketplace , that you can install to increase the functionality and ease of use of your Genesis powered WordPress site . <p> here 's a few of them : <p> Genesis Simple Hooks Gives you easy access to over 50 action hooks inside the Genesis Theme , perfect for adding functionality to your WordPress site without having to install additional plugins . <p> Genesis Simple Edits Let 's you edit the three most commonly modified areas in any Genesis theme : the post-info , the post-meta , and the footer area . <p> Genesis Extender Plugin A third-party plugin created by CobaltApps which will give you incredible control and power over customization for your entire child theme . <p> OK so I hope so far you 've gotten a better understanding of what Genesis theme framework is , now let 's look at some of the reasons why YOU might want to invest your money in a Genesis theme for your business website or blog . <p> Over the years I 've played around with a lot of themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep coming back to Genesis because editing even simple preferences is much easier with Genesis . <p> Each Genesis child theme comes with its own unique set of settings , and making changes to those settings is just a case of ticking a few boxes , entering some basic information in the fields provided , switching a few slider settings over , placing ready-widgets inside the columns and footer section and you 're done . <p> There 's really no need to mess around with theme files , bits of code or anything else , however , I will talk about advanced customization later on in this post . <p> The layout options is already there for you to make changes to , such as color style , default layout , navigation , breadcrumbs , blog page template etc . <p> Check out the screen shot below to view the theme setting option in Genesis . <p> Robust and reliable When it comes to quality and reliability for your WordPress theme , I can only think of a few names , and Genesis ranks at the top for me . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time researching , designing and coding- their child themes carefully . <p> Having used many of the child Genesis themes over the years , I can safely say without bragging too much , that never once have I experienced any glitches or annoying errors with Genesis themes . <p> Most of the Genesis themes are lightweight too , they load pretty darn fast as well and that 's something very important to bare in mind when thinking about creating a user-friendly website . <p> Affordable Yep , Genesis is pretty affordable . <p> The thing is there 's so many competition out there , and yes , you can find cheaper themes . <p> In my opinion , however , you cant really go wrong with paying top dollar for a reliable premium quality theme . <p> Its certainly a cheaper alternative than seeking out a professional web designer , which can cost a small fortune , right ? <p> Expandable Yes , Genesis is expandable , and as I mentioned at the start of this review you can expand the functionality of your Genesis powered WordPress site using plugins . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSS , you can take full advantage of your theme customization . <p> This is not to say that you- need to be a coding expert to use Genesis , I 'm simply saying that if you have some knowledge of HTML and CSS you can really make your Genesis site more unique to you and your personal brand , in terms of both design and functionality . <p> First class support &amp; unlimited updates Support is pretty spot on with StudioPress . As a lifetime member , you get premium support as and when you need it , including lifetime updates on all your purchased themes . <p> Now this is something to really consider when thinking about investing in a premium theme . <p> A lot of theme creators will have some kind of annual membership fee setup on their site , like Thrive Themes . <p> With StudioPress , when you buy Genesis theme(s) you become a lifetime member , no need to keep paying an annual fee . <p> Genesis Framework and each Child theme is coded with security in mind , and moreover , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a robust and reliable website , but a very secured one too . <p> I realise that no matter how many precautions you take , your website will always be at risk , but keeping those nasty bots and hackers at bay , and of course complete peace of mind as well is important , yes ? <h> Genesis customization <p> Now I want to talk a little bit about customizing a Genesis child theme in a bit more detail . <p> If you have the money , you can go beyond the ready-made child themes and pay for a developer , like myself , to either customize , or create a unique child theme to work with Genesis Framework . <p> If you do n't  have the money to do this , as I mentioned earlier , you can use a premium WordPress plugin called Genesis Design Palette Pro , or the Genesis Extender plugin , which will both make it very easy to add some personalization to your Genesis site . <p> If you need help with customising your Genesis site design , by the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Your WordPress Site <p> If you 've recently purchased Genesis , I have a short detailed tutorial video showing you how to install the software into your site . <p> In the video you 'll see I install the parent theme first , and then the child theme . Just to warn you , though , the video is a good few years old now , but the installation process has n't  changed one single bit . <h> Pros and Cons <p> OK its time to look at some pros and cons of using Genesis Framework . <p> Pros <p> High quality premium theme framework built on its reputation . <p> Affordable . <p> Lightweight and easy to install . <p> Simple layout and settings . <p> Wide range of StudioPress and third party child themes to choose from . <p> Lifetime membership , no annual fee . <p> Lifetime updates . <p> Great support . <p> Built-in SEO , mobile responsive and HTML5 markup . <p> Cons <p> Not the most easiest to add advanced customization without using additional plugins . <h> Final Conclusion On Genesis Framework <p> Hopefully you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that you do n't  think that Ive been completely biassed at all towards Genesis . Yes , I do love using Genesis and yes , I recommend it to anyone serious about taking their WordPress site or blog to the next level . <p> But , I 'll leave you to decide for yourself now .

@@76508615 @5208615/ <p> If you 've been doing the online thing for a while , just cast your mind back to 8 or 10 years ago . There werent really many great places to sell your eBooks on the web , even though eBooks were just starting to get popular . <p> Giving it away on your blog or website was the easiest thing to do , and it probably still is . <p> Today , however , there are dozens of great places online you can sell your digital books on , so in this- post , I want to share with you 6 of those great places . <p> If you have your eBook written , edited , done and dusted , and you 're ready to sell it to the masses and start reaping- the rewards of your hard labor , then pay these 6 sites a visit soon ! <p> Payhip is what I currently use myself to sell all my eBooks . Payhip allows me to not only host my- eBooks but to also create promotional campaigns using their promo tools . I- can also- create affiliates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Payment is conveniently handled through PayPal and the company takes only 5% commission on each eBook sale I make . <p> There are no setup fees , monthly fees or even hosting fees to concern myself- with . I would highly recommend checking them out to sell your eBook on . <p> I 've never personally used Selz to sell eBooks on , but I have purchased eBooks through them.Selz- is far more than just a place to host and sell your eBooks <p> A couple of friends of mine in the blogging industry do quite well with Selz too . Selz- is far more than just a place to host and sell your eBooks <p> Selz- is far more than just a place to host and sell your eBooks on . Selz provides you with complete eCommerce solutions should you need it . <p> Again just as with Payhip , there are no fixed monthly fees , bandwidth fees or hosting fees to worry about with Selz. - In addition , the company only takes 2% commission per transaction , an even better rate than Payhip in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places on the web to sell digital products and services online . <p> Fiverr is a great place to sell your eBooks on , and I 've had some reasonably good success with selling my eBooks on the platform in the past . <p> Its where I first started selling my eBooks online actually . <p> There are some amazing built-in tools and features in Fiverr , including a complete dashboard for managing your customer communication , orders , and sales . <p> The only problem I found with Fiverr is that you have to manually deliver the eBook yourself when you make a sale . You also have to maintain your profile so that your gigs do n't  become deactivated after some time , so that means logging in every few weeks- or so to be sure . <p> The fact that your digital products are n't  delivered automatically when someone makes a purchase , is a pain in the backside to me . <p> The other pitfall with selling eBooks on Fiverr is that they take $1 per transaction , so if your eBook is priced at $5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eBooks on Fiver though is that Fiverr is- a pretty large platform . Even though there might be a lot of competition out there , the site gets a lot of traffic and you have every opportunity to make a sale of your eBook . <p> Now again I have had no experience with selling my eBooks on Feiyr.com . The company suggests that they 've been around since 2006 and- from what Ive heard , - its a- great place to self-publish and distribute your eBooks on . <p> Registration is free but there is a small account activation fee , around G9 I think . <p> There is no monthly or yearly cost with Feiyr.com and you earn 80% commission on sales of your eBooks .

@@76508617 @5208617/ <p> In this tutorial , you will learn how to add new custom widget areas to the front Page of the Digital Pro child theme for Genesis . <p> A few of my readers have kindly asked if I could write a detailed post on how I was able to modify and customize the Digital Pro Genesis child theme- for this website . <p> Well , I in this post I hope to do just that . <p> I love the Digital Pro child theme . I 've played around with modifying it many times on my- staging site , and Ive finally tweaked it to just the way I want it to look and work on Magnet4Blogging . <p> If you do n't  already have this theme and would like to use it on your blog or website , click here . <p> What I 'm going to show you mainly is how to add new widget areas to the front page of the Digital Pro child theme . Along with some other tips for changing the style and font . <h> Disclaimer : <p> Once again , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child theme for Genesis. - Please do n't  attempt to try and modify any other Genesis child theme using the same methods below , in hope that it will work . You may end up breaking your theme . <p> Right , the other very important thing I want to quickly mention before we crack on is this : <p> Back up everything ! <p> Yes everything , hopefully , you are using a quality backup service like BlogVault or VaultPress . <p> I cant stress enough on the importance of backing up your site . Also if you 're using a staging site or locally hosted WordPress site before doing this on your main live site , even better ! <p> OK , this tutorial will also assume that you already have Genesis and the Digital Pro child theme installed . If you have n't , you can once again grab a copy of them both- via my affiliate- link . <h> Modifying the front page of the Digital Pro child theme <p> So what exactly do I mean by modifying the theme ? Well , what I 'm going to specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homepage : <p> That was what our website looked like before we upgraded and rebranded . <p> If you 're currently using the Digital Pro child theme- on your website , you 'll notice its a little bit different from the default theme . For starters , there are 5 widget areas instead of just 3 . <p> Let 's quickly go over the elements that make up this " customized homepage " appearance . <p> Main above the fold hero section . ( Theme default widget area ) <p> Influencers section below the- fold . ( Newly added widget area ) <p> Services section ( Theme default , slightly modified ) <p> Recent testimonials ( Newly added widget area ) <p> Information section above footer ( Modified ) <p> Footer section ( Theme default ) <p> Let 's begin . <h> Step One : Adding additional widgets to the front page <p> First , log into your WordPress dashboard as normal . <p> Then , go to the Static Front Page ( front-page.php file ) , and not the Theme Functions ( functions.php ) . <p> Click on Appearance &gt; Editor , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the front-page.php file is being viewed . <p> I want to remind you at this stage to ensure you 've created a backup copy of all the contents on this page , just in case you need to revert back to it should you make a mistake . <p> What I usually do is copy the entire content of the page I 'm going to be changing , and then paste it into a blank notepad . Should I need it later on , I can use it to restore things back to normal . <p> Please also note , if you break your site , I wont be held responsible . You are following these guidelines at your own risk . <p> Right , so on the Editor page you 're currently on , scroll down the Static Front Page until you see this line : <p> // Add widgets on front page <p> Now carefully select the portion of the script highlighted in red , shown in the image below , and delete it . <p> DO NOT PRESS SAVE CHANGES AFTER yet . <p> OK , so the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paste it into the area where you just deleted the previous script . <p> You can look at the image above for reference of where the old code was originally placed . It simply replaces that code . <h> What have you just done ? <p> Instead of adding them individually , like front-page-4 and then front-page-5 , Ive provided you with the complete replacement PHP codes for all the widgets on the front page , just to save you a HUGE amount of time . <h> Typography and CSS styling <p> For those of you interested , I also had to change some of the CSS rules of the Digital Pro theme- front-page . <p> To make CSS styling easier for this child theme ( or in fact for any other Genesis Child Theme ) , I used or I 'm using two additional plugins. 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417

It is rightly said one needs to keep changing everything at his blog and this is a very pleasant change . <p> Your point number three " purchase a product " is the heart and soul of this post . You can never write a successful review just on the basis of observation and knowledge . You must have first hand experience of using that product and after that whatever you declare about the product would be trusted more if you already have trust of your readers . <p> This is one of the most comprehensive posts on product review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important step to write a salable product review . <p> Thanks so much for your kind words , I wanted to make this blog as personal as possible , to really close the gab between me and my good readers such as yourself . Hopefully people will see that I 'm genuinely a real person and look forward to engaging with me on the blog . <p> Thank you so much for adding such a great and valuable comment . Yes the trust factor is a big deal in my experience , and can certainly make a difference when it comes to gaining the trust of your audience . <p> I personally would not trust an online review , or make a purchase from one that only showed stock images or videos . Unless the site is a reputable site like Mashable or TechCrunch . <p> Thankfully most bloggers I know of in the blogosphere are pretty damn honest and review great products theyve used themselves . I 've made some great purchases this way . <p> I have never read such a lengthy blog post at one stretch . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some that would stay in my memory for long and that I actually intend to implement . 1 . The way you compose the title : -product name-review-an extension . I have seen such titles come up on top of the search engine results . 2 . The content structure of your review . I have leant an important lesson . 3 . The non-use of keywords in anchor text while linking ( after all , you have used the keywords earlier wisely in the post title and in the content ) 4 . The comparison of competitive products ( Yes I have read about it long ago ) <p> I sincerely thank you Fabrizio for putting me on the right path of review blogging . <p> Hi Kidambi thanks so much for visiting today , glad you really enjoyed the post . I know it was a bit long , I really wanted to write a detailed post on product reviews because the potential for making money online from good honest , well written and informative online reviews is really good . And its a great way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will inspire many bloggers to start writing good reviews or perfecting their current strategy . <p> I would say that it is an excellent guide for the bloggers to write perfect product reviews . Yes , people do believe our reviews before buying any product and thus we should be very honest in writing the review of products/services . As you said , we should buy and use that product to write a genuine review . <p> I would prefer to purchase/use any product/service to present a detailed review for my readers . Your guide is ultimate and yes , SEO should be taken care for reviews . Thanks for writing this awesome post for us = <p> Hi Nirmala thanks so much for commenting and sharing this post on Google+ , I really appreciate it . I 'm so pleased you see the valid point I made about product purchasing before reviewing . This was one of the mistakes I made myself in the early years , back when I started doing online reviews in 2010 . <p> Sometimes bloggers are n't  in a finicial state to purchase products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask the companies for one of their products you want to review , however , in my experience this does n't  always work , it works sometimes , but not always , unless you are really well known in the online world I guess . <p> But from a beginner stand point , purchasing products is key to writing a great honest product review that will convert into sales , and you can really make some great money from this . <p> In the blogging and online business niche there 's always great products coming out , you just have to be super vigilant and try and be one of the first to get hold of the product to review . Ive been successful a few times with these before myself . <p> Anyway , thanks for your comment Nirmala , have yourself a great productive and profitable week = <p> Hi Fabrizio , as Nirmala said , its just an excellent all round guide , well done .

@@76508622 @5208622/ <h> Should I Disable Comments On My Blog ? <p> That 's a very interesting question , and I know there 's already quite a bit of debate about this topic , and already- some of the industries leading blogs have gone down the route of disabling the commenting feature on their blogs , Copyblogger made a bold movement to remove comments on their blog a while back . <p> I want to add my personal thoughts and opinions on this topic of removing comments , and more over , I want to look at the advantages and disadvantages of disabling the comment feature on your blog . So if you 're seriously thinking of removing comments altogether , for what ever reasons , just hold off until you 've read- this post . <p> Once I 'm done ranting , I 'd love for you guys to get involved and share your own thoughts and opinions . Maybe share your experiences too , perhaps- you do n't  allow comments on your blog , and if you do n't  , I 'd love to hear from you . I 'd like to know how that 's going for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement on your blog , if not through commenting . Perhaps you do n't  care about engagement and building a community ! Let me know your thoughts below this post . <p> Anyway , let 's get on with the post . <p> First of all ask yourself this : <p> " Why should I disable comments on my blog ? " <p> Why do you want to do this ? <p> It could be because you want to spend less time sorting through comments every single day ? <p> It could be because you want to maintain a nice clean blog without showing lots of comments ? <p> It could simply be because you do n't  want any comments , or care about building an audience for your blog . If its a personal blog I would n't really recommend turning off comments , but a niche site then maybe comments are n't  as important as social shares . What do you think ? <p> What ever your reasons may be for the moment , let 's just start off with- weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of turning off comments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Let 's start with the disadvantages <p> #1 . No engagement and no conversations- This is the big one for me , ultimately the benefit of allowing comments on your blog is to promote engagement and conversations . Comments helps you to make real connections with your readers and build relationships , ( which well talk about more in point #3 ) . <p> In my opinion , turning off comments on a personal blog does the complete opposite of promoting engagement and helping you to build your community . Its a bit like having a slice of toast with just a bit of butter and nothing else , no jam , no marmite , no marmalade , just bland old butter ! <p> What 's my point ? you 're probably wondering . <p> Well whilst your toast is going to taste OK with just a bit of butter , you ca n't help but think that somethings missing , a bit like your blog ! <p> If you have a great blog and great content , but with no comments , no conversations going no , its just going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Do you really want to have a ghost town blog ? - ( aff ) That would be pretty boring in my opinion . <p> If you turn off comments , that 's exactly what it will be <p> So as you 've probably gathered by reading the above statement , I do feel that comments are important , regardless of how many you 're getting on your blog , whether its 3 or 4 comments per post , or 30 plus comments per post , I do n't  care , comments are essential , they 're useful to you and your community , it let 's people know your blog is alive and active . <p> So to round up this first point , allowing- comments on your blog promotes engagement and conversations , and engagement is crucial for several reasons . I wont cover them all in this post , but the biggest two reasons for me is that engagement is crucial for helping you to build your community , - and crucial for helping you- understand your target audience better . <p> Think about it , you would n't do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and not ask them for their feedback and comments at the end , would you ? <p> So remember this point clearly:No comments means no engagement and no conversations . No conversations means no community building and no relationships with your readers , and having a blog community is- one of the many keys needed for- achieving blogging success . Well cover more on this in point #3 . <p> #2 . No proof your blog has an active community- - Proof , what proof ? - When new visitors come to your blog and- see lots of conversations going on , lots of comments being left by others in your posts , they immediately get the impression that : - hey , this- blog must be pretty darn important . <p> Its proof that you are an- authority in your industry , and that people are actually listening to you , following you and communicating with you through comments . So when other people are visiting your blog for the first time , they see all these comments and this will encourage them to want to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You turn off the comments , and you 'll have no proof to show to anyone that your blog has an active community ! Perhaps you can rely on social shares instead . <p> #3. - Difficult for you to build relationships and strengthen relationships with your readers- Following on from the last two points I made clearly about no engagement and no proof , the other critical benefit of allowing for- comments on your blog is that with engagement , comes the strengthening of relationships between YOU and your blog audience . <p> When regular visitors and other bloggers drop by to leave meaningful comments and you respond to them , something crucial and magical happens , you become more connected , intertwined , and over time those relationships strengthen , which to me is what its really all about . <p> Comments is what helps you to build your blogs community ( aff ) . And you know what else strengthening your relationships with your audience does ? It helps you to build trust and credibility ! Boy do n't  even get me started on how important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . <p> #4 . Difficult for you to understand your audiences needs- I kind of touched on this in my first point , but let 's dive deeper . <p> Allowing- your readers- to comment on your blog makes it easier for you to tune-in and- listen to what they 're asking for , what questions they 're posting , what conversations they 're striking and so forth . <p> Understanding their needs will help you to determine what types of content to create for them in the future . For example , you might notice that a lot of people in your audience is talking about , and searching for solutions to their problems , what ever that might be . The that would be your cue to start thinking about writing more how to posts and creating online tutorials , - right ? <p> As you engage more with your audience , as you connect with them on a more personal level , you get to understand them and their needs better . Blog comments can do all of these great things and then some . <p> OK I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment on your blog , what I 've done is tried to highlight what I believe to be the most important ones . If you can think of anymore good reasons , please do leave them in the comment section below . <p> So let 's now look at 3 main- advantages of disabling comments on your blog , why might you consider removing the ability for someone to leave a comment on your blog ? <p> I 've already shared with you some reasons why at the start of this post , but let 's take a look at some others , in fact I 'll use one of my niche blogs as an example . <h> 3 Huge Advantages Of Turning Off Comments On Your Blog <p> I did a little experiment on one of my niche sites earlier this year ( 2014 , a parenting blog ) , where I completely disabled the commenting feature on that blog , I have n't enabled it back since . here 's why I did this and the benefits I got from removing comments on- that blog . <p> #1 . I saved myself valuable time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that I 'm not doing anymore as a result of removing comments , is using up valuable time and energy trekking through the thousands of spammy comments that blog used to get each month , just to find a handful of half decent comments . <p> Its tragic I know , and I did n't  have Akismet at the time . So instead of letting people , or bots comment , I pushed for- the real conversations to take place over on the sites Facebook and Twitter page , and to some extent that tactic- has worked well , social sharing in fact increased ! <p> #2 . I 'm not putting off new visitors- If you have a blog that gets a lot of comments , great , that 's wonderful , this point would n't matter . But if you do n't  have many comments whatsoever to show , that 's not so great . I know new blogs do struggle to get comments in the beginning , however they will come with time , marketing and promotion . <p> But let me tell you- how I see things when there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you- have a ton of posts that have a big fat zero comments in them , ( like some of mine do from time to time ) , what 's that going to do for your first time visitors ? Its going to tell them that , " hey , the lights are on here , but nobodys home ! " - I 'm sure you 've heard that expression- before . <p> What I mean by this is that people are going to see that you make an effort to update your blog regularly , but most of your posts do n't  have any comments , just a big fat zero sitting in each of your posts . <p> So in my experience seeing big fat zeros- can sometimes discourage others to want to start commenting , let alone hang around long enough on your blog to show interest , not always , but I 've certainly experienced that myself . <p> Some visitors- may automatically assume just because your blog does n't  get any , or show many comments , it ca n't be a very good blog , so there 's little point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing this myself in the past , I visit a blog , I scroll down the blog posts page and see big fat zeros in almost all the posts , and therefore I leave without reading a single word on that blog . My bad <p> What Ive found to be very useful in such cases , is to disable commenting altogether on just the posts that havent received any comments at all , I do this after some time of course to give those posts a chance . And I 'll leave the posts- that do have comments in them , so if anyone new is visiting , they wont be greeted with big fat zeros , theyll see few posts with few comments in them at least . <p> #3 . I 'm saving money- If you have a WordPress blog , and have had one for some time , you 'll know the only way to stop comment spam is to either disable comments and trackbacks altogether , or pay Akisment for spam filtering . <p> By disabling comments you- save yourself $60 per year on Akismet subscription , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that I saved a little bit of money . You might be thinking well what 's $60 per year for heavens sake ? When you have 7 , 8 or more blogs going , each with its own Akismet subscription , it accumulates to quite a lot of money each year ! <p> My Final Thoughts <p> There are many other reasons why some bloggers might choose to disable comments on their blogs , reasons that I 've not mentioned in this post perhaps , but at the end of the day , its what ever you decide to do . I 'm not saying do n't  do it , I 'm not saying do it either . You can read all the articles you want about how valuable comments are , but its YOUR choice at the end of the day . <p> My personal opinion is that receiving- blog- comments is an essential- element for building an active blog community . <p> So there you have it , if you 're thinking about removing comments from your blog for what ever reason , I do hope this post has helped you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , let 's hear what you have to say <p> OK so I 've said what I needed to about this subject matter , I 've shared with you- my thoughts , experiences and opinions too . I 've weighed out the benefits of taking- either- options . I now want to hear what you think about disabling comments on blogs . <p> Leave me a comment below as always , until next time , keep on blogging , keep on rocking ! <p> Fabrizio Van Marciano <p> Post Views : 796 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Very difficult topic you picked and it is still to say definitely about two of its options . You well covered all the merits and demerits and did full justice with the topic . <p> I think it also depends upon the niche of ones blog . If niche relates to an industry where nothing is worthy of selling then obviously he has to rely on PPC options to earn money . For that he needs not to build a community . <p> Yes for those blogging on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think to disable it . They cant make money without building a community and commenting plays a big role for this task . <p> Yes you 're absolutely right about the niche type , I discovered that very quickly with my parenting / child custody niche site , since it is just an information blog and at present I 've not yet thought about creating a unique product to sell on that site , nor is the site making any real money other than modest income from AdSense . <p> For a blog like this one though , I realise how important comments are because I want to serve an audience and help people solve problems and take their blogging to new levels , so allowing comments is essential if I want to connect with people , strength my relationships with them and and build a community . <p> Always great to read your comments here Muba , thanks for being part of my community = ) You 're truly appreciated . <p> First time on your blog and I found you via Adrienne Smiths blog . You made some valid points on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I do say for beginner bloggers to leave your comment section on . As a beginner you want to start building engagement and a community . How do you do this ? You want to comment on other blogs within your niche to start off . For me when I was a beginner , this is what i did , and people did come to my blog to comment as well . For others it may be different , but so far I have n't seen this for myself . <p> Now once you get to the point where you 're getting hundreds and hundreds and thousands of comments , then it might be safe to turn off your comment section . At this point you 've already build a great reputation and trying to reply to all of those comments can be by far overwhelming . This is at the point where your shares become more valuable than your comments . I myself have n't got into this point yet , but would more than likely turn this section off it it does ! <p> Thanks for sharing your opinions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman , first of all , a warm welcome to my blog , and thanks so much for leaving a valuable comment . <p> Yes I absolutely agree with you , from a beginners perspective you need to start establishing yourself quickly , and like you say , you need to start getting as many eyeballs on your content as possible from the word go , and hopefully getting more people interested in becoming regular visitors , readers , and becoming part of your community . Blog commenting is the ultimate way in which to do that , that and doing content promotion and engaging on blog community sites . <p> When I started my first blog back in 2010 , that 's exactly what I did ( minus engaging on blog community sites ) , I had a strategy where I was commenting on 5 to 10 blogs per day related to my niche . Within a year I had built a reasonably good readership and averaging between 15 and 20 comments per post , which was n't too bad I thought . <p> I turned off the comments though during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great comments I was getting , also came the thousands of spammy ones . Spammers were getting cleverer everyday and bots were invading blogs via commenting like as if it was going out of fashion = But by which then I also had a nice little regular audience to cater for . <p> This blog however is still relatively new ( started in March 2014 ) and so community building IS big on my agenda . I love reaching out and connecting with influential people online , and through blog commenting Ive been able to connect with great bloggers like Adrienne Smith and Neil Patel and Ms Ileane Smith , and now of course yourself = I invested in Adriennes community building course and very close to finishing it , its such a great course what Ive consumed of it so far , and I 've learned so much . <p> Anyhow Sherman , thanks again for visiting , hope to see you again soon . Have a super weekend too . <p> Yeah sure , I mean I 've experimented many times with comments on and off with blogs , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start the process of getting people to comment is essential , then later on if comments is working then that 's great . <p> Like I found with my niche fatherhood/parenting blog , people did n't  comment very much on that site , they were quite happy to just share posts on their favourite social network site . I think largely due to the fact that the content was n't personal like the content on this blog for example . Here I write and address the readers in my post . On my niche site I do n't  address anyone , I just write content that provides value without promoting engagement , without asking questions or providing call to actions , so eventually I turned off the comments . <p> Hope you 're having a great weekend too bro , thanks for stopping by , come back soon . <p> I had to stop by and chime in on this subject , its one of my favorites as you know . <p> I know that not everyone is here for the same reasons . Not everyone is using their blogs the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as just a resource and they do n't  really care whether or not they build engagement or have a community . <p> For those people I hope that 's benefiting them well but for the rest of us I believe its valuable to not only have comments but have great conversations taking place . That 's social proof that you not only know what you 're talking about but its very attractive in new prospects eyes . <p> To me having a community behind you is the key to your success . They are the ones that will be there for you and support you . If you can achieve that through building your list and having great results than all the more power to you . But I believe that by having social proof , that will entice more and more people into opting into your list and getting what you offer . <p> Down the road if you 're having massive success because of these avenues and you cant afford to continue keeping up with them then at that time each person can decide whether or not they want to disable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it because I 'm so big on community but again I think it has to be up to the individual . <p> As far as doing it for spam , I think that 's just an excuse . If you have the right things in place you wont be run over by spam . I do n't  use Akismet and only did in the very beginning . Anyone with a blog will have spam , its just part of it but it can be controlled and all I can say is that mine is very much under control . <p> Anyway , that 's my two cents on this subject and thanks for bringing this up . I know everyone has their opinions on this . <p> Very well put Adrienne , though like I said , on my niche site I had no spam protection whatsoever , so I could have easily solved that problem right there by adding Akismet . But I chose to turn off comments on that site as well because there werent really any real comments being left , it seemed that visitors preferred to share content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most of that sites traffic comes from search engines in any case . I guess its like Muba says it ALSO depends on the niche type as well . <p> Had a great weekend Adrienne , should be fully recharged for another week = Hope you had a great one too = ) <p> That was an interesting topic for discussion . I thought that Copyblogger were wrong to disable comments ( although I thought they were right to dump Facebook ) . <p> I agree with all the points that you made except one : " I 'm not putting off new visitors . " Perhaps its because I make and receive comments regularly on blogs , but I am put off by an article that has not enabled comment . It looks lonely and desolate , which puts me off reading further . Therefore , I would n't describe disabling comments as a potential advantage for that reason . <p> Hey Nathan thanks for checking out my post and thoughts on blog commenting . <p> That 's cool , I love hearing about others thoughts and opinions too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenting is off putting , but I think in my case for my niche site , comments was simply not working at all , people were simply using it to leave me thousands of spam every month , so I flipped the switch and disabled their ability to leave me crap lol . <p> But on a blog like this , I would never dream of removing comments again after carrying out my little experiment . <p> If I remember correctly you had comments disabled on this blog for a while . You had left an option below every post so we could join the conversation at Google+ . I might be wrong but I am somewhat sure because after reading a few posts , I wanted to leave my opinion on the post right there . Since I did n't  have that option , I simply left disappointed . And then I stopped visiting your blog since it was all one way = Sorry to say so . <p> Personally , I would n't turn off comments and make my blog a rigid place for my readers . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and share their opinion on ANY topic ! It is a place where everyone , including me , learns . <p> Hello Jane , nope , you are absolutely correct , I did disable comments on this blog for almost a month ( about 26 day ) , I posted on the Facebook page that I would be running an experiment with comments turned off . <p> I decided to turn it back it back on because a few people had emailed me to say that they could n't leave comments , what was going on ? I soon realised that turning off comments was a bad idea , especially on a blog where I 'm drawing readers into the conversation . <p> The feedback I got from people was great , they were disappointed too that I had turned off comments , thankfully though they emailed me and told me , so I knew this was not going to work .

One of which was that this was a lightening fast loading plugin , and I was all about making my site faster to load . <p> So , if you 're sick and tired of waiting around for your site to load because of your current social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least one of the problems of slow loading site solved . <h> Tell me about the features ? <p> Social Warfare is crammed with a host of powerful tools and social optimization features . These include the following <p> Beautifully crafted , fully customizable social sharing buttons . The design of these buttons is simply gorgeous . <p> Built-in Frame Buster to protect your content from being used for promotional purposes , and much more . <p> I want to share with you just a few of my favorite features in this plugin. <h> #1 . Button customization and display options <p> With Social Warfare , you can customize your social sharing buttons just the way you want it , and there are over 5,000 potential style combinations to work through using the Visual Options . <p> In addition to styling , you can position your buttons almost anywhere you want on your site , simply by selecting the placement options available , or manually placing the buttons into your posts or pages yourself . <h> #2 . Click-to-Tweet boxes <p> I love this feature . Before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Click-To-Tweet boxes into my content , with Social Warfare premium , this is stuff is built right it . <h> #3 . Hover Pin-it button <p> Another one of my favorite features is the easy-to-use Hover to Pin button . Enabling this means anyone can pin images straight to their Pinterest boards , thus helping you to drive traffic from Pinterest. <h> #4 . Popular Posts Widget <p> Once of the coolest features , I think in Social Warfare is the Popular Posts widget . You can drop this straight into your blogs sidebar or footer area to display your most popular posts by the total number of social shares . <p> Amazing built-in features , including " Click to Tweet " and " Frame Buster " . <p> Lots of buttons placement and display options , including manual placement . <p> ACTIVATE TWITTER COUNTS to show Tweet counts ! <p> A free version of this plugin available from the WordPress plugins repository . <p> Affordable premium version with access to tons of additional features , support and updates , only $29 for single use license ( per year ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and configure . <p> Extensive knowledge database and great customer support ( Premium ) . <p> Cons <p> If you want to continue receiving updates for this plugin , you have to renew your subscription each year . <p> Very occasionally conflicts with other plugins stopping some of the features working properly . <h> How much is Social Warfare ? <p> Once again , there 's a free version of this plugin available from WordPres.org <p> If you choose to go premium for additional features , support and updates , as you 've probably read from the above list of pros , Social Warfare is very affordable at just $29 per year for a single site license . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> When it comes to techie tools including plug ins my eyes normally glaze over . Its just not what I 'm about . But your well written and constructed review really made it very clear even to a technophobe like me . <p> I got ta say I love that click to tweet function its a winner . And of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , various custom options well , it seems like a winner to me . And its only 24 bucks ! <p> Hey Kim , thanks for your comment mate , personally I love techie tools , especially ones that has a purpose . A few that I 've invested in over the years has literally helped me get where I am today with my blog , but there 's quite a few others unfortunately that 's been a total waste of time . <p> This plugin is awesome , the features are truly gold , a lot of plugins of this kind usually starts around $37 for a single use , so $24 is a steal mate . Whether you decide to invest or not , best of luck in any case = <p> Looks like this one could be well worth it . Ive been using Digg Digg since I first started by site but I do think the design options that Social Warfare has available are a bit more attractive . <p> The click to tweet feature is great as well I do have a free plugin that does this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate plugin . I prefer to have as few as possible , so having both of those features under one plugin would be nice . <p> I 'm definitely going to have to consider this one , especially at such a cheap price . If it did actually yield additional shares over my current plugin setup , it would pay for itself .

There 's so many options there 's something there for everyone . I 've still not completely decided on the final design I 'm going to use . <p> I also invested in Easy Social Metrics Pro .

That being " expert roundup posts " . <h> What are expert roundup posts ? <p> For those of you who do n't  know what these are ; <p> Expert roundup posts are- articles consisting of content created 80% by other people such as top bloggers , industry experts and influencers , and- 20% created by you . Here are some fine examples of successful expert roundup posts . <p> Whilst there 's a lot of organisation involved and correct execution required from you to make your expert roundup posts truly successful , most of the input will come from those who contribute to them . <h> Rewarding way of creating content <p> Creating expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I said earlier , they can definitely attract a lot of traffic , social media shares and even some backlinks . <p> Yes backlinks , but- I will say this : <p> Your goal for creating expert roundups should n't be purely for SEO gains , but moreover for helping you to make some- new connections in your industry and to build your blog community . <p> You can also gain a lot of credibility and authority with your expert roundup posts , - especially if the folks contributing to your posts are " truly experts " in their field . <p> OK so in this post I 'm going to share with you some simple steps to help you create some truly amazing expert roundup posts for your blog , from start to finish , so let 's begin . <h> Create An Expert Roundup Post , Step One : - What type of questions do you want to ask ? <p> How an expert roundup post works in a nutshell , is that you ask a specific question related to your niche or industry to a group of people i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with their answers in which you can use to build up your roundup post . <p> So the first thing you want to do is figure out what question you want to ask . <p> When I did my expert roundup post a few weeks back , I thought about the types of problems that some of my readers were having . So I wanted to as a " problem solving question " if that makes sense . In hope that the answers I would get , would help some of my readers . <p> If you 're in the blogging or online business niche , here are some example questions you might want to ask your participants . <p> So before you start emailing your question or questions to anyone , its very important to get organised first . <p> First you 'll need to make a list of as many top bloggers , experts and influencers in your industry or niche- that you may want to consider contacting . <p> This process is much easier to do if you 're already connected with some bloggers in your niche , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to creating a successful roundup post is to reach out to top level influencers in your industry , the ones that are making the most amount of noise if you like . <p> When contacting anyone , consider creating a database list of who you made contact with , when , how , and when they responded to your email invitation . <p> This way you can keep on top of things and if you need to send follow up emails to those who have n't yet responded , or to those who are interested by havent gotten back to you with a final response , it will be easier to see from your list. - Of course this can only work if you keep it updated . <p> Below is a screen grab of the email outreach campaign database I created for my last expert roundup post . <p> I use " Numbers " for the Mac , but you can create an email outreach campaign database using Excel for Windows or any other spreadsheet software for that matter . Google Docs is another great tool you can use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about keeping your expert roundup post contacts organised and updated like this in a spread sheet , is that should you need to use them again in the future for another roundup article , the whole process will be easier and can save you a ton of time . <p> In addition I would also suggest you set a deadline date for people to respond , so at least they can add it to their calendars or have the date stamped in their heads if they 're interested in participating . <p> From previous experience I think 1 to 2 weeks is ample enough time for asking folks to respond . <p> Now like I said at the start , 80% of the content will be contributed by your participants , the other 20% by you . <p> As you begin to- receive responses from the folks you have emailed , you can begin to add their contributions to your roundup post . Again do n't  forget to update your spreadsheets when doing this . <p> Start the post with a brief- introduction , followed by the question you asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your post , start by creating a short title containing the contributors name with- a link to their website or social media profile , including- a small photo ( optional ) . - See image below for an example of this . <p> The length of your roundup article depends on how many people you 've invited to participate , and of course how many people actually responds as well . <p> Once the deadline is reached and you 've finished putting together your roundup post , and once you 've edited and proof-read it a hundred times over , you 're then ready to hit that publish button . <p> Promoting your post is where the real fun begins . Not only will you be promoting the post , but potentially everyone who has made a contribution to your roundup post will also want to promote it as well . <p> To make sure this happens , construct a short email to let your participants know that your expert roundup post is live for them to read , share or even comment on . You 'll find email templates in the bonus content link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> This one was really interesting to me because I 've yet to conduct any sort of expert roundup post . Loved that you actually went through and showed us exactly what you did , there were ideas here that I would have never of thought of . <p> I especially like the idea of keeping a spreadsheet to keep things organized . That 's one area I definitely need to improve on in all aspects of my business so no doubt I 'm going to end up using that one if I ever do my own expert roundup which you 'll definitely be part of if that time ever comes . <p> Hello James , thanks for dropping by again mate . You know something , I 've been meaning to do an expert roundup for a very long time . I did n't  really know how to start so I just organised myself and went with the flow . It turned out to be quite successful and a great experience for me , as I was able to connect with a lot of folks and even make some new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my end too with everything going on . I do love my creative mess though , but from time to time , I need to untie the knots lol . <p> I think you 'd be great at doing an expert roundup , and it would most definitely serve your audience well too . Love your blog James , your thought process is very interesting and I 'm still overwhelmed with what you 've been able to achieve at such a young age . <p> Fabrizio , thanks so much for including my roundup in your post you 've put together a great primer for anyone wanting to get started with these types of posts . <p> A great way to take these further is to repurpose the content into an infographic and offer another blog the opportunity to host it . I tried this with TweakYourBiz.com and get an extra 30,000+ views &amp; most of the participants shared it the second time . <p> Hey Adam , great to see you here and thanks ! Wow that 's amazing mate , and such a great idea too , I 'll definitely try that one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an eBook as well . <p> You could use a content upgrade style strategy for this . So let 's say you do a group interview on straight up blogging strategies , you could repurpose that into an eBook but add a resources section or something to add value to the ebook so its more than just a repurposed post . <p> Then publish the original post with a content upgrade . Repurpose that into an infographic and link back to your original post , then repurpose the post into a Slideshare presentation with another link back to the original post . <p> The links back to the original would need to be pretty strong calls to action but with the help of influencers &amp; the site you publish the infographic on &amp; Slideshare , it could drive a nice amount of traffic back to the original . <p> Put a targeted popover on the post that is tailored to the content upgrade offering set to exit intent and you could be looking at some pretty sweet conversions .

When it comes call to actions ( CTA ) , i believe it all boils down to testing different formats until you choose a winner . For marketers , crafting a very enticing and attractive call to actions is very necessary in order to grab the attention of our audience . <p> If the call to action is not inviting enough , it will fail to perform its function ( conversion ) . However , if it is well crafted and compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard several times that color also impacts the conversion rate of call to actions . I think that RED generally converts better than other colors . What do you think ? <p> Doing A/B split testing is very important and I think its something that a lot of marketers fail to actually do at all . Ive tested colors and text on my own homepage CTA buttons , testing red against green , and so forth , and found that red actually works best for me . Although green was n't too far behind , but red seems to attract more clicks .

You simply see the page as it would appear to your visitors , only in editing mode . <p> Thrive Content Builder is crammed with tons of cool and useful design elements to help you create the perfect custom page layout and design . <p> Here is a screen grab my websites homepage in edit mode being built using the Thrive Visual Editor plugin . <p> By the way , the editor can be easily collapsed giving you more on-screen space to work around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the tools and elements are located in the right sidebar . <p> This is particularly useful if you are right-handed like most people are . <p> At the top of the editor you have " Save Changes " and " Preview " so you can check on the page you 're working on in real-time . <p> You also have a drop down menu to access page settings and of course to access the built-in landing page and other page templates , which you can load immediately to begin working on . <p> here 's a list of things that 's also included in the editor elements column <p> Undo and redo button <p> View HTML page source <p> Save content as template to use on other pages of your site <p> Revision history , useful for reverting to last changes made to your page <p> If you look closely at the image above , you 'll see at the bottom of the editor you have options to collapse the editor . You can also make changes to the global design settings here . Currently , there are three design settings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with up to 4-columns layout feature grids . These are particularly useful for highlighting key features of your products on sales pages , or services on your websites homepage like I have used below . <p> You can currently add a feature grid with icons or with images . <p> Content toggle Content toggles are great for creating content using minimal space on your web page , keeping your site clean and easy to navigate- around . <p> Each toggle can have its own unique headline , content complete with images , videos , links and more . <p> Table If you need to add a table to your landing page or sales page , its easy with Content Builder . You just drag the element where you want it and begin editing the number of rows and columns you want to add to your table . <p> Data elements These are some very useful elements for adding to your coming soon pages , email opt-in pages or for adding social proof to your opt-in pages .

To me that makes good business sense . <p> If you 're unable to convert your traffic , then you need to think about who your target audience really is . <p> Your website can have all the traffic in the world , but if your bottom line does n't  reflect on this , then you 're doing business the WRONG way . <p> Unless of course you 're not trying to run a business , in which case please forgive me and stop reading this post now . <p> For the majority of us who are trying to build a business with our websites or blogs , the message is very clear here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success by the number of subscribers , leads and sales you are making , not by the number " hits " , page views or what ever other metrics your site is generating . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 <p> Absolutely right , and me too .

And you made a good point on getting the RIGHT kind of traffic to your blog , that will definitely help to increase conversions . <p> I 've worked with peeps that have got so much traffic but their conversions are almost none-existent , its definitely about getting the message to the right kind of people in your niche . <p> Which all comes back to the importance of making those all important connections , and communicating with people . <p> Learning more about the kind of peeps who are visiting our blogs and websites . What they 're searching for , what problems they 're having , what questions they 're asking in the comment section or via email and so forth . <p> Hi Fabrizio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just visits . Many retailers and businesses that spend money on digital marketing know that and live by it . If the marketing campaign does not work they will not continue it . Converisons and sales are what makes them market more . Getting the RIGHT traffic is key over HOW much traffic one gets . Excellent piece Fabrizio . <p> You know something , I 've worked with a good few clients that have had websites with a ton of traffic , but their conversions was something else altogether . So the RIGHT kind of traffic is very important . <p> Amen and amennnn to this one Fabz !

@@76508632 @5208632/ <p> Not so long ago , I published an in-depth review of the Genesis theme framework software , if you want to check that review post out , - just click here . <p> So today I want to review another great little software that complements Genesis very nicely , its called Genesis Design Palette Pro , or GDP for short . <h> What is it ? <p> GDP is a premium quality WordPress plugin designed to help make the process of customizing Genesis child themes a lot easier , so let 's take a closer look . <h> Customizing a Genesis Child theme before the arrival of this plugin <p> Was a complete nightmare . <p> I started using this plugin many years ago now , way back before I was competent enough to understand or even write code . <p> If you 're a Genesis user yourself- and found modifying or customizing your WordPress website a complete nightmare , then you can probably relate to this . <p> Jus doing simple things like trying to change font style , the font size or even the theme color for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours messing about with bits of code in the theme Editor . <p> No one has that kind of time to waste when they could be building their business . <p> Thankfully though this little plugin came along and changed a lot of things for Genesis users . <p> You can now edit quite a few things with your child theme without having to touch a single line of code . <p> So if you 're wondering what kind of problem will this plugin solve for you , its simple . It will save you time and prevent you from going insane trying to add some simple customizations to your site . <p> Yes , - it will work with pretty much all of the current StudioPress child themes available . <p> No , you do n't  need to possess any skills or knowledge in HTML or CSS to use this plugin . <p> No , this plugin will not break any other customization you 've already made to your Genesis child theme . What this plugin does is create a separate CSS file and make the changes in that file only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so let 's now look at the plugin in more detail . <h> 1 . Plugin Installation <p> Installing the Genesis Design Palette Pro plugin is so easy , using the same steps as you would , to install any other plugin into your WordPress website . <p> You can refine any of those changes by clicking on each tab to access more options and settings for different areas of your site , as shown in the image above . <p> If you have the plugin installed already , play around with it for a while and get used to it , before making any key style changes to your site . <p> Top screenshot : Here you can refine some of the changes to the content area of your Genesis powered website . <p> You 'll see that there is a live preview window showing your website in the right column . Any changes you make in the design column- will take effect in real-time in the right column . <p> When you 're happy with the design changes you 've made , you can go ahead and hit the save button , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you could save with your blog customization using this plugin ? Especially when before you 'd have to tediously look for bits of codes to modify in your themes template editor . <p> Top screenshot : In the settings tab you have options for default child theme , preview URL , data export and import which is useful if you wanted to import settings used on another theme . Or , you can export the current settings to use on another site . <p> And let 's say if all your tweaks and mods go haywire , you can simply hit the reset button and remove all of the customizations you 've made and start over . <p> So what exactly can you customize or change using the Genesis Design Palette Pro plugin ? <p> With this plugin installed you can make changes to the following areas within your child theme : <p> Other notable features in this plugin include- the ability to preview on mobile layouts and child theme add-ons . <p> In- the latest version of the GDP plugin , a Freeform CSS box has been added so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> How much does the Genesis Design Palette Pro plugin cost ? <p> As I said this is a premium quality plugin , so its not free . There are currently 3 plans available for this plugin . <p> There is a Basic Plan which gets you 1-year standard support , 1-year worth of upgrades , documentation , import and export capabilities , live preview , and child theme extensions . The single basic license will set you back $49 . <p> There is also a Plus Plan which will set you back $89 and give you 5 site license , all of what 's included in the basic package plus priority email support . <p> Finally , there is a Deluxe Plan which will cost you $199 and give you 50 site licenses , 3 exclusive palettes , and priority email support . <p> Cons - Quite pricey for a plugin of this kind . Would have loved to see an undo and redo feature added , perhaps a few more font style options built-in too . In my opinion , and this is purely my opinion , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when you consider you can pick up the Genesis Extender Plugin for only $39 and do so much more with it . <h> My final verdict ? <p> This is a great all-around plugin and a wonderful addition to have and use with any Genesis child theme . <p> I do recommend it if you 're not confident enough to learn and apply some basic CSS or HTML to customize your WordPress website . Or , you do n't  have thousands of Dollars at your disposal to pay for a professional web designer . And , the GDP plugin is a real time saver too . <p> Price-wise , however , I do think its a pretty steep for what you can actually do with this plugin in all honesty . As an alternative , I would also check out the Genesis Extender . Although some knowledge of CSS is required to use that plugin . <p> All-in-all , the Design Palette Pro plugin is a great little tool .

The video on the NinjaOutreach homepage will show how this is done so please do view it . <p> Once I have my list of prospects , I can then begin constructing my outreach email template , or use one of the ready-made templates provided , to send out to those blog authors , asking them if they would be interested in being featured in- an experts list guest post . <p> It does n't  stop there , I can also- use NinjaOutreach to find suitably targeted guest post friendly blogs to get my guest post published on using the method outlined above . <p> This is just an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , for example you can use it to search for : <p> Guest post friendly posts . <p> Blogs that are hosting giveaways and contests . <p> Blogs that publish product reviews . <p> Blogs that accept sponsored posts and more <h> Advanced Filters <h> So is this for everyone ? <p> Err , yes , but not if you do n't  want to add yet another thing onto your list of things to do <p> However if you 're incorporating outreach into your blogging strategy , and want to save time and resources by being able to quickly and easily search , find and connect with new influencers , businesses and other bloggers , create new relationships in your niche industry , which is pretty much what a lot of bloggers and most businesses are- wanting to do these days , then this is definitely worth your time and money for sure , that 's how I see it . <h> Ninja Outreach Review : Pros And Cons <p> OK so let 's look at- some of the pros and cons of using NinjaOutreach . I 've only been using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explore a lot of the features and do a few more legitimate blogger outreach . Let 's start with the good old pros . <p> Affordable , the bloggers plan for example will only set you back a cool- $19 per month . <p> So how about the cons then ? To be really honest I hate using the- word " cons " , so Ill just call it , some points of minor concern . I could n't really find much fault with NinjaOutreach , however here 's two that might be a slight concern for anyone interested . <p> Relatively new startup , and with anything new , there 's always the trust factor issue . But I 'm pretty confident in this software in general , I 've read many great positive reviews about it already , and know a few other bloggers that Ive connected with myself that are using it . <p> My one other concern with NinjaOutreach is with regards to email spam , emails sent from the software could be flagged up and I think that could cause some issues I do n't  know . I 'm not too sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that once the software has been established a little more , and a lot more people within the industry know about it and are using it , then this might not be so much of an issue . <h> Would I personally recommend this software ? <p> Yes definitely , the biggest selling point of this software for me is how much time you 're going to save using it to do blogger outreach , so- if- you want to save yourself a ton of time researching influencers , getting access to important metrics , connecting with like minded bloggers , freelancers and agencys in your niche , and if you want to do all those things under one roof , then NinjaOutreach- is absolutely recommended . <p> OK so the moment you 've been waiting for peeps , the chance for you to win yourself 1 years worth of Free access with a Small Agency Licence worth $261 . <p> I only have 1 license to give away , so for the lucky winner , here 's what you get with this plan : <p> 2 Users . <p> 1,500 Contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrome extension . <h> How to enter ! <p> This contest is pretty straight forward , to be in with the chance to win , you simply need to leave me a very thoughtful comment below via Google+ , tell me why and how you think this software will be of use and value to you !

@@76508640 @5208640/ <p> I rarely talk about SEO tactics and methods on Magnet4Blogging , largely because I 'm not a huge fan of doing SEO . <p> Regardless , I do appreciate the importance of Search Engine Optimization , because , at the end of the day , search engine traffic is important for any online business or blog to grow and thrive , right ? <p> So in this post , I want to talk about your website and blog post images . Moreover , I want to share with you some very simple ways in which to optimize your images for both performance and Google image search . <p> I 'm sure you 've used Google Image Search to find relevant images for something or another . You simply type in the keyword or phrase and you get rows and rows of images in the search results . <p> Did you know that if you have images that are well optimized for search engines that you can drive traffic to your blog from image search ? <p> Yep , you can , so how do you optimize images for web performance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's find out . <p> Heres what were going to be looking at <p> Naming images properly <p> Optimizing images for speedy loading times and performance <p> Add proper ALT Tags in your images <p> Now let 's take a look at each of these areas in greater detail . <h> Step One Naming images properly <p> How many times have you uploaded images to your website or blog with dumb names like DS980284.png ? <p> One of the problems with uploading images that are n't  properly named is that when you want to use them again in the future , without reuploading them again , its going to be a time-consuming effort searching for them in your media file . <p> A little bit of care and effort , in the beginning , goes a long way so make sure you give your images proper names . <p> Also , its often a good idea to include your SEO keyword in the title of your images . And I do n't  think you should use more than 3 words ( including your keyword ) when naming your images either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image for your website : <p> optimizeblogimage.png <p> Sounds better than just something like IMG1456730.jpg , do n't  you think ? <h> Step Two Optimizing images for speedy loading times <p> How many times have you uploaded images that are HUGE in file size ? <p> One too many times no doubt ? <p> The problem with doing this is that you 're only adding to the page load-time of your blog post or website page . <h> Wrapping things up <p> As you can see , it does n't  take much time or effort at all to optimize or create SEO friendly images for your website . <p> If you 've never optimized a single image on your blog or website , I highly recommend you start doing so . I know this will probably take you some time , but you may benefit greatly from increased search engine traffic in doing so . <p> I hope you found this post useful , the very best of luck .

Alternative text is the text you see when you hover over an image . And image title attribute is more for crawlers , which is why having your keyword in there is important for SEO , without stuffing of course =

@@76508642 @5208642/ <p> In the last post , I shared with you some of the reasons why I decided to ditch Bluehost as my main host for this website . <p> I briefly touched on the process and the outcome of migrating my blog over to SiteGround . If you missed that post you can read it here- at a later date . <p> Recently , I decided to migrate yet another website of mine from Bluehost to my GrowBig shared hosting plan with SiteGround , so in this post , I want to share with you the exact steps that I took to make this move successfully . <p> It was a smooth transition , however , I did run into a spot of bother , but it all worked out well in the end and I 'll explain what happened next . <h> Finally leaving Bluehost behind <p> In May of 2015 , - I decided to leave Bluehost for good . And I 'd heard a lot of great things about SiteGround at the same time that I was shopping around for a more reliable web host provider . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my blogging colleagues were recommending SiteGround web hosting so I decided , hey , why not give them a try . <p> Migrating from Bluehost to SiteGround- for this particular website went very smoothly , without a problem , and the entire process was quite quick and effortless almost . <p> For my niche site JusticeForDadsUK.com , however , whilst it was still a smooth transition , I did run into a few problems . <p> Heres what happened from start to finish . <p> The aim of this post is to help you take the steps of migrating your website from your current host , to SiteGround should you wish to . Here I 'm sharing my experience with you . <h> It begins <p> The first thing that I did was to log into my SiteGround web hosting- account as per normal . From the- Home tab , I clicked on the Supporttab and then clicked on the link to Transfer Website , see image below . <p> I was then greeted with the website transfer form , where I had to carefully fill in the details required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just to make you aware that website transfer is a paid service . <p> Its free if you 're opening a new shared web hosting account with SiteGround for the first time , and as long as your site is under 1GB in size . The transfer fee is normally- $30 per website / cPanel . <p> A few hours later I got an email from one of SiteGrounds tech support staff to say the process was complete , wow I thought , happy days , right ? <p> No not happy days . Not yet anyway . <p> The database I requested to have- moved for the site in question was the wrong one . <p> The- SiteGround team had moved the wrong database to put it simply . <p> I double checked phpMyAdmin to make sure I was n't wrong and to make sure I did n't  make a mistake requesting the wrong site , but everything checked out on my part . <p> So , yep there before my very eyes was the wrong database . I reopened the support ticket and responded to <h> What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the- technical support team to tell them that they had moved the wrong site for me . <p> I clearly stated which database I wanted moving when I filled out the transfer form , the database name is bodyboarwor2 , instead , the database to another site that I did n't  want to- use was transferred . <p> Just to clarify , I have little technical knowledge or experience with hosting or site migrations , I 'm still learning about this area even though I 've worked with WordPress for many years . <p> This was a little bit frustrating for me to say they least . I waited for a response from the- SiteGround team <p> 19 hours later I received a response from a- SiteGround technical team member , it said : <p> Fabrizio I have created a new database called Magnet44Bwor2 in which I have imported bodyboarwor2 See below . <p> Happy days ? ? ? <p> Heck this time yes ! <h> So what 's the point in me sharing this experience with you ? <p> here 's the reason why I wanted to share this story with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was very happy and satisfied with the way SiteGround treated me . <p> Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed very willing to help , so I was happy . <p> So , the next job for me was to migrate the domain name from Bluehost to SiteGround . <h> Migrating domain names from Bluehost to SiteGround <p> To migrate my domain name for the website SiteGround just transferred for me ( JusticeForDadsUK.com ) , I first had to unlock the domain from my Bluehost account , see image below to see how I did this . <p> Then I went back into my SiteGround hosting account and clicked on the Add Servicestab , then scrolled down the page to Order Extras , then clicked on the Domain Transfer button . <p> I then filled in the domain transfer form which is pretty much self-explanatory , but I 'll walk you through the process nevertheless . Here is a screen shot of the form below . <p> Product Information - In here you enter the domain name you want to transfer and select any additional options . <p> Domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the EPP authorization code , and administrative email address . In Bluehost , you can find your EPP code under domains , then select the domain you 're transferring . <p> In the domain information box , you 'll see a tab called transfer EPP , that 's where you will find your EPP code . here 's a screenshot of what mine looked like . <p> Domain Owner Info This is where you place domain owner information such as name and address , email , phone , and country . Its important you keep this information up to date at all times . <p> OK so for me , once I was done filling all the fields in this page , I simply confirmed the terms and hit Submit Order with my payment details . <h> Additional Info <p> If you 're doing this for the first time yourself , the process is n't over yet . <p> You will be sent an email from SiteGround to authorize the domain transfer . When you receive this , open it and click on the approve transfer link within this email . A- page will load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your EPP code again , and simply agree to the terms of transfer . <p> Once submitted you 'll see this follow-up page : <p> I 'd recommend saving the page or printing it for later reference . <p> Additionally , you will need to go back into your Bluehost domain info page to confirm the transfer there too . <h> All done ! <p> The process is complete , transfer usually takes 7 days but I 've found this to happen much sooner . <p> If you log into your SiteGround account and go to My Account , under Domains you 'll see that the the domain transfer is pending . See image below . <h> DNS Change <p> One last thing I want to mention- is that you will probably need to change your domain DNS , as it will still be pointing to the Bluehost server your site was hosted on . <p> If you did n't  move your site ( as shown at the start of this post ) , and you only moved the domain name , then leave this well alone . <h> Wrapping things up <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my WordPress website from Bluehost to SiteGround . I now have both my blog and niche site proudly hosted with SiteGround . <p> Asides from the small but time-consuming error SiteGround made with moving the wrong database ( website ) , the outcome was a positive one in the end . <p> Whilst they never really admitted that they made an error , or even- apologized for the inconvenience caused , they did rectify the problem for me reasonably quickly , so like I said , happy days . <p> I 'm still very happy that I made the decision to move away from Bluehost . I was paying a ridiculous amount of money for a lousy service . <p> I hope you 've enjoyed reading through this post , and seeing the steps I took for successfully migrate my WordPress website from Bluehost to SiteGround . <p> If you found any value in this post , please do share it with your friends and followers on social media , I appreciate you as always . <p> Psst , need help with your website ? - Click here to see how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417

@@76508645 @5208645/ <h> Starting Over After Google Penguin Killed My First Blog ! <p> This is a personal story about how my first and most successful blog ( before this one ) , - was hit hard by Google Panda and eventually Google Penguin , and sadly never recovered , despite working so hard to try and fix as much as I could to regain lost rankings and traffic . <p> Over the last couple of years many bloggers have fallen victim to Googles notorious algorithm updates , Google Panda and then of course Google Penguin . <p> I have n't been so lucky myself , in fact all of my blogs and small content niche websites have been affected by Google penalties to some degree , including sites that had zero backlinks , AND- including what was the sister site to this blog , Magnet4Marketing , which sadly had to be taken offline in March 2014 . <p> Why take the site offline just because it was hit by Google penalties ? <p> Because it was costing me more to keep running than it was actually profiting . Sure I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business stand point , I could n't keep throwing money down the drain . <h> I was n't alone <p> I know that I was n't alone in having to deal with that- situation , - and like many small business owners and bloggers at the time , I was forced to quit a business- I had spent almost 4 years building . <p> At the time , in my quest to repair the damage to my blog , I met- many other great bloggers who were also affected by Google penalties. - In fact I reached out and connected with many of those bloggers over the years , sharing dilemmas , exchanging- tips , strategies and ideas for recovery , exchanging personal stories . <p> I 've heard how some peeps have had to find new jobs because their entire businesses and livelihoods were completely destroyed by Google Penguin overnight . <p> OK so like I said , - in this post- I want to share with you my personal story of how I built a thriving- and profitable blogging business , a blogging business that at a time before Google Panda or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , and almost 25,000 monthly page views , and- how it was all taken away from me in what seemed a single heart beat , from the day- my blog- was hit hard by Google Panda and then eventually Google Penguin , and exactly what I did to try and recover , with no avail . <p> I do n't  wish to depress anyone reading this who is struggling to recover from any Google slaps , but my story does n't  have a happy ending as such . I did n't  win back my rankings and regain my traffic , I was forced to start over or admit defeat and failure . <h> So it begins <p> In July 2012 , my 3 year old blog at the time , Magnet4Markeing , was hit hard by Google Panda and then followed Google Penguin shortly after . <p> Before Google Penguin killed my blog , the site was a bustling place , attracting lots of search engine traffic , particularly from Google of course . I was getting a lot of comments , I was building my audience base- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blog was also making a nice part-time income passively . During 2011 and 2012 this blog- was making between $600 to $1,000 per month . <p> The two years that followed the penalty strikes ( 2012 to 2014 ) , the blog went from seeing almost- 700 unique visitors per day , to seeing just 50 to 70 visits per day ( as of March 2014 , this was- also the month I decided to take the blog offline ) . <p> Organic traffic from Google alone went from 500 plus visitors per day , to just 10 to 20 visitors per day , the image below shows how organic traffic from Google eventually flat-lined over the course of time , I was completely devastated to say the least by this , as I had well over 600 unique articles published on Magnet4Marketing ! <p> After organic traffic from Google virtually disappeared , the only notable traffic the blog was receiving were from referral sources and some direct traffic . <p> The blog- almost completely- stopped generating any income altogether , as I said it was costing me more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Despite every effort made to try and regain lost rankings and recover traffic , even partially , Magnet4Marketing never recovered . <h> Money , time , blood , sweat and tears <p> Like a lot of online businesses that were struggling to regain their status back during that time , I made huge attempts to try and fix my blog the best I could . I did n't  want to see it go to waste , so I started my plan of attack . <p> As it turned out , I was spending a lot of money , wasting a lot of time and valuable resources trying to fix a blog that really was never going to recover , I did n't  know that at the time . <p> In addition to the time and money , I was also seriously putting- my health at risk , sitting in front of the computer for long hours , day after day , night after- night , trying to fix as much as I could ! <h> Trying to fix things ( Google Penguin ) <p> Amongst the ton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better place , here are just some of the things that I invested an enormous- amount of time , energy and money in doing during the last two years ( up until March 2014 ) , to try and recover from Google- Penguin penalties <p> #1 . Improve backlink profile <p> Magnet4Marketings- backlink profile was my first biggest concern , at the time I decided to invest money in online tools to help me better understand my blogs- tarnished backlink profile . <p> As you will see from the image here to the right , the blog- had a considerable amount of what was being classed as " dangerous " and " suspicious " backlinks pointing to it ( according to WebMeUp ) . <p> Now there 's bound to be one or two peeps reading this thinking , well you should have- played by Googles rules and you would n't have ended up in this mess . <p> I can honestly say that my SEO efforts for Magnet4Marketing has always been completely white hat , that 's the darn truth , I never purchased any links , I never got involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong as far as I knew . <p> As for the backlinks , my SEO guy- concluded that most of the crappy links- were the result of some- Negative SEO done on my blog ! Read this article . Probably some jealous competing blogger who could n't cut a bit of competition , so decided to cheat his way to where ever he is now . <p> Seriously folks , negative SEO , because a ton- of the links that were pointing back to this site were from gambling sites , pornography sites , debt and loan- sites etc . I certainly did not build those links to my blog . <p> #2 . Submit link removal requests ( with little to NO success ) <p> Following these startling reports , I used the data analysis that my SEO guy and myself were able to generate through WebMeUp and other various link analysis tools , to request for many of these dangerous links- to be removed by the web masters . <p> But guess what ? <p> Like many website owners and bloggers out there who were also trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where fast . <p> In most cases I received few- to no response at all from website owners . As a result , those dangerous backlinks remained on those sites pointing back to the Magnet4Marketing domain . <p> My last resort was to disavow the suspicious links through Google WebMaster and play the waiting game . ( Unfortunately I did n't  wait around to see the results when Google rolled out Google Penguin 3.0 in October- 2014 , the site was long gone by then as I took it offline and let the domain name expire ) <p> The one strategy that I paid a lot of attention to at the time was of course guest blogging , like many other bloggers was doing I guess . <p> But ! If you 've been in the blogosphere for long enough , you 'll know that earlier this year ( 2014 ) , - Matt Cutts slammed the book down on guest blogging- too . Guest blogging was no longer being considered as a recommended method for building natural backlinks Pffft . What ? <h> Trying to fix more things ( Google Panda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what I should do next , I was so desperate to just wake up one morning to see that everything had been fixed and sorted , it was n't meant to be I guess . <p> Anyway , - whilst I was doing everything that I could to try and recover from Penguin , there was also Panda issues to contend- with . <p> In all honesty , I was never entirely sure whether Panda had affected my blog or not , in any case , - to try and recover from the Google Panda penalties ( assuming my blog was hit ) , I started to look at the site in greater detail , I looked at the content and internal and external link structure and so forth . <p> Here are some of the things that I did to try and fix the site in time for the next significant Panda update , ( which would have been September 2014 , Panda 4.1 ) <p> Removed all thin content and low quality posts and 404d the links . <p> Updated all other posts that I wanted to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Optimised all images by shrinking the files and adding appropriate ALT tags . <p> #4 . Create more quality content <p> Whilst I was making every effort- to fix issues and recover from Panda and Penguin almost at the same time , I also continued on my quest to update the blog regularly , dropping my posting frequency to just 2 blog posts per week to focus more on quality . <p> I also hired experts and other authority bloggers to come in and write articles for the blog . I explored and used other content marketing platforms to help promote and distribute the sites content further , using platforms like YouTube , Vimeo , iTunes ( Podcast ) . <p> I also created some- useful content presentations on SlideShare , curated content on sites like Scoop.it , Paper.li and Pinterest . I even built a thriving group on Facebook and Google Plus and much more . <h> And then some <p> With the help of some of my budding blogging friends , my SEO guy , I tried everything that I possibly could to try and recover from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is one story that does n't  end happily , it might have if only I 'd waited until October 2014 , but truth be told I was exhausted with the site- at this point . <p> Sure there are case studies and other related articles out there that focus more on the core problem , for why a site has been penalised by Google in the first place . I never really got down to the root of the problem , all I knew for sure was- that after those two updates took place , my traffic took a massive downfall . <p> I investigated a little bit and my SEO guy concluded that the penalties were mostly down to the shady backlink profile the site had . <p> Sure there are case studies with a more positive outcome than this one too , but there is no point in me sugar-coating anything here . After working so darn- hard for over 3 years on building my blogging business , Google destroyed it all with just a few tweaks made in its algorithm , here 's what Ive concluded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been hit by Google penalties , and if you genuinely believe that you 've done all you can- to try and recover your blog from Penguin , Panda or what ever else there is , if you 've done everything and there is still no sign of recovery for you , even after the latest Penguin and Panda refreshes , here 's my advice to you ! <p> Unless you have a massive pile of money available to pay for a professional SEO company to fix your blog for you , if you do n't  , then do n't  bother wasting any more of your time working on a dead end blog , really do n't  bother . <p> I know its hard to digest this piece of advice but seriously , its never too late to start over in my opinion . <p> Sometimes you need to know when to quit on something that is n't working and move on . It took me a while to figure that one out but looking back now , I 'm glad that I did . <p> I 'm not telling you to quit trying to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUIT full stop ! I 'm simply advising you , from my personal experience , that its far better to start fresh than to kill yourself trying to fix something that is permanently- damaged . <p> Once again , if you feel you 've done absolutely everything in your power to try and recover your site , and you have n't succeeded , then think about your next move carefully , before you continue driving yourself into the ground . <p> You can still succeed with a fresh start , this blog ( Magnet4Blogging ) is almost a year old now , and with the experience and knowledge that I gained from running my first blog , I 'm making a lot more progress and finding success faster than I did the first time around , I 'm not making the same mistakes over . <p> Do n't  get me wrong , I fully appreciate- just how much work goes into building a profitable blog or online business from scratch , and its so heart breaking to see it all go down the drain and having to give up on it . <p> But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done everything by the book , you think Google gives a flying rats backside ? <p> So with all that being said , there are some huge opportunities waiting for you by starting over . <p> You are starting over as a more experienced and more knowledgeable blogger than when you were when you first started out . <p> You are starting over more consciously aware of the things that you should be doing , and the things that you shouldnt be doing ( like solely relying on Google for traffic and business ) . <p> Sure its going to take a long old time to build a credible blog like you had before from the ground up , but but its not too late . In my opinion , its only too late when you do nothing about it . <p> Sorry , let me quote that for you <p> Its only too late when you do nothing about it <h> Lessons learned by starting over <p> I could write an entire 2,000 word post about the mistakes Ive made and the things Ive learned from starting over almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March 2015 ) , but perhaps the biggest lesson for me is that Ive learned- not to place all my eggs in one basket By this I mean not to solely rely on Google or SEO , or one source alone for traffic , especially when there are countless of other more reliable traffic sources to tap into . <p> What ever decision you make , I wish you the very best of luck , I hope my story has resonated with you in some way . <p> Leave me a comment <p> If you enjoyed reading this post and you have- something to say or want to share with me , please- leave me a comment on the following social media posts : - Twitter or- Google+ 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417

I come up with a plan to improve my personal brand and blog for the new year . This year was more about making my blog cohesive within itself and with my social media profile . <p> Ill have to keep those tools you recommend in mind . I already use Evernote , but I never heard of the other tools . For now , I use evernote to just down ideas for future posts as well as taking notes whenever I go to a training for my job . <p> Hey Sherman , you 're not alone my friend . In fact I was just looking at my game plan for 2016 that I set myself way back in January . There 's only a few things on there that Ive actually only been able to focus on . <p> You 'll love some of those tools , Evernote has been an absolute life-saving tool , the other apps are great especially if you are juggling multiple clients and what not . <p> Yes could n't agree more , the more you know about your targeted audience the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal brand business , so the more great things you can do for someone the better right ? <p> One of your points about being consistent is what I find to be very important . It is indeed very important . But I have doubt . <p> Like I 'm a newbie blogger and when I try to come up with content ideas and working titles , it takes a whole of time . Also when you start , you struggle alot to bring traffic to your blog . It is said to update your contents and publish new posts on a regular basis . But that is the very thing when you want to provide your readers with great quality and you 're a beginner how the hell will you be able to publish posts on a regualr basis as it takes a lot of time to create content as well as images and infographs.dude everything . <p> OK so I know how you feel . When you 're starting out with a blog and want to add more quality content , being consistent can be challenging at first . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brains for content ideas . If you 've picked a niche you 're passionate about Tarun , finding topics and content ideas should n't be too hard , but I know it still takes time right ? <p> I used to publish a post every day and yes , this did help me boost traffic quickly . But at the same time it is very exhaustive work both for the blogger and the readers having to keep checking back to read fresh content all of the time . <p> Sometimes with publishing content too often , quality can be sacrificed . I would recommend writing 2 or 3 high quality posts each week at the most , even to a new blogger . If you can do less than that even better in my expereince . <p> I now post every 7 to 10 days depending on how much time I have to write , and Ive seen no change in traffic fluctuation to be honest . Old posts still gets good traffic and new posts takes time to build traffic . <p> Focus more on quality and value , and diversify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , podcasts etc . <p> You do n't  need to publish a new post every single day to be consistent . Publishing every few days will give you the chance to promote a piece of content properly and get the readers , comments and social shares it deserves , before writing the next one . <p> Using a quality content planner or editorial calendar can help you utilize your time more effectively when creating content , even as a beginner . In fact I 'm launching a new Blog Planner this week for bloggers . Its a collection of templates to help them manage and grow their blogs in 2017 . <p> The journey to discovering the process of creating one piece of content , for one person , with one problem/need/want/desire is the key to creating the kind of viral content that can catapult ones business . <p> On Dec. 22nd , I created a post with an infographic that is exploding titled " The Ultimate SEO Google Hack to Increasing Organic Traffic and Conversions " It outlines what Google is looking for in their own words and the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same framework others before self and specificity . <p> Hi Fabrizio Nice video and tools are pretty awesome . As the year has already started and I had developed my plan to make the most of it but after reading your post I can improve it further . This is called delivering value with your contents and you really did it . Many thanks for the share . Happy New Year

Even if I know you very well through my blog , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please click here . <p> OK so I spent the last few days replacing some of the list building elements on my blog that I talked about in my last list building post , such as the HelloBar ribbon , yep that 's now gone . <p> I 've also got rid of the default email web form in my side-bar and the web form post footer opt-in . <p> I replaced all of these with the new customised forms which Ive created using Thrive Leads plugin , so let 's dive in to see what this plugin can do for you- and your online business . <h> Built-in- Features <p> #1 . Design and publish - Thrive Leads contains all the email opt-in templates you 'll ever need to get started . In addition , these templates can be fully customised further using the same point , drag-and-drop editing technology found in the Thrive content builder plugin. - You can literally- create and design professional and branded opt-in forms to place almost anywhere on your site <p> Well talk more about the opt-in form styles available and where they can be placed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful feature within Thrive Leads . You can increase your conversions dramatically simply by displaying targeted opt-in offers for your blog visitors . This can be based on type of blog posts , pages , categories , tags and more . <p> Currently I have specific and targeted opt-in forms for several pillar articles on my site , which are all converting very well . <p> #3 . A/B testing engine - Thrive Leads enables you to create lead groups , in addition to this you can also create multiple versions of a form so that you can perform simple but highly effective A/B testing . <p> This is hugely important and beneficial for optimising and increasing your conversions , and if you 're an A/B testing freak like myself , you 're going to love this feature . See image below . <p> Images above : Overview of your forms performance . Create as many forms as you want and perform A/B testing to see which form is converting the most for you . Edit , clone , reset stats and archive your forms . <p> #4 . New : Multi-choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form features . That means you can do things like create a pop-up that presents a Yes/No choice , with each choice leading to a different offer . Click here to check out the video . <p> #5 . New : SmartLinks Feature SmartLinks is another newly added feature to Thrive Leads . It enables you to create multi-states for none-subscribers and already subscribed users . You can learn more about this in a recent post I published here . <p> #6 . New : Asset Delivery Feature The new built-in asset delivery feature allows you to send download links to new subscribers , this is an awesome and powerful feature for bloggers looking to create content upgrades on their blog posts . It takes away all of the hassle and work of having to create new lists inside of your email service provider . <p> #7 . Reporting and insights tools - The metrics tools gives you an overview of how your opt-in forms are performing for each group . Over time you can use this information to fine tune your list building efforts by- seeing exactly where your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Create groups of forms and test the types of forms against each other , you can further edit these forms using the content editor , and use advanced targeting tools . <h> One single plugin , multiple ways to generate leads <p> So having used this plugin for almost 10 months now ( updated post ) , I can honestly say that this plugin is all you need to create multiple ways to generate leads , so if you 're using various other plugins to help you generate more leads , you really do n't  need to with Thrive Leads installed on your blog . <p> here 's a list of the types of ways you can create leads- with this one single plugin . There are multiple design templates for each form type- on the list below , and again each of these forms can be fully customised using the built-in- editor , you can really create the perfect form for your site . See image below of my sidebar form in edit mode . <p> Types of lead forms you can create using Thrive Leads <p> Sticky Ribbon ( Appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sidebar ) <p> Post footer <p> Slide In ( Slides in at bottom of page ) <p> In content <p> Screen filler lightbox ( Takes up entire screen real-estate ) <p> PHP Insert <p> Scroll Mat ( Appears first on a page and disappears as your scroll down ) <p> A wide range of pre-design form templates to choose from , plus each of these can be customised further . Or build your own form completely from scratch ! <p> All of the forms have their own unique settings giving you complete control over how each form behaves on your WordPress site . <h> Easy integration with your favourite email service provider <p> If you use a provider that enables you to create HTML forms , this plugin should work perfectly fine . <p> The team over at Thrive says that the- plugin will allow you to easily integrate your autoresponder- code into any of the forms listed below . <p> I use MailChimp and integration works seamlessly with this provider , others include : <p> Aweber <p> GetResponse <p> iContact <p> SendInBlue <p> OntraPort <p> InfusionSoft <p> Campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also integrate your provider using both HTML code or API . <h> Price and availability <p> The Thrive Leads plugin is currently set at $97 for an unlimited sites license , so those are the sites you own and run . <p> You can also purchase a single site license for just $67 . In addition to these plans there is the Agency license which will set you back $588 per year . However with the Agency license you get full access to all of the Thrive products . <p> For a plugin of this kind with this many features and built-in- tools , I 'd say its reasonably well priced . Especially when you compare it to a service like LeadPages , that charges you a monthly subscription fee to have most of the key features that is found in the Thrive Leads plugin , I say most here , not all . <h> Pros And Cons <p> OK so we 've looked at most of the key features and the tools this plugin has to offer the avid list builder , let me walk you through some of the pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So what about the cons ? Well it was extremely difficult to find any flaws with this plugin to be really honest , maybe one if I had to be really , really critical . <p> Cons <p> 1 . Only available for WordPress , if that is even a con. 2 . You can only create opt-in forms and not landing pages , though landing pages are available with Thrive Visual Editor . <h> Conclusion <p> So final thoughts rather than conclusion , because I 've used all of the Thrive products released to date , and I came to the conclusion a good while back that Thrive simply produce some of the best- conversion focused products for WordPress , period . <p> If you 've used the content builder plugin , the landing pages templates , any of the Thrive themes , you 'll fully appreciate just what I 'm saying here . <p> This plugin is simply a piece of art , it is so powerful , feature packed , affordable , simple to install , integrate and use . Its simply all you need , along with using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list building efforts to the next level . <p> Once again , I 'm big on list building if you 've not already guessed by now , and I would absolutely recommend checking this plugin out for yourself , especially if you 're a blogger or business owner using WordPress , and you 're serious about building your list quickly and effectively too . <p> I 'm going to leave you with this short overview , review , insight video that I created for the Thrive Leads plugin , you can see first hand how powerful some of the tools are . Ill just say that the video is a few months old now since last updating this post , but the key elements and usability has n't  changed at all . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> So I wanted to read about this and thank you for sharing this by the way . <p> I went in search some time ago for a plugin to help me with my opt-in boxes and I tested out Hybrid Connect and OptInMonster . What I was after was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts . I was n't necessarily looking for yet another opt-in box though , I was going to create an image and when they clicked on that it would take them to a pop-up opt-in box to sign up for my list . <p> My problem was that I like to ask for the name , email &amp; phone number . Hybrid Connect does n't  allow you to add those and OptInMonsters was a nightmare . Support really tried to help me but it just never worked . <p> I 'm still searching so will this plugin do that do you know ? I do n't  mind buying it and testing it out but if I know up front it wo n't then I wont waste anyones time . I would like to create my own opt-in boxes though and have them a lot more attractive . I like the metrics they provide as well . <p> Okay , enough about all of that and I 'll check back to see if you 've responded . Thanks Fabrizio for your honest review and I 'm excited about the direction you 're headed . <p> Hi Adrienne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most amazing lead generation plugin on earth = <p> I 've never tried OptinMonster , sounds like the beast ha ha = <p> Anyway , to address your question , that really depends on who you use as your email service provider . The Thrive Leads plugin will configure any provider as long as you can create HTML forms in your email provider . <p> I use MailChimp and all I had to do to add a phone number was to create a new field in my list , regenerate the HTML , embed it into my Thrive form and hey presto . If you look at the footer opt-in form above now , it has a new field for telephone . I 've done this to show you . When you reply to this comment I 'll remove the field . <p> So it really depends on who your email service provider is and whether you can create custom fields with them , such as add a number . If you like , you can send me your HTML code you use for your opt-in forms and I 'll test it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my current opt-ins I obviously use a service that provides this . The problem with OptInMonster was that it did n't  read javascript so all of that had to be taken out . Support went through what to do but their explanation obviously was n't clear to me because I did everything they said and it just did n't  work . So I 'm thinking that was n't compatible for what I was wanting or I 'm just an idiot and could n't get it to work . I currently use Aweber but am thinking of switching to another platform . I thought they all used HTML coding , I know this new one will as well . <p> The other question I had was if I have them click on an image can I get a small pop-up box to appear in order for them to opt-in ? Just trying new things on my blog so this was something I 've really wanted to use . Right now I have a landing page they go to but I prefer them staying on my blog while going through this process . <p> Thanks again Fabrizio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited again . <p> Hi Adrienne , of course silly me , yes you already have existing numbers so your provider can do this . To answer your question whether you can create a clickable image , I 'll look into it and get back to you . I know you can create a 2-step opt-in where visitors click on a link or button and a pop-up opt-in form will appear on the same page , but I 'm not sure about a clickable image . Ill look into it . =

@@76508649 @5208649/ <h> Appreciating the importance of on-page SEO <p> I appreciate- the importance of- doing keyword research and other essential on-page stuff . <p> Whether we- like it or not , we just cant ignore the fact that good quality and relevant search engine traffic is vital . <p> Vital for any- blog or online business to be successful at least , right ? <p> You can deny it all you want , - because if youre- getting most of your blog traffic- from Google and other search engines . Youd better be sure that you 're making the most of converting as many of those visitors , into either subscribers- or buyers right ? <p> OK so let 's get back to using Long Tail Pro . <p> When it comes to doing keyword research and analysis , but- more specifically , finding blog post topics to write about , I just love , love , love using Long Tail Pro . <p> Its so simple to use , it has a ton of cool features and I think every serious blogger or marketer should have it in their marketing toolbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to share with you 6 very simple steps that I take- for finding relevant , low competition- keywords to target for my blog posts , using Long Tail Pro . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Thanks for the quick tutorial . I bought LongTailPro ages ago before it became a subscription service . It still works OK and still gets updates . <p> I 'm not fond of keyword research I find it can become quite boring . But I reckon LTP is as good as any other tool . That said , I found a keyword last year that looked like it was rankable ( I just ran it again with your criteria above ) but I 'm still waiting for Google to put it on page one ! I guess we have to be patient sometimes = <p> I did exactly what you did mate , I purchased Long Tail Pro a few years ago now , and it still works perfectly . Still get regular updates which is great . <p> I 'm not an avid fan of keyword research either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find fruitful keywords for my parenting niche site , and for researching keywords for content on this site too . Some have paid off , whilst others I 'm still waiting to see what happens with . <p> Fabrizio , I bought the LTP last year and it has been gathering dust due to me thinking that keyword research is not as important as I think it is . At the end of the day , we should write for people and not search engines . However , this is wrong . If my articles are not searchable and people cant find them on Google , how can I expect to get traffic and hence more engagement . A carefully selected keyword can help to rank better and hence more visibility of your work . <p> I think I should start to use it and try to get some results from it . Thanks for a nudge : ) ) cheers . <p> Glad you stopped by , I have a similar outlook towards keyword research . Although I love to write for people and mainly my audience , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use search engines to find information that is relevant to them , therefore if I can optimize a few of my posts for the target phrase or keyword , I can help them find the content they need easily . <p> I get asked a lot should I write for people or search engines . I say do both , optimize for search , but write your content in a human friendly , readable way .

@@76508651 @5208651/ <h> How To Provide Incredible Value To Your Blog Readers Consistently <p> Hey peeps , youve probably heard by now that one of the most obvious- ways to succeed with your blog is to provide incredible value. - Incredible- value meaning providing exceptionally- useful content , going above and beyond , creating- content- that your blog readers are going to love reading and keep coming back for more of in the future ! - After all , content is King right ? - So Bill Gates and just about everybody else agrees on these days . <p> Yes content is king , but not any old content . <p> Quality content is King , that 's if you actually believe that content is truly king in the first instance , do I ? Hmm I 'll leave you guessing on that one . <p> No it does n't  , so below I 've compiled for you 6 powerful ways in which you can provide incredible value to your blog readers , so let 's dive straight into todays content . <h> #1 . Help Your Readers- Solve Problems <p> This is the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help your readers- with their problems , what ever that may be . <p> OK that 's probably a lot easier to suggest than to actually do . <p> But the majority of people- that come to your blog for the first time are there for one thing only , and that 's not to shake your hands or to get to know you better , sorry to be the barer of bad news here , but they 're on your blog to find answers to their problems . <p> So that being said , you have to create problem solving content for your readers as often as possible , you have to be a problem solving blogger . So next time you sit at your computer ready to bash out your next epic blog post , just ask yourself this ; <p> " How is this post Im about to construct going to benefit my readers ? " . <p> If you 're creating problem solving content already , that 's great , but is it working ? If you 're not sure , you need to investigate this further . <p> So how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not ? <p> There are two ways to do this , the first method is to engage with your readers , find out what it is they need help with. - You can do this by simply asking ! Or by going a step further and- adding an ask feature or question and answer series to your blog posts . <p> This really works , I 've only just started doing this myself with Ask Fabrizio Q&amp;A series , already I have a few questions which people have emailed in wanting answers for . <p> But seriously , you need to have a connection with your community to understand their needs better , you simply can not guess and write . <p> The second method is to look at your metrics ( Google Analytics or what ever you 're using these days ) . - See what pages within your blog your visitors are landing on , see where they 're coming from and whether they stay long enough to appreciate your content or not . <p> This process takes time I know , its not a quick process , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better you can cater for them and help them find answers to their problems . <p> Study the comments section of your blog posts . If you 're replying to most comments as you should be , you should have a reasonably good understanding of your audiences needs , just by reading the comments folks are leaving , types of questions they 're asking , or problems they 're having . <p> A great tool I love to use in addition to Google Analytics is Clicky realtime analytics . You can learn more about this tool here- ( aff ) . Ive been using Clicky for about a month now , but the metrics are amazing , the premium package offers heat-maps , you can track every single visitor and every action they take on your blog and a lot more , really worth taking a look ? <p> People can relate to real facts , plots , methods , strategies , case studies that they can see is working for somebody or not ! <p> Its often too easy to create content that tells people what they should be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of crap on practically any other blog out there , they do n't  want to be told , they want to be shown , so let them see for themselves . <p> So how do you become transparent in blogging ? <p> Its simple , be honest and show your audience what 's working for you and your blog or online business , and show them what 's not working too ! <p> Its not always about writing how successful you are , people will appreciate your honesty and maybe even relate to your failures too . Theyll feel more comfortable in maybe sharing with you their own stories of success and failures as well . <p> Share or incorporate personal stories that your readers can relate to in your blog posts . <h> #3. - Use Other Platforms To Distribute Your Value <p> When it comes to creating amazing high-value content , it does n't  mean you should just resort to creating blog posts and use nothing else . <p> I see a lot of bloggers sticking to good old fashioned blog posts , often bashing out 4,000 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well , but its pretty boring if you ask me <p> Your high-value- content- should- come in all types of mediums , I personally love to use slide presentations , videos and eBooks myself , but there are plenty of other platforms you can be utilising- to distribute your content on , both online and offline . <p> I simply love how Jon Loomer over at JonLoomer.com provides an audio version of his post , to accompany each and every blog post on his blog . I think that 's a fantastic idea and one which I 'm seriously thinking about doing myself in the future . <p> The internet is a vast space , - so make use of effective content marketing tools- and platforms to help you create impeccable value , and drive visitors to your blog , where theyll find even more value , subscribe to your blog and become regular visitors . <h> #4 . Just Be There <p> If you do nothing else I 've shared with you in this post , just do one thing for me . Be there for your community . <p> Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and readers blah , blah , blah , but they themselves are often far from being anywhere near practicing what they preach . <p> I can name you half a dozen bloggers I know that get a ton of comments on their blogs , yet they 're nowhere to be seen amongst the comment section themselves . I see questions left unanswered , its not good practice in my opinion , although its an opportunity for other commentators to give answers and add value . <p> If you 're going create value for your blog community , that also means putting yourself in front of your audience and being there for them too . Being ready to answer their questions , being there to help them solve what ever problems they might have , even if you cant solve all their problems , you just have to show them that YOU ARE HERE FOR THEM ! Like I am here for YOU . <h> #5 . Reach Out ! <p> How often do you reach out to a member in your community to ask how they 're finding things on your blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing them . Or to simply ask them if there 's anything you can help them out with ? <p> Probably not that often right ? <p> When someone new comes to my blog and leaves a compelling- comment , I 'll almost always head over to their blog to see what they have to offer , if I like it , I 'll read a post and add a comment . <p> In addition , I 'll occasionally- also reach out to them via email , get to know them a bit better , thank them for commenting on my blog , and tell them if there 's anything that I can do to help them with their blogs or online ventures , they can just get in touch with me . <p> When someone new signs up to my email newsletter even , I 'll do the exact same thing , get in touch via email to introduce myself and ask if I can be of assistance , not always though , but just now and again . <p> I do n't  ever want to give the impression that when someone- signs up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another boring email list and get some free eBooks in the process . I want them to feel as if they 've signed up to become part of a great community , and to gain valuable knowledge that will help them with their blogging business . <p> Creating value for people on your blog does n't  just mean giving them all the good stuff for free , like content , eBooks and services etc ! It also means being a valuable person That 's YOU , you 're that valuable person . <p> It means being somebody that folks in your community can come to when they really need you , someone they can depend on , rely on no matter what ! Do you not agree ? <h> #6 . Be Everywhere ( Blog Commenting , guest blogging ) <p> Lastly , providing value is n't just restricted to your blog or the platforms that you use to distribute content with , you can also provide value on other blogs , in the form of blog commenting and guest blogging <p> I have started to put a lot more emphasis and thought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect with a lot of new people in my niche , as well as helping me to drive traffic AND grow my blog community . <p> I had the immense pleasure of connecting with Sylviane Nuccio from SylvianeNuccio.com- here on my blog for the first time a few days ago . She left a great comment , and in that comment one of the things she wrote about was : <p> " The reason that I 'm here is because I 've seen you everywhere lately , on blogs other than mine , that is " <p> Shes right , I 've been commenting on a few extra " great blogs " as of late , and trying my best to add some value to conversations over on those blogs , in the process I got to make some new friends . That 's the power of blog commenting ! <p> OK , enough ranting from me , let 's do a quick recap . <p> To create value consistently for your blog community , you need to : <p> Help your readers solve problems , or at least try to help them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You need to be honest and transparent with a lot of things you share on your blog , whether its a review or a case study or income report , transparency works . <p> You need to ensure you 're using all available platforms to help you distribute your valuable content- to your audience , not just your blog . <p> You need to just be there for your community , always . <p> You need to occasionally- reach out to people in your community , tell them , show them you 're willing to help them if they ever need you . <p> You need to be seen providing value not just on your blog , but other blogs and their communities as well , through smart blog commenting and guest blogging . <p> So folks that 's all I have for you this week , I do hope you 've enjoyed reading this post and that its motivated you in some way to get out there and create even MORE value on your blog , and on other blogs , and through various content platforms , and through blog commenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen as someone that provides great value and resource in your community , you 're going to win and be successful with your blog . <p> Please do leave me a comment below , I 'd love it if you could add value to this post by sharing your own tips , thoughts and ideas for creating value for your blog , what is working for you ? Do share <h> Happy Christmas To All My Readers ! <p> Just a quick note before I sign off This is the last post I 'll be publishing this side of Christmas . I want to wish you all a very Merry Christmas from me and Team Van Marciano here in wet and windy England , the next blog post will be on the 29th of December , and that will of course be my personal review of Maxwell Iveys , The Blind Bloggers- eBook , " Leading You Out Of The Darkness Into The Light " , keep an eye out for that one . <p> All the best and enjoy the festive celebrations , I appreciate you all . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417

@@76508654 @5208654/ <p> I hate to remind you folks , but the new prospective year is just 8 weeks or so away ! Goodness , where has 2014 gone ? <p> Yep , 2015 is fast approaching , and I bet you have n't even thought about planning your blog strategy , or thought about your goals and objectives , or even- thought about- what projects you 'll be undertaking- in the new year . <p> I know what you 're thinking , you have plenty of time to do this . Really ! - Do you ? Hmm I 'm not so sure , and if you 're thinking of waiting until January to start planning , can I ask why ? <p> I 've already begun planning for 2015 myself , I 've not planned everything of course , but I 've made a pretty good start . <p> Anyway- I thought I 'd write a post sharing with you some of- my own blogging- strategies , goals and objectives for- Magnet4Blogging for 2015 , so if youre- reading this , hopefully you 'll be- inspired to start thinking about your own plans for your blog , before 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also going to share with you some tips on how to plan ahead , and recommend some tools that you can use to help you plan your blog strategy for the new year , and also some recommended further reading to really fire you up . <p> OK so grab your favourite beverage ( I 'm currently hooked on Peppermint tea ) , and let 's get planning for 2015 ! <h> My 2015 Blogging Strategy <p> #1 . Blogging <p> 2014 was a darn good year , and as far as creating content went , I more or less stuck with- writing 2 to 3 posts per week . My aim for creating blog content is to either continue writing the same amounts of posts , or drop the frequency down to 1 amazing post per week . I 'm sure I 'll make a decision by January 2015 . <p> If I aim to write 3 blog posts per week , usually 1 of those posts will be a MVP ( massive value posts ) , and can take up most of my time to put together , as they 're usually anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm considering dropping the frequency to 1 post per week . <p> I am also- looking to hire someone at some stage- in the early part of 2015 to assist me with content creation , probably around the end of March time. - If anyone reading this is genuinely interested in becoming a paid writer for Magnet4Blogging in the new year , please do get in touch with me- with your details . <p> Committing to writing frequency <p> I wont commit myself to writing anymore than the prescribed number of posts outlined above , reason being is that I do n't  want to exhaust all of my resources too quickly , or- worst still , end up sacrificing quality for quantity . Writing a post daily is just not practical for me neither at the moment , especially with having other commitments going outside of blogging . <p> Back in June ( 2014 ) - I made some tweaks to optimise my blog the best I could to increase my email opt-in rate . I started this blog in March remember , and with already 800 email subscribers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however I deleted almost 700 emails from the list , so currently I have just over 130 subscribers , 30 additional new subscribers gained this year , not great by all counts , but its a start . <p> I will continue to make list building one of my top priorities in 2015 , and my goal is to reach 600 subscribers by the end of the year . <p> I 'm also quite active on a couple of blog network sites , mainly BizSugar and JustRetweet as they are my two favourite places for connecting with other bloggers and creating new relationships . <p> Triberr is still fairly fresh to me , but is proving to be a valuable source of traffic , readers and engagement . <p> I am putting together a new plan of action based on an idea that will hopefully help me get more people flocking to this blog , and help me connect with more people as well , I 'll reveal more about this closer to the time . <p> If you 're reading this for the first time and you 're not yet signed up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll get my awesome 36-page eBook the Smarter Blogging guide , plus I do my very best to provide you with useful content always , content that will help you with your blog ! I look forward to connecting with you = <p> So what 's your plan of action for building your tribe and increasing engagement on your blog in 2015 ? <p> #3 . Blog Marketing And Promotion <p> Content marketing has been at the forefront of my blog promotion strategy throughout 2014 , and I 'll continue to focus on content marketing to promote my blog in 2015 . The three areas , or types of content that I 'll be concerning myself with the most will be : <p> YouTube and creating video content <p> Creating Slide presentations and PDFs ( SlideShare ) <p> Kick starting a new podcast for Magnet4Blogging <p> Creating custom infographics <p> I 've not mentioned guest blogging because it wont be something I 'll be doing much of in 2015 if at all. - Perhaps I 'll write the odd 1 or 2 posts to help me promote my brand and get some fresh eyeballs on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more focused on using other platforms , as mentioned above , to distribute and promote content . <p> Here are some numbers for you . By the end of 2015 I hope to have reached the following : <p> Published 50 YouTube videos in total , I currently have about 8 videos on my channel . <p> Published 50 pieces of content on SlideShare , currently I have 4 pieces of content on SlideShare <p> Facebook engagement has increased notably over the last few months alone for Magnet4Blogging , and I 'm getting a little more traffic from Facebook than I did at the start of 2014 . <p> Currently my Facebook posts reach on average 1.5% of my total Facebook fans Pretty poor show I know , however its up from the previous month by a whole 1% , so its a step in the right direction I think . <p> In addition to building my Facebook audience , I 'll also continue to promote my content and grow my followers on two other main social platforms , Twitter and Google+ . <p> Ill still make very good use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont be spending too much time engaging- on those sites- as they 're not really effective for me right now . In any case I 'm still learning about Pinterest . <p> So what are your social media goals and objectives for 2015 ? Leave me a comment below . <p> #5 . SEO <p> Believe it or not , around 70% of my blog posts are n't  search engine optimised ! I kind of half-heartedly gave up on SEO back at the start of 2014 , so I wont be going into 2015 with many SEO goals or objectives in mind . <p> I do use the WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin , but most of the time I do n't  make the most of this plugin . Regardless of my lack of enthusiasm for on-site SEO , Google ( organic ) still remains to be my blogs top traffic source , however I do n't  want that to be the case in 2015 , especially with my previous experience of putting all my eggs in one basket Read this post . <p> As far as building backlinks and traffic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable sources , and more over , to turn- YouTube into one of my blogs main- traffic sources . <p> This will take some work I am aware of that , as YouTube is currently locked in at number 13 for traffic sources to my blog , but as I mentioned above in my content marketing and promotion strategy , I 'll be using YouTube and video content a lot more to promote my blog . <p> Are you focusing all your efforts on SEO to drive traffic to your blog in 2015 , or are you aiming to drive traffic from other sources ? <p> #6 . Projects <p> Back in September I released a revised edition of my Smarter Blogging eBook , so far that eBook has been downloaded over 400 times ( in total ) . <p> I also have plans to revise my paid eBook , Creating Smarter eBooks in early 2015 . Since its release in March 2014 , I 've sold only 13 copies . With a new revised edition , I plan to properly market and promote the eBook as I should have done when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those two eBooks , I 'm also working on a brand new eBook altogether , and one that I hope to be able t sell through the Amazon marketplace . I 'm anticipating April or May for a possible launch date , however nothing is set in stone just yet . I will reveal more details closer to the date . <p> Do you have any blog project goals for 2015 ? Are you working on anything new ? Of course you do n't  have to share specific details , but let me know whether you are or not ! <p> #7 . Income <p> Magnet4Blogging was launched in March 2014 , previously to focusing on this blog I was writing for another popular blog called Magnet4Marketing ( now dead ) . <p> Of course I 've not been focusing my efforts on blog monetisation much for this blog , although I 've been writing quite a few product reviews as of late , and they in-turn have helped to generate some income , however I 've not properly focused on making any substantial income- from this particular blog . <p> So will I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months I 've been playing around with various- monetization methods for Magnet4Blogging , testing the water if you will . I 've even been playing around with Google AdSense , - however , most of the income from this blog- has so far been created through affiliate marketing , and from creating online reviews . <p> In 2015 I 'll continue to add a lot more reviews to the site , I 'm aiming to write 1 great review per month , that should be 12 reviews by the end of 2015 , in addition to the reviews I 've already published . <p> The other idea that I have for monetisation in 2015 is to provide- WordPress services , specifically custom WordPress website design , but there 's a lot of thought and preparation needed- before making this a reality . <p> What about you , are you currently receiving an income from your blog ? What are your plans for making money , or making more money from blogging in 2015 ? <p> #8 . Self-improvement and learning new skills , moving on from mistakes made <p> I 've said this before and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops . I 've learned so much in 2014 and some of the things Ive learned I 've put into good practice . <p> I aim to read a lot more eBooks in 2015 , especially ones that will help me improve my- social media efforts , Pinterest marketing and video marketing , in fact I have some great eBooks to read over the Christmas holidays , I 'm looking forward to it . <p> Conclusion <p> So those are my plans , my goals and objectives , my aims for 2015 for this blog . Now that I have what I want to achieve written down , its time for me to get organised and begin filling my diary with targets and deadlines . It is a small mass of mess reading it like this , but at least now I can begin prioritising what 's important for my plan of action . <p> Final words <p> My final words for you all is ? <p> Do n't  wait until January to start planning your blog strategy , do it now , get yourself in the right frame of mind , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor running ! <p> Now I bet you thought this post was over right ?

Write everything down Your plans , aims , goals , objectives , projects and what ever else is on your mind should n't be left to roll around in your head .

@@76508655 @5208655/ <h> 10 Tips For Using Amazon Affiliate Links In Your Blog Posts <p> Promoting Amazon products on your blog is a great and exciting way to monetize your blog . <p> I know there are some bloggers that do n't  like using Amazon links on their blogs for unknown reasons , however , I 've been monetizing this website with Amazon links successfully since 2013 . <p> Admittedly I do n't  earn a huge fortune from the- Amazon- Affiliates Program , each month I might see earnings ranging from just- $10 to $100 , but I guess every penny counts right ? <p> Whilst I appreciate there is a wide range of quality products on Amazon that you can promote on your blog , there are a few things you need to bare in mind before you start adding affiliate links to your blog posts or pages , especially if you 've never promoted a single Amazon product before . <h> When is it a good time to monetize with Amazon ? <p> A lot of factors can be taken into consideration before deciding to monetize a blog in any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche type etc . <p> However , I guess the short answer would be you can monetise anytime . <p> In fact , I would n't really recommend having any Amazon links on the homepage of your blog , unless its a specific niche site of some sort . <p> The best places to use Amazon links from my experience is- on content rich pages and blog posts . <h> 2 . Do n't use redirection or cloaking <p> This is more of a personal choice than anything else , however , my advice would be to link directly to the products on Amazon using the links provided in your members area . Do n't use any form of link cloaking or 301 redirection . <p> I use a plugin called- Better Links Pro to link all my other affiliate links , but Amazon links I tend to leave as naked as they are . <p> If you 're wondering why ? <p> Well , its because I personally do n't  like to mislead people- by hiding my Amazon links . <h> 3 . Add Amazon affiliate links to content rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is again and also why you should do this <p> Google absolutely loves useful , compelling , content-rich pages . They also love content that is up to date , and you 're less likely to ring any alarm bells in the spam department if you 're adding useful links to quality- content rich blog posts and pages . <h> 4 . Add no-follow attribute <p> Ensure that your Amazon links are no-followed so that they do n't  pass any link juice . Again , this is also to avoid ringing any alarm bells in Googles spam department and to avoid any penalties . <h> 5 . Do n't  place affiliate links in the first paragraph <p> Leave the first paragraph well alone , you can start adding your affiliate links from the 3rd paragraph down . Once again this is to simply avoid appearing too spammy. <h> 6 . Link to relevant products only <p> Do n't  just promote any old crap you find on Amazon , be specific and think " usefulness " and " relevancy " . <p> If your blog is about fly fishing , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with fly fishing . If your blog is about solopreneurship , then link to business books and tools etc. <h> 7 . Add Amazon links naturally <p> What do I mean by this ? Well , here 's an example : <p> You 're writing an article on how to build a model Airplane , you then remember a book that you purchased on Amazon about Aero Model Making . You can mention the book in your article and add a link to it . Thats called linking naturally , the way humans would find it useful . <p> Linking unnaturally would be hyperlinking every other keyword on the article related to model making to the book on Amazon . <p> You should also use a combination of non-descriptive and naked URL 's to link directly to Amazon products , none-descriptive such as " click here to find out more " or " Read more about this product " , or " Check out this great book I found on Amazon " etc. <h> 8 . Use high-quality images of products <p> If you 're planning on using images of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book review , for example , make sure those images are of high quality . <p> You can also hot link some of your product images to the respective Amazon products , but seriously do n't go overboard with this strategy either . <h> 10 . Create quality video reviews and tutorials <p> The visibility that videos get is phenomenal . Think about it , content consumers can consume video content anytime , whether its on your YouTube channel or Facebook page . <p> Consider creating detailed video tutorials and reviews of products and books on Amazon to embed into your blog posts . <h> Wrapping things up <p> So there you have it , a short but hopefully useful list of tips for you to consider when monetizing your blog with Amazon affiliate links . Follow these simple tips and you 'll enjoy a nice stream of income from Amazon for years to come . <p> Best of luck . <p> Post Views : 2,274 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 
@@76508657 @5208657/ <h> How To Create A Killer Tools And Resources Page ( Plus Marketing Tips ) <p> Almost every blog you visit will have some kind of page dedicated to a list of useful tools and resources . <p> If you 're still confused about what one of these pages are , simply head over here to see a fine example of a tools and resources page . <p> Alternatively just read on and I 'll explain in more detail about what this page is . <h> What is a tools and resources page anyway ? <p> A tools and resources page is pretty self-explanatory . Its a page within a website- that you can use to write about all the various online tools , apps , technologies and resources you use and recommend . <p> Some bloggers call this page a recommended tools page , a toolbox page , a get started page , but most just stick with calling it a tools and resources page . <p> In a WordPress environment , most T&amp;R pages are built with a static page and not a conventional blog post . <p> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , and sometimes the blogs sidebar and various other pages . <h> Why you should create a tools and resources page for your blog <p> Having a tools and resources page is a great way for you to showcase , promote and give praise to the products and services you love to use in your blog or online business . <p> This is probably the golden rule for building any successful T&amp;R page . <p> Always try and recommend tools or resources you 've used yourself or in your business , and therefore would like to endorse and recommend to others . <p> Never recommend something you 've never even tried out yourself . <p> If you end up promoting or recommending something that turns out to be some kind of scam , you 'll be remembered for it and that can hurt your trust- and reputation as a blogger . <p> #4 . Add useful content <p> Do n't just list your tools in a form of affiliate links and be done with it either . <p> Write a short little piece besides each of the tools you 're adding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been using the tool for , why you 're using it and recommending it to others . <p> If you have any relevant case study articles related to a tool or app you 're recommending , make sure you link to it . This will only boost your T&amp;R 's page authority and help to boost trust with your readers . <p> One of my favourite tools for WordPress is the Thrive Visual Editor tool . This plugin is great for creating professional custom landing pages inside WordPress . <p> I know one of the aims of creating a recommended- tools and resources page is to help you increase blog income , however not all your links need to be affiliate links . <p> Some links can point to useful books or articles on the web you may have read . <p> If you are linking to any affiliate products , apps or services , I recommend using a plugin like Better Links Pro . This is the plugin I use for masking and tracking my affiliate links . <h> 10 ways- to promote your tools and resources page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your powerful tools and resources page , it 's time to make it visible on your blog or website . <p> Its important that this page gets seen . The more visitors you can drive to this page , the better your conversion rates will be . <p> Below you 'll find an un-exhausted list of things you can do to help promote your T&amp;R page , drive traffic and boost your affiliate income . <p> Note : I would also recommend setting up some kind of conversion tracking goal inside of Google Analytics . Check out this video- to learn how to do that . <p> Link your recommendation page in the main navigational menu of your blog or website . <p> Create a custom banner graphic for your tools and resources- page , embed it with a link in your blog 's sidebar . <p> Do the same as above and place at the end of your blog posts . <p> Add a link in the footer section of your website or blog . <p> Add native links from inside your blog articles to your T&amp;R page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or perhaps a video intro to your tools page . Talk about the tools in more detail . <p> When you update your tools page with new- tools and content , let your email list know about this update . <p> Add a link to each of the tools you recommend to a review article on your blog ( If you have one ) <p> Link from your case study articles , top traffic posts and pages . <p> Create a PDF version of your tools and resources page for folks to download for free ! <h> Wrapping things up <p> So there you have it , a step-by-step guide for creating a super awesome , conversion focused tools and resources page for your website , plus some top tips for promoting it , driving traffic and boosting blog income . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Here comes a bit belated wishes for the New Year 2017 . Hope you enjoyed the festive and holiday season , <p> Happy to be here again to read yet another informative post . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily activity in blogging i never thought of building a tools and resources page for my blog . I just visited your Tools and resources page , nice to read and know about the tools and resources you use in your blog . <p> Hey , sorry to tell you about the pop ups scrolling in I am heard that Google does not like these types of Pop ups I am not sure You know better than me LOL Thanks for sharing such an informative piece . <p> A tools and resources page can be very powerful . Thanks for checking mine out , I am planning to update this page very soon , as there are many new tools Ive discovered and using since I last updated it . <p> My recommendation page is currently the 26th most visited page on my site each month , one of my goals is to get it in the top 10 at least . <p> As for the pop-up , its on my list to eliminate it from the site . I already use a pop-up form on click in the sidebar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have a great rest of the week and I hope 2017 is full of success and good health for you mate . <p> Fabrizio , a helpful article . I have been blogging for over two years now and have been severely procrastinating on creating a tools/resources page . Now that I have read your article , it is definitely going to happen very soon . Thanks for a valid reminder . <p> You 're welcome mate , glad you enjoyed the article . I think a tools and resources page serves two valid purposes . It helps others find and discover what tools you 're using to ultimately find success online . And it helps the site to boost some additional income for the blogger . <p> I think you should definitely create recommended page for your blog , then start driving some serious traffic to it . <p> Thanks for the reminder . I need to get my tools and resource page sorted . I have an old page that I took off my menu , but I really need to get it back in action . Perhaps I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You 're welcome mate . Definitely get your tools page back in top form .

I totally agree about contact details on every page , I think that 's essential . I would also add the importance of having a picture , something that you 've made clear yourself = <p> I 'm just at the stage of developing products so no testimonial page at the moment but I can definitely see its a necessary thing . In the past year I 've implemented a good dose of your recommendations so no doubt I 'll be checking back here to see how you implement this one . <p> Don that 's truly amazing , the power of testimonials huh , and to have Adrienne add even more validation about your business coaching by writing about her own experiences with you in the form of a guest post ? Priceless . <p> Many sites have a testimonials page , but its amazing how few of them feature case histories . Sometimes the testimonials lack punch , but a good case history or two will give potential customers the extra validation they need to move forward and make an inquiry , or buy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill testimonial can be transformed by turning it into a testimonial story whereby you top and tail it with some engaging editorial . Build the narrative ! <p> Another point is that a testimonial should include the persons name and their location ( not their street address of course ) and also include a pic of the happy customer . Detail points like these can transform a testimonial . <p> The best testimonial is a video testimonial , providing the customer conveys some enthusiasm and authenticity . <p> I also think your point about design is spot on . Some bloggers and business owners neglect good design . If they take shortcuts in this area they will pay the price good design can help conversions , no doubt . <p> Hey Kim great to see you here again , you 're absolutely right about case studies , they can work greatly . I just look at Neil Patels posts that are almost always case studies and data drive articles , they rock . I love the fact that as well as providing value and insight , they also provide a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video testimonials if people can take the time to do must be quite effective , I know from visiting your blog Ive seen quite a few video testimonials , that 's awesome mate . <p> Digging all of these tips . I have a nice juicy page of Endorsements from a few of my eBooks posted to my blog . It can help to have backing from happy fans and readers because some folks buy in to social proof . If you have fans , show em off , right ? As for me , I keep things simple and clear on BFP . And clean too . Just biz pages and eBook ads and endorsements and About Me page , along with pictures of paradise in my sidebar . Selfie images from paradise . It aligns with my brand so well and also , it keeps readers focused on my content which is the key selling point on all blogs . <p> A bit weak on endorsing my endorsements , I may bump that up going forward . Thanks much for sharing Fabrizio . <p> Hey Ryan , thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Great to that you have your endorsements page sorted buddy , I know you have a lot of happy fans , including some big wig endorsements too which surely throws some serious weight your way = <p> Your paradise selfies are truly your signature , I have to look twice when I come across an paradise pic on social media these days because I automatically connect them all with you and BFP = That must be a good thing right ? <p> Anyway keep doing what you 're doing my friend , enjoy the rest of your week and thanks again for stopping by Fabrizio . <p> Oh god . I have a lot of tweaking to do I havent accomplished any of these ! I do focus on creating irresistible content right now because that 's something that I can accomplish on my own , but creating a better design for my blog would probably need the services of a professional designer . <p> Hey Yeshua , thanks for dropping by , great to hear you 're putting a lot of effort into creating great content for your blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always work on later , and of course I 'm always here to help you with that anytime = <p> Welcome and great to have you commenting on my blog .

Think of it as a direct way to communicate with your customers . <p> Businesses who use blogs receive 67% more leads than businesses who do n't  market with blogs . ( Source ) <p> Blogging can help you dramatically improve your search engine rankings , thus driving more targeted and relevant buyer traffic to your business website . <p> Blogging can help you add that all-important " human element " to your brand , help you build more connections , reinforce relationships and help you earn the trust and loyalty of your customers . That 's important if you want them to buy from you again and again and again . <p> Blogging is a cost effective marketing strategy , simple to setup and every business should be using . <h> Digital- Marketing Idea #3 : Search engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products or services on your site that people really need and love too . <p> But what good is all of it if no one can find and of it . <p> Search Engine Optimization- or SEO is more important than most people realize . <p> I speak to many business owners and bloggers alike every single week , be it online or offline . <p> To a lot of folks in business , when it comes to creating online visibility for their website or services , they immediately begin to- talk about PPC . <p> I 've heard many stories of how some companies are spending ridiculous amounts of money each and every month on things like Google AdWords and Facebook Ads , just to make- sure their website is seen above their competition . <p> There are even companies set up to rob small businesses blindly like this , and I 'm probably going to annoy a lot of people in those kinds of businesses by saying that . <p> Sorry . <p> The problem is that many small business owners have been brainwashed to think that SEO is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then there 's the waiting game to see if your SEO efforts will pay off . <p> I 'm not saying that PPC is bad in any way . I know a lot of great marketers out there who know exactly what they 're doing- and are getting excellent results from their PPC campaigns . <p> If you 're just starting out , however , you do n't  want to be blasting your entire budget on PPC . <p> When you implement simple but effective SEO practices into your website marketing strategy , sure it takes time to see any genuine results , again especially if you 're just starting out with your website . <p> But I can tell you the rewards are far greater , and long lasting too . <p> And the best thing is ? You do n't  have to throw your hard earned cash down the drain . <p> If you run a WordPress website , consider installing a powerful SEO plugin . I recommend something like- Yoast SEO , which is free. - Or something like SEOPressor- for more site-wide optimization options . <h> Digital- Marketing Idea 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the norm either , and only a few years ago it was considered as being a very powerful link building and traffic generation strategy . <p> Sadly these days if you try building backlinks using guest blogging , or should I say more appropriately , if you use- unnatural spammy link building tactics in your guest posts , you could potentially get your site slapped by Google . <p> Guest blogging , however , is still a very powerful way to do the following : <p> Building an email list for your business is unlike building a following or network on social media . <p> Yes , you can have 15,000 followers on Twitter . <p> Yes , you can have 20,000 fans on Facebook and all the rest of it , but here 's the thing , you 'll never own those fans and followers . <p> By building your email list , building your own network , you will own it . Even if you can only muster a few subscribers each day , it all goes towards building your power list . <p> Do n't  waste all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . Its cost effective and can be a very profitable for your business , so get on the case . <h> Digital- Marketing Idea 6 : Social media marketing <p> I just told you not to waste all your time on social media , now I 'm going to tell you to use social media . <p> Social media is n't going to go anywhere , its here to stay for a very long time , whether you love it or hate it . <p> And as more people flock to sites like Facebook , Instagram , Twitter , LinkedIn and Pinterest , you need to start thinking of new ways to get your business noticed , and in front of your target audience on social media . <p> The aim with social media , however , is not to be on every single platform you can find . But to be on the platforms that give you the most back . <p> For instance , if your target audience happens to be on Facebook and LinkedIn , focus on those two sites and make it really work for your business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't working for you do n't  waste your efforts trying to make it work . <p> A lot of businesses just plod along on every social networking site they can find , - month after month wasting money and valuable resources , when their target audience and potential customers could well be somewhere else entirely . <h> Digital- Marketing Idea 7 : Content marketing <p> Content marketing is the big trend these days , and it does n't  have to be complex or complicated at all , not to begin with anyway . <p> So what is content marketing anyway ? <p> In a nutshell , content marketing is simply creating and using useful , compelling , problem-solving online content to attract and convert prospects into paying customers . <p> Content can be created using a variety of mediums and platforms , such as video , audio , eBooks and whitepapers , webinars and live-stream video , presentations and more . <p> Blogging and social media can be included in your content marketing strategy . <p> If you want to learn what a content marketer is actually responsible for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Digital- Marketing Idea 8 : Outreach and influencer marketing <p> Influencer marketing is a tactic- again that has n't  been around for very long , but its growth in popularity has been phenomenal in the digital marketing world . <p> When done right , influence marketing can be very effective for any business online . <p> So what is influence marketing anyway ? <p> According to this source : - Influencer marketing is a type of marketing that focuses on using key leaders to drive your brand 's message to the larger market . Rather than marketing directly to a large group of consumers , you instead inspire/hire/pay influencers to get out the word for you . <p> So just in case , you 're still at a loss with this , it means using industry leaders and influencers to catapult your message about your products and service to a wider audience . <p> Here are some useful tools to help you with your influence marketing and outreach campaigns <p> With your business firmly placed in Google Maps , your customers can find you easily , and even leave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you attract even more customers . <h> Digital- Marketing Idea 10 : Pay Per Click <p> You probably thought that I was totally against Pay Per Click ads right . <p> Well , I 'm not . I simply do n't  think PPC should be the first focus for marketing and promoting your website or other web properties if you 're just starting out . <p> That being said , using PPC is probably the quickest way to get traffic to your website . If you 're smart enough about it , you can create a very relevant and compelling offer , along with some great content and use targetted PPC ads to get people flocking to your offer . <p> I would not recommend you start using PPC with the mindset that you 're going to convert cold prospects into buyers instantly . <p> I would recommend that you use PPC carefully , to build your customer base , by offering a valuable incentive in line with your business offerings . You can then think of ways in which to convert your prospects into buyers later on . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 
@@76508669 @5208669/ <h> How To Do A/B Split Testing For Your 2-Step Email Pop-up Forms <p> I once believed that if I created a compelling enough offer , and I combined this offer with a compelling enough opt-in box , it would be merely enough to get people subscribing to my email newsletter . <p> Believe it or not for a while that actually worked quite well . But then I discovered the art of doing- A/B testing . <p> You see I always thought that if it worked then great , if it did n't  work then I 'd just start over and create another offer or design another email form . But seriously , how much work and time is involved in doing that ? <p> Too darn much . Doing simple A/B split testing would save me a ton of time if I could get the results I wanted . <p> In this post I 'm going to share with you the results I got from doing a very simple- A/B test for my email pop-up lightbox opt-in form . Wow , what a mouthful that was huh Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Let me start off by talking to you a little bit about my amazing offer , moreover , one of the incentives that I use to help me build my beautiful email list . <p> Over the course of time the guide has increased in size with new content etc . Initially it was only about 20 pages long when I launched it . <p> OK so as the title suggests , its a traffic generation guide for bloggers . Its packed with some great practical and actionable tips and ideas for increasing blog traffic , and doing so without having to tire yourself with- SEO or relying solely on Google organic traffic . <p> Much of the tips and ideas in this little guide I 've used myself , and Ive gotten some great results too. - You can learn more about this book here . <h> The LightBox <p> OK so one of the lead capture forms- that I use for building my list , using this very incentive , is called : - A- 2-step lightbox pop-up opt-in form . Yes I know its a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this custom lightbox using the awesome list building and opt-in form builder plugin for WordPress , - Thrive Leads . I 'm sure you 've heard me bark- on about this amazing plugin before so many times too right ? <p> No better tool for the job in my opinion . <p> Anyway , I created both forms identically ( Form A and Form B ) , with some slight variations between the two versions . here 's a snap shot of the opt-in form A , in the first step and second step . <p> I 've kept the forms in line with my sites existing design , i.e. colour and layout , and relatively clutter free . Now here 's a snap shot of the pop-up- form B , - in the first and second steps . <p> Instead of just asking visitors- " do you want to know how to drive more traffic " , I used numbers to specify just how much more traffic . i.e. " 100+ Blog Visits Per Day " . <p> I also made some slight variations in the Yes and No- submit buttons too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used a different call-to-action inside the button . Instead of just using " download the traffic guide now " , I placed a more direct command like- " send me my blog traffic guide now " . <p> There are no differences in design or layout for both forms A and B. <h> Form Behaviour Variations <p> I should also mention that both forms trigger to launch after 40 seconds on page load . So that means a visitor stays on my site for more than 40 seconds before the form is triggered . <p> Both forms are set to trigger on exit too , and loads once every other day . <p> Form A uses a slide in from the top animation , whilst Form B uses a rotational animation . <p> So how much of an impact has these slight variations made on my opt-in conversions ? How have these forms performed against each other ? Let 's take a look . <p> Before I forget to mention this , I tested these forms against each other over the course of 9 days . <h> Test Results for Pop-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result- graph below you 'll see that Form A , which is the green line , did not convert very much at all when compared to Form B , which is the blue line . <p> Form A in fact struggled from day one , resulting in a lousy 0.68% conversion rate . Form B on the other hand did a little better , resulting in a conversion rate of 1.49% . Not great by far , but still a decent result . <p> Form B had a 97.85% chance of beating the original form ( Form A ) . So it would have probably made sense for me to just end the test- and go on with Form B right ? - Since the conversion rate is slightly higher than Form A. <p> The thing is I wanted to do some more experimenting , so I created a third form ( Form C ) and tested it against Form B. Heres a snap shot of Form C. <p> As you 'll immediately- notice , I changed the headline title slightly to make it shorter and more click-worthy , and I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Submit " button to green . <p> The animation I selected for form C was slide from the top , same as form A from the first test . <p> OK so here are the results of the test for form- B against form- C for the duration of the 7- days . <p> This time not a great deal of difference between the two forms as far as conversions go . Form C only had a 29.21% chance of beating form B , but 0.84% conversions is n't far off 1.08% right ? <p> I made the decision to end the test and award form B as the overall winner , but I would have probably gotten a more insightful result had I allowed the test- to run for a longer duration . Still I can always head back to the design board and create some new forms to put up- against form B later on . <h> Conclusion <p> So there you have it . Again this is just to show you how I did a simple A/B test on just my email pop-up form . I am testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sidebar form and ribbon form above the header of my blog , and I 'm getting some interesting results . <p> Do let me know your thoughts on my results if you have anything to share , maybe some tips or suggestions , I 'd love to hear them . <h> Over to you <p> Are you currently building your email list with various opt-in boxes placed on your blog or WordPress website ? If so are you doing split testing too ? I 'd love to hear about your results . <p> Which forms are working best for you right now ? Are you using an incentive offer ?

And of course Dig Dig . <p> Thanks so much for this information and video you have shared ! Ill spread the word . <p> Hi Donna , thanks for your visit . The Thrive Leads plugins tops my list of best plugins Ive purchased this year by far . Shane and his team have really put in a lot of thought into this one . Its such a powerful tool and one that simply ca n't be ignored by serious list builder I think . <p> Hey lucky you having a blogging guy to do all the back end stuff , I think I need one of them to free up some of my time lol . <p> Now I feel like a kid in a candy store LOL ! You have mentioned a lot of great tools . Some Ive heard of but the majority I have n't . <p> But one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point ! I started using it about 3 weeks ago as you already know and I too am very impressed with it . Even better I 've had no problem with it on my blog compared to others that I 've installed . I 'm still playing around with it but I really love the A/B test features . <p> Besides that I really got to come back and take a really good look at the other tools you mentioned . There were a couple that caught my eye ! <p> Hi Sherman , thanks for checking out my resource list , all of these tools have been really useful for me . I 'm so glad you 're enjoying the Thrive Leads plugin , I tell you this thing is going to be a winner for bloggers , I 've had no problems using it either . I 'm currently running A/B testing on my ribbon opt-in form , getting some really interesting data , I 'll be writing a post about it in the coming weeks . <p> The other plugin I 'd recommend if you have n't checked it out that is , is the Better Links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services on your blog , this plugin has some really cool features like tracking and analytics integration etc . <p> When I said I would n't be investing in any more tools for my site recently , I 've been doing completely the opposite lol . Another plugin I 'm interested in investing in is Gravity Forms , not sure if you 've come across that one . <p> Wow , Fabrizio ! That 's a lot of tools . Of course , it all kind of creeps up on you . I 'm glad they help you . I went the opposite way and removed most of my plugins . <p> Plus , I turned off comments , so I do n't  really need a lot of supporting code . I do like WebSimon Tables , since I do n't  plan to get a framework anytime soon . I just have to work a little hard to customize my free theme . = <p> Wow Hats off to you mate , must be great to be a code wiz kid , you do n't  have to rely on any external things to make your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course at tech college years back in 2001 , the course was to pass visual basic 6 programming and to get a diploma at the end . It was so way over my head that I ran for the hills so darn fast that I forgot what I was actually running away from lol = <p> Wow , you 've got some great tools listed here and I always enjoy hearing what other people use . <p> As you know I 'm looking to change themes and the Thrive one is the one Ive seen a few times that to me is the most attractive . I can spot a Genesis theme a mile away , everyone has it which is another reason I do n't  want to go that route . I may or may not have a theme custom made , not sure about that yet but I do have one question for you . You know me , always eager to learn more . <p> Why would you need the Thrive Content Builder or Visual Editor plugin to build your pages ? I would think a landing page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create something that looks nice without having this addition . I just do n't  want to have to buy two , three or four more plugins to make the darn thing look or function better . That 's my concern but I am still considering their lead plugin . Just want to make this particular move first . <p> By the way , I saw a tweet that Sherryl shared today about a vulnerability with SEO Yoasts plugin . I do n't  use it so I was n't as concerned but you might want to look into that my friend . I would hate for anything to affect you or your blog . <p> Thanks Fabrizio for this great post and for your suggestions . As you can see , we take this to heart and I look forward to you answering my many questions again . Thank you for that too . <p> Hi Adrienne , yes I read your post about rebranding yourself , but I have n't got round to commenting because the moment I went to do it , I got called away in the offline world lol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very reason that everyone is using them . If you were able to customise a child theme to the point where it would be completely unique then that would be great . <p> Thrive on the other hand are making a lot of noise , and I 'm really excited for them . Now to answer your question as to why would you need the content builder plugin in addition ? <p> Now do you think I would have been able to build a custom page like this using the bulk standard prehistoric editor within WordPress ? lol . <p> Probably yes , if I was a coding wizard and if I had hours and hours to dedicate to creating such a page like this . <p> The content builder plugin takes all of those things away . I created this page within 40 minutes literally . <p> Basically the content builder plugin allows you to create custom pages with a lot of elements at your finger tips , I 'm talking about content columns , pricing tables , testimonial boxes , nice buy it now buttons , opt-in boxes , custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so much more , all with a click of the mouse . <p> Now there 's nothing wrong with the simple landing page built using the editor in WordPress , but trying to make it attractive by adding all of those elements , and trying to optimise it to convert the best it can would be almost impossible , like I said unless you were a developer yourself . <p> As for the Yoast Plugin thanks for the heads up but I was onto it the moment it was announced , my backup provider BlogVault notified me immediately = Over 1 million peeps use this plugin I think . <p> Take it easy Adrienne , if I can answer any more questions please fire away . <p> This is a great roundup of tools that you are personally using you cant beat that kind of review ! <p> I 'm a big fan of all things Thrive and I must say I like the way you have used the Pressive Theme here . I 'm familiar with most of these tools but there are a couple of new ones for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks for introducing me to those . <p> Hi David , thanks for your comment mate , I 'm loving Thrive too , I was using Genesis before and thought long and hard before switching to Thrive and using the Pressive theme . I 'm so glad that I did , I love the layout and with a few customisations here and there I was able to make it match the look and feel of my brand .

With your YouTube channel , you publish vlogs or videos . <p> The other great thing about using YouTube is that it has a humongous community at the ready . <p> That 's right , whatever niche you 're into , chances are there are folks on YouTube searching for what you have to offer right now . <p> So you do n't  only get the opportunity to add and share great content , but also the opportunity to grow a huge fan base , a loyal following known as subscribers . <p> OK , so before you even start thinking about creating and uploading videos or vlogs of any kind on your channel , you first need to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target audience . <h> Branding your YouTube channel <p> What does branding your YouTube channel mean ? . <p> It- means- to give it some kind of identity that will help people instantly recognize who you are , similar to that of your blog or website . <p> In fact , very much like your blog . <p> If you have a unique brand identity with your blog design , message etc , you should be consistent with that and use the same identity for your YouTube channel . <p> If you take a look at my YouTube channel , for instance , you will notice that my branding and messaging is more or less consistent with that of my blog . <p> Take some time to craft a great banner logo for your channel , as well as create some cool thumbnail templates which you can use later on in your vlogs . <p> If you need help with custom graphics click this link to see how I can help you . <h> Complete your YouTube profile <p> As well as branding , do n't  forget to customize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is to use your channel to not only promote your vlogs and videos- but to also get people flocking back to your blog . <p> Here are some essential things you need to do <p> Write a short but powerful description in the about section . <p> Add customized links to important pages on your blog or website . <p> Brand your videos with your logo using branding watermark . <p> Add your associated website under advanced settings . <p> Add channel keywords under advanced settings . <h> Creating Video Content ( Vlogs ) <p> Creating vlogs or videos for your channel takes as much time and effort as creating any other kind of online content . <p> With blogging , you can spend days or weeks researching , writing and crafting your blog posts to perfection . <p> Vlogging is very similar , however as a blogger creating videos , you have a huge advantage . <p> That advantage is that you already have content to work with in the first place , content from your blog . <p> And this is one of the many reasons vlogging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the content you use for your vlogs needs to be of high-quality . <p> The recording and audio quality of your vlogs also need- to be top-notch . <p> Let 's now look at the process of creating high-quality vlogs for your YouTube channel . <h> Vlogging To Grow Your Blog : The process of creating vlogs <h> #1 . Make a list of possible- vlog topics <p> Start with making a list of all the blog posts that you have on your blog that could potentially be repurposed into vlogs or videos . <p> Tutorial posts and product review posts are great for doing just that . <p> However , with careful planning , you can also turn your list posts and even strategy posts into vlogs too . <p> Always keep in mind quality content , and relevancy . <p> What I like to do is find posts on my blog with the most engagement , most number of social shares , comments , and traffic , and convert them into vlogs. <h> #2 . Structure your vlogs <p> After making your list , take each post and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be reproduced into a quality video . <p> here 's how I create vlogs and videos for my YouTube channel <p> Create a quick intro with my logo displayed ( 5 seconds long ) <p> Introduce myself and the title of the video ( 20-40 seconds long ) <p> Go straight to the content ( 4-8 minutes long , however , this depends on how in-depth I go and some of my videos are much longer than this , but , the shorter the better ) <p> End the video with a call-to-action , for instance , asking viewers to visit your blog URL for more of what you have to offer , or to subscribe to your channel . This is very important if you want to drive traffic from your vlogs . <p> Add an outro and end credits . <h> #3 . Recording your vlogs <p> The next step is to actually record your vlogs ( videos ) . <p> Now , this step can take a considerable amount of time to do , especially if you 've never done anything like this before . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become frustrated with it and give up . <p> Just take your time and try and have some fun doing it , you 'll soon get the hang of it . <p> Add a good description . In the description do n't  forget to add a link to your blog . Even better if you can link to the relevant or corresponding blog article for your vlog . Again , this is very important if you want people to visit your blog from your videos . <h> Bloggers that vlog <p> OK so to give your some inspiration to get started , below I 've compiled a very short list of my favorite bloggers that have found success with vlogging . <p> Ileane Smith from IleaneSmith.com Ive known Ileane for a number of years now and through her YouTube channel she vlogs about blogging and social media , as well as provides YouTube tutorials .

You can check out his channel here . <h> Wrapping things up <p> So there you have it , some key things you need to know to start vlogging to grow your blog . <p> I realize that vlogging can be an extremely time-consuming activity , but as you get more used to doing it , the more fun you 'll have , and the better you 'll become at it and the more rewarding it will be . <p> Once again , video can be a very powerful medium , so make sure you 're doing everything you can to make it work for you and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole new audience out there waiting to discover your content through video and vlogging , so go make something happen . <p> So now over to you .

What good is having all of that awesome content , if its not easily accessible ? <p> Now I know its not even remotely possible to have each and every piece of content on your blog visible from a single point of access . <p> However , there are plenty of things you can do to make your content 1 , easily accessible , and 2 a pleasure to consume , simply by making your blog more user-friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every possible way to do just that . <p> Are you ready ? Let 's get to it . <h> 9 Ways to make your blog more user-friendly <h> 1 . Fix your blog design <p> Let 's briefly talk about design , and why having a clean , clutter-free blog design is critical and can help you make consistent progress with your blog . <p> In this post by Iron Paper , it quotes that almost 60% of consumers worldwide would rather engage and interact with content that 's been beautifully designed rather than just simply- designed . <p> Let 's put this into perspective for your blog . It means that design is very important . <p> You spend an enormous amount of time producing great content- so it would make perfect sense to not just slap it on a sloppy looking , poorly designed blog , right ? <p> A great blog design will not only make your content stand out , but also make your content a pleasure to consume by your readers . <p> You can either hire someone to create a custom blog design for you , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WordPress theme like Genesis . <p> OK , so now let 's take a look at how you can prioritize user experience on your blog to make your content truly stand out . <h> 2 . Clean up your blog header &amp; navigation links <p> The header and main navigation section of your blog should be top-priority- because essentially this is the first thing that most of your visitors will see when they land on any page or post on your blog . <p> Keep your blog header and navigation clean and simple . Your logo and navigational links should be the only elements present in your blogs header . <p> If your conversion goal is to get people to read your blog , make sure that a link to your- blog- page is clearly visible on the menu . In fact , make this the first item on your menu . <p> If you have a banner ad in your header area , consider removing it . If you- have links to your social profiles in your header , consider moving these to the footer section or sidebar . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make your content the center of attention , then go for it by all means . <p> If you decide you want to keep your sidebar and want to make better use of it , I recommend placing only the essential elements in there , as too many items in the sidebar can be a HUGE distraction for your blog readers . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Very detailed guide you have here Fabrizio !

@@76508684 @5208684/ <p> This was and still is to this day , one of the most inspirational and eye opening books I 've ever read as a blogger and solopreneur . <p> Garys vision and theories based around focus , time and task management and productivity , really paved a new way in which I thought and operated as a blogger and online business person . <h> The bullsh*t concept of multi-tasking <p> In one of the chapters of The One Thing , Gary talks about the concept of multi-tasking , and how many people believe that they 're actually good at it , and how they 're getting lots of things done by doing it . <p> The truth however is that they 're actually getting less things done , and making a bunch of errors in the same process . He shares countless startling studies and theories that actually prove this concept . <p> In the book he also quotes a saying by Steve Uzzell , which has really stuck in my mind , and which goes like this : <p> " Multitasking is merely the opportunity to screw up more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about how multitasking has become the mainstream element in all our lives , and how we often do it without thinking about it , not just in business , but also in life too . <p> I started reflecting on this and thought about how I was organising myself on a daily , and even weekly basis to run and manage my blog and online business . <p> Yes , I was multitasking a lot of things , and more often than not , making a bunch of mistakes too , and really not getting much done either . <p> I once believed that simply just having a to-do list , with lots of items on it was enough to keep me on the right path to getting things done , and ultimately finding success . <p> Seriously , I would create a list of 15 to 20 items . From content writing to promoting a new post . From blog commenting to finishing off a client project , to tweaking my own blog , to doing keyword research . Literally everything I wanted to do went on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , I mean that 's the way I was taught to do things in life and in work too , way before I came online . It was engrained in me . <p> As Gary- rightly says , it has become mainstream in all our lives . We multitask when were not aware of it . We eat food and watch TV at the same time . We walk whilst texting on our mobile phones , and perhaps even whilst listening to music . <p> So anyway , going back to my monster to-do lists . Guess what happened each time I made a ridiculous list with 15 to 20 items on it ? <p> Yep , that 's right . I would get nothing but just a few items on my list done each week . <p> The rest would be forgotten about , or I would write another list of 20 things to do for the following week , and once again hardly get anything done . <p> So if I wanted to write an epic piece of content about blogging productivity , and have it completed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like this : <p> Research topic <p> Collect resources <p> Write post <p> Edit and format post <p> Schedule or publish post ( Success ) <p> Or let 's say I wanted to put out a new YouTube video . My success list would look something like this : <p> Research topic <p> Write notes or rough script for video <p> Record video <p> Edit and format video <p> Upload video to YouTube and publish ( Success ) <p> I think you get the drift here . <p> So I started doing this about six months ago , picking one thing and focusing on that one thing each week . I cant begin to tell you how much more Ive been able to do and achieve . <p> Before , I would write a crazy list like this : <p> Write blog post <p> Comment on 10 blogs <p> Record new YouTube video <p> Create visual content for social media <p> Schedule posts on HootSuite <p> Schedule posts on Facebook <p> Finish Bobs website project <p> Update featured post images on 4 blog posts <p> Update this , that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email <p> Chat to Mandy on Skype <p> And it goes on , and on , and on , and on <p> How boring and tedious does that list above look ? Its enough to make anyone want to throw in the towel and give up right ? Its uninspiring too . <p> Focusing on the one thing , whether you 're a blogger , marketer , solopreneur , who ever ! Will help you move forward , and take you a step closer to finding success online , or closer to your goal . I truly believe that . <p> I can create two success lists like this each week , have them completed by the end of the week , and over the course of a month , I will have done more , and achieved more , than I would have sticking to the routine I was once lost in , with a to-do list . <h> Take the one thing approach with your blog <p> If you want to check out Garys book for yourself , perhaps you have n't read it yet or even heard of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here on Amazon . <p> Now let me get back to creating more success lists in my business and in my life too .

@@76508685 @5208685/ <p> I have never truly appreciated the importance of building an email list until I started Magnet4Blogging , seriously ! <p> Of course- Ive always known- that it was important , but I never paid much attention to it. - As a matter of- fact , when I started blogging some 5 years ago , I was n't remotely interested in list building , I thought I 'd get to it eventually , which I did . What I was more focused on at the time was getting search engine traffic and lots of it , and writing purely for Google , and for a while this worked . <p> What then followed- in 2012 , Google unleashed Panda and Penguin , and they mercilessly destroyed my blog , and the obvious result ? I lost virtually all organic traffic from Google . <p> As I said I did n't  pay much attention to list building back then , so I did n't  have- much of an email list to fall back on , at most I had about 60 or so subscribers , pretty appalling considering I ran that blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 390,000 visits and 500,000 page views . <p> When I started this blog Magnet4Blogging in 2013 , ( I did n't  actually write the first post until March of 2014 ) , the first thing that I did before creating- any content , was to set up my opt-in forms through MailChimp- ( aff ) , and creating my opt-in pages . <p> I 've also been learning as much as I could about list building and doing email marketing properly , as I felt this was an area I needed to improve on a bit more . <p> From March of 2014 up until November , I was averaging around 6 or 7 subscribers per month at the most , not a great amount , but they were targeted peeps . <p> In December- of 2014 however I literally exploded my email opt-in rate. - That month I managed 42 new subscribers , and in January 2015 another 35 new signups , and February looks like is going to be another awesome month as well . <p> In comparison to what I 'd been doing previously , this was much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those two great months , December and January . <p> Finally I thought , after learning where I was going wrong , tweaking here and there , experimenting and testing with this and that , I was able to create- a reasonably powerful combination to reel in more targeted email subscribers in just two months , than I was able to muster in most of 2014 . <p> As you can see from the image screen shot above , December and January were really impressive months in comparison to the rest . I know what you 're thinking , this is a shot of " all lists " , what about just Magnet4Blogging ? Well here they are : <p> The above screen capture shows subscribers to a brand new list I created in December , in conjunction with a new incentive that I was giving away , I 'll talk more about that in tactic 5 . <p> Growing an email list does NOT happen overnight <p> Before I dive into this post further , if you 're just starting to build your email list , I just want you- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not something that happens instantly overnight or over a few weeks or months even . <p> If you work hard at it , keep making small changes and track your progress all the time , you 'll make small leaps and bounds and eventually get to build yourself a healthy email list . Its really worth the time and effort . Its all about finding what really works . <p> At the time of publishing this post , - Magnet4Blogging has approximately 230 active subscribers and growing , not impressive by far I know , but the blog is still relatively new in my opinion . <p> In addition , I once read something very powerful over on Adrienne Smiths blog I think it was . I think she said : <p> Its not how many people you have on your list that matters , its the quality of the folks that you have on your list that matters the most , people you 've connected with and nurtured online relationships with , people who trust you ! <p> The more quality peeps you have on your list , the more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these folks are sincerely interested in your content , they trust you 'll continue to provide them with just that . <p> It would be pointless to have 2,000 email subscribers if only a dozen of those signups actually opened your email newsletter- right ? <p> OK let 's begin <h> 5 Tactics That Helped Me Grow My Email List Like Never Before ! <p> I know that the tactics I 'm about to share with you below is n't anything unconventional or fresh out of the box , however , if you put some effort into building your list properly and without rushing , anyone can follow these steps or add them to them to their existing method and get some level of success with it , there 's no doubt in my mind about that . If you 're completely new to all of this , this is even better for you . <h> Tactic 1 : Finding and using a- reliable Autoresponder Service <p> Many moons ago I was using a service called VerticalResponse as my primary email marketing service provider , I then switched to MailChimp- ( aff ) - in late- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autoresponder service . <p> However- the biggest reason why I switched to MailChimp was because of the number of spammy registrations I was receiving with VerticalResponse . I do n't  know what the case is now with them , but it certainly was n't good for me then , I was getting 20 to 30 spammy registrations per day with VR . <p> I did like the service and the PAYG system they had setup on VR , and it was so simple to use too . <p> In any case , switching over to MailChimp was one of the smartest moves I 've ever made in my online business . I love their templates and creating smart and catching email newsletters is so easy . Setting up MailChimp for list building is easy too , there are lots of customisation options and you can really make the signup process seamless with MailChimp . <p> Take away tip : Find and use a reliable and reputable autoresponder email marketing platform you can work with for your blog , either MailChimp or Awebber . <h> Tactic 2 : Being everywhere with my email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have their email opt-in form in the sidebar of their site and the bottom of their posts , and that 's it ! That 's the way everyone else does it , so it is what it is . <p> That 's a good tactic do n't  get me wrong , but it should n't be the only places where to put your opt-in box , and if you 're not getting as many subscribers to your list- as you 'd like , just look at where you 've placed your signup forms . You literally need to be EVERYWHERE ! <p> Have a quick scan of your your Google Analytics report and check the traffic stats for your about page and you blogs homepage , if you 're getting a lot of hits to these pages , which I reckon you are , and you do n't  have opt-in boxes on those pages , then you 're missing out hugely . <p> here 's a list of places you can expect to find my email signup- form . <p> Top of blog sidebar <p> End of blog posts with call-to-action <p> In my about page ( several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about later ) <p> HelloBar link placed at the top of blog , linking to opt-in page ( I 'll talk more about later ) <p> Native links in content <p> On my blogs homepage above the fold <h> Tactic 3 : Using dedicated customised lead capture pages <p> One of the most effective strategies for building an email list by far is to use a dedicated lead capture page. - I 've said this over and over again , but searching a handful of blogs that I visit regularly , I rarely find a dedicated email opt-in page ! If you 're guilty of this , consider this a good telling off . Now- go do something about it . <p> I currently have two email landing pages , each of them offer a valuable incentive . You can find the links to them below . <p> I am currently working on a 3rd email opt-in page which will coincide with another product/service that I 'll be launching in April hopefully , I 'll talk about conversions at the end of this post , first I want to share with you the tool that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What I use to build my email opt-in landing pages <p> The tool that I use and swear by to build my email landing pages quickly and effortlessly is called Thrive Landing Pages . <p> Yes I said quickly , its so important that if you do n't  yet have a dedicated email landing page , to be able to get one setup quickly , as quickly as in a matter of minutes , not having one is probably costing you more , and so this Thrive landing pages plugin will help you do just that ; build your landing pages and integrate your email service provider in a matter of minutes . <p> Once you have your landing page active and for all to see , you then start making tweaks and fine tuning your landing pages to get the best possible conversions . <h> Tactic 4 : Installing HelloBar Call-To-Action banner above site header <p> Another- reason why I believe- Ive been more- successful with boosting my email opt-ins in the last few months is because of the HelloBar plugin I installed above my site . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a moment has been truly awesome . <p> HelloBar is a free service to use and you can signup here . There is a premium service too available , but I personally use the free one for the time being . <p> Below you 'll find screen captures of the statistics for the HelloBar link featured above this site . Whist the conversion is n't much to party about , that almost 1% conversion rate is contributing towards my increased opt-ins . <h> Tactic 5 : Offer the most irresistible incentive possible <p> Finally we get to the ultimate big fat juicy cherry on the cake ! <p> Back at the end of November I launched a brand new PDF guide for bloggers , after doing some brief research , I decided to write a book about how I generated traffic to my blog , and to do it- without having relying heavily on search engine traffic or doing much SEO . <p> Originally I launched this guide as a freebie , only for a limited time , with no need for opting in . I then decided in December to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who signed- up to my email newsletter , and when I did this , my subscriber count literally took off as you can see ! <p> I 'm now using it to build- a separate new list and Ive- already started to provide targeted content to that list . I 've also had some positive feedback from users of the eBook too . See the screen grab of some of the comments received on Google+ <p> So peeps , with combining- all of the tactics above , this incentive has been well received because it offers a real solution and ideas for bloggers looking for more traffic to their blogs without relying on Google . Its proving to be popular right now , but in a few months time I 'll have to update the guide so that it continues to provide value . <p> So let me quickly recap the list of tactics- once again . <p> Find and use a reliable and reputable autoresponder service , one that wo n't hamstring you . <p> Make valuable use of your opt-in form , put it everywhere on your site like I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capture emails . <p> Install HelloBar plugin to grab potential subscribers attention . <p> Offer an irresistible free incentive to entice people to get onto your list . <h> A/B Testing , Goal Setting And Conversion Tracking <p> Of course there 's no point in busting your guts out trying to make anything- work if you 're not going to tweak , test or track- your efforts and progress , especially when- list building . <p> Everything needs tweaking and testing to see what works best for you . For instance , your email sidebar opt-in box , there is n't a one solution solves all problems answer unfortunately . You have to continuously make changes until you get the best possible results . <p> I 'll give you some quick examples of things you might want to test with your side bar opt-in box for example : <p> Is there clarity in your headline title and opt-in message . <p> How many fields should you use , test with both , name and email or just name , or just email . <p> If you 're offering an incentive , is it enticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers etc ? <p> The same applies to your dedicated landing pages , with A/B testing , your about page , end of posts opt-in box and so forth . <p> Goal Setting And Tracking In Google Analytics <p> So for my email download page for example , I 've created a destination goal within Google Analytics to track its conversion , how many people actually land on that specific page by- taking action within the- confirmation email which they receive when signing up . <h> Conclusion <p> So there you have it troopers , the 5 tactics that I use to build my email list . <p> Like I said this is an ongoing process , there 's always something to tweak and improve somewhere . As some of you may know , I 'm testing- a plugin called Zero Bounce to direct bounced traffic from Google to my email opt-in form , and Ive already seen a slight increase in conversions since installing this plugin . I 'm stilly playing around with the settings for now . <p> I reviewed Zero Bounce plugin a few weeks ago , if you missed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully you 've found this post super useful , if you 've not yet started on building your list , stop wasting time waiting for the perfect time to start , do it now ! Grab the Thrive landing pages plugin- ( aff ) and build your email opt-in pages . Get your thinking cap on and find out what your audience really wants , then go out and create the most irresistible incentive for them ! <p> Your Thoughts <p> As always I 'd love to hear your thoughts , if you have any tips or strategies that has been working for you that youd like to share , please do leave me a comment below . I look forward in reading them . <p> As always have an awesome week , happy blogging and stay safe ! <p> Your blogging friend Fabrizio Van Marciano <p> Post Views : 756 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> I found your post on Adriennes post today . I need to work on my subscriber list and so I came straight here . <p> Thanks for sharing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes and you gave me a good headstart . I 'm using a free email marketing service and you know how they say you get what you pay for ( or do n't  in my case ) well , let 's just say I 'll be switching soon . <p> Thanks again for sharing these five tips with us . It was great to meet you . Have a great week . <p> Hi Corina , welcome and thanks for stopping by . I love Adriennes blog and it was very kind of her to include this post in her Magic Monday series . <p> Glad you were able to pick up some tips for your list building efforts . What email provider are you using ? I would highly recommend MailChimp , if you have less than 2,000 subscribers its free to use . There 's a lot of tools and features with MC . <p> Hi Raspal , thanks for stopping by and leaving such a great comment . Great to meet you and thank you so much for signing up to my email newsletter and downloading my eBook . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quality list you have to have three things in my mind . 1 . great content , 2. targeted visitors 3. an irresistible and valuable incentive and 3. some amazing lead generation forms . <p> As for the double opt-in , I would absolutely recommend using it . It prevents a lot of unwanted spammy registrations . If someone really values your content or offer and wants to subscribe , theyll go through the process of a double opt-in in my mind . <p> This was a nice write up of all you do to grow your email list , esecially with quadrupling your list within the last couple of months . There 's a lot of bloggers who do n't  have a clue on how to grow their email list and the important it is to have one . <p> As i was reading I had to make sure I was doing the right things for my blog . You 're right about having your opt in forms everywhere . I do have mines in quite a few places , but I do believe I need to put them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thrive leads plugin this past weekend . I havent had too much time to play with it , but i 'm going to make it a point to do so this week . I 'm really excited about it ! <p> Also its still a good idea to have a landing page . Again , you want to have some place where your visitors can opt in , and trust me , if your content is good and valuable then your visitors will definitely ask you <p> Thanks for sharing what you did about increasing your opt ins ! I hope you have a great rest of the week ! <p> Hi Sherman , thanks for stopping my mate . I think its about being consistent with the tactics and making tweaks when you 're not seeing results or not seeing the results youd like to see . <p> After doing several things I saw a slight increase as you 'll notice in October and November , but I made an effort to write and complete my eBook in a weekend I think it was , and the results of offering a valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOVE the Thrive content builder plugin , going to love it without a doubt Its truly amazing , it has some amazing features , metric tools , targeting tools and the ability to design your opt-in form to how you want it . <p> You can check out the walk through review video I did of Thrive Leads here if you like mate : <p> As for landing pages , yes they 're essential , the two landing pages on my blog have become the 3rd and 4th most viewed pages on my site , which is great news . Ill be writing a follow up post later on in the year about the progress I 've made with my list building efforts = <p> Glad you 're enjoying it , yeah the A/B testing is awesome , simple to implement too . Ive been running A/B testing on my sidebar opt-in , I removed the Ribbon at the top of my site , even though it was my highest converting opt-in , because it was taking too much screen real estate . I 'm now optimising the sidebar and footer post forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see increased conversions from using the plugin . <p> Growing a list is the utmost important thing that bloggers should be doing . And with that said , I do n't  pay as much attention to it as I should and shame on me for that . <p> But i have specific strategies in place that I plan on implementing starting next month and hopefully will be able to grow my list to over 10,000 by year end . <p> Being everywhere with the email opt-in form is a good takeaway and one thing I do n't  do , right now , is have a CTA at the end of my posts . I just havent been able to find and create one that I liked . Ill work on that this week because its important . I notice you did n't  mention pop-ups . <p> Hey Andrew , I hear you mate , this was something I did n't  do until much later , I look at list building as important as updating my blog regularly now . My list is still very small and focused , and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the year , I 'm more focused on ensuring that I target the right kind of people . <p> I now use the Thrive Leads plugin for WP . The great thing about using this plugin is that you can see first hand which opt-in form is performing the best , and which needs tweaking , I love that because its something I was n't able to do at all before . <p> I used to use pop-ups quite a bit when I started Andrew , but even with a delayed execution , I noticed that over a period of time , my bounce rate went through the roof , like touching 90% through the roof . <p> I do find pop-ups to be slightly intrusive for a blog that 's just starting up , with limited traffic and readers . The larger and more popular blogs however with maybe 3 or 4k visits per day , I think pop-ups might just work there . <p> I like to give visitors a chance to see what my website is about before signing up , which is why the ribbon opt-in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . <p> Hey Fabrizio , Great article with useful tips as always . I 'm experimenting with some of these especially Hello Bar , because its unintrusive , as opposed to sign-up boxes that appear before I 've read anyones content . I always just click those out of the way . LOL Joy <p> Hi Joy , thanks for visiting , glad you enjoyed the post . I 'm so glad you said about the unintrusive hellobar , though I now use Thrive Leads for this . Like I was saying to Andrew , I do n't  use pop-ups only because I think new visitors should get a chance to see what the site is about before deciding they want to receive updates from it = <p> Hi mate , welcome to M4B and thanks for stopping by . Bless Adrienne she really is a great lady , so honoured that she mentioned me in her post . I must be doing something right lol . So pleased you 've decided to add my blog to your list of morning reading , the next amazing post should be out in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resourceful = Have a super rest of the week buddy . <p> When it comes to email lists , there is never enough to learn . I like the way you shared your stats and how effective things are . <p> I found that since I have been using native links in my content , things have been growing . I do have the opt in on my sidebar but I know that people do have what I call " sidebar blindness " so from time to time at the end of a post if it is congruent , I give them a CTA to check it out . <p> It is very true that an email list wont grow over night , but I rather have it grow organically than have a huge number whereby no one is opening my emails . <p> I do have several ways that I do in my marketing strategy besides my blog . I 'm finding lately that my FB Page has been pulling in new people that not only click , but purchase immediately . Pretty good hugh ? <p> Hi Donna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banner blindness thing , check out the screen shot below after running this for just a few weeks . My sidebar opt-in is performing like as if it was n't there . I 'm going to make a few tweaks and then run it for another few weeks . If its still under-performing I 'm just going to remove it altogether . <p> Great news with the Facebook conversion though sounds like you 're killing it , I 've not set anything up properly through my Facebook page , something I 'll have to do in the future I think . 
@@76508687 @5208687/ <p> I 'd like to ask you a serious question relating to your blog and your blogging efforts . Here it is . <p> Are you making your own path in blogging , or are you following- someone elses lead and advice , or implementing- someone elses tactics and strategies , using the tools that somebody- else has suggested you use etc , too often ? <p> here 's the thing , and I 'm not saying that all bloggers do this and that its completely a bad thing , but its so easy to fall into the trap where you 're doing nothing else but following somebody elses advice , tactics , methods , footsteps etc . Sometimes sticking with just the lovely bunch of people you 've connected with in your circles , and not venturing out and connecting with new peeps , can do- more harm than good . <p> Now tell me to sod off and close this post , let me just say , there 's nothing wrong with reading and commenting on the same blogs day in and day out for the rest of your life , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always read and comment on because they 're valuable to me and they always have something fresh to share , but blogging is also about exploring the boundaries , stepping beyond your comfort zone and connecting with NEW people whenever you can right ? <p> In addition , blogging is also about cultivating your own path , making your own journey to finding success . Its about making your own series of mistakes and proudly reaching your own series of milestones , please correct me if I 'm wrong here peeps . <p> Hey , as you may know if you 're connected with me via this blog , or a social network where Im active on , I 'm all for reading other blogs and other bloggers stories and taking their useful advice onboard , and applying it to my own strategies from time to time . <p> I 'm all for trying out new things to see if they might work for me too , but here 's what we have to remember peeps , sometimes we have to go our own way , stand on our own two feet and make our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice to move forward with anything in blogging . <p> Heres what we have to remember : <p> Just because something has worked or is working for somebody else , it does n't  mean you have to follow that persons advice or steps too , because itll- work for you too . <p> Just because you know a bunch of bloggers who are writing and posting daily and benefiting from this , it does n't  mean that you have to go and do the same thing too . <p> Just because you read how blog commenting is supposedly the ultimate way to build a community , - ( aff ) and to connect with other influencers- in your industry , just because it might be the best method , it does n't  mean that you 've got to go out busting your nachos commenting on 10 blogs per day for the rest of your life . <p> Just because Joe Bloggs is writing 10,000 word blog posts over on his " getting naked with nature " blog every single time , it does n't  mean that you have to sit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to figure out how YOU- can write a 20,000 word blog post . <p> Just because I 've recommended a bunch of tools and services- for you to use that have worked for me ! It does n't  mean that you have to go out and buy every single one of those tools to use yourself , because they 're going to work for you too . <p> My point with all of these is that you can read about all of these things online , but take what ever you read with a pinch of salt . At the end of the day you have to do what youre comfortable with doing , what you have time to do and- more importantly , - what works with you and resonates with YOUR audience best . You have to create your own goals , strategies and methods and set your own objectives . <h> You cant do this alone Or can you ? <p> Definitely not I do n't  care what you read and where you read it , - and most bloggers will agree with me here , blogging alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , I 'm truly sorry if you do happen to go to the movies by yourself . <p> But seriously folks , to succeed in any way with blogging asides creating epic content and marketing , you have to build a loyal community and engage with others frequently , whether you like it or not , you cant just write and pray for people to find you and connect with you online , but like I said you cant do it alone but you can do it YOUR way , not how Joe Bloggs always does it . <h> You can do it your own- way , no one will get offended really ! <p> When I share something with you folks that is working for me , I do n't  expect everyone to rush out and copy my strategy part by part , but more over to take parts of it and apply it to there own methods , because chances are what 's working for me might not work for you at all as I keep saying . <p> You can read other blogs , follow other bloggers advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time and to a degree , but not always . <p> You can also read all the how to books you want , books that show you how to do certain things to achieve certain goals , or help you with what ever you 're trying to do . Yes reading books really does help . <p> You can use a bunch of cool tools to help you do great things with your blog and improve your workflow , but at the end of the day , you go your own way in blogging . You might be sat there right now shaking your head disagreeing with me , but I 'm right and I 'll tell you why . <p> You create your own identity in blogging , no one does that for you , and you ca n't be someone you 're not , or try and be like one of your other blogging buddies . <p> You build your blog as a brand your own way , and put out amazing unique and useful content , and even create great unique products that people are going to love . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just your exceptional content and offers , but with your shining personality too. - You do all of these things- not by yourself , but certainly your own way . <h> Final words <p> In the last 12 months I 've been so fortunate to have connected with so many great folks online . <p> These folks- have been part of my journey so far with Magnet4Blogging , and I owe so much to some of these peeps , because I 've learned a great deal from them , they continue to motivate me , teach me , and inspire me to keep moving forward . <p> But at the end of the day , I make my own path in blogging . <p> I try to be nobody else but myself . <p> I am responsible for building and doing the majority of the promotional work for my own brand , though its so nice to have loyal peeps who promote my content from time to time , or give me a kind mention in one of their posts , that feeling is awesome always . <p> OK , enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what about you ! <p> Are you cultivating your own path in blogging , making your own decisions , making your own mistakes ? Or are you hop-skipping on the stepping stones someone else has laid out already ? <h> Have your say <p> Now you 've heard it from me , I 'd love to hear your thoughts on this , so let me know what 's on your mind and leave me a comment below . Perhaps you agree with me , or perhaps you do n't  , and that this post makes absolutely no sense at all to you Which ever the case may be , I 'd love to hear from you . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> I find getting clear on my blog and on my intent helped me be me , life-wise , blogging-wise , all over wise . Power post ! I figure if I can be me , here , and on my blog , I 'll be at peace with my path and I 'll enjoy taking the path . I am a jokester and story teller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying it all in to smart blogging tips . <p> Same deal with my eBooks . My newly released Amazon book tells a few travel stories some funny and helps folks live the life I live . In the tropics . Blogging from paradise . I know how to be me and how to take my own path so I guess any other way would feel awkward and not too natural either . Write how you speak , and write how you be , and you 'll stand out from the crowd , NOT needing to compare yourself to Mr Nature Blogger Guy who does those in depth posts , as you noted . <p> Hi Ryan , how are you mate , thanks for your awesome comment as always . Your stories are truly awesome and I love how you incorporate them into your posts , it works really well , and for fact I never get bored reading your posts . <p> Anyway blogging offers many new challenges to the newcomer I can appreciate that , but it really annoys the heck out of me when people do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it this way and that way . <p> I set up my good friend Kim a website over the weekend for her small business in decorative shabby chic art , and I mentioned that it would be good to add a blog . <p> Her reply was : " no I cant have a blog because I do n't  have time to write posts . " <p> I said : " well OK you do n't  have to update it every day , just once a week you could write something useful and it will help with your brand promotion . " <p> Her reply was : " I cant and do n't  have time to sit and write a 5,000 word blog post every time , I have a business to run too " <p> My reply was : " What the f ? " <p> Yep , she read somewhere that to have a blog or to start blogging that 's what you had to do , and that really annoyed me , because she did n't  have to do any of that . She could write something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I explained that blogging wast about creating rules and regulations and following a code of conduct to the extent where you did n't  know your arse from your elbow , its about writing passionately about your topic , you do n't  count the number of words right , you focus on offering something useful and valuable . <p> I write super long blog posts , you 've written long posts too no doubt , but we do n't  sit with a quota in our heads of how many words were going to write , well I do n't  think I do anyway lol . <p> But like you said , " write how you speak , and write how you be , and you 'll stand out from the crowd " . And if you can mix that up with offering something useful and valuable that will help others , at the same time help to promote your brand and get people talking about you , your products and services then that 's beautiful right ? <p> Hi Lorraine , thanks I appreciate where you 're coming from . I love helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other peeps in my circle and beyond , and that helps me a lot with the decision making that I do when doing my own thing on my blog . <p> One thing I 'd like to teach you is this : Make your blog post titles a bit shorter . When you 've finished writing a post , preview it and click the button to share it on Twitter ( but do n't  ) . Do this to ensure your title , name , and link all fit AND THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR OTHERS NAMES TO BE ADDED when they retweet . This issue is one that is often overlooked by most bloggers , and is one of the tips outlined in my free ebook , 20 Blog Post Must-Haves , which you can get by visiting Wording Well . <p> Lorraine , you know what ? I am so guilty of this , and I do get carried away with lengthly post titles . That 's one thing I 'll do from now on is test tweet the post without making it live to see if it all fits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powerful post my friend and I agree 100% . I am always looking for new influencers to read and connect with ! ! ! It has changed my business radically over the last several months and created some extreme opportunities for me ! <p> While I will always have my core of bloggers I come back to , I 'm always looking for that next group that I can add to the mix . <p> Hey Don , great to see you here mate . So pleased you agree with me here , That 's the way Don , reaching out to new peeps slowly but surely will pay massively in the end , as you begin to promote your brand everywhere . <p> There 's a lot of bloggers Ive followed since the very start and I 'll never stop following them , like you I like coming back to them and being part of the family = <p> When it comes to blogging there is no such thing as one size fits all . Yes , there are certain things needed to do , content , commenting , sharing , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the how-tos in the world , but we must follow our own path . We can pick up some good information and add it to our blogging , and others we just can not It all depends on our niche . And mostly what we are doing besides blogging . Are we marketing something ? etc . <p> And yes , I do follow many of the same bloggers week after week , but I 'm always reaching out to others if I find them interesting . <p> Hi Donna , I hear you and could n't agree more . Blogging is n't just blogging , boy if only it were , there 's a ton of stuff involved asides writing great content . And yes I could n't agree more , the web is jam packed with FREE valuable information so that we can make the right decisions as to where we want to steer our blog . <p> I follow many blogs too , actually my list has grown quite a bit over the last three months alone . I do find it harder now to keep up appearances and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to , because I 'm trying to spread myself over the short amount of time we have in a week lol . <p> I agree with what you 're saying but I think that as things do n't  work for some people they do have to venture out and find more information so they can test the waters to see what works for them . <p> We all know there is no one size fits all and we each do have to find our own way . I listened to the " gurus " for so long . None of what I did was working so I just stopped and started doing it my way and guess what ! It worked and I was even surprised by it but that 's what you 're saying here . <p> Do what 's best for you , venture out and try new things , test the waters elsewhere and see what kind of results you 'll get . I think that 's the only way you 'll ever really learn and grow . <p> Hello Adrienne , yep I agree , sometimes you may need a little more help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a rut . I guess that 's the beauty of being in a great community or having a loyal audience . Sometimes you might think you know what 's best , but it never hurts to get the opinions of others in your field as well , I 've found that useful too in the past . <p> When I started out I assumed there was a one size fits al method , of course , I was new to everything and I read a lot of how to posts and watched a lot of videos . Come to think of it nothings really changed today lol . <p> A lot of what I was trying out myself , even suggestions made from the very best names in blogging I might add , simply did n't  work for me . I had to adapt them into my own methods and understanding , make my own mistakes and things like that . 
@@76508689 @5208689/ <p> The route I would recommend anyone or any business owner to take is to create their own website !

The good news is that you can purchase a domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend signing up to SiteGround. - This is the hosting provider that I use myself for all the websites that I have for my online businesses . <h> Step Two : Install a content management- software ( CMS ) . <p> The best CMS software- I would recommend using for building your business website with is WordPress .

Choosing the right tools for the job can be a bit of a pain . <h> The best of the best <p> These two are amongst the most popular and most powerful opt-in form builder and list building plugins/tools available on the market . In- this comparison post were going to be looking at the following important criterias : <p> In- this comparison post were going to be looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key features . <p> Full features comparison . <p> Marketing tools and metrics . <p> Usability . <p> Pricing . <p> And a bunch of other awesome stuff . <p> Hopefully , by the end of reading this post , you 'll be better informed as to which of these two- will be best suited for your needs and your business needs . <p> Let 's get cracking with this . <h> Thrive Leads VS OptinMonster : Key Differences <p> Let 's first look at some of the key differences between these two Goliath form builders . <h> #1 . OptinMonster is the most popular list building and opt-in form builder available today ! <p> OptinMonster has been around for a little longer than most of its rival competitors , which makes it one of the most popular opt-in form builder and lead generation tool currently being used . <p> At the time of writing this post , OptinMonster is- serving- over 270,000 businesses and marketers around the world , including some of the industries top influencers , i.e.- Chris Brogan , Neil Patel and Joost De Valk . <p> Thrive Leads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin is still relatively new on the market , already has over 44,000 users and growing very fast indeed . <h> #2 . Just available for WordPress , or all other available platforms ? <p> One of the other significant key differences between these two is that OptinMonster is not just available for WordPress , but also available to use on many other popular website building platforms. - Essentially OptinMonster- will work on any website that is built on- HTML . <h> Key Features For Both- Tools <p> OK so let 's dive deeper and compare the built-in multi-tools and features of both Thrive Leads and OptinMonster. <h> #1 . Easy-to-use form builder complete with templates and design elements <p> Now having a built-in form builder that 's simple to use , even for complete newbies , is what really makes both these plugins stand-out from the rest of the pack . <p> Both of these tools offer a simple point , drag and drop form builder , complete with ready-made templates for you to use or customize and drop straight into your site . This essentially means you 're wasting less time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time generating leads . <h> Thrive Leads Form Builder <p> From my own personal experience with using both of these tools , I would go as far to say that Thrive Leads- form builder , gives you far more flexibility than OptinMonsters form builder ! - Again that 's my own opinion purely based on how I 've used both of these tools in my business . <p> With Thrive Leads you get a ton of options and elements to choose from . You also have the- ability to move , add , remove , resize , change literally everything you see in your forms , regardless whether you 're creating a form from scratch , or editing one of the built-in form templates. <h> #2 . API &amp; HTML Integration with all email marketing service platforms <p> Click this link to learn how to integrate MailChimp with Thrive Leads using API connection <p> This is a massive plus point , and more likely than not , both these tools will work regardless of who you use to serve your email marketing emails . <h> Full Features Comparison <p> When it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge punches . Let 's take a look at them below . <p> So there 's very little difference between these two tools as far as features go , which makes it very tough to decide which tool to use for your business . However I will mention this now , not all the features are available with all the OptinMonster plans . Ill talk more about that later on . <p> Thrive are always adding awesome new features to their list building plugin , which makes Thrive Leads- one of the most exciting opt-in form building tools to use for your business . <h> Conversion tracking , optimization , and marketing tools <p> I 'm a complete sucker when it comes to analytical tools , charts , graphs and all kinds of measurable metrics . And no list building plugin would be complete without these essential marketing tools . <p> Both Thrive Leads and OptinMonster offer some very powerful and useful conversion optimization analysis , and metric tools of their own . <h> Pricing <p> Now here 's where things get a little interesting . You 'll see from the comparison chart above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thrive Leads you only pay a one-time fee to use their product . <p> So here are your options : <p> With Thrive Leads you can- pay $67 for a single site use . $97- for an unlimited multi-site use . Or- $49 per month for full- access to not only Thrive Leads- but all the plugins and tools available in the- Thrive Membership , including Thrive Landing Pages , themes and Content Builder . <p> Its worth noting that regardless of the plan you choose , you get full access to all of the features inside of Thrive Leads . <p> With Optin-Monster , - on the other hand , you can pay $49 per year for single site use , and with limited access to features . $99 per year to use on up to 3 sites , with access to everything from- the basic plan , plus some additional features . $199 per year to use on unlimited sites , with access to all features . <h> Pros &amp; Cons <p> OK so far so good , right ? Now let 's take a quick look at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools . <p> User interface although attractive- can be a little confusing until you get used to it . <h> Verdict <p> Personally , I love both of these tools . They both boast a ton of awesome features and benefits and complete ease-of-use . Its easy to see why they 're both industry leaders . However there can only be one clear winner here , for me at least , and that 's Thrive Leads . <p> Again , Thrive Leads has n't  been around for that long , - yet- its already busting at the seams with a ton of awesomeness. - The built-in conversion optimization and tracking tools is- simply a winner for me . In addition , Thrive Leads is constantly evolving into a better tool/plugin . <p> Secondly , the price structure I think is hugely appealing with Thrive Leads . If you have more than- one site that you want to build an email list on , then Thrive Leads at just $67 one-time payment- for unlimited sites , is pretty hard to beat . <p> So Shane and Co have done wonders with this plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this is n't to say that OptinMonster is n't a great tool- because it absolutely is. 270,000 users ca n't be wrong , but I guess it comes down to your personal preference at the end of the day , and what youd really like to achieve with your list building efforts . <p> Ill now leave you to decide which tool to use . Enjoy . <p> Post Views : 1,158 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Honestly I shouldve looked into Thrive Leads a bit further when I chose to upgrade my pop-up plugin ( I was using Pippity previously ) but I just went immediately into OptinMonster because at the time I believed it to be the best in the price range . <p> Usually I 'm better at doing my due dilligence and when my 1 year is over maybe I 'll end up making the switch . Youve definitely given some compelling reasons to choose Thrive Leads over OptinMonster , especially for the price . <p> For now though there 's really nothing that makes me want to immediately switch OptinMonster is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always looking to improve ! <p> Hi James , Thrive Leads is a great tool , with a lot of powerful features built . I would recommend it to anyone . The conversion metrics and tools , as well as the ability to have full control over opt-in form design is among the big stand out features . <p> Its still a relatively new tool on the market and already with so many new features being added , Thrive are making a lot of noise with this one . <p> Hey Kim , your son made the right choice = OptinMonster is the most popular by far of course , plenty of people swear by it . I love it too and its easy to use , though Ive now stopped using it and replaced on my websites with Thrive Leads , only because of the extensive features and marketing tools built in . Plus I love having full control over my opt-in form designs .

Disable new user registration on your WordPress site <p> If you 're not accepting guest posts or do n't  want anyone to register to your WordPress site , simply make sure that they can not register . <p> You can do this by going to Settings &gt; General .

Use a well-coded WordPress theme <p> Many free WordPress themes are OK to use when you 're just starting out or experimenting with your site , but in time you might want to upgrade to a premium quality theme like Genesis or Thrive . <p> Sure they cost a little bit of money initially , but they 're called premium themes for a good reason . <h> #5 .

Avoid installing too many scripts or codes on your site ( or on your web server ) <p> Often WordPress users will install many scripts and custom codes to avoid having to use too many- plugins- or to add extra functionality to their sites .

Keep yourself informed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for something to happen and then have a panic attack , educate yourself and learn what you can do in advance to prevent any types of brute force attacks in the future . <p> The fact that you 're reading this post is a sign that you are serious about preventing brute force attacks on your WordPress site . Good for you . <h> #13 . Avoid using username " admin " <p> When manually adding new admins to your site ( should you ever need to ) , avoid using the username " admin " . That 's a real amateur thing to do anyway . <p> If you 're currently using the name " admin " for your website then consider changing it immediately . <p> To change it is very simple . Simply create a new admin account with a different username and email . Then transfer all the posts and pages over to the new admin account from your old admin account ( this is done when you are deleting- your old admin name to transfer posts ) . <p> You 'll need to delete the old admin account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . <p> If you make a mistake doing this , you could lose all your posts , so make sure you know what you 're doing . I wont be held responsible . Oh , and remember to backup . <h> #14 . Create stronger passwords <p> In addition to using stronger passwords , make it a habit to change your passwords every few months . <h> #15 . Use one contributor account for all guest posts <p> Now , this is something that not a lot of bloggers will want to do . <p> However , creating a single contributor account for all guest posts will not only save you time having to keep track of multiple- accounts- but can also save some space on your database and decrease the chance of having an account hacked into . <p> When ever I publish a guest post on any of my blogs , I always use one single guest post account and add the user bio of the guest author to the bottom of the blog post . <p> So there you go , follow just a few of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mentioned above and you 'll have a safe and secure WordPress website. 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> This is a great list of tips here , several of which I had to learn the hard way . I will never forget the day I logged on only to see my site had been defaced due to an exploit in a plugin ( I had way too many installed at the time ! ) <p> I will also never forget the time my web host threatened to shut me down because too many emails were being sent from my web server . Turns out , I never disabled registration and tons of spam accounts were being made . That was lovely . <p> Hopefully people take the advice here to heart and do n't  put it off until something bad happens to them ! <p> Hi James , glad you enjoyed the post . I 've had plugin trouble before way back when I first started using WordPress properly . What a headache that was . Web hosts can be a little bit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to excessive CPU throttling , so I moved hosts . <p> Hey Kimbo , wow that must have been some headache . I use BlogVault at present to backup the site , but thinking about moving over to VaultPress or BackupBuddy . I 've a lot of great things about both . As I mentioned in the post I use WordFence for security , the premium service is great and affordable for a yearly subscription . <p> These days we have to protect our blogs and business websites , especially when its our livelihood . 
@@76508695 @5208695/ <p> The route I would recommend anyone or any business owner to take is to create their own website ! Or at least learn how to . <p> With this option you have greater control and ownership of- your content and your online presence . <p> Creating a website for your business is n't rocket science at all , this page will help you get set up quickly and painlessly . <h> Step One : Get a domain name and web hosting . <p> When thinking about- purchasing a domain name for your business ( example.com ) , I would highly recommend using the same name as your business , if it already exists offline. - That might sound like such obvious advice , but you 'd be surprised as to how many businesses create a website with a totally different domain name from their actual business name . <p> I would also recommend you use a popular extension , i.e. . com or . net for your domain name . <p> Buy a domain name and web hosting together ! The good news is that you can purchase a domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend signing up to SiteGround. - This is the hosting provider that I use myself for all the websites that I have for my online businesses . <h> Step Two : Install a content management- software ( CMS ) . <p> The best CMS software- I would recommend using for building your business website with is WordPress . WordPress is a free open source platform ( WordPress.org ) . <p> Here are some benefits of using WordPress for your business website : <p> Access to a host of themes available online to make your website truly personal to your brand . <p> Access to a- host of plugins available online to make your website functional in every way possible . <p> Simple to use without the need to learn complicated HTML or CSS ( coding ) . Though some knowledge will only expand your creativity with WordPress . <p> Adding WordPress to your website ! The other good news is that almost all reliable web host providers will have some simple method for installing- WordPress into a website , and with just a few clicks too . Again , SiteGround- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to do that . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 
@@76508697 @5208697/ <p> In this post I want to share with you 4 ways to use effective call-to-actions in your blog posts . <p> Almost every blog will use a call-to-action of some sort , depending on what type of response they 're looking for from their blog visitors , call to actions can be of any- type . <p> I want to look- at using effective call to actions to encourage visitors to do four- things on your blog : <p> To- engage with your content <p> To explore other content on your blog <p> To subscribe to your blog <p> To share your blog content on social media sites <p> Of course the very first step- to encouraging visitors to do those four things outlined above , - is not by adding call-to-actions all over the place , but to actually write compelling content that will make your visitors WANT- to take action . <p> OK so how do you harness the power of using effective- call to actions- in your blog posts to achieve the four things I mentioned above ? <p> Let 's take a look . <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> #1 . Use call to actions to encourage content exploration Funny old phrase to use I know , but to me content exploration means reading- and digesting more than one piece of content on a blog , exploring other pages- thus spending longer on a- blog . <p> Some ways to encourage visitors to explore other content- on your blog is to use related posts and popular posts plugins of various types , but you can also use effective call-to-actions to recommend other posts too , by linking to other content as you know . <p> Tip : Instead of linking keywords or a string of phrases to other related content- the old boring- way , actually ask your readers to check out the posts you recommend them to read . <p> An example of this would be the method I use to recommend other posts . See the image below. - <p> I kindly- ask my readers- to check out the post I 'm linking to . You can put it in a nice quote as well like I do , which I think- highlights the- call to action/link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Theres nothing worst than seeing a blog with no comments . A post with zero comments does very little to encourage- others to leave a comment , so you need to add a call-to-action again , kindly asking people- to leave a comment , here are some ideas and suggestions on how to do- that : <p> Use the last paragraph to request comments , for example use a title- like " Now its your turn " or " Have your say " , followed by a unique comment request . <p> Post- questions ( where appropriate ) , during and at the end of your post . Questions are great to get readers involved in the conversation , and it shows that you care about their thoughts , opinions and experiences too . <p> Occasionally- invite your readers to suggest- and share links to related posts from their own blog , perhaps they wrote an article- similar to yours that can provide additional value to the post theyve just read . <p> Post a mini quiz at the end of your post . <p> In addition to encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog should n't be a challenge for your readers , it should be simple and fun . <p> #3 . Use call-to-actions to encourage newsletter signup- This is one call to action you probably do n't  want to neglect , especially if your aim is to increase traffic to your blog in the long run , and to get more people reading your content in the future . <p> There are several call-to-actions you can use for directing visitors- to signup . <p> The first method is to place an opt-in form at the end of your posts with your request like most blogs have . <p> The second- method is to create a paragraph at the end of your post and use something like , " Enjoyed reading this post , signup for future updates " as the title , followed by a unique request to signup , with a link to your signup page . If you have an eBook to giveaway as an incentive for signing up , then do n't  forget to add a link to it in your call-to-action . Keep it clean and simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blog to the next level ? Download my free eBook , the ultimate guide to Smarter Blogging ! <p> In addition , and if you use WordPress of course , consider installing the Click To Tweet plugin to create click-to-tweet boxes anywhere in your posts . <p> Do n't  forget to add call to actions at the end of your posts- as well , if you do n't  ask for people to share your post on Facebook , Twitter or Google+ , chances are they may- forget to ! <p> Take a look at the simple call to action box that I have placed at the bottom of my posts titled , " Take The Conversation Further " . <p> This is an idea that I picked up from the CopyBlogger blog . See image below . <h> Conclusion <p> These are just some examples and ideas of how to use effective call to actions in your blog posts , of course there are many other- ways to use them , depending on what type of response you 're looking for from your audience . <p> Experiment with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take action when they 're reading , or finished reading your blog posts , keep them on your site for longer , ask them to share a post or comment on one , ask them to signup and join your email list . <h> Have- Something To Say ? <p> Do you have something to add to this post ?

I particularly like the " sign up if you liked this post " idea . I have been toying with the idea of putting an opt in box in the middle of a post - " read more . " . Is this too pushy ? <p> Hi Anna thanks for visitng , glad you enjoyed the post . When you say you want to add an email opt-in box in the middle of your post , do you mean that you want to encourage people to signup to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> That 's interesting , Ive seen this done on a few blogs Ive visted in the past . It sounds like it could be a good idea to try out at least , it would certainly highlight those who are serious enough about your content to subscribe to it . At the same time it sounds like a forceful tactict and may put some people off =

Minify resources <p> Again , you can learn more about the benefits of doing this here in much greater detail , but generally speaking , minifying your resources helps to improve your page load time . <p> To achieve this for my own website I installed another fantastic little plugin called Better WordPress Minify . You can once again- grab this plugin here . <p> As you can see from the General Options above in Better WordPress Minify , I can minify JavaScrip and CSS . <p> There are also some advanced options that I can make changes to as well . <h> #4 . Leverage browser caching via . htaccess <p> This was a bit of a challenge at first I will admit to that . <p> Unfortunately I was n't able to find a dedicated plugin out there to help me solve the browser caching issue . <p> What I was able to find however was- a great article written by Thomas Griffin detailing the procedures of leveraging browser caching in WordPress via . htaccess . <p> Do n't  worry ! It might sound technically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and if I can do it , so can you . You can read Thomass post here . <p> I was able to apply the code provided in Thomass article to my . htaccess file and deal with most cacheable resources , but not all of them , regardless it helped to increase my score slightly , so thanks Thomas . <h> #5 . Eliminate render blocking ( JavaScript , not CSS ) <p> OK before you jump up and down with joy thinking I 've found a solution , I 've not been able to completely resolve this issue . <p> I 've checked the forums over on WordPress.org and no one seems to know of a complete solution ( Yet ) . <p> There are some plugins available but upon testing a few of them , they ended up breaking my theme more than solving a problem , so be careful with any plugins you find . <p> What I was able to do however is eliminate render blocking for JavaScript only , using one simple plugin that I found . <p> However , I 'm not able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on that one . <p> The plugin that I 'm currently using to solve the JavaScript issue is called Scripts-to-Footer and can be found here . <p> Again this is a plug-and-play plugin , and you can turn on or off the plugin in specified posts or pages if you wish . <h> Wrapping things up <p> So there you go , as you can see I 've been able to do a few simple things to try and improve my Google PageSpeed Insights score overall by pasting some codes , optimising a few images , and at the cost of installing a few extra plugins . <p> Most of the plugins are plug-and-play , so fairly lightweight . <p> I will be updating this post in the future no doubt , as and when I find better solutions and tools that I can use and recommend to continue improving my PageSpeed Insights score , there 's always room for improvement , right ? 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 
@@76508700 @5208700/ <p> That being said , I believe that writing less is often best . I believe that posting less content on your blog will make you a better blogger . <p> You might totally disagree , but here 's what Ive found from writing only one to two really good posts per week on my own blog . <h> Why reducing your blog writing and posting frequency will make you a better blogger <h> #1 . Writing less will help you focus more on the quality of your posts <p> If you 're able to write every single day and produce high-quality content each time , then congratulations to you . Me personally , and I 'm sure I speak for many others too , I find that I create better quality posts when I have more time to work on them . <p> Blog writing is not a rapid process by any means , it takes a lot of planning , research , writing , editing , editing again , writing some more and so on . <p> Youve heard the saying " Focus on quality , not quantity " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay attention and put all your heart and soul into writing a great piece of quality content , it wo n't get unnoticed . <p> People love to not only read a quality post but also share and talk about great content like their lives depends on it . <h> #2 . You 'll never run out of post ideas again <p> Having more time to think about the topics you want to write about means that you 'll hardly ever run out of post ideas . <p> The time and energy required to brainstorm ideas each time you have to write a new piece of content can be all too overwhelming . I know this from making this mistake earlier in my blogging career . <p> I only write 1 to 2 posts each week about , however , in my blog content planner I have over 40 blog post ideas I could write about . All of them great valid topic ideas too . <h> #3 . You 'll have more time to focus on other areas of your blog <p> This is a big one for me when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my blog and online business , like serving my clients and doing marketing and promotion . <h> #4 . It gives your audience more time with your content <p> Writing only a few posts each week gives my readers sufficient time to read and digest my content properly . And when they leave comments , that 's when I begin to learn more about their needs and desires . <h> #5 . You 'll have more time to spend on content promotion <p> Again for me , content promotion takes the majority of my time when I 'm not writing for my blog . <p> Writing less gives me more time to focus on getting doing marketing and promotion for both new and old content . <p> So peeps , as a result of reducing my blogging frequency , I 've been able to reap some excellent benefits : <p> I do n't  have to fear too much whether my blog posts are good enough or not for my readers - ( I believe that if you 've spent enough time crafting your blog posts , ensuring that what you 've written is valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it , then you wont have to stress too much about whether it will appeal to your readers or not . ) <p> I do n't  have to stress too much about what to write about next . <p> As well as having more time to focus on other areas of my blog development and online business , I- also have more time for myself , my family , and my friends . <p> I- have more time to better connect and nurture my relationships with my blog readers . <p> I- have more time to accurately measure the results of my blog and content promotion efforts . <h> Conclusion <p> Publishing one or two blog posts per week is n't everyone 's ideal strategy I know , and as I said it depends on many factors as to why you should reduce your blogging frequency . But as you can clearly , see there are some great benefits for doing so . <p> Also , remember this , if you 're burning the candle at both ends , i.e. working full-time , have family commitments and trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if you 're simply struggling to find good topics to write about , consider dropping your blogging frequency , you might just benefit if not stop yourself from burning out . <p> If you can think of any other good reasons to reduce your blogging frequency please send me an email and let me know . Perhaps its something I can add to this post . <p> Or if you do n't  believe that writing less is a good strategy , I 'd love to know why too .

When I started my new site I wanted to dive straight in wit x3 weekly , but it just was n't possible , and both sites started to suffer . I am now working on building it up slowly . <p> We must always make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its not.dont post it ! <p> Hi Catherine , thanks for stopping by and I completely agree with you , I was in a similar boat . Over the years I started ( and ended ) numerous blogs as they became too time consuming . At one point I was running 6 blogs and trying to post 3 posts per week on each blog , 18 posts per week was a killer , so in the end I ended 4 of those blogs and migrated some of the relevant and popular posts to my main site . <p> As you say its way better to focus on quality and value rather than to sacrifice it for quanity . <p> All the best and thanks again for visiting , hope to see you here again soon = <p> I have done some experiment twice on my blog . When I just moved to Enstinemuki.com , I published daily ( including weekends ) for about 30 days . My alexa dropped to 94k within just 1 month . About 2 weeks today , I have been publishing almost daily again and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has doubled . That 's the biggest advantage I have noticed . <p> But to be frank , I have been working like a horse with less time to promote my content as I used to . I have less time to comment on other blogs or even reply to comments on my blog . That means less time to engage with others like you mentioned . <p> Hi Enstine , great to see you here again , I did something very similar when I was blogging over at Magnet4Marketing a few years ago , yes my findings were similar to yours , increase in traffic and improved Alexa , but the moment I dropped my posts from 6 per week to 3 per week , traffic was less impressive , but I had more time to focus on QUALITY and PROMOTION . <p> I truly believe that posting 1 to 3 posts per week is the best way to ensure you 're creating epic content for your blog , whilst being able to focus on other areas of your blog . <p> Hi Van , Youve really made a great point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ? How posts within a day or week is considered as too much ? I was posting three times a week but had to drop it to 2 but I occasionally post thrice within a week as I value promotion more important than just writing as well . <p> I could n't give you a figure as to how many posts would be too much , I 'm really just highlighting the benefits of writing less and having more time to do other things . <p> But if I had to give a number I would probably say posting daily is a bit much , for me in any case as I do n't  have the time to post daily , so yes posting a blog post per day to me is slightly excessive , unless <p> Unless of course you are able to create amazing content each time , every day , or you have a host of world-class bloggers guest blogging on your blog who are able to write great content every day for you . <p> But <p> Even if you were able to write an awesome piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trying to promote each post would be insance , and therefore I do n't  believe each post ( posted daily ) would get the attention it truly deserved if that makes sense . <p> Hi there , thanks for the article . When I first started blogging one of the things they told me was to post often . What happened was soon I got burned out and I had to stop all together . It seems to become more of an obligation , instead of something that I enjoy doing . <p> Now in days , I publish a lot less . But this gives me more time to study more and producer higher quality content . <p> Great comment , and that was exactly one of the reasons why I decided to reduce blogging frequency too . Burning out is a motivation killer , and if you 're exhausting all your resources , blogging becomes a chore and the fun is removed entirely . Thanks for dropping by mate = <p> Hi Fabrizio If we admit that blogging has changed a lot so we should also accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring to wait and wait of feedback after posting just once in a week . But after a few weekly posting results are visible to everyone when you have strong readers engagement and you get huge feedback from your niche audience . Also you do have to read a lot and think a lot to produce something remarkable . Thanks for sharing on a very heated topic that 's a brilliant stuff for all . <p> I think the most important one here ( all are valid ) is " You 'll have more time to spend on content promotion " . If you are not promoting your articles and not connecting with people who can help promote those articles ( which means you have to help promote theirs ) , you can write all day long to no one . <p> I agree , write one or two a week and spend the time promoting and marketing them . <p> Here is what I ve learned . Because of the promotion and over a hundred comments with a week per article , I learn what my readers are thinking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I learn that , I can blog more to their problems because I 'm sure they are not the only ones . What happens is they begin sharing those articles more and more and it takes on a life of its own each week . Plus , I connect on article to another and reference it with a link and people reading a new article to them visit the others ; and many times go into other parts of the site to buy because we educated and solved a problem in the blog and did n't  try to sell them there at all . <p> I publish a new blog post once a week for all the reasons that you mentioned above . I do n't  like to be stressed out about things . I like to take my time . It does take a lot of time to promote your blog posts and it can be hard to promote many at one time . I think your readers appreciate your blog posts a lot more too and it also gives them time to really enjoy and absorb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us ! <p> I have really found this to be true . I used to be all about frequency and quanity , but since I started publishing less , I have noticed an increase in the quality of each post . Also , like you said , it is less stressful to not have to worry about topics as much . 
@@76508701 @5208701/ <h> 1 . MailChimp- signup forms and response email settings <p> Let me share with you exactly how I have- these setup for my website . <p> Its very simple because most of the settings and configurations are actually made in Thrive Leads . Although I do add some small customization to the opt-in forms in MailChimp , I prefer to use my own custom built forms using Thrive Leads . <p> The only pages I customize in MailChimp are the ones highlighted . See image below . <p> So these pages include : <p> Signup form <p> Signup form with alerts <p> Opt-in confirmation email <p> Opt-in confirmation reCAPTCHA <p> Final welcome email <p> The reason the signup thank you page and the confirmation thank you page- are both grayed out in the image above , is because I already created these- inside my- WordPress site using another plugin called Thrive Content Builder . <p> Why ? <p> I prefer to create a custom thank you page on my website instead of sending new subscribers to a default thank you page somewhere in MailChimp . <p> The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my site after they- subscribe , I like to keep my visitors on the same page they were on when they opted in . It just creates a better user experience for them I think . <p> Plus with a custom thank you page I can add my own content , links , and offers . <p> So once I have all these pages setup , the next step I take is configuring Thrive Leads with MailChimp using API connection . <h> 2 . MailChimp to Thrive Leads API connection <p> To set up and configure Thrive Leads with MailChimp is ever so easy . Just follow the steps below . <p> Log into your MailChimp account . In the top right-hand corner , click on the little face-down arrow and you 'll see a list of options . You 'll see Profile in the drop-down menu . Click on it . See image below . <p> Hit Connect and with a bit of luck , you should have completed the API connection for Thrive Leads and MailChimp . You can always test the connection from- the Active Connections dashboard . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you need to do is connect your custom Thrive Leads opt-in forms to your email list in MailChimp using API connection . This is the easy part . <p> Go to Thrive Leads and then go to edit one of your opt-in form designs as you would normally . See below . <p> In the opt-in form editor page , click on the actual opt-in form email field to edit it . See below . <p> You will see the Lead Generation Option bar pop up . Now click on the button that says Connect with Service as shown below . See image below . <p> You can now create a new connection for your form . Hit the button Create a new Connection . See image above . <p> You have the- option to either connect- with HTML or with API . Select API as your type of connection . Then click on Go to the next step . See image above . <p> OK so now choose from your list of existing API connections . Since we already done the set up for MailChimp in Step 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected , and the name of your mailing list . <p> You can also choose Grouping , and I would just ensure that you have Doube-optin enabled as well . Once you 're done simply hit Save . See image above . <p> Youve successfully set up MailChimp with Thrive Leads .

@@76508702 @5208702/ <p> Ask any experienced blogger , they will tell you that building a loyal and targeted- blog- audience is just one of the steps required- for achieving blogging success . <p> But what do we define as being a loyal and targeted audience ? <p> I guess a- loyal and targeted audience would be identified as a large group of- readers that visit your blog frequently . And readers that love your content so much- that they come back to see what you 're offering- every single time you hit that publish button , <p> You can build a targeted audience for your blog in the form of an email list . <p> OK so there are many key factors to be take into consideration when trying to- convert more of your blog visitors into subscribers . <p> But these are not the only factors . In this post I will share with you some powerful steps that you can take to help you convert more people that come to your blog , into loyal regular readers and subscribers . <h> #01. - Turn your homepage into a lead generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Google Analytics , you 'll no doubt see that your homepage is one of the most visited , if not the most visited page on your blog . <p> Now the normal thing to do , as most bloggers do , is to show the most recent blog post entries on the homepage , along with your sidebar items . <p> A few smart bloggers however will use their homepage quite differently . Theyll use it for several things : <p> To provide a true message about what their blog is about , their business , goals , objectives mission statement etc <p> To use it as an effective lead generation page . <p> Check out Pat Flynns blog the SmartPassiveIncome blog , or check out this blog even ! You 'll immediately notice that you 're not greeted with a list of blog posts from the archive , but more over , a powerful message about the site you 've just landed on , and a call-to-action . <p> If you want to generate more leads you 've got to let go of the old tactics and embrace the new ones . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your messaging and offers and call to action . <p> Creating a custom homepage is a- very simple thing to do . If you 're using WordPress you 'll first need to create a new static page in your dashboard , then use your static page as your blogs homepage in Settings &gt; Reading . <p> When done correctly dedicated opt-in pages can work wonders in converting more of your visitors into subscribers . <h> #03 . Turn your blogs about page into a subscriber magnet <p> Now again , if you take a look at your Google Analytics data you might notice that your blogs about page is one of the other most visited pages on your blog . <p> If it is , then you should seriously consider adding your email opt-in form to this page too , perhaps at the bottom of the page with your personal message . <p> Some bloggers will add several opt-in forms to their about page , depending on how much content they have on this page . Usually one is added about halfway through and another at the end . <p> How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend no more than two opt-in forms . <h> #04 . Eliminate any conversion killing distractions <p> Now I mentioned that one of the advantages of creating a dedicated opt-in page is so that you can eliminate any distractions such as menus , ads and sidebars items . <p> Generally you should try and do the same throughout your blog . For instance , a lot of bloggers fill their sidebars and headers with a lot of clutter . Things like ads and banners , intro videos , blog rolls and a bunch of other gimmicks . <p> All these are distractions and conversion killers . So my tip for you here would be to reduce the number of widgets and items you have in your sidebar , and leave only your signup form clearly at the top above the fold . Ill talk more about visibility above the fold in a moment . <p> Give visitors fewer options and make one of those options to signup " very prominently " . <h> #05 . Remind visitors why they are subscribing to your blog , entice them with something cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog ? Yes your blog ! That 's what you need to ask yourself . <p> If your visitors are landing on either your blogs homepage , your about page , or your lead capture page and they do n't  know what your blog is about , they 're not really going to- consider subscribing ro be honest . <p> Your message has to clear and concise . <p> In addition its also important to let people know what they 're signing up for , it could be to get access to your info-packed- email newsletter , or to get access to your free report or eBook or other exclusive content. - Whatever the reason , make sure they know the benefits of why they 're signing up . <p> Use bullet-points , ticks and arrows to highlight key features and benefits etc . <p> Add- social proof if you already have 500 or 1,000 subscribers on your list , mention it ! <h> #06 . Make it really simple for visitors to signup <p> People love simplicity . When it comes to filling in forms online , they do n't  like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . <p> Create and use an attractive , clutter free opt-in form , usually two entry fields is plenty enough , a name field and an email field . <p> Avoid adding too many options such as tick boxes and CAPTCHAS , if you 're using a reliable email marketing service provider such as MailChimp- you can ask them to confirm their email address in the signup process . <p> A great plugin for WordPress users to use for building clean and attractive opt-in forms is Thrive Leads ! <h> #07 . Provide a valuable incentive <p> When your blog visitors consider whether to subscribe to your blog or not , usually its based on the quality of your content , and one other factor- " what 's in it for me ? " <p> Which is why incentives work wonders ! <p> If you 're unsure about what an incentive is , an incentive is something you give away to people for subscribing to your email list , like a free report or eBook . <p> Free exclusive and extremely valuable content such as video tutorials and podcasts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the fold <p> It is common knowledge that placing your essential elements above the fold can help boost conversions , in this case being your call to action or email signup form . <p> Above the fold means the line before visitors have to scroll down to see the rest of a web page content . This should apply to not just your homepage , but your email page , about page , blog page and any other page that you use to generate email leads . <h> #09 . Add call to action at the end of your blog posts <p> Adding a call-to-action at the end of your blog post is something very simple to do and can help you convert many more readers into subscribers , but even though its common knowledge , very few bloggers implement this strategy . <p> Once again , your call-to-action could be an email signup form , or a simple line of text giving your readers instructions as to what youd like them to do next . <p> here 's an example of a very simple but effective call to action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reading this post , I hope you 've enjoyed the tips here today and that you 're going to take action and use them on your blog .

So finally , here are my 12 top tips to help you with designing and building your email lead capture page in WordPress. <h> 12 Lead Generation Page Building Tips <h> #1 . Use a static page and not a blog style page <p> If you 're not too sure what a static page is , its simply a page created in WordPress that does n't  have a time stamp or any tags or categories allocated to it . it is simply a still page if you like . <p> Static pages are awesome for building evergreen content ( Content that rarely needs updating- and content that can be accessed anytime from your sites main navigation menu ) . <p> Pages such as your sites contact page , about page , services page , products pages , sales pages can all be created using static pages . <h> #2. - Make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page permalink or URL short and relevant . Here are some examples : <p> yourwebsite.com/signup <p> **26;58;TOOLONG <p> yourwebsite.com/joinhere <p> Why must you do this ? <p> Well , for one simple reason : <p> A short URL is easier for people to remember . And if they remember it , they can come back to it later , or recommend the link to a friend and so forth . <h> #7 . Place your opt-in form close to the top of your page <p> Your opt-in form or signup form should be visible without your readers having to scroll too far down to find it . This will help your conversions greatly . <p> If you have a lot of content on your landing page , consider placing your signup form several times on the page , i.e. at the top , one in the middle and perhaps one at the bottom . <h> #8 . Remove conversion crushing distractions <p> An email opt-in landing page should n't be surrounded by other content elements . These are just conversion crushing distractions . <p> Consider removing the sidebar , main menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do n't  need them . You can do this simply by- changing the default layout to full-width content for your page . Or , by changing the default template to landing . See image below . <h> #9 . Use video content <p> Adding video content to your landing page could not only help you connect with your potential subscribers on a personal level , but it can also help boost your conversions like you 'd never imagine . <p> Insivia reported that adding video content to landing pages can increase conversions by a whopping 80% ! <h> #10 .

And like I said we 've been doing a lot of family stuff which I enjoy , - going off on driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So- it 's all fun really , and that 's what its all about , that 's what I love about being my own boss and working from home and doing this whole blogging thing so that I can spend way more time focused on my family and doing- fun things . <p> And I 'm sure any of you listeners in a similar situation can relate , and appreciate that running an online business from home or blogging is hard work and time consuming , but it gives you a lot of time to do the things you want in life , and focus on the things that really matter as well . <p> But of course with all that being said , family is important and doing fun things is great , I still need to be able to priorities work and hopefully next year- will be better , with my kids extending their time at school , because at the moment they 're only there for a few hours each day , so next year when they 're at school for much longer , I 'll be able to organise my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work when I should be spending time with them . <p> OK so let 's dive straight into the content for this episode and what I want to do is share with you 4- rock solid ways , to get onto the radar of top bloggers and influencers in your industry , in your niche . <p> So I 'm talking about getting noticed by- bloggers that are much higher up than you perhaps in terms of popularity and authority , so hopefully the tips I 'm going to share with you will help you stand out more and get noticed more . " <h> #1 . Create Great Content Really ? ? ? <p> " OK so the first thing you want to be seen doing is creating great content for your blog <p> YES , yes , I know this sounds like a cliche , and yes you 've heard this piece of advice a million times before already folks , you must create great content , you 've GOT to create great content , content is king and all the rest of it , but it 's true , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To get noticed by the top bloggers in your industry etc , your content has to stand out . <p> And- I 'm not talking about creating boring old mediocre , rehashed , heard before , generic , call it what ever you want type of content . <p> And I 'm not talking about going out and buying a bunch of crappy spun articles- in bulk so that you can publish on your blog every now and then . <p> To be honest there 's enough boring rehashed- content around , - and not just in the form of articles and blog posts , there are videos and endless PDF books that all repeat the same old thing . And most of the time those types of content have little to no engagement value . <p> I 'm also talking about writing your own content as well , not buying content in bulk as I mentioned , but writing your own content , that 's very important in the interest that- you wish- to give your blog a unique voice and show off your personality and make your blog memorable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a couple of examples of the types of blog posts for instance , that could really help you create some stand out content for your blog . <p> 1 ) Case studies You know , Neil Patel and Mathew Woodward are two examples of authority bloggers that are crushing it right now with case studies ! A lot of other bloggers are starting to follow suite as well . And its these kind of posts- can really help to make you stand out as an authority blogger too . <p> If you 're not aware of what case studies are , they 're simply monster blog posts that are packed with tons of information , data and statistics based on research . They contain reports , theories , findings and provide proof as well for what ever cause . They just offer a ton of value . There 's an awesome article on HubSpot titled 15 Important Ways To Use Case Studies In Your Marketing , do check it out sometime . <p> 2 ) Expert roundup posts Something I 've just started experimenting with myself . Last week I published my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it help me get noticed . That post alone doubled my daily referral traffic , social shares , comments , backlinks and a whole lot more . <p> I also saw an increase- in email conversions , and people were signing up for my exclusive offers etc . I also added a content upgrade to that post to make it even more valuable . Ill talk more about content upgrades in another episode . In addition to all of this , I was also able to- generate a few affiliate sales as well . <p> So I highly recommend you try creating a few expert roundup posts for your blog too . You can outsource this service if you do n't  have the time , but creating them yourself is far more rewarding . <p> By the way if you missed my expert roundup where I asked 23 top bloggers what their favourite marketing tactic was for new blog posts , I 'll have a link in the show notes . Ill be writing up another post in the coming months where I 'll be sharing the very steps that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 ) In-depth tutorials - These types of blog posts do n't  get the credit they deserve sometimes , tutorials are great problem identifiers and problem solvers . Now if you can create a bunch of useful tutorials on your blog , perhaps on how to use certain tools , or how to do something to achieve something , or perhaps share something that 's been working for you in particular . Do it , because they can get you noticed and they can give your blog the credibility and authority it deserves . <p> Tutorials combined with case studies and well constructed product reviews are the posts that I love to create on my blog , and the posts that are mostly responsible for the affiliate sales I make here on Magnet4Blogging . <p> So folks those are just three examples of post types that you can create to help you stand out and get noticed online . But essentially what ever you decide to do , - just remember that- each post you put out on your blog has to offer value beyond comprehension . <p> When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I keep two things in the back of my mind always . " <p> What 's in it for my readers ? What can they benefit from reading my posts , what actionable things can they take away to implement right away <p> How much value can I add into this post ? If I 'm writing a post on a topic that 's already been discussed before , I 'll ask myself , how can I make my post more valuable ? How can I make it better ? <p> " OK so peeps , that 's the first thing you want to be seen doing : creating amazing content . Because if you ca n't create great compelling content for your blog for what ever reason , you might as well forget about moving forward and getting noticed and growing your blog as a business. - You might as well also forget about the other three- tactics that I 'm about to share with you in this episode , because they simply wo n't matter . " <h> #2 . Have A- Unique And Professional Blog Design <p> " Ok so number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your content . <p> Now why is this so overlooked by a lot of bloggers and marketers out there ? For me , the concept of do n't  judge a website by its design does n't  work . <p> And I can not begin to tell you how many sites I 've visited over the years that have actually hurt my eyes looking at them , and have- tested my patience as well . <p> Now as a web designer I 'm not trying to be picky or biased or anything like that , but your blog needs to look the part if you 're going to impress influencers in any way , it needs to stand out . <p> Even if you have great content , it needs to be presented nicely . And also having a great blog design says a lot about the owner of that blog , it shows they 're committed to making a real difference and wanting to get noticed . <p> So with that said , you need to have a blog- design that 's clean and bold , well structured and organised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve a great looking blog design , you do n't  have to- go out and find a web designer to create a custom blog for you , you can make some of those changes yourself to optimise your site better , just by removing the needless things . Or you can just invest in a new cleaner modern looking theme , perhaps something like Genesis or Thrive . <p> It means sharing other bloggers content on social media sites frequently , and if you 're doing link roundup posts on your own blog , it can work wonders to mention those bloggers by linking back to one or two of their posts from time to time . <p> Now from my own personal experience of doing this , this does n't work all of the time , you kind of learn to identify the bloggers that are interested in engaging with you and wanting to make a connection , and the ones that are simply not interested in responding to anybody let alone take notice of you . <p> But it is important that you do make a conscious effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can , because all it really takes is making one critical connection with one top influencer , and for them to mention you on their site or their blog , or to even offer you the opportunity to guest post on their blog , and that could literally change- the course of your blogging path in a positive way . <p> Networking and making connections is just one of the major key ingredients to helping you get noticed online . <p> There are some great tools to help you create very effective blogger outreach campaigns out there , NinjaOutreach is the tool I 'm currently using myself and recommend for finding bloggers and influencers in your industry. - One of - benefits- of using this online application is that its a huge time and money saver . <p> Ill have a link to this online tool in the show notes for you to check out . " <h> #4 . Be everywhere <p> " OK so tip number four is to be everywhere . Something I learned a long time ago listening to one of Pat Flynns podcast shows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before too . But when I say be everywhere , I do n't mean comment on every single blog you find out there , or to pitch your guest post to every other blogger you bump into . <p> I mean use every available platform that you can comfortably use , to promote your content on , and other people 's content as well . <p> There are so many tools , services , apps and technology available out there . There 's more opportunity for us now to get noticed out there , - than there ever was even just a few years ago , yet I still see a lot of bloggers and marketers stuck in the same dimension as they were last year , or the year before . <p> I mean let me ask you a few questions . <p> When did you last create a great video to post on YouTube or Facebook or SlideShare or Vimeo ? <p> When did you last write an eBook ? <p> When did you last publish a great infographic or create a memorable presentation to share with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you last do anything else other than write a post to publish on your blog ? <p> The tools are available people , it 's all well and good telling me you do n't have the time , or you do n't  like doing videos or creating other types of content . Well in which case you 're probably in the wrong line of business , and really- do n't expect to make as much progress with your blog , let alone try to stand out to get noticed . <p> Please use the tools , a lot of them are free and I know there 's some premium ones out there as well , but it 's all available to you , so make the time to use them . <p> If you want to check out some of the tools I 'm using to build , run and manage my blogging business , do- check out my tools and resources page . I update this page each time I discover a great tool that I 'm using and want to share . <p> OK so were coming to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched on 4 tips to help you get noticed online by your peers and top influencers , there 's plenty of other things you could be doing as well , like email outreach and guest blogging and exploring deeper into influencer marketing and so forth . <p> I hope these four tips will help you get more noticed online , its hard work but peeps I know , but its so worth your time . <p> OK so thanks for tuning in peeps , I hope you 've enjoyed the show . If you did , please consider heading over to the iTunes page and leaving a review , you 'll find the link at the bottom of this episode show notes . I appreciate you tons as always . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> I did n't  know you back when you launched episode 1 so I will have to go back and listen to it . I really like how you kept the podcast free of fluff and a lot of the advice was actionable and had real application potential . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It really is kind of plain , and I do n't  like how thin the margins are for the article text . I do love Genesis though so maybe I 'll check out another one of their child themes . Changes will be made , I am sure <p> In any case , I subscribed to the podcast on iTunes and left a good review as well . I 'm on a friends computer so I 'm not sure what itll show up as , but in any case , I 'm looking forward to future episodes ! <p> Hi James , thanks for your comment mate . Glad you enjoyed my 20 minute rand and thanks so much for the positive review on iTunes I really appreciate that . I like to keep the fluff low because I know if I were to write a blog post I would n't add the fluff there anyway , so why do it in a podcast show . <p> My first show was just talking about what the show will consist of , and I do hope to bring on some guests very soon . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for myself and the guests to fit it in . Hey if you ever want to appear on the show , just give me a shout , I think you could provide a ton of value , especially on how your built up your businesses . <p> Genesis is a great theme framework , I 've used them for over 6 years now , but on this blog I switched over to Thrive for conversion purposes . <p> Anyway , great to see you here again James , and great to be connected with you buddy . Have an awesome weekend = <p> Yes , yes , yes having great content should be the goal . But not everyone wants to or can create awesome content , like a Neil Patel ( that 's his thing and good luck to him ) . That 's where networking comes into its own . If you look at the offline business world often the best networkers are the ones who actually get the business done , even if their product is not the best in the marketplace . <p> Back to the online world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great/awesome ) , but also networks effectively and prolifically , he or she could get plenty of exposure including leads from that content . Further , if that person uses their blog more as a means to an end ( rather than an end in itself ) , they can directly and more aggressively connect with their leads , and sell em something . <p> I know this is a bit different to the pure blogging model , but pro bloggers should never lose sight of the end goal to make money . The point is that there are a myriad permutations and variances available for profit seeking bloggers to apply to the classic pure blogging model . <p> In all honesty buddy I love creating content , and I love using a blog to strike a conversation and networking with my audience about a specific topic . I like to keep things short and to the point as well . I love the way how Jim Connely from JimsMarketingBlog.com writes short punchy posts , but still manages to pull in a massive audience . The same for Seth Godin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patel is doing over on his blog , the posts he puts out are monumental and packed with a ton of value , and he does this on a regular basis too . I have 6 hours a day of solid online work time and I just about find enough time to write one epic post per month . The rest of the time I 'm networking and promoting the living carnage out of it . <p> Thanks again Kim , have a great rest of the week glad you enjoyed the show . <p> I like the point you made in number 4 , being everywhere . That 's one of the smartest tactics for getting seen by other people in your industry , although very times consuming . Great podcast show , all the points are spot on .

I have used almost all of them and they are God-send to make marketing for us easy and time-saving . My favorite of them are Canva and Pablo and they are very straight forward in what they do .

I use it to instantly pull photos from Pixabay to edit and use in my blog posts . <p> Thanks for bringing me up to speed on Canva again , that 's very interesting to learn that its been hiding its rights of use policy for graphic images and logos . <p> Sweet list ! Canva-Addict here LOL . Love the site . Makes things so stunningly easy for anybody to create pro images without being particularly talented in that area .

@@76508711 @5208711/ <p> Featured images come in all shapes and sizes . For example , for this blog , I use full-width , 1920px featured images . For my personal brand blog at FabrizioVanMarciano.com , I prefer to use smaller 750px width featured images . <h> Are featured post images really that important ? <p> Yes , personally I think they are . <p> Featured images do n't  just open up a great blog post , but they can also help to compel web users to want to click on and read the post or page , and like I said , especially since featured images are the- primary image that 's often associated with a shared link on social media . <h> What tools do you need to create amazing featured post images ? <p> What I 'm going to do first is share with you the tools that I use to create my featured images , and then share some other tools that you might be interested in using yourself . <p> I use mostly premium tools for my business as most of you may know . However , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image editing tools . There are plenty of free image tools you can find and use out there . <p> Here are some other tools you might be interested in checking out and using yourself <p> Photoscape ( Free version ) <p> Tiny PNG ( Free online service ) <h> Where to get high-quality images from ? <p> These days , quality stock images are in an abundance . There are so many websites currently available all offering very high-quality stock images for both personal and commercial use . <p> Cast your memory back to just a few years back when finding images was a complete nightmare . Once upon a time , youd either have to use Flickr images and give credit to the image owner- or pay a huge wad of money for them on premium sites . <h> How to use free stock images in your featured images <p> The best way to use free stock images in your featured post images is to customize them and add some personal flare to them . I will now share with your the steps I take to create great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you read ? Let 's do this ! <h> How I create custom featured post images for my blog posts <p> The tool I 'm going to be using to create my custom images is called Photoscape . <p> You 'll need to download Photoscape if you do n't  already have it . Or you can simply use any other photo editing tool that you have on your computer . <p> I 'm going to create a simple 750px by 400px featured post image . So first I want to find and download a nice photo from let 's say , Pixabay.com . <p> I do have a user profile with Pixabay which you can check out here , as I like to contribute to the site by sharing my own images too from time to time . <p> here 's one I found , do you like it ? Its a beautiful photo of Hong Kong . <p> I 'm going to show you how you can use a beautiful photo like this , and turn in into a cool featured post image like the one below , all using the free version of PhotoScape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows . <h> Editing the photo <p> Once I 've uploaded the photo into PhotoScape X , the first thing I do is add a gradient filter . The reason why I do this is so that any text layers that I add over the top of the image , later on , will be clearly visible . <p> So just for the fun of it , I 've added a simple purple box shape to my image and resized the box shape to fit across half of the image only . See image below . <p> I then make this purple box semi-transparent by adjusting the Opacity setting . <h> Adding some text and branding <p> Next , I 'll add some custom text to my featured post image . Again , in PhotoScape X this is very simple to do . You can also adjust line-height , letter spacing , color , and opacity . <p> I can also upload my website logo in PNG format to brand my featured post if I wanted too . <h> Personalizing the featured post image some more <p> As you will see from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my featured post image . <p> The PhotoScape X tool has some amazing editing features that allow- you to really personlize your images the way you want it to look . I recommend you play around with your featured graphic until you find the perfect look . <h> Saving the featured image <p> Once I 've created my featured blog photo , its time to merge everything together and save it . Merging elements together is very simple to do , all I have to do is click on the link that says Merge into Background inside the editor . <h> Optimizing featured image for the web <p> Before I- upload my new featured content image to my website- and assign it to my blog post or page , I need to optimize it for the web . <p> The free service I use ( and recommend ) for all my image optimization is called TinyPNG . <p> You simply drop your images into the TinyPNG website and download a compressed version of the image . And do n't  worry , compressing images using TinyPNG wont affect the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So there you have it , that 's how I create amazing and personalized featured post images for my blog posts and pages . <p> The process takes no time at all , probably 5 or maybe 10 minutes at the most , and depending on how creative you want to get with your featured image . <p> Hopefully , you will be able to do the same after reading this post , especially if you 're not including images in your content . Its very important that you do . <p> Best of luck ! <p> Psst , if you enjoyed reading this post , please give it a thumbs up on Facebook , tweet on Twitter or share the link on LinkedIn with your peeps .

@@76508715 @5208715/ <p> Naturally as a complete newbie , I was motivated to- want- to try this for myself . <p> I thought , wow , all I had to do was get a blog , put some mediocre content on there , SEO it to the brink of death and whack on some dirty , eye-popping ads and hey presto ! <p> " Let the money come rolling in baby ! " <p> And did it ? <p> Err No , not entirely <p> In fact I made like $30 in the space of 3- months of starting <p> Were you inspired to make money from blogging or affiliate marketing in the same way , only to be- somewhat- disappointed- by the results ? <p> The reality is this : Doing affiliate marketing requires a lot of hard work upfront , and done- correctly too . <p> See how I underlined correctly there . <p> Because the one reason many bloggers fail at affiliate marketing , is because they do n't  do it right to start with , along with the other reason being they know nothing about marketing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have to appreciate- something very important here . <p> They just did n't  wake up and decide to start a blog and woo hoo , the next day they were financially made . <p> Nope sir , those respectable folks- worked their absolute butts off to get to where they are today . But you know that already right ? <p> So can you do it too ? Can you make money with- affiliate- marketing ? <p> Heck yes of course you can ! But only if you work hard , and do things correctly and take your time with it . There 's no point in rushing as you 'll only get frustrated and give up ! <p> That 's one of the many things I failed to realise myself as a newbie . <p> Affiliate marketing is n't a quick solution to anyones financial woes , let that be said . It takes a lot of practice , trial and error and patience , like anything else in online business . <p> So Fabrizio do you make money from affiliate marketing too ? <p> Yes I do make a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - However- my methods and strategies are slowing working for me . <p> here 's a screen shot of one of my affiliate accounts for some validation , that I 'm actually making some money from doing affiliate marketing , and not just talking about it . <p> A nice amount of $2,296.05 was made by promoting one- particular service in just over 12 months , which I wo n't disclose of course <p> What I will disclose however , are the tactics and strategies that I used to help me create- that income . <p> OK so enough talking . If you want to increase affiliate marketing sales for your blog too , and to do it without needing to- increase blog traffic as well , here are 8 smart ways to crush this . <p> Let 's rock this ! <h> 1 . Build up your online reputation first <p> When I started out doing affiliate marketing with my blog , I failed to understand two very critical things . <p> The trust factor and online credibility . <p> Getting lots of search engine traffic is great , but you could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversions , and that would suck . I mean what a waste ! <p> Building an audience on the other hand , would mean that you would be able to market and promote relevant products and services the right way , and drive targeted traffic to your offers as and when you needed- to . <p> Creating videos is powerful , incorporating them into your review articles will make them even more powerful , and more profitable for you . <p> Just check out how I put together this Social Warfare Plugin review , complete with a cool walkthrough video at the end . I even had one of the creators of Social Warfare , Dustin Stout comment on the video ! <h> 4 . Create your own product comparison blog posts <p> There will be many folks looking to compare products or services before making a decision on which one to purchase and use . <p> This is your perfect opportunity to take some of the hottest products in your niche and create a comparison post for them . <p> When these posts are created properly they can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post over on Rob Cobbons blog about comparison posts , with some great tips to take on board , so please do check it out . <p> From personal previous- expereince , creating product comparison posts where- 3 to 4- products are involved is the most profitable way to create these types of articles . <p> You can compare important things like usability , benefits , prices , features , support and documentation , and much more . <h> 5 . Create- powerful case-studies about your- affiliate products <p> Case studies in affiliate marketing can be very powerful , again if- done correctly . <p> In affiliate marketing , a case study can be used to show how you- overcame a particular obstacle or problem , using a method or strategy , combined with using a- particular product or online service . One that you want to promote as an affiliate . <p> For instance , you could create a case study showing how you were able to increase conversion rates using some cool video software you purchased ! A little bit like this one over on Matt Woodwards blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots , before and after shots , graphs and charts , test results , links to additional resources and much more . <p> You can also add links to other relevant and related case studies to help reinforce- your own case- studies . <p> If you can create a skull crushing , problem solving case study for one or two hot products in your niche , you 're going to make more money with affiliate marketing than you ever thought was possible ! <h> 6 . Write and publish some useful eBooks <p> Writing and publishing eBooks is another- great way to distribute useful " problem solving " content in affiliate marketing . <p> Again consider creating a few eBooks around a particular product or service . You could even turn some of your case-studies or tutorials into full-blown eBooks or guides to give away freely on your blog . <p> Or you could set up a page where you could sell your eBooks- and make even more money , a bit like this page . <h> 7 . Build a targeted email list <p> List building is so critical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote relevant products and services to your email subscribers as and when ever you need to . <p> Providing your list is targeted and active of course ! <p> Yes- I know what you 're thinking ; " Surely spamming your subscribers- with affiliate links and what not is not a great business move ? " <p> Yes it can be a bit of a dodgy move so go careful . I know a lot of email service providers are against using affiliate links in emails . MailChimp is n't one of them , just as long as you play by their rules . <p> But here 's the thing when it comes to promoting affiliate products and services using an email list . Most bloggers or marketers do n't  bother to pay much attention to email segmentation , or to build lists to target specific audiences on their blogs . <p> Most bloggers just build one huge mother list , and send everything and anything to that list . This is n't bad , its just not optimal . <p> If you 're going to build a targeted email list to promote relevant affiliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list that 's going to serve- that purpose only . <p> If people opt-in , at least theyll know what they opted in for right ? And this way you 've got more chance of making a few affiliate sales than not . <p> This works far better than trying to promote affiliate products or services to your entire site list , because some of the folks on your list wont be remotely interested in them . <p> If you 're promoting everything and anything to one email list , you could be spamming without realising it . <p> More often than not , this is one of the reasons why I believe people unsubscribe to an email list . <p> Build an email list that 's specifically for notifying your subscribers of products and services you recommend they check out . <h> Conclusion <p> When you earn- passive income through affiliate marketing and blogging , the feeling is awesome , - it really is . <p> If you put in the blood , the sweat and the tears now ! And you put it in the right places too , like doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make a nice little income each month from your blog . <p> Logically if you can convert just 4 great products or services , to earn you around $2,500 each year , that 's an additional outstanding $10,000 per year just from affiliate marketing ! <p> Of course you would have update your reviews , and add additional affiliate- marketing content to your blog from time to time , just to maintain that income each year . <p> But how awesome would adding- $10k- to your regular online business income each year ? You just cant beat it ! <p> So stop flapping around like a headless chicken with affiliate marketing . Stop avoiding the fact that there 's tons of great tools and services you 're probably using right now , that you could really be promoting and earning money from ! <p> Implement some of the affiliate marketing tactics Ive shared with you above , and you too will be creating some nice passive income through your blog . <h> Your turn to speak <p> Are you doing affiliate marketing on your blog ? <p> What strategies seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share it here of course . <p> Leave me a comment below as always ! <p> Post Views : 801 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> I have to admit , I hardly make anything from affiliate marketing off of my blog directly . I do expect this to go up over time , especially as my organic rankings increase ( search engine traffic only accounts for about 1/3 of my visits ) as my old review posts do n't  get much traffic on their own . <p> Affiliate marketing used to be my main source of income , but more than 90% of that income came through my email list itself . Of course the posts would play a part of that as I 'd schedule them to be sent out in my autoresponder but the majority came straight from the emails themselves . <p> Youve given a lot of great advice here that is bound to help me make more from the posts themselves which is something I 've always struggled with . <p> Hey James , thanks for stopping by buddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . For me I would say 70% of the income created through aff marketing is from search traffic whilst a small percentage are from social and email . <p> From time to time I 'll get an email from someone asking about a product I 'm using . I try and explain the use I 'm personally getting from a product or service , rather that try to convince them they need to buy it too . Usually this results in an affiliate sale of some sort . 
@@76508716 @5208716/ <p> With WordPress , you can build a website for absolutely any purpose. - This is largely thanks to the fact that WordPress is an open source platform , so if you 're a developer , you can create a unique WordPress site for whatever goal or objective you have in mind . <p> One of the ways you can add incredible functionality to your WordPress website is through the use of plugins . And , as you probably know , there are thousands of them available , both free and premium ones . <p> Personally , - I like to have a balance of some free quality plugins , and premium paid plugins on my WordPress sites . <p> In this post , I want to share with you a list of my favorite premium plugins for WordPress , all of which I 'm currently using right now . <p> Granted , you wo n't need all of these plugins on your site . There might be one or two that you may want to use on one site , and a few others perhaps on another site . <p> Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently have 7 of them installed on Magnet4Blogging . <p> Thrive Leads is easily one of the best , if not the best , list building and drag-and-drop opt-in form builder plugin on the market . That 's what I think anyway . <p> Ive been using Thrive Leads since it was officially launched back in 2015 . I have Thrive Leads running on all of my WordPress websites . <p> With Thrive Leads , you also get lots of ready-made forms that you can customize further using the built-in form editor . Its a huge time-saver when it comes to creating customized opt-in forms for your WordPress site . <p> This plugin is very similar to BLP , with some additional built-in features . In addition , with Pretty Link Pro , you get lifetime updates , unlike BLP where you have to renew your license every year to keep receiving updates . <p> There is also a free version of this plugin available in the WP repository . <p> There is a free version of this plugin and a pro version , with many additional features built in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much is because it was developed with performance in mind , so it wont hog resources and slow down your website . <p> Other features include button customization , display and placement options , click-to-tweet , in-page or post social integration , and one feature that I cant forget to mention : Twitter counts ! Yes , you can proudly display your tweet share counts using this plugin . <p> Genesis theme framework is one of the most popular premium WordPress themes being used today . Unfortunately customizing a Genesis child theme requires a little technical knowledge in HTML and CSS , and its not a simple process . <p> This plugin is a must for all none-developer Genesis theme users . It makes it ever so easy to customize a child theme without needing to touch a single line of code . You have control over colors , backgrounds , typography , margins and paddings , line heights and so on . <p> The plugin currently works with Genesis parent theme- and most of the other Genesis child themes . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417

Outsourcing blog writing can free up your valuable time . <p> Without a doubt ! <p> As I mentioned earlier , we all live very busy lives . <p> When it comes to running your online business or your blog , there 's just so many things- involved . <p> Sometimes its hard to play the roll of being everyone and being everywhere . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic designer , a business coach , a virtual assistant , a business mentor , an author and speaker , what ever your skill-set may be , you have your work cut out . <p> Theres being the content creator ( huge task ) , webmaster , business administrator , business developer , marketer , event organiser and manager and so on . <p> Sometimes its nice to bring in writers that can provide something new and fresh to your blog . <p> Writers who can provide your readers with different perspectives and alternative points of views . <p> This can help you boost engagement and traffic for sure . <p> It is also your opportunity to learn something new , simply by reading an article written by someone else . <h> #3 . Can help to boost your blog authority and credibility <p> Yes , outsourcing can do just that for you . <p> That is if you are able to find credible and authoritative writers in your industry , and not just the average run-of-the mill content churner . <p> Upwork is a great place to find expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your homework very carefully . <h> The cons of outsourcing your blog writing <p> Now let 's look at some of the pitfalls- of outsourcing your blog posts . <p> Sometimes by giving the job of writing blog posts to someone else , someone external from your establishment , perhaps to a ghost writer , you can run into some- risks. - Especially if you do n't  research your writer properly . <p> Remember , <p> YOU- know your style of writing better than anyone else . <p> YOU- know how to communicate and engage with your audience , better than anyone else . <p> Let 's dive deeper . <h> #1 . You know your style of writing better than anyone else . <p> Since I started blogging 6 years ago , Ive written over 1,000 unique articles for my own blogs . <p> In all that time , Ive outsourced blog writing no more than a few dozen times , and most of it this year actually . <p> If you 've been blogging for a length of time too , then I 'm pretty sure you have a decent sized audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Good points ! One man show at BFP only because I love writing SO much , and because writing comes easily to me ( after writing millions of words over the years LOL ) but you make a strong point for outsourcing . Glad to hear business is rocking too = Always fun to have a crew of outsourcers handling stuff for you when you need to juggle , but are running out of arms to keep the balls/bowling pins/whatever flying . I have pulled back on certain tasks and spend more dough these days on handing off projects , processes and the like , as I focus on what gives me joy . So key as we learn how to scale . <p> HI Fabrizio , Outsourcing always has its own benefits . Like you mentioned , it will leave you enough room for growth , and concentrating over other aspects of business . I outsource some part of my writings too but never hired people from Upwork . I had heard a lot of negative about the article quality that I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I would love to hear your experiences . = Yes budgeting is an issue , but once you start earning from the blog , hiring can be easier . I would say bloggers should do it if and only if they are going to earn at least 2X from the saved time . <p> I 've found hiring the right writers have certainly helped me over the last 12 months for sure . Have I used UpWork ? Yeah several time . <p> I have found that with UpWork though you 've got do your research carefully into the writer . People can make up any old crap about their expereince and knowledge as a freelance writer . The great thing about UpWork is that you can see from the feedback others have left how good a writer really is . <p> I never go for the cheap options either . I prefer to pay $150+ for a well written post by an industry expert , as apposed to $40 for 5 crappy posts by amateurs . <p> First up , I have to say well done on your first Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but caught up later . Must be scary at first ? <p> OK , onto the blog post As a freelance writer and blogger I have to say that I enjoyed reading both sides of the argument . All the points are equally valid , and I can see them from both sides : From a freelancer perspective then of course I want bloggers to outsource their writing , preferably to me if there is a good fit . I write both as a ghostwriter and with bylined articles , so I can understand your point about how the writer needs to understand exactly what and who they are writing for so that they convey the right tone . Upwork has n't  proven to be a good source of projects for me because there are a lot of clients wanting the cheap shit you mentioned . Fortunately Ive been able to build my clients through networking and through having my own blog . Which brings us to the other side of the argument . Two years ago I had n't  written anything for the web . But having my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better writer , and proved to be a good form of self-marketing . <p> So my advice would be as follows : If you 're new to blogging then write yourself . You 'll learn a lot along the way . If you 're a solopreneur or small business that wants to focus on developing and selling your product/service , then outsource your content marketing , including writing , to a freelancer who understands you and your project . <p> Luckily all the writers Ive found and worked with on UpWork have been great . One of the outsourced post here on Magnet4Blogging happens to be one of the most shared and most commented on article . <p> At the same time I 've had my fair share of amateurs and time wasters as well from UpWork . <p> I also use UpWork to provide my WordPress development and design services and you 're absolutely right . There are clients that want to earth for such measly prices , no thanks . Like you I 've used my own blog and networking to promote and advertise my business services . <p> David your outsourcing advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed , so thanks so much for adding value to this article . <p> True at UpWork you can find some of the amazing writers however they are sometimes too expensive for the budget . With staff-india hiring writers for an affordable flat cost rate and the option to choose from number of professionals on the basis of their work is an attractive offer hard to be unexplored.

You cant really completely disable it or have it not running at all . <p> However , - you really do n't  need to have it running in the background that often , using up valuable resources . And it does n't  matter how many visits you get or do n't  get to your site either . <p> OK , so first here 's how to disable wp-cron inside of your WordPress install . <p> Remember : Always backup your WordPress site , and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes changes to . What I usually do is use good old copy-and-paste for the files I 'm going to change in my WordPress install . Save a copy somewhere on your desk top should you need to revert to it . <p> So here goes . <h> Step One : Disable wp-cron in WordPress <p> Log into your SiteGround hosting account and navigate to the cPanel . <p> Once again , if you 're using a different web host provider such as Bluehost or HostGator , this tutorial should more or less be the same for those too . <p> Then scroll down to Files- and click on the File Manager- icon , as shown in the- image below . <p> A box will appear , click on the Web Root- directory , but make sure the Show hidden files box is ticked . Now hit Go ! See image below . <p> A new page will open up and will show all the files inside of this directory . <p> Now navigate to the PublicHTML folder , then- find the folder in which the WP files are stored for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your WordPress site might be inside the PublicHTML folder , or a sub-folder ( PublicHTML folder &gt; sub-folder ) . <p> Once you have located the WP files for your website , locate the wp-config file and right click on it . In the drop-down menu , click on the Code Edit link. - See image below for example . <p> Now from the pop-up dialogue box , click on Edit to open up the wp-config.php page . <p> You should now be inside your wp-config file . <p> Remember what I said at the beginning of this first step , always backup and make copies of anything you 're going to make changes to . So- click to select all the content in the wp-config.php file , then copy , then- paste the content inside a blank notepad to save on your desktop just in case you need to revert . If you do n't  have a backup plan , click here . <p> Right , so once you 've backed up your wp-config.php file , scroll all the way down to the bottom of your original wp-config file inside your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , right at the bottom of the page , add the following code . <p> Now were going to enable cron jobs to execute on your server side for your website , so that 's the server in your SiteGround hosting , or whatever host you 're currently using . <p> Were going to set this to take place twice-per-day , instead of multiple times per day . Of course you can set cron-jobs to execute more than that depending on your needs , but ideally , I 'd recommend most bloggers have this set to no more than around 4 times per day . Unless of course , you run a multi-author blog , where blog posts are being scheduled more often . <p> Let 's get to it . <p> So now head back in the cPanel of your SiteGround hosting account , scroll down to the bottom of the page , and under Advanced , click on Cron Jobs . See image below for example . <p> A new page will open , scroll down until you see Add a New Cron Job . <p> From the Common Settings drop-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields automatically for you . <p> Like I said earlier- if you want your cron jobs to happen more often , simply change the hour settings . <p> Now inside the Command field , enter the following path : <p> cd **32;159;TOOLONG ; php -q wp-cron.php <p> Do n't  forget to replace the red part with your own SiteGround cPanel username , which you can find under information and settings on the homepage . <p> Once you 're done with this part , simply click Add New Cron Job . <p> And that 's it ! You are done and dusted my good friend . <p> Youve now taken one smart step closer to reducing CPU usage and throttling , and place less stress on your server . This little trick has worked wonders for me , and I do hope it works for you too . <h> Final quick notes <p> If you have more than one WordPress install on your shared hosting account with SiteGround , you 'll have to do this for each of your websites . Do n't  forget to keep an eye on your CPU usage graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once again this little tutorial is for anyone using WordPress hosted on SiteGround. 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 
@@76508721 @5208721/ <p> Hey folks , I love- writing long blog posts as some of you may know . The benefits of writing pillar articles on your blog are of many , but writing eBook sized blog posts every time comes with a lot of challenges and pressures , let 's take a look at 3 of them right now . 1 . Maintaining Reader Interest <p> Since the demise of WebMeUp , for some time now I 've been searching for a powerful alternative SEO software . WebMeUp was perfect , affordable , simple to use and provided me with all the tools I needed to fine tune my SEO efforts . I loved the backlink analysis tool in WebMeUp the most , thankfully <p> I do n't know about you but I get a lot of value from guest blogging , I mean the benefits are massive , one guest post alone can provide your blog with multiple benefits . Guest blogging for SEO may be dead to some degree , but it 's still a very powerful way to increase exposure and get noticed. - It 's <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective year is just 8 weeks or so away ! Goodness , where has 2014 gone ? Yep , 2015 is fast approaching , and I bet you have n't even thought about planning your blog strategy , or thought about your goals and objectives , or even- thought about- what projects 
@@76508723 @5208723/ <p> So things have been fairly quite around here for some time , and that 's been largely due to the fact that I 've been flat out busy as usual . <p> Not just busy with doing my other blogging duties and meeting deadlines with client projects etc , but I 've also been busy working on my own projects , both online and offline , leaving me very little time to actually write blog content . <p> Now one of the things that I 've been busy doing over the last three months or so , has been auditing all of the content on Magnet4Blogging . Including the copywriting on the homepage , about page , landing pages , sales pages and various other pages . <p> How it all started off <p> Back in early January of this year ( 2016 ) , I sat down and began taking a look at my website as a whole package . I was particularly interested in the existing content and copywriting on my site . <p> I was coming up to having almost 200 blog posts published , and almost 50 pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked myself one question : <p> Without sounding as if I 'm blowing my own trumpet here , I guess a lot of my content must have been doing a pretty good job at providing some value . Because I was already getting emails and praises from people reading my blog , comments , social shares , clients and all the rest of it , way before I even thought about doing a content audit , or improving the copywriting on my pages . <p> So something was clearly working right ? <p> However , I felt that I I could still make improvements , I could still make my web content better somehow . <p> And that 's basically what got me thinking about doing a full-blown content audit for the rest of my blog . <p> And so it begins . <p> Now design and branding wise , I was fairly happy with my setup . I have made some additional small changes to the homepage since the beginning of the year , most notably above the fold . <p> I did this to start with , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my passions , my skills and ultimately what business I was in and what value I could provide to people visiting my site . I wanted my message to have more clarity if you will . <p> So , simply updating a few static content pages lead me to start preparing for a full-blown blog content audit . Well I knew this was going to take a considerable amount of time to do , hence why I decided to reduce my posting frequency back in January . I wrote a post about it here actually , explaining- that I was going to take a break from blogging . <p> What is a content audit anyway ? <p> If you 've landed on this page for the very first time , or perhaps you 're new to blogging or online marketing and are n't  too sure what a content audit entails , here is the low-down in a complete nutshell for you . <p> A content audit in the online world , is best described as the process of evaluating content elements . <p> So if you have a blog with lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog posts and all of your static page content , and then making a formal decision as to what you want to do with that content , based on a series of measurable factors and how much of your content holds any true value to your blog or website . <p> Hope that made some sense . If not you can always read more about it here in greater detail . <p> Why should you do a content audit ? <p> There are way too many reasons why anyone or any blogger would want to do a content audit . <p> For me it was about wanting to make my website content better , so that it would become- more aligned with my goals and objectives ( which is to ultimately get more subscribers , and create more leads ) . <p> In addition , I also wanted to create a better user-experience on my site for my visitors . I wanted to make every single piece of content on my blog every bit as useful and problem solving , for anybody who was reading it . <p> So my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do a content audit before you set about doing one . Have a clear goal or objective . <h> 54% Increase In Organic Traffic Content Audit Case Study <p> Now since I began making these changes to my website , in particular my blog content back in January , I instantly began to see the results of my efforts . <p> Literally , after identifying and removing a handful of thin , low quality and low value articles , one of the things I noticed was the significant increase in organic search engine traffic . <p> Look at the screen capture image of my Google Analytics below . You will notice how towards the end of January and into early February ( around the time of me removing pages and posts ) , organic traffic increased almost instantly overnight ? <p> If I compare the week where traffic increased , with the previous week in fact , that 's a 55% increase in organic traffic . Not too shabby huh ? <p> So if you 're wondering whether doing a content audit for your blog will help you to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , I cant really say that it will . Maybe it will maybe it wo n't , I guess it depends on many other factors as well . <p> Now my goal once again was to ensure that my that blog content was still relevant and still useful to my audience and new visitors , and of course still able to convert those visitors into subscribers and leads . <p> So what actually goes into a content audit then ? <p> OK so before I finally dive into how I did my blog content audit ( I promise you its coming ) , let me just say something very important here . <p> If you 're going to cary out a successful content audit for your blog too , first ensure that you have a master plan and that you get yourself organised . <p> Seriously , you 'll pull this off more successfully if you are better organised and better prepared . Do n't  just got about stabbing around in the dark and do something silly , like delete posts and pages you think you should be deleting , without doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and preparation , so please be aware that doing a content audit is not an overnight process . <p> Below I 've compiled a list of some of the information and data you might want to gather for your website audit . These are also the ones I used for my content audit . <p> List of all blog post URLs ( Critical ) . <p> List of all static page URLs ( Critical ) . <p> Content publish date for blog posts . <p> Page views for the last quarter , or for whatever length of time you 'd like to measure traffic for each post . <p> Bounce rate for each post . <p> Current search engine position for target keyword if any , for each post . <p> Percentage of traffic from search engines for each post . <p> Total number of comments per post . <p> Total number of social shares per post . <p> Page ranking per post . <p> Page links per post . <p> Page authority per post . <p> OK so remember what I said about the importance of being organised and prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content audit takes an enormous amount of time and effort . It will get tedious I kid you not , but it will all be worth it in the end . <p> So finally , here 's how I got myself organised to audit the content on my blog successfully , and you can follow the same exact steps if you wish too . <h> 3 Steps To Executing A Successful Content Audit For Your Blog <h> Step 1 . Do a complete URL dump <p> The first thing that I did was to dump all of the URLs for my blog posts and pages into a spreadsheet . <p> When you do this for your site , you might also want to include Categories and Tags , but in all honesty you 'll just be making more work for yourself , so just leave it out if you can . <p> I used my blogs sitemap to find all of the URLs for my site . If you have an XML Sitemap generated for your WordPress site , you can use this too . If you do n't  yet have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a few sitemap plugins about , but this one is the most popular one to use by far . <p> If you 're using WordPress SEO by Yoast , there 's also a Sitemap feature within this plugin that you could use . However from previous experience with Yoast , the Sitemap feature does n't  always behave the way it should . That might not be the case for you or everyone else though . <p> What if I do n't  use WordPress ? <p> If you do n't  use WordPress , or even if you do , to save time there 's a great tool you can use called Auditor- by Kapost . You simply enter your domain name and the software will crawl your entire site and generate a list of URLs , which you can then download as CSV . You can find that tool here . <p> OK so going back to dumping URLs , I used Numbers for the Mac to do my URL dumping and organising , however you can use what ever tool you feel most comfortable with using . <p> If you are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use that perfectly well . Otherwise you can use Google Sheets . <p> When I started getting myself organised for auditing my blog content , I had around 250+ URLs to my spreadsheet . You may have more or less . Remember the more you have , the more time it will obviously take you to do your content auditing . <h> Step 2 . Organise your spreadsheet <p> here 's how to organise your spreadsheet . First put all the URLs in one column under the heading " URLs " . <p> Now you 'll need to add some auditing categories . <p> Categories ! What categories ? <p> Using categories will help you make a better decision as to what to do with certain blog posts or pages . I added the following categories to my URL spreadsheet . <p> Again , you can follow the same process as above or add your own set of categories . So let me dive deeper into each of these categories and their meaning or purpose if you like . <p> 1 . Keep As <p> Pretty self explanatory stuff . Basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current and up to date on my blog . These would be content posts and pages with 2,000 words or more , and getting good traffic from all sources , high levels of engagement and converting reasonably well . <p> 2 . Make Good <p> I would make good and keep all the posts and pages that were getting good traffic and engagement , but not converting as well as hoped for . <p> I would combine multiple posts that were written on the same topic or subject . These would be posts with low word count , getting satisfactory levels of traffic , but low engagement . These would mostly be quick blogging tips , quick insight posts , quick how to tutorial posts . <p> If there was n't a related post I could redirect to , often I would just redirect to the blog archive page or my custom sitemap page . <p> You can also choose to create a custom 404 page for your visitors should you wish to . <p> 5 . No-Index , ( No-Follow ) <p> I would make these posts good and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make no-follow as well . <p> Why no-index or no-follow and not just delete them ? <p> Because truthfully speaking , these would be posts that I spent many days or even weeks researching and writing , but cant let go of . <p> Whilst these posts still offered great value , theyd usually be ones that received low to no traffic . So instead of deleting them I would simply make them better , no-index them and promote them further . <p> So as you can see by adding categories like this , it makes the whole process of auditing blog content easier , but not necessarily faster . <h> Step 3 . Start your content auditing engine <p> If you 're going to make and use a URL list like this for your blogs content auditing , go through each page or post with a fine-tooth comb , and again , take your time . <p> I cant stress enough on how important it is to take your time with this . Yes its going to be extremely time consuming and tedious going through each post , its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be worth it in the end . <p> On average I was spending around 25 to 30 minutes auditing each post or page . Even longer if I had to upgrade some of them with new content . <p> Whilst my content auditing is now very close to completion , I 'm still working on a a few posts and pages here and there , the ones that have escaped my URL dump stage somehow . <p> Tip : - Set yourself a daily minimum goal . I set myself to audit a minimum of 5 to 6 posts per day , just so that I would n't go insane doing it . <p> Do n't  forget that as you go through each post with a fine-tooth comb , to evaluate some , if not all of the data , I shared with you at the start of this post . <p> Put each post or page in the category you think it should be in , based on the data and information you gathered and analyzed . <p> How I did this , was to start off with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views per month . These would go into either a " keep as " column or " make good " column if I needed to improve the content of a post or page . <p> Then I focused on the posts and pages that were getting less than 50 page views per month . I would put these URLs in either one of the three remaining columns to work on later . Either " remove " , " consolidate " or " no-index " . <h> Content Auditing Tools That I Used <p> OK so to finish off , I want to share with you some of the tools that I used to help me carry out my blog content audit .

Build that email list <p> How many times have you heard that ? Youve got to have an email list , you 've got to build an email list <p> Sounds like boring old generic advice right ? <p> So I hesitate to ask , are you building your email list ? <p> You want to know how I get folks flocking to my latest blog post , reading , sharing and commenting ? <p> Its very , very simple , I send out an email newsletter letting them know there 's a new post on my blog . Ta-da ! ! ! <p> That 's right , more generic advice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many bloggers make when starting out even today , is that they do n't  start to build their list at the same time . <p> John Chow from JohnChow.com is amongst five other famous A-list bloggers who admit this to be their biggest mistake in this powerful expert roundup post published on blogician.com <p> here 's a screen capture- of what he wrote . <p> Do n't  become another another blogger to admit the same mistake later down the line , build your list now ! <p> here 's an interesting statistic for you : <p> 44% of email recipients made at least one purchase last year , based on a promotional email . Source . <p> That means if you 're not building your email list now , you 're potentially missing out on traffic and more importantly sales to your blog. - Dont- waste another minute and get started . <p> And if you 're wondering at all , no you dont- have to sell your liver to the black market to start list building , in fact to get started all you 're going to need is the following : <h> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marketing Institute , only 6% of bloggers publish original content as guest posts. - Meaning the rest of the time bloggers- prefer to make their blog the central hub for valuable information and awesome content . <p> Regardless of this , - guest blogging is far from dead . Guest blogging in fact has to be up there amongst some of the greatest- ways to get your blog and content noticed by new audiences , and of course guest blogging is great for driving some serious traffic too . <p> Guest blogging for SEO ? <p> Its definitely harder to get the- results you want from guest blogging as far as SEO and backlinks is concerned , but it can still work effectively to some- degree. - A few years ago it was definitely- a lot easier to submit a couple of guest posts- and get massive SEO returns back , long gone are those days as Google is a lot smarter today . <p> Blog commenting and guest blogging are two old school strategies , that are still by far the best ways to connect with people , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So how can you achieve all of this with simple blog commenting ? <p> Simply by doing one thing and one thing only ! <p> By providing incredible value . <p> And providing value- by the way is n't achieved by commenting ( or spamming ) on 20 or 30 blogs per day . Its achieved by commenting on no more than 2 or 3 blogs per day . <p> Each comment you leave on other blogs has to be meaningful. - Imagine you 're writing a mini guest post if you like , just keep thinking of ways in which you can provide- value to a piece of article , or ways in which you can extend a conversation on a topic . <p> If you can do that on every single blog you visit , read and comment on , just think of how many people will want to come back and visit your blog and hopefully do the same for you . <p> Sherman Smith runs one of my favourite blogs on the subject of online business and entrepreneurship . Without sounding as if I 'm blowing my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed comment I left on one of his recent blog posts . <p> As you will notice , its not just a spammy one sentence comment like you see on many- blogs , but a comment that helps to promote engagement and foremost , adds value to a conversation . <p> If you want to use blog commenting to drive traffic and readers to your blog , keep this mini-checklist in the back of your mind , or bookmark this post . <p> Always address the author by his or her first name . <p> Write about why you agree or disagree with the topic being discussed in the post . <p> Share your thoughts , experiences and beliefs . <p> Add additional value , mention something that has n't  already been covered in the article . <p> Sign off thanking the author for a great piece of writing . <p> In addition , here are some basic but essential guidelines for doing blog commenting : <p> Always use your real name . <p> Do n't  spam by dropping links in your comment , or by writing self-promotional jargon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded with any questions , so that you can answer them and keep the conversation- flowing . <p> A- lot of bloggers however , are somewhat confused about networking or doing blogger outreach ( often known as influencer marketing ) . - In all fairness , - where does one actually network to find blogs to collaborate with , as well as find traffic and readers for their blog ? <p> You may or may not have come across sites like Inbound.org , BizSugar.com or NinjaOutreach and BlogDash even . Well if you haveny , these are all platforms in which you can join and network with other great like minded folks- in your niche . <p> In addition , you can use many of these sites to help promote your own content and find new readers for your blog . <p> With BlogDash for example , you can potentially reach out to many the 200K bloggers registered on the site . <p> NinjaOutreach- also- has 25 million websites in their database and growing .

The 80:20 rule is the key here , yes unless we share and make known about our products who else will do ! ! LOL <p> Yes we need to do a rigorous promotion about our resources . Thanks for telling about this ! <p> This is indeed a great share . The 5 Smart Ways ( Tips ) you shared in this post is really worth following . <p> I have been following these steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do follow these steps very religiously and found lot of benefits out of it . Especially the one on Commenting on others pages . Yes , I have been following this strategy even before I have a blog of my own , Of course , I have been writing , sharing my posts on the pages different shared platforms like , Googles Knol pages , Yahoos Associated Content and many other similar platforms , , , <p> But in fact , I was known as a blogger without a blog ! ! I posted an article in this regard on my page , A blogger without a blog an Interview . <p> Yes , our solid and well-structured comment to the subject will get notice the attention of the readers of that page . And thus they may land on your page by seeing your constructive comment . One need to note that a one line comment or a generic one will note even get the attention of even the author of that post . <p> Hi Phil , thanks for your comment mate , I remember Google Knol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , that along with HubPages , Squidoo , InfoBarrel and other similar web 2.0 blogging sites , when they were popular . <p> These days I prefer to keep my best content for my own blog and create similar types of content in other mediums to distribute around various content marketing platforms . <p> For a long time , I relied on Social Media as my number one strategy for promotion and neglected list building and guest posting . I now realise that we need to get our strategies prioritised when it comes to marketing and promotion . One plays on the wrong foot , it takes a lot of time to get things rectified and start again . <p> You are right on point ! These are great ways to promote your blog . You definitely do n't  have to write a blog post everyday or even every week . As a matter of fact , from my own experience , you 'll come to a stand still . <p> Why ? <p> Because of the lack of promotion . <p> You not only want to write content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to promote it so that your target audience can actually get to it . <p> I usually promote through email , commenting , social media . I did a few guest posts last year , but have n't got into it this year so far . But with just this three strategies , I 'm getting just as much traffic if not more as I only publish a blog post once a month compared to last year where I was publishing a blog post every week . <p> Thanks for the mention about leaving great comments . You truly only have to leave 2 or 3 comments a day , if that . Its a great way to connect with other bloggers and build up your reputation . <p> Hi Fabrizio , good to know 80% should be promoting and only 20% writing new content but if you are doing guest posts would n't that change the percentages some ? I 'm trying to do more of the promotion but always end up feeling guilty I have no new content for weeks . Its such a balance act but I do love some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you for those ! <p> Hi Lisa thanks for taking the time to comment . Yes I guess that percentage would increase slightly , though I suppose guest blogging could be seen as doing marketing or promotion to some degree . <p> I fully understand where you 're coming from as far as content promotion goes . Sometimes it could be weeks before I actually get around putting together ideas for new blog content as Im engrossed so much in marketing and promotion and doing other blogging stuff .

@@76508727 @5208727/ <p> Charging $60 or $70 for an eBook sounds- absurd and I 'm safely guessing is mostly unheard of these days . <p> Heck , I think charging $25 for an eBook could even raise a few eye-browse . <p> Unless of course , the content is so darn good that one is compelled to pay that kind of money for an eBook . <p> Anyway , eBooks are not meant to cost big bucks , even the most valuable eBooks cost less than $20 these days . <h> Why are eBooks priced cheaply ? <p> If you take a look on- Amazon.com for instance , you 'll find a monumental amount of eBooks for sale , all with prices ranging from $2 to $20 and more . <p> I 've purchased many eBooks from Amazon- myself over the years . I 've also purchased eBooks from- other sites such as Payhip , but most of them have been for just a few dollars , with the odd one- for maybe $9 or $12 . <p> To be really honest with you , more often than not , I 've found eBooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more valuable than eBooks I 've paid $9 and $12 for . <p> So why on earth are eBooks so cheap to buy these days ? <p> Because the cost almost nothing to create <p> That 's right , and the other reason being the competition is way too high , so eBooks cost nothing to make . <p> If your eBook is 200 pages or more , then you could consider $12 to $20 <p> Regardless of the number of pages your eBook has , this is just a guide to go by . Your eBook may only have 50-pages , for instance , but if the content is super high-quality , then a high price might be justified . <h> #4 How much will your eBook cost to sell ? <p> A lot of people do n't  think about this question carefully enough . <p> If you 're promoting and selling your eBook on your own blog or website , and you 're taking payment through PayPal , for instance , then you 're probably not going to incur many charges , except for the PayPal fees maybe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about a few other logistics , such as registering and paying EU VAT , and how you 're going to deliver the eBook once its sold . <p> If decide to use a third-party eCommerce platform such as eJunkie- or Payhip perhaps , then you 're probably going to incur some fees for using these services . <p> Again , take this into consideration when pricing your eBook . I 've used eJunkie in the past as they do n't take a commission on sales , just a monthly membership fee . <p> These days I using PayHip to sell my eBooks because the fees are extremely low , and they take care of the EU VAT for me . <p> here 's a good tip , - if youre- publishing your first ever eBook , consider pricing it low first and then gradually increasing the price over time , especially as you begin to see a few more sales coming through . <p> Right , - so let 's do a quick recap of the things to keep in mind when deciding on how to price your eBook <p> How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique or valuable is the content inside your eBook ? <p> How much content does your eBook have to offer ? <p> Hoe much will your eBook cost to sell ? <p> Is this your first eBook publication ? <p> Conclusion <p> Knowing the answers to all of these questions will definitely help you come up with a good price for your eBook . Whatever price you decide , make sure you stick with it . <p> If you really think your eBook is worth $20 , sell it for that and do n't  look back . If you think its only worth a few Dollars , start with that and then increase it over time . <p> With a little bit of research and testing , you 'll get there . <p> here 's one last tip for you : Take a look at some of the titles similar to your eBook on Amazon , and see what prices those authors have set their eBooks at . Best of luck to you . <p> Post Views : 1,082 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many . I 've kinda booked the trend with my price points and sold my first ebook for $47 . It was 120 pages long . I sold my second for $67 , it was 450 pages long so pretty comprehensive . I took into account mainly what the individual would be getting from the information ( how I created a Facebook presence that got 7 million people a week directly engage with my stuff ) and they both sold well . You are right that when pricing you need to be realistic . Unless you are offering something pretty original , you have a lot of competition although you can still do some good marketing to present the offer in an irresistible way . Great article , I 'll tweet it = <p> Hi Andrew thanks for visiting and leaving a valuable comment , and of course sharing your experiences with pricing your eBooks . That 's really great to hear , and exactly the point I 'm making in this post with realistic pricing . You on one hand are a prime example of someone who is offering extremely high value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is serving your audience greatly . It sounds like you 've put a lot of work into these eBooks therefore you have every right to price your eBook at what its worth . <p> Thanks again for commenting and tweeting my friend , have a super rest of the week . <p> In relation to how valuable and how unique the book is it is worthy to spy on the competition . Is there a similar book on the topic ? How much does that sell for ? Hunting for things like this will not only help one price the book but will also help in positioning themselves in the market . 
@@76508728 @5208728/ <h> The Single Lazy Method For Building Natural Backlinks : It Works ! <p> When it comes to off-page SEO , backlinks are still an important part of the mix , so despite what you may have read , that backlinks are n't  as important as they used to be , or link building is dead , that may be so for some people , but it does n't  mean you shouldnt be gaining some valuable backlinks to your blog , especially if you want to improve your search engine rankings a little bit . <p> There are some great ways to build natural backlinks to your blog , here are some of the things that I 've been doing over the last few years : <p> Creating an email outreach program ( Read this post on QuickSprout for more information ) . <p> Over the years- Ive been doing all those- things to help me build some good links to my blog , and you- should certainly be incorporating some of these into- your own off site- SEO- strategy , - if you 're not already doing so . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this blog , I realised something . Doing all those things to build links is really time consuming , and some of those strategies are n't  as effective as they used to be . So now- for me personally , there 's just one link building strategy that I love doing more than any other . There 's just one strategy that I focus on <p> And that strategy is Blogging , nothing but blogging ! <p> That 's right , just creating amazing all-round content on my blog , you could say its also the lazy method for building backlinks . here 's how I see it : <p> If you spend all your time- focusing on creating content that solves peoples problems , content that provides impeccable value , content that is unique , relevant and extremely resourceful. - Content that is much superior than that of your competition even . <p> If you focus- just as much time on really promoting that content the best you know how , using- every platform where you regularly interact and engage with your audience asides on your blog , be it Facebook , Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where ever <p> If you do those two things alone , people are going to notice you . Other bloggers in the same niche or industry will start to recognise you and your amazing blog content . The people- you have connected and built relationships with over time , will begin to do something great for you , theyll start to build your backlinks for you ! <p> What ? I hear you say ! <p> That 's right , people will- begin to link back to your blog and your articles naturally , because your content is so great and so valuable , they trust you and believe that their own audience will appreciate your content too . <p> I do n't  mean to blow my own trumpet when I say this , - but that 's exactly what 's been happening with Magnet4Blogging , people have been linking back to my articles naturally from their blog posts , great ! <p> The chain reaction effect is that you do n't  just gain natural backlinks , but you get to grow your own tribe effectively too , from folks coming over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much slower process than chasing after backlinks yourself , but you benefit from improved SEO , you gain new subscribers , new readers , new social followers and the rest , leaving you with more time to get on and create more great content for your blog . <p> So , if you want to build natural backlinks the lazy way like me ? <p> Create great magnetic content , and other people will build your backlinks for you ! <h> What I consider to be natural linking ? <p> When I 'm building natural links to my blog , I 'll usually link using the naked URL of my blog in variations , for example : <p> www.magnet4blogging.net <p> http : **25;193;TOOLONG <p> magnet4blogging.net <p> http : //magnet4blogging.net <p> Ill rarely use keyword anchor text links just to stay out of trouble with Google , just perhaps now and again for a wide range of long tail keywords . When I 'm blog commenting I 'll use my real name in variations , for example : <p> In addition I 'll also link back using brand name , here are some examples : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I 'm linking back to my blog or articles on my blog from guest posts , I 'll use some of the following generic anchor texts : <p> Click here <p> Visit my blog <p> Check out my blog <p> Learn more about me here <p> Visit my website <p> Read my blog <p> Read this post <p> Check out this post <h> Types Of Posts That Can Attract Natural Backlinks <p> Here is a short list of types of posts that I 've found effective for- attracting attention and of course valuable backlinks , if you can think of anymore , please do add them in the comment section below . <h> Proof that this strategy can work <p> Here are some screen shots of blog posts excerpts where bloggers have linked back to some of my articles , sometimes they are do-follow although most of the time they are n't  : <p> Conclusion ( and your final thoughts ) <p> I appreciate that this method or idea is n't for everyone , a lot of people prefer to actively build SEO backlinks , which is quicker than waiting for someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ever the case , you SHOULD always be striving to- create amazing content for your blog . <p> You do n't  have to go out and write a 2,000 word blog post every single time to create quality content , or to get noticed either , its not about quantity , its quality that matters the most . <p> So , if you want people to link back to your blog and articles without having to go out and chase after backlinks yourself , begin with making your blog the ultimate hub for valuable content , content that focuses on- solving peoples problems , simple . <p> Also , be resourceful and boost your chances of being linked back by adding appropriate links to other valuable sources . Often other bloggers will see that you 've linked to their articles , and if they have trackbacks enabled , they may accept it , not always though . <p> So what are your thoughts on my insight and method for building natural links ?

@@76508729 @5208729/ <p> You see , even though my recommendation was to wait 6 months and build your blog first , there are some benefits of starting to monetize your blog early . Here are two of those benefits . <p> You start to build momentum right away . Your audience will immediately come to know what to expect from your blog . Whereas if you started 6 months or more down the line , when you have a stronger audience for your blog , they may be surprised a little bit to see that you 're trying to turn your blog into a profit making machine . <p> You may be financially better off with your blog . If you started to monetize your blog 6 months from now , you 'd have to wait a few more months , likely even more , before you 'd see any income come through . Whereas if you started to monetize right away off the bat , you may even make your first dollar within a few months . Its possible . <p> Note : I appreciate that not everyone is out to make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that want something to show for all the hard work they put into creating great content and doing- marketing and promotion . For those who want to turn their blogs into profitable businesses , this post is for you . <h> 4 questions to ask yourself before you start monetizing your blog <p> How much traffic is your blog getting ? <p> Do you have enough peeps subscribed to your blog ? <p> Can you honestly say you understand your readers needs ? <p> What monetization strategies will you use ? <p> Let 's dive into each of the questions a little deeper . <h> #1 . How much traffic is your blog getting ? <p> How much search engine , targeted referral , - email traffic- and so on is your blog getting right now ? <p> If you 're only managing 20 visits per day , you 're going to struggle without a doubt . Which reinforces the point I made earlier about waiting 6 months before you monetize your blog. 6 months from now you should have more traffic , right ? <p> If your blog is getting at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good hands to start monetizing successfully . <h> #2 . Do you have enough peeps subscribed to your blog ? <p> The next question to ask yourself is how many loyal peeps ( subscribers ) does your blog have ? <p> The more the better , right ? <p> Of course , because people who subscribe to your blog updates are usually the ones that are interested in what you have to share and offer . <p> If you 've been providing nothing but an- incredible amount of value to them through your blog , podcast , and videos , then turning your subscribers into customers should n't be too hard to do . <h> #3 . Can you honestly say you understand your readers needs ? <p> So I said to you that turning your audience into customers should n't be too hard for you to do , however , this greatly depends on how well you know your audience . <p> You can learn more about your audience by engaging with them , asking them questions from time to time , checking to see what content they respond to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer your help etc . <p> The better you understand your target audience , the better you will be at serving them , and the more likely theyll do business with you . <h> #4 .

Inside the Thrive Leads plugin you have access to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered most of these reporting tools and features in this walk-through video- of Thrive Leads I created a while back . <p> However , a recently added feature to Thrive Leads now enables you to generate- content marketing reports . See image below . <p> This new feature allows you to generate reports where you 'll be able to see- which pieces of your content , i.e. blog posts and pages , are generating you the most amount of conversions and leads . <p> These reports include impressions , conversions and conversion rate and of course new leads . <p> So how valuable is having this kind of data- available at your disposal ? <p> Instead of just wasting your time creating more random blog content and hoping your conversions will increase , this feature will help you to take a lot of the guess work out . Simply by giving you the information you need about what kind of content is really working and getting people to subscribe . <p> In my case from the image above , I see that several of my product comparison and online reviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my recent blogger outreach and expert roundup post with content upgrades , gave- me the best conversions and new leads- in the last 30 days . <p> With this information , - I can now set about creating a content strategy plan that will help me create more of this type of targeted " conversion focused " content . <p> I can also customise my reports even further by changing the source type to view- blog posts , or pages , or all . <p> In addition , I can also change the date interval- to view information about conversion performance over longer periods of time , i.e. 3 months or a year etc . See image to the right . <p> All this sounds pretty cool so far right ? <h> Step Two : Create your- killer content strategy plan . <p> Now that you 're armed with the knowledge of which- types of content you need to create more of , in order to increase conversions and leads , you can set about creating your killer content strategy plan for the next 3 months , or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some great- tools available online to help you create a content strategy plan , here 's a few of my favourite ones that you might not already be using ( but most likely are ) . <h> CoSchedule Content Marketing Editorial Calendar <p> You might have come across this one already at some stage folks , because its both extremely popular and useful , though it does come at a premium price . <h> WordPress Editorial Calendar Plugin <p> This plugin includes the ability to- schedule blog posts , - as well as create new posts directly from the calendar view . <p> You can also view unscheduled posts . See image below . <h> Evernote <p> Evernote is a very versatile online and desktop tool and one that almost every blogger should use . <p> Personally I cant live without Evernote . If I 'm doing research online for my next blog post for instance , I can simply drag stuff that I find and drop them straight into Evernote for use later on . <p> I also use Evernote- to write my blog posts , and because I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can access all of the information and resources I 've gathered , and continue working on new blog post projects from almost anywhere . <p> The best thing about Evernote is that its free to use , with premium options available . <p> My good friend Jane Sheeba wrote an incredibly detailed post on how she uses Evernote to boost her blogging productivity , you can check out that post here . <p> Remember that on average , 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy , but only 2 out of 10 will read the rest ( source ) , so make your headline truly memorable . <h> #2 . Add a thought provoking image or two . <p> The power of visual content- has really exploded in the last few years . <p> Visual content such as images and videos not only brings your content to life , but when it comes to- social media and sharing , images and photos for instance is considered the most important tactic for optimising content on social media . ( Source ) . <p> With that said , use plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests quickly , both on site and on social media . <p> You can use tools like Canva to create professional blog post images , or hire a web graphic designer to create something unique and special for you . <h> #3 . Power up your post with action words . <p> You should always use a variety of calls-to-action to engage and interact with your audience when crafting your blog posts . <p> Use powerful calls-to-action in the most prominent areas of your content. - Whether its to share your post on social media , subscribe to your email newsletter or simply to leave you a comment , ask them by using effective action words ! <h> #4 . Add- some irresistible content upgrades to your blog posts . <p> A content upgrade is a bonus content incentive , similar to the- free report- you might be offering on your blog right now . <p> However , content upgrades can be way more powerful than any free report or eBook . Content upgrades are content extensions to your blog posts . <p> Example : Youre writing a tutorial post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so your content upgrade might be a free PDF cheat sheet- with tips on how to boost opt-in conversion rate. - Your readers can access this content upgrade by opting in to your email list via a form or call to action placed at the bottom of your post . <p> Content upgrades can be very effective especially if the bonus content- is aligned with the topic of the blog post . <p> For added validation that content upgrades can work , take a look at the screen capture below . <p> The screen capture image below is to show you how a content upgrade can be created using some simple image and graphic- editing tools . Again if this is n't something you can do yourself , it might be best to seek out your friendly graphic designer . <p> Another great thing about using content upgrades is that you do n't  just have to add them to new- content , you can add them to some of your existing blog posts as well . <p> Take a look at the top 10 or 20 most popular blog posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one of them . <p> This can be a lengthily process to do I know , but it can be all worth the while . <p> At a later date I 'll share with you a more detailed post ( or podcast episode ) , on how to create irresistible content upgrades for your blog , including some cool online tools and applications you can use as well . <h> Conclusion <p> A lot of bloggers and marketers are obsessed with trying get more traffic , and its not easy . <p> Creating more conversion focused blog content however , and optimising- your existing blog content with content upgrades and so forth may be time consuming. - But it is a lot easier than trying to get more traffic in my experience . <p> With that said , go make a start today , even if you optimise just a few pieces of the content on your blog , the results will most likely be far better conversions that what you 're already getting right now . <p> Best of luck . <p> Enjoyed this post ?

@@76508732 @5208732/ <p> Do you want to learn how to make an infographic without wasting valuable time and money ? In this guest post submitted by Amy Cowen , you 're going to discover a time and money saving way to create epic infographics for your blog ! Rock on Amy ! <p> Most publishers shy away from infographics because they either do n't know how to make one that is absolutely beautiful , or they believe that the benefits wo n't justify the cost if they decide to hire an expert to create- them . <p> This is a rather detrimental view of infographics , especially when we know that infographics tend to get more views " around 15 % more to be accurate - , and get more easily shared than any other type of content , barring videos . <p> In fact this source explains how infographics are likely to be shared and liked on social media 3 x more than any other visual content . <p> And as for the importance of using visuals in content ; - Content with relevant images gets a staggering 94% more views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , let 's get down to business . <h> Cut Down on Preparing Content for Your Infographics <p> One of the greatest concerns that marketers have is connected to the relatively short lifespan that infographics have . <p> Think about it ; you spend a couple of work days researching your topic , organizing data , communicating with your team and the designer , - only to see your work go down the drain after a couple of weeks or a month . <p> This is the natural progression of an infographic . They are increasingly popular and tons of them get published on a weekly basis , so there is really no point in getting upset about it . <p> The trick is to publish graphics closely intertwined with your business , to really hone in on a subject , and deliver quality content . Of course , it would be ideal if you could drastically cut down the time you spend preparing an infographic right ? <p> Well , Im- are here to tell you that there is a way ! <p> Making everything from scratch is pointless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily be turned into a great visual . <p> Just think about the ton of blog posts , articles , podcasts , videos , and white-papers you 've published in the past year . How many email blasts and newsletters did you send to your audience ? The numbers are probably staggering. - Chances are you have more content than you know what to do with . <p> Granted , not everything is great infographic material , and some pieces will require additional research and polishing up , but you 've probably cut your work in half . <p> So , how to- get about it ? <h> Create a content catalog <p> Go through your content . This means going back to those first pages of your blog pulling every " quality " blog post and every article you 've ever written . <p> Check out those miscellaneous folders on your computer . Then sort out everything you 've found by topic . This will give you a general idea about how many pieces of content you have at your disposal . <h> Evaluate every piece of content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each particular piece of that content is . <p> A good rule of thumb is that if you ca n't picture it in the first couple of paragraphs , it 's probably not worth your time . <p> Sort everything by the amount of work it 's going to need to become an engaging infographic . <p> Create folders labeled Too much work ' , Moderate work ' , and Low-hanging fruit ' . You do n't have to use those labels , but you get the point . <p> The important thing is that you can easily find what you are looking for , and you can ballpark the amount of time you 're going to need to invest in polishing up the content . <h> Adapt the content <p> Now we 're coming to the fun part , or the difficult one , depending on how much you enjoy writing new and revisiting old content . <p> Remember , the point is to cut the time needed to create an infographic , so pick the content that you can adapt in half the time or less it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of content you want to adapt and rework , it is going to take some time , regardless of how much you streamline the entire process . <p> If you ca n't tackle it alone , consider including your colleagues or hiring a professional content writing service . <h> Hire a designer or consider making infographics yourself <p> Hiring a reputable designer can cost a lot of money , and your total cost will go up if you decide to repurpose a lot of your content . <p> You can go the low-cost route , paying peanuts for an infographic , but I highly advise against that . You will only end up with an eyesore that will end up hurting your brand more than helping it . <p> There are two ways you can get around this problem . <p> You can touch base with a designer you like and try to negotiate a bulk discount. - Sometimes you can get a decent discount if you commit to ordering a certain number of graphics in , let 's say , a month . <p> If you have contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and make a proposal . You might be surprised at their response . <p> Alternatively , you can take a couple of days and research some design tools that are available online. - Most of them are rather simple , and if you have a flare for design , you might be able to pull it off , especially because these infographics do n't have to be particularly stellar , they just have to not suck ! <h> Tools to help you make an infographic yourself <p> Here are three- of the most popular tools for creating infographics ; take a look at them if you decide to give it a try yourself . <p> Infogr.am has a free version , but it is very limiting as it allows you to download your graphics exclusively as a PNG , which is not extremely useful . <p> The paid version will cost you $19 a month if you decide to subscribe for a year , but you can pay $25 and subscribe only for a month . <p> You will have your choice of around a hundred different templates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add charts to the graphic , but wo n't have an option of adding videos . <p> Infogr.am is easier to master than Piktochart but lacks some advanced features . If you value simplicity and do n't want to end up in over your head , then it might be just the tool that you are looking for . <p> Another fantastic visual content and infographic creation tool you must try is Easel.ly . <p> You can create a free account , or pay just $3 per month for a pro account , which is fair to say wo n't break the bank . <p> The free account is very limited , with only 60 free images and around 10 fonts to use . Where as the Pro Account gives you the choice over 1000s of free images , 50 plus fonts , dozens of pro designed templates and even access to a designer to help you with your infographic creation . <p> Deciding against creating infographics can be detrimental to your business . You can not ignore the stats for starters ! <p> Again , they generate 94% more views- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be shared over social networks . <p> Just ask yourself this What would Bruce Lee do in this situation ? He would create some kick ass infographics is what he would do ! <p> Nicely designed infographics will let you grab the attention of the crowd that might not be otherwise very interested in your content . They do n't have to be ground-breaking or superbly executed ; they just have to be a part of your content mix . Repurposing your old , evergreen content is a great opportunity to create engaging infographics and reach a new audience . <p> Amy Cowen is a content marketing strategist who specializes in maximizing the commercial impact of the content . She manages her own team of content writers at Aussiewriter.com and contributes to different sites and blogs on marketing topics . <p> Do you need a graphic designer to help you create some powerful visual content for your blog or website !

Yes absolutely , there are some great visual elements on Canva you can use to create an infographic project . And then export it . I think my first ever infographic was created on Canva . <p> Hey Kimbo thanks a bunch mate . The stats just prove how critical visual content is these days and infographics too . The thing is these takes a lot of time and effort to put together . Its OK if you have the know how or have access to tools to create them yourself , but they do take an enormous amount of time . <p> I do n't  believe I 've had the pleasure of meeting Amy before so let me be sure to thank her for this post and great choice here . <p> I like infographics but what I do n't  like about them is how quickly they too can become outdated just like our content . I KNOW were supposed to focus on writing evergreen content but let 's face it , rarely is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoe or ride a bike will always be the same way but when it comes to doing things online that 's just much much harder in my opinion . <p> Also for those who are n't  that creative this is n't an easy task even with these different sites . I think in order to stand out of course you want to be unique and different , not have one that 's background is similar to someone elses . I just know this is n't my area of expertise although a lot of people love them . <p> I definitely appreciate what Amy has shared here though , I at least know I should be considering these more . Now just to do them right ! <p> Hey Adrienne , I 'm laughing so hard right now but yes you 're absolutely right , what is evergreen in a world that 's evolving faster than were becoming of age . I mean for instance , everyday I log onto my computer and everyday there 's new updates here , updates there and what not . I mean come on already , how much could things have possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this post , and I for one would like to create a few infographics of my own . I have the tools the content but the time it takes to put these together is ridiculous . <p> I think as well as having the content ready to create into infographics , having the design and graphics elements and icons in place ready to drop and edit into an infographic template , would be awesome and a huge time saver . <p> Thanks for visiting Adrienne , have yourself an awesome rest of the week . <p> Hi Martin , welcome to my site / blog , great to have you here . Yes indeed you could . I started using Canva a few years ago to create short infographics , because all the elements were there and easily accessible . <p> These days I create my own using Affinity Designer . <p> Thanks for checking our my podcast , I have a new episode coming out very soon end of this month = 
@@76508733 @5208733/ <p> Well its finally here , the very first episode of my new podcast for bloggers and entrepreneurs " Above The Fold " . After weeks of planning , getting things together , learning how to use certain software again and setting up the mic , I recorded my first show over the weekend . <p> I cant believe that 18 minutes of audio content took me almost 2 hours to record !

I have missed it ! - So I 'm really happy and super , super excited to be back doing it all over again and this time people <p> Ill be doing it for a little bit longer than last time , let 's see how things go . <p> As far as podcasting goes , I think its a fantastic platform , its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not enough bloggers are doing it . <p> I mean with podcasting you can reach out to a whole new audience , so seriously folks , if you 've been thinking about putting out a podcast show for your blog , stop thinking about it , and get out there and take action !

Introduction and more about my blogging background <p> So if this is your first visit on my blog or first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , I just want to welcome you warmly and thank you mostly , thank you for taking the time out to tune in and listen to the show , I truly appreciate it and I truly appreciate YOU ! <p> Hopefully I 'll be able to share with you some truly amazing content , useful information and techniques that you can use and implement into your own blogging strategies and effectively help you build a better and more successful blog . <p> So as I said my name is Fabrizio Van Marciano , I 'm not Italian and I 'm not dutch , I was born on The small Island of Mauritius and raised in England from an early age . <p> Ive been blogging since the middle part of 2010 , but before that I was running an online business selling original artwork , in fact I still do create and sell art online from time to time . <p> So the whole blogging thing came about in early 2010 , I was influenced by the likes of Darren Rowse from Pro Blogger.net and John Chow from John Chow.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs that- kind of inspired me to start my own blog , and so I started my first blog Magnet4Marketing in July 2010 , and I ran that blog for almost 4 years . <p> You know I built up a pretty good reputation online , I had a small audience and I was getting comments and lots of traffic and what not , I was making- some genuine connections with other bloggers , some whom I 'm still connected with today in fact . <p> But unfortunately I had to take the blog offline in March 2014 because , well , I made a lot of mistakes like any newbie does , I mean Magnet4Marketing was my first blog , previously to that I had no experience in blogging or using WordPress or doing internet marketing stuff or knew even how to build an audience properly- ( aff ) and what have you , so although I was learning all of these things I was- making a lot of costly mistakes in the same process . <p> And looking back now , you know Im kind of glad and thankful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I am today , I would n't have the focus and mindset that I have today with my current blog , those mistakes have made me a smarter blogger , like I said making those costly errors has completely changed my mindset , my focus , my approach , and I 'm loving what I 'm doing over at Magnet4Blogging . <p> I 'm reaching out and connecting with people in my niche like I 've never done before , I 'm creating some amazing content for my audience like I 've never done before , I 'm learning new things still and applying myself consistently , and I 'm loving blogging , and I think that 's what its truly about . <p> You know I put my hands up and I 'm not ashamed to admit that I am a blogging failure , I failed with my first blog , I made a lot of mistakes , learned from them and moved on . <p> I think one of the most valuable things that I can take away from my early blogging experience is not just the mistakes I made , but also all the useful things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During those years I connected with a few influential bloggers with a lot more experience and knowledge than I had , and needless to say I learned some amazing stuff from following , reading and reaching out to those bloggers for help , and I 'm really happy I did that . <p> So as I said earlier I wanted to keep the introduction brief but if you really want to learn more about me and my blogging journey , or my goals and objectives with Magnet4Blogging , please do check out my about page at **30;220;TOOLONG <h> Podcast launch : show formalities <p> OK so I want to move on now and share with you some of the formalities , basically what you can expect from future episodes of Above The Fold , some of the content ideas that I have for future shows . <p> So one of the reasons why I also decided to start a podcast for this blog was because I realised how powerful and effective the medium was to use to distribute content on , and reach out to a whole new audience you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you folks following me to consume my content , sometimes its hard to find time to read blog posts , I mean I struggle to find time to read blog posts being a busy dad and all , and listening to podcasts is perfect . <p> And these days we- all use mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones , and so what better way to distribute content , and more over , for you to consume content on the go , than to tune into a podcast ? What better way ? <p> So what I hope to be able to provide though these podcast shows is more of my tips , ideas , strategies , insights into blogging , I want to be able to share with you what 's working for me , and what 's not , and also I want to be able to bring in special guests , influential people in my niche , do interviews with other bloggers and to give them a chance to share something valuable with you guys , and on that very note <p> On that very note peeps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest , I cant promise anything or name that person just yet , there 's some confirmation and other formalities to do before hand but I 'm certainly hoping that I 'll have an awesome guest for you in episode 2 . <p> Of course if you come up with any ideas yourself , Im open to suggestions , you know , if there 's something you want me to talk about or somebody you want me to try and get on the show for an interview , reach out to me and let me know about them and I 'll certainly consider them . <h> Upcoming eBook <p> OK folks so- I now want to share with you- some exciting news about my brand new up coming eBook , the Definitive Guide to Smarter Blogging . If you 're a regular reader , you 'll no doubt have noticed the eBook cover art in my blogs sidebar with the title " Coming Soon " . <p> Now Ive been working on this eBook as I said for the best part of 4 months now and its taken me a lot longer to complete than I anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on it you know . Once again- I 'm a busy dad by day , I 'm trying to run a blog , write my eBook , provide services through my blog and all of those things happen during the evenings and into the night , and occasionally on some weekends , although I passionately hate working on weekends . <p> But its coming along and Ive almost finished the writing process and will be starting the editing and proof reading process very soon . I 'm hoping to have the eBook launched in the early or middle part of May , I 'm a little bit unsure at present about the accuracy of the launch date , but I 'll of definitely- confirm this closer to that time for sure . <p> So what is in this eBook and who is it for ? <p> Well like I said at the beginning of the show , this is essentially going to be a power guide containing my tips , ideas , techniques and the effective strategies that I 've been using myself , combined with- my personal insights for not only building your blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So I talk about things like motivation in blogging and how to stay focused , I share my unique strategy for creating content ideas , I share my strategy for writing useful , compelling and engaging content , I talk about posting frequency . <p> I share with you my ultimate blog post promotion strategy for maximum content visibility , I share my tips for overcoming obstacles in blogging , how to stand out from the crowd , growing a loyal blog audience and relationship building , and I also share with you some useful resources , including a list of all the tools I use to build my blog and become smarter at blogging . <p> So its going to be a valuable guide for a lot of bloggers of all levels hopefully . <p> Once again , I 'm hoping to have this eBook launched in early May but with a lot left to do , I 'll have to confirm the exact- date closer to the time , however , if you want to be notified when the eBook is launched , I 've created a special page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head over to **30;252;TOOLONG . <h> Taking Action ! <p> OK folks so I want to finish off by sharing with you some good old motivational tips for taking action ! And I think this fits in quite well with the launch of my podcast , because I would n't be here doing this first episode if I had not taken action . <p> Now I know we all live busy lives and we all have different things going on , different commitments and things like that , but here 's the bitter truth of it all peeps : <p> As bloggers and online business owners its so very easy to get caught up in doing nothing but the " regular stuff " . <p> We go on Facebook to update out status and check out what others are getting up to . <p> We go on twitter to post a bunch of tweets . <p> We visit our favourite blogs to catch up on some reading and leave comments and what have you . <p> We go on YouTube and watch a bunch of videos and you know , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And of course if you 're doing all of those things in a productive manner then that 's great . And yes , I appreciate the fact that doing all of these things are an essential part of the blogging process . <p> But seriously ask yourself this : <p> How is doing any of those activities helping you to move forward with your blog or your online business ? <p> OK here 's another question : <p> How is doing any of those activities I 've just mentioned helping you reach your goals ? <p> If you can answer me then forget this conversation ever took place . <p> What I 'm trying to say to you is that some of us are just so- caught up in doing the regular stuff day in day out and we put off the things that really matter , we put off taking action on the things we want to do for ourselves for another day . <p> If you 've made plans to do any of those types of things , and have n't yet started , they wo n't happen until YOU TAKE ACTION ! <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to simply take action , I want you to take action on something that will help you move forward with your blog or your online business . <p> I want you to make a list of the things you planned to- do , and prioritise each of those things in order of importance to you , and take action on one ! Make a start on something . <p> What I 'd like you to do afterwards is come back here , and leave me a comment stating- what it is you took action on , ( so really kind of holding yourself accountable for achieving what ever you want to achieve with your blog ) . <p> OK peeps so that 's pretty much all I have for you in this very first episode , I do hope you 've enjoyed listening even though I did n't  really have much to offer apart from sharing some info about me , some information about my eBook and laying out the formalities of the show so that you know what to expect in the future . <p> But if there 's one thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it ! to take action ! <p> OK thanks for listening once again , I 'm hoping to put a show out once per month , so watch out for my special guest in the next episode , if all goes well that is , I 'll reveal more information closer to the time . <p> Oh and I 'll also keep you posted on my eBook launch . <p> Peace and take care . <p> End Of Broadcast <p> So there you have it folks , my first podcast episode and many more to come in the future . Do n't  forget to leave me a comment below , let me know what you thought . <p> Was the recording quality and sound quality good enough ? <p> Did you like the intro and outro music ? <p> Is the podcast intro clear about what the podcast is about ? <p> Was you able to understand me OK ? <p> Will you tune in regularly to listen to my shows ? <p> I 'd love to get your feedback . <p> The podcast will be up live on iTunes sometime this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my blog as well very soon . <p> Thanks for listening and reading , I appreciate you and your time here , keep an ear out for session 2 next month . <p> Your blogging friend <p> Fabrizio Van Marciano <p> Post Views : 567 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> Good to see you Podcasting . Podcasts are a very good platform and I think a better way of expressing things . In addition to all the information that you normally write down in a post , you have the flexibility to express it with your emotions , in a Podcast . <p> I started my podcast about 4 weeks back . Still very crude though , but I think information is what matters and I think that the perfecting of the recording and fine tuning etc. will go on for the life of the podcast . <p> Your podcast was good and a way to understand more about you . Looking forward to more of it . <p> Hey mate thanks a lot , its taken me a while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using this platform to provide even more value for you guys . Youve hit the nail on the head with podcasting being the most personal way to express opinions and share your message . <p> Wow that 's good to hear about another fellow blogger starting a podcast , I 'll definitely head over to check it out . Glad you enjoyed my first episode , lots more to come . <p> So you 're joining podcasting again . Congratulations and it was a great show . I normally do n't  listen to them myself , I do n't  have the time because I can read much faster and I have so much to do throughout the day but I took the time to listen to your first one and I have no doubt it will be a great success . <p> Thanks for sharing how you got started with us and that you 've done this in the past just like blogging but of course we do n't  always do everything the right way in the beginning . Boy can I relate to you on that level . <p> I know your eBook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your show . You are right , there are people who of course use nothing but their mobile devices these days and would prefer to listen a podcast while they 're doing things . Most are still working day jobs and its a great time to listen to them while they 're in the car . <p> Thanks Adrienne , Im honoured that you tuned in , wow I wish I could speed read , I 've tried it before and I usually end up missing the point of a post entirely , so I have to go back and read it in slow motion , must be just me . <p> I cant wait to start getting people on the show because itll give me a chance to get to know them better and of course strengthen my relationships with them , at the same time I will be providing more value hopefully . <p> Thanks Adrienne , Im honoured that you tuned in , wow I wish I could speed read , I 've tried it before and I usually end up missing the point of a post entirely , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must be just me . <p> I cant wait to start getting people on the show because itll give me a chance to get to know them better and of course strengthen my relationships with them , at the same time I will be providing more value hopefully . <p> Hey David , thanks so much for the awesome feedback my friend , that means a lot .

Love your sense of humour mate , but I hope to provide a lot better content in the future = <p> I have been to your blog before but this is the first time I tuned into your podcast . I love it !

@@76508734 @5208734/ <p> In this post , I will show you how to do just that , and to do it without pulling your eyelids over your head . If that 's even possible . <h> Plugins for the job <p> OK , so the simplest way to change the login URL in WordPress is to use a plugin . <p> There 's a few of them- available in the WordPress.org repository . Unfortunately , though , most of them are no longer maintained or even updated . <p> There 's one plugin in particular , however , which I 'd like to share with you called : Rename wp-login.php . <p> This- is an ultra lightweight plug-and-play plugin ( almost plug and play ) , - so it wo n't eat into your websites- resources- or affect page load time ( much ) . <p> Above all , its simple to install and get working . <p> Before we start , I want to give you some quick tips after changing the URL structure of your login page . <p> Change it to something memorable : Change your new login URL to something that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will not be so obvious for unwanted visitors to guess . For instance ; /login-page/ is pretty obvious so try and avoid using ones like that . You could instead- use something like /jump-on-board/ or /let-me-in/ or /members-only-page/ . I 'm sure you can think of a few more . <p> Write it down : Make sure you write the new login page URL somewhere until you remember it off by heart . <p> Right , let 's get started <h> 1 . Installing Rename wp-login.php <p> Pretty straight forward stuff if you 're familiar with WordPress. - If you 're not , then all you have to do from the back end of your site ( Admin area ) , is head over to Plugins &gt; Add New , and do a search for " Rename wp-login.php " . See screen shot below . <h> 2 . Configuring the Rename wp-login.php plugin <p> Head over to Settings &gt; Permalinks. - Scroll down to the bottom of the page until you see the option to add a new string for the login page . See image below . <p> Simply add a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit save , that 's it you 're done ! <p> How easy was that ? <h> What happens to your wp-login.php extension ? <p> If you now try accessing the wp-login.php URL of your site or blog , you 'll instantly be presented with an annoying but welcoming- 404 error page not found . <p> This should deter unwanted visitors trying to access this page to log into your site in the future . <h> Disabling or redirecting the wp-login.php <p> If you prefer to completely disable or redirect the wp-login.php page for whatever reason , you can try using the following code placed inside your themes functions.php . <p> Please do this at your own- risk . You have been warned . <p> ( Always backup your WordPress site before making any changes to the- functions.php . One thing you could do if you 're not too sure how to back it up is to simply copy the entire contents of your functions.php page , and paste it into a notepad. ) 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> I wish I 'd known how to rename @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people , I was being hit a LOT with people and bots trying to log into my blog . Its SO frustrating as many know . I did n't  want to do the double opt-in type feature or log-in verification through the phone . They had a lot of those resolutions back when I was searching for a solution . <p> I had someone create a detour so to speak and it worked . I highly recommend you rename that page so that you can stop those annoying people in their tracks . I believe I 'm going into 3 years now and I have n't had any issues at all . No one can get to my log-in page if they take that normal route . It sends them back to my blog which I love . <p> Great share Fabrizio and I 'm going to have to hang onto this post for future reference . I 'm sure I 'll be creating another site in the future . <p> Hi Adrienne , thanks so much for your comment . Well I discovered this a while back to be honest and I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things I get requested a lot for on Magnet4Blogging is more tips n tricks posts on WordPress , hacks etc . So I 'll be putting together a lot more posts like these in the future . <p> Since renaming the login URL for my niche site I tell you , no more spammy registrations , for now at least . Its such a shame there are people out there willing to try anything and everything to get into a WordPress site . And of course bots too mainly . <p> Glad you found this post useful , have a great rest of the week = Fabrizio . <p> I too wish I wouldve known about this years ago . I did n't  even realize I was getting spam registrations until my web host threatened to shut me down because too many emails were being sent out from my server . <p> Of course I had new registrations disabled on this one until I opened up my membership site but I still need to get to changing the default login page once I figure out its not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the membership aspect now . I 'm not super knowledgable when it comes to the tech side but it sounds like it should be compatible with other plugins based on the way it works . <p> Security is one of the main challenges in personal blogging where failed login attempts report on daily basis perturbs a blogger who already is under stress of meeting deadlines and following a tough blogging schedule . <p> Earlier the only smart trick was to change the user i 'd and put a unique I 'd for WP control panel but now a lot of resources to change the login url is just amazing way to keep the site safe from any malicious attempt . <p> Hey Muba , thanks so much for dropping by buddy . Yeah security is such an important factor when using WordPress , and especially as your site begins to get more and more popular . Unfortunately there 's always going to be folks and bots looking to do some kind of exploitation and if we can stop them in their tracks before any damage is done , then that 's a great start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for boosting WordPress security . Currently I 'm using WordFence premium for added piece of mind , and of course there 's backing up our sites for even more peace of mind . <p> I 'm in the midst of writing up a detailed tutorial of creating professional backups for WordPress users which will be live shortly . <p> Hey Don , no need to apologise man its great to see you here any case busy man . I know you 've just migrated your site over to WordPress , so it could be a little while before you start seeing increased activities on your wp-login.php page . <p> The best plugin to use to track activity on wp-login.php page is the Limit Login Attempts plugin , though be careful as it has n't  been updated for a long while . Coding some kind of software to do the job for you is more headache than its worth , and who has time for that when there 's a business to be running right ?

For this tutorial , I 'm going to use the Magazine Pro child theme as an example . See image below . <p> When you find the name of the child theme you want to add your custom 404-page- in , simply click on it to open it and to view all of the files within this child theme folder . <p> As you can see from the- image below , inside the Magazine Pro child theme there is n't a 404-page template in sight , so the child theme is simply pulling the 404-page template from the Genesis parent theme . <h> Create a custom 404-error page : Step two <p> OK , so the next thing you need to do is create a new file inside your themes folder , this is very simple to do . <p> Navigate to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an icon that says New File . Click on it to create one . <p> Now were going to name this file 404. php- See images below . <p> Hit Create New File to save it . Then locate the new file in your child theme folder and navigate back to the header to find Edit . See image below . <p> When you click on Edit , a pop-up box will appear like the one below for the text-editor . <p> This is just to advise you to backup the original file before making changes to it . Since the file is going to be empty at this stage , just go ahead and click on Edit . Do n't  change anything else . <h> Create a custom 404 page : Step three <p> So at this stage , you should see a new tab open in your browser with the editor open . <p> It is in here that we are going to paste our new custom 404-error page PHP code . <p> Do n't  hit save yet , there are a few obvious things you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replace the %s as shown below ; <p> &lt;a href= " %s " &gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; <p> with your own homepage URL . <p> Secondly , you might want to change the text that says Search more as shown below ; <p> ' Search more than 150 articles : ' <p> to whatever message you 'd like . <p> The next thing to do is to add the URL of the search results page in your WordPress website to the code . <p> So if you 're using a custom AdSense search box , for instance , you can add the URL of the results page where it says ; <p> " http : **31;284;TOOLONG " <p> Once you 've made all the changes needed to the PHP code in your new 404-page file , simply click on the Save- button to save it . See screen shot below . <p> OK so now you need to check to see what youve actually done has worked for your site . <p> If I go to my own website and add some random text on the end of the URL to generate a 404 error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I created for my site is now working . See image below . <h> Create a custom 404-error page : Step- four <p> If you head back into your WordPress dashboard for your website or blog , then click on Appearance &gt; Editor , you should see a new file called 404 Template for your child theme . See image below for example . <p> In the future , you can make changes to your 404-template for your child theme here , instead of going via the Cpanel . <p> I hope you enjoyed reading this quick little tutorial , and I hope that it has worked for you and your Genesis site . <p> If you have any questions or get stuck , please do n't  hesitate to get in touch with me here , I 'll try and assist you the best I can . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 
@@76508736 @5208736/ <p> To really answer the question of why do you blog , you really need to understand what drives you to want to blog . <p> Think about why you started blogging in the first place if that helps at all . <p> See if you can answer the following questions . <p> What are your passions ? <p> What is your purpose as a blogger and why should anyone care ? <p> What makes you so different from all the other bloggers out there ? <p> Grab a pen and paper and spend a few minutes trying to figure out some of the answers to those questions above . <p> When people ask me , Fabrizio , why do you- blog ? , or what is your purpose as a blog writer ? , I usually respond with the following : <p> I blog because I love to provide value and help to solve problems for people reading my content . If people find value in what I have to offer as a blog writer , they can learn to trust me , purchase my products , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself why you started blogging. - Think about how passionate and driven you were , and then try and get that feeling back . <h> #2 . Do something that inspires you ! <p> Motivation comes when you do inspiring things . <p> So instead of fighting with yourself trying to get inspired to work on your blog , or to write your next blog post , do something else entirely . <p> It could be anything at all ; washing the car , going off for a nice walk , listening to music , watching motivational videos on YouTube even ! 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> You are right we all have motivational challenges from time to time . And I do n't  think it applies to bloggers alone . <p> I also agree that this is a huge issue for most business owners , but especially for home business people . It can get lonely as a solo entrepreneur ; that 's why your suggestion to connect with others is so valuable . We are social creatures , so its imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement . <p> Techniques Ive used to get myself motivated are varied . One is to turn off the computer , lie on my bed with a piece of paper and a pencil and just , well , doodle for a while . It helps get my creative juices flowing again . Often within 15 minutes Ive mapped out a simple game plan replete with lots of exciting ideas that will keep me motivated for weeks . Bloggers can use a variation of this technique if they 're suffering from an inspirational deficit . <p> Hey Kim first and foremost thanks for your comment and wow ! Thanks for grabbing my eBook , what can I say , I 'm totally honoured . <p> Thank you for sharing the things you do to motivate and inspire yourself . I can imagine that doing some creative doodling can get your thoughts and ideas flowing greatly . Yes sometimes turning off the computer can help . Its so easy to get stuck on the screen like a fly compelled towards that blue zapper light lol . <p> The tips I shared and indeed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just bloggers , but like you say solopreneurship can be a pretty lonely journey , which is why networking and making those awesome connections is a must . <p> Do I get tired sometimes and do n't  want to blog ? Sure I do . But then I just do something different for a while . I 'll make more videos and include those in my blog with a short post . Its less writing and more fun for me , lol <p> Because I get to see the results of my clients success it just never gets old for me . Its all I want to do to be honest Fabrizio . <p> Hey Don , thanks for sharing your message and honesty here . That 's so awesome that you get fired by by seeing other folks take action on what you have taught them , and to succeed as well . I think that would definitely fire me up too . <p> Blogging has really changed my life too . There was a time though that I was very unmotivated and that 's when I felt stuck where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . Its like that old saying about doing the same things over and over again expecting to get different results . Until I took that turn I felt stuck but once I did then things have really been fabulous . <p> I 'm someone who started out thinking I could do this all by myself . It took me a few years to figure this out and I 'm not sure why I balked at it so much since I 'm such a people person . I thought I was bothering others though or that they would n't like what I shared . Just all sorts of thoughts going through my head . Once I realized that they have the same thoughts I do and I started meeting people online then things really changed for me . <p> I do n't  need to motivate myself , I get up every morning loving life and welcoming the new day and what it has in store for me . I wish everyone could do that but we all have our own routines right !

Youve hit the nail on the head , I think when folks get into blogging without any real purpose , they can get stuck and become uninspired . You decided to take a direction that worked for you and your blog and your community and boy it has helped you to find success right ? <p> Like you I initially thought I could do this myself . But the reality is that blogging is n't really an activity one does alone . <p> Its great to hear you do n't  need to motivate yourself and your tank is always full , but you know deep inside that its possible to become motivated and uninspired , because like I mentioned in the post , sometimes life can throw an unexpected rusty spanner in the works , and our motivation can take a bit of a dent . <p> Thanks again for dropping by Adrienne , keep up that smile of yours =

If you 're starting a fresh blog but not necessarily your first blog , hopefully you can use the tips below as a refresher as well . <p> Just to be clear right from the word go , Ill- assume that you 've already purchased your domain name and that you have some web hosting sorted out , ( If you do n't  have any of these things yet , click here to get set up quickly ) . Ill also assume- that you 've finished installing WordPress and that you 're ready to rock ! <p> So you 're all set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post for your brand new blog right ? <p> Nope you 're not ready just yet ! - Before you start writing anything , - there 's a few extra essential things you need to do , so let 's check them out below . <h> Starting a new blog ? What to do after installing WordPress <p> Tip #1 : Delete the sample page and " Hello World " post - If this is your first ever WordPress blog you might not know to do this . <p> When starting- a new blog with a fresh WordPress installation , by default you 'll usually- be greeted with a " hello world " post and sample page that 's already been published . <p> What you need- to do once youve logged into your WordPress dashboard , is to immediately delete both the sample- post and the page , you really do n't  need them . See image below . <p> Simply hit trash and then head over to the trash folder and delete them permanently . <p> When you 're ready to start writing your first post , just head over to Posts &gt; Add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - The next thing you want to do is head over to Plugins and delete all the default plugins that came with your WordPress installation , except maybe for the Akistmet plugin , you 'll probably need that one for much later on when you start getting a few more comments on your blog . For now though you can just deactivate it if you wish . <p> Tip- #3 : Change the permalink structure - This one is entirely up to you , however I would highly recommend that you consider changing the permalink structure to a more simple format . <p> To change your permalink , simply head over to Settings &gt; Permalinks and change from the default permalink to either date and name , or month and name . <p> The setting- I 'd personally recommend using is just post name , as this is a more human and search engine friendly structure . <p> Once you 're done , - hit save changes . See image below . <p> Note : On latest versions of WordPress , the " post name " is already selected by default , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just double check to be sure . <p> Tip- #4 : Install your preferred plugins - After deleting the plugins you did n't  need in tip #2 , its time- to install the plugins you do need . <p> If this is your very first blog and you 're not too sure what- a plugin is , or what they do , - let me briefly explain . If you do n't  need to read this , just skip this part entirely and move onto Tip #5 . <p> What are plugins for WordPress ? WordPress plugins are- simply add-ons that you install into your hosted WordPress site . The purpose of plugins is- to extend the functionalities of your WordPress website . For example , adding the WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin will enable you to- accurately optimise your site , pages and posts , for better search engine visibility and performance . <p> Adding the WooCommerce plugin will enable you to turn your WordPress site into an eCommerce platform , where you can sell products . <p> All you have to remember is that if you want to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest way to do it is to install a plugin . The WordPress plugins repository has over 34,000 plugins to choose from . <p> Alternatively if you do n't  wish to use plugins on your site , you can hire a developer to hard code anything you need to add to your site to add functionality . However this option usually takes time and costs money . <p> OK so here is a list of top plugins I 'd personally recommend installing . <p> WordPress SEO by Yoast ( Joost de Valk ) For all your on-page and site wide SEO needs . <p> How many plugins should I install ? As far as how many plugins you should install goes , it greatly depends on what you want your blog to do . As a rule , I do n't  usually add more than around 15 plugins to any blog installation , that 's my top number personally . <p> Remember the more plugins you add , the more your page loading time will be affected. - I would also recommend only installing plugins that are regularly updated , and avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years or more . <p> Premium plugins are great because they 're well coded and regularly updated . <p> Tip- #5 : Disable user registration - For a new blog you do n't  really want anyone to be able to subscribe , perhaps later on if you decide to accept guest posts or create membership pages . For now though this setting can be left un-ticked . <p> With new versions of WordPress , as default this is disabled in any case , but do double check this .

@@76508740 @5208740/ <p> So you have a brand new website " hot off the press " and you 're ready to roll . As of this- moment in time you 're staring at a blank canvas . <p> You 're thinking about branding and really wanting to create something special that will stand out from the crowd . Where do you even start ? <p> Well right here is where you start , because in this post I 'm going to- share with you 7- killer website branding tips and ideas for for you to explore , and more over , these are simple things that you can do , so how about that ? <p> What I want to do is break this post into two sections , were first going to look at website branding in design , then were going to look at branding in marketing , so let 's get stuck in . <h> Website Branding Tips In Design <p> If you 've been following my blog for any length of time , you 'll know that I 'm obsessed with design when it comes to the web , so this part for me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trick question , because having a unique style or theme is what will help you make your- website memorable , and also help make your brand stand out . <p> For instance , if you take a look at- ByRegina.com , - her site has a very " unique " , clean , modern fresh feel and look which I really love . <p> And if you take a look at- **25;317;TOOLONG ( Dre Beltrami ) , - her site also rocks a " unique " semi-boutique style of design . See screen captures of their websites below . <p> I think you 'd agree with me that both Regina and Dre have created a memorable online brand for their business , and one that is " unique " . I say that a lot because often uniqueness is overlooked in branding in design . <p> The other important element with creating a memorable online brand for your business , its not just about creating something that looks great , but also something that is going to suit your personality and individuality . <p> Your brand needs to say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person or entrepreneur , and it has to be something that you absolutely love as well . <p> #2 . Colour The next course of action- is- picking out some colours to complement your website style . <p> Now I only speak from experience here , but flooding your website with all the colours of the rainbow is OK if that 's your kind of thing , - but more often than not this can create some unwanted design clutter . <p> Two tones work very well in modern website design. - For instance , Magnet4Bloggings design incorporates a two tone flat red with dark charcoal throughout . The images and graphics- also have the same attributes , though I 'm still updating many of them as I 'm writing this . <p> You 'll also notice that the two great looking websites I mentioned above also incorporates two-tone colours mainly . <p> Take the time to pick colours that will stick with you and your brand , and more importantly , pick tones that wont put off your site visitors as well . What ever you do , do n't  make your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below hurts your eyes ) . <p> Now if you think about this very carefully , often regardless of the- style or theme you might be rocking on your site , the moment you change the typography it affects the overall design or look and feel of your website entirely . <p> When selecting typography its important to think not just from a design perspective ( what looks great ) , but also from a users perspective as well . Where ever possible try and use web safe fonts . You 'll find some inspiration here . <p> #4 . Layout Now just as style and colour is important , so is the layout of your site . You have some choices to make whether you want a compact site where all the elements are packed tightly together , or want to create lots of space between your elements , content , images , graphics etc . <p> From personal experience and working with some recent clients , the- core message or value proposition of a website can sometimes become diluted when theres- too much going on . <p> Creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a branding point of view , but also from a users perspective as well . <h> Tips For Website Branding In Marketing <p> OK so we 've looked at some core design elements involved in creating a memorable online brand for your site , but design is just one obstacle . <p> Let 's now look at some marketing objectives to help you increase brand awareness for your site . <p> When someone new comes along to your site , sure it might take them a few seconds to get their bearings that 's natural . But you can assist them better by- ensuring that you have a clear message and unique value proposition , something irresistible- and compelling to offer . <p> So your first time visitors- might be asking themselves : <p> " have I landed on the right site here ? " and if so , - " Is this site worth my time ? " or " This site looks interesting , but what 's in it for me ? " . <p> I 'll keep this very simple : <p> The process of defining your message does n't  happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else where , its something bloggers and marketers are always working on to improve . And its something that you can define better , the more connected you are with your audience . <p> #6 . Content &amp; Visuals So you have a great looking website that 's well branded , with a clear message and UVP , its time to back it all up with some great content and visuals , because let 's face it , great content is the fuel to your branding , marketing , getting noticed and building your community successfully , and generally everything else to do your online business success . <p> Its also very important to ensure that your content always remains aligned with your marketing message , your UVP etc . <p> Visual content is- also a critical part of your brand marketing , so take the time to create truly memorable blog post images and custom graphics that will not only make your content stand out and recognisable anywhere online , but to also promote sharing on social media sites and blog networks . <p> here 's a link to a recent guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools for creating beautiful content . <p> Canva is just one of those wonderful online tools you can use to help you create stunning online visual content . <p> Once again , if you do n't  have the time to create your own visual online content , perhaps hiring a graphic designer to help take care of this for you could be a better option .

Writing Style &amp; Tone - Finally folks , if you 're incorporating blogging into your business ( which you should be ) , having- a unique writing style and tone will help you promote and grow your brand even more . <p> Developing a persona takes time I know , but- the more useful and compelling content you can create and dish out , and the more connected you can become with your- online community , the more familiar folks will become with your style of writing . <h> Have your say <p> So I 've hopefully shared some simple but worthy tips for you to think about doing when branding your website , both in design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science folks , and its so easy to think that it is when you read other articles on the web- that makes all of this sound more challenging than it actually is. - However- it does take some time . <p> Do let me know your thoughts , leave me a comment below . <p> What are you doing to create a memorable branded website for your business ? <p> Let 's get your business rocking online !

Lots of things to read and check with the connected links you 've given . I am sure this will present me with some new experiences in my blogging journey . I am bookmarking it for future reference . Keep sharing and Thanks again Fabrizio . <p> Well there are some people who still just do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm one of them . As you know , I finally got my new theme but I 'm not consistent yet with my images or color because I only go so far and then I hit a wall . I just ca n't make up my mind but its SO important too so I 'm glad you pointed all of this out . <p> I 'm still trying to figure a few things out so I hope that those who have it together can easily follow everything you 've shared here . Its not easy task getting everything in place but its a necessity if you really want to stand out . <p> Hi Adrienne , thanks so much for your comment and being honest . I definitely know where you 're coming from because a lot of the times although I know what I 'm looking for , I 'm always indecisive about things , especially when it comes to design . <p> That 's one of the reasons why I decided to take a step back from blogging all too frequently to focus on getting this right once and for all . <p> Your site looks great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with a more modern fresh look . As far as branding colours and design style goes , you 'll get there , like I said these things take time to craft , and for sure its not an easy process . <p> I just redesigned my site and the feedback I 'm getting it outstanding ! ! ! I really love the professional and polished feel ; especially since my audience tends to be more high end entrepreneurs . <p> I really appreciate you including me in your post . The reality is that ones message is the absolute most important thing the message will ultimately dictate the layout of a website . <p> The reason is you want to be able to deliver a clear , concise and relevant message for a specific audience and the layout is the means to do that ; and as you know ones industry , purpose for the site ( ie information , education , marketing , ecommerce , etc ) and a few other factors inform it . <p> Hey Don I know you recently migrated over to WordPress and you 're now rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that what you had before was n't great , but I certainly feel your new site looks more up to date and professional = <p> Don I love the homepage of your site now , I really do . Love the fact you 've incorporated your call to action inside a button . I use something similar on my homepage with " work with me " . <p> Anyway , glad you 're getting some awesome positive feedback my friend . <p> You are the master when it comes to clarity and message in online business for sure Don . Thanks to you and a small handful of other fine marketers out there I 've been able to incorporate some of that into my own business . <p> The problem I find with a lot of bloggers and entrepreneurs is that they have way too much going on on their homepage . Its like information super overload , especially above the fold where I see most of the space being cluttered with crap , and often the message gets lost . <p> Have a great rest of the week mate = Hope some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit I am hopeless when it comes to blog design . I know what looks good but have no clue how to create a nice looking site for myself . <p> While I neglected color and typography previously , I recognise now that they are important issues , at least from a branding point of view . <p> Design wise , I 've noticed that a lot of websites that use themes such as Thrive have a sameness about them . Structurally they seem to be more or less the same as each other . From a differentiation point of view , this is a concern . That said , your two examples look great and unique . Just like your blog ! <p> ( Business owners including bloggers would be well advised to engage a designer who will help lift a site from being functional but mediocre to something unique and exciting . ) <p> Regarding the issue of messaging , even if a site owner does n't  have a blog there is a lot they can do to develop and articulate a potent message for their audience . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lame . Its pathetic . <p> Whether its the home page , the about page or the testimonial page it is critical to get the messaging right . Bottom line it does n't  matter how beautiful a site looks , if the messaging does n't  hit the spot with site visitors , conversions will tank , and the site owner will be forever complaining about all the money he spent on a non-performing website . <p> Hi Kim , thanks for stopping by hope you 've been keeping well buddy . You are spot on my friend , yes I could n't agree more about the " message " . <p> Ill be the first to admit that when I got started with this blog some years back , I do n't  think I took this seriously enough . <p> I 've always gone by the concept of " hey if you like my stuff then that 's cool , if you do n't  then tough " . <p> But as I started to look at blogging as a business , I started to become more specific with my message and put some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was getting more visitors , more subscribers , more affiliate conversions , sales and more clients coming in the door . <p> Before I came to know of Thrive very few were using it , but like anything these days it became popular . Like Genesis , I loved Genesis and had been using them for years , until I got fed up with the fact that almost every other blogger was using the same theme . <p> The great thing about Thrive is that they have some swell customisation and front end tools to really help you create custom pages , and with combined with my own design elements and some fancy code work I was able to create something a bit more unique for brand . <p> Loving this Blog Post Fabz . Definitely agree with Kim#2s perspective on having the right message on your website ( this is super important ) . I 'm so glad that I have finally gotten on the right track with this . because it has truly made a hugeeeee difference . <p> To Fabzs point though , design does matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less likely to trust you and also , it just helps your brand stand out from the rest <p> The two brands that you mentioned in this post Fabz , Regina and Dres brands are totally rockin it out online . Grant it , they do also have powerful messaging to back their brands as well .

@@76508742 @5208742/ <h> And the three- most popular web host providers are right now ? <p> HostGator and Bluehost are household names in the web hosting world . SiteGround is also now very popular . <p> Bluehost and SiteGround are currently WordPresss top choice for PHP and MySQL web hosting . <p> What you need to know , however , is the answer to the following question : <p> Which web host to use ? ? ? <p> Hopefully , after you 've read my most honest- and unbiassed comparison post here , much of it based on my own personal experiences with these three hosting companies , you 'll be able to make a better decision as to which one to use for your website . <p> Let 's get cracking . <h> Before we get started <p> Before we get started , I want to explain the situation with Bluehost and HostGator quickly , which I think you should know about if you do n't  already . <p> As I mentioned , HostGator and Bluehost are common household names in the world of shared web hosting . <p> Both of these companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bluehost and HostGator are owned by the EIG Group ( Endurance International Group ) . <p> What does that have to do with anything ? you might ask . <p> Well , for most people who have experienced any below average service from an EIG owned hosting company , it can be an instant turn-off . <p> And that 's not just my word either . Go ahead and do a quick search online and you 'll soon find an abundance of- complaints- made from customers using an EIG hosting brand . <h> Separate hosting companies <p> Whilst both Bluehost and HostGator are separate companies offering different levels of services and prices , they 're both owned by the same mother ship hosting company , so bare that in mind for the future . <h> What about SiteGround ? <p> They have n't been around for as long as the two above mentioned companies granted , but they are certainly a web host provider gaining a lot of traction , popularity , respect and authority , and certainly one of the best choices to consider . <p> OK , so now let 's dive deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ill talk about- features , benefits and what each one has to offer for your hard earned cash . <p> Reliability &amp; Security - So this is the part you need to read about . When I began using Bluehost back in 2009 , they were without a doubt incredibly reliable . Easily the best in the business I might add . <p> Uptime was really good too . The first couple of years I experienced only 1 downtime , and that was due to the company- installing new upgrades and what not , but nothing much to complain about at the time . <p> From around 2013 and onwards , uptime and the general quality of the service I received from Bluehost became something of an issue . <p> On 1st April 2014- my website went- down for 3- whole days , with no real explanation from Bluehost other than they knew about the problem . <p> Many other customers were experiencing the same downtime issue , and all Bluehost could say was that they trying to fix it . <p> That became the normal thing afterward , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I used this tool to calculate- the uptime I was experiencing from Bluehost over a 12 month period , minus all the downtimes . <p> It turned out that my site was experiencing an uptime score of- 99.20% . <p> Most people would argue , well , that 's not too bad surely . I beg to differ personally . <p> On April 16th , 2014 my website went down again with downtime , I sent out a tweet about it and mentioned @bluehost . As normal , they were working on it . That was the last straw for me . <p> Shortly after , I began looking for a web host company . <h> Asides from downtime , what else was wrong with Bluehost ? <p> When it comes to security , Bluehost is still pretty solid in my opinion . <p> In my time using them , I 've only experienced one occasion where an attempt was actually being made to hack into my site . <p> Luckily the Bluehost tech team- were on the case before I could even bring it to their attention . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load speed and uptime for the last 8 months here . <p> Affordability Bluehost is not the cheapest around , but still nevertheless reasonably affordable when you weigh up what you get ( minus the poor uptime ) . <p> According to their website what you get is unmetered and unlimited- everything . <p> Shared hosting starts from $7.99 per month- ( $2.99 with their current 2017 special offer ) for a Basic plan , whilst their Prime plan will set you back- $14.99 per month ( $5.45 with their current special offer ) . <p> Reliability Even though I was a customer of HostGator for only about 16 months , I was quite impressed with the reliability of their service . <p> I experienced zero downtime with my site during its short life , and so never really had the chance to use and experience their- customer support properly . <p> The signup process was fairly straight forward with HostGator , and once you 're in you have a similar setup as with Bluehost , with cPanel access and smart web developing tools , and of course that one-click install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load response time <p> **View HostGator page load speed and uptime for the last 8 months here . <p> Affordability HostGator is one of the most affordable web host providers around . <p> I 'm happy to report , however , that in the last 3 years of using them , I 've experienced nothing but- 100 percent server uptime . So if you were to ask me " are they reliable ? " <p> 100%- yes would be my answer . No pun intended there = <p> As for performance and security , SiteGround thrives on the robustness and secureness of their service , with- SDD , latest speed technologies , free SLL , autoupdates , firewall rules and monitoring with daily backup added to their service <p> Uptime- and page load response time <p> **View SiteGround page load speed and uptime for the last 8 months- here . <p> Affordability SiteGround , again like Bluehost are n't  the cheapest web host providers on the web . But , what is affordable or cheap to one person is completely another thing for someone else , right ? <p> Like I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , or a higher premium for a more reliable service . And I know that sometimes you can pay MORE and expect a reliable service , but actually end up getting a crap service . <p> The StartUp plan- with SiteGround will set you back $9.95 per month ( Currently there 's 60% off deal with SiteGround , which means you pay only $3.95 per month ) for a 12 month period . <p> The Grow Big plan will set you back $14.95 per month , and the GoGeek plan will set you back $29.95 per month . <p> Customer service and technical support SiteGround provides customer service and technical support through means of phone , chat or ticket . <p> I 've only ever had to contact SiteGround technical support once , still to this day ! And were now in 2017 <p> The reason for contacting them was regarding CPU throttling problems that I was experiencing on my account . <p> Unlike Bluehost , they did n't  tell me that I needed to upgrade my account or pay more money to get a better service , phew <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming from , although they did n't  succeed in finding a solution . <p> I was later able to identify a simple setting in my theme which was causing the high CPU throttling . <p> I give SiteGround customer team and technical support a big thumbs up , simply for the fact that they were willing to help me out before telling me that I needed to pay more money for improved service . <p> With SiteGround you also have access to a host of resources , including tutorial videos , webinars and there 's even a setup wizard for new folks . <p> Facts and stats about SiteGround- Heres some interesting stats about SiteGround . <p> SiteGround have data centers in three Continents . USA , Europe , and Asia . <p> From my own findings , I 've managed to achieve 100% uptime from SiteGround in the last 36 months . Woop , - woop ! <p> Final words - I 'll remind you that SiteGround is n't a cheap option , and if you join them at a discount rate , do n't  expect that discount to continue when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I certainly noticed how my hosting bill went up by a whopping $80 in the second year . <p> That being said , I recommend them wholeheartedly ! <p> If you do n't  mind paying a little bit more for peace of mind web hosting , then get with SiteGround . Let them take care of hosting your site securely so that you can get on with what 's important , building your blog or online business . <p> I personally give SiteGround a respectable- 4.7 out of 5 . <h> Wrapping things up ! <p> Whether you choose to use a house hold name web hosting company like Bluehost , or an independent company like SiteGround to host your WordPress website , there 's a few things you have to keep in mind as I 've outlined- in this post . <p> Do n't  just go for the cheapest option and be done with it , do n't  go for the most popular provider because that 's what everyone else is doing . <p> Consider your options carefully . Do your research carefully , hopefully , this post will have helped you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stats before finalizing on which host provider to use for your future website or blog project . <p> I hope you 've enjoyed reading through this web hosting comparison post , and that you 've found it useful . <p> If you have any questions , please do n't  hesitate to ask me in the comment section below , or drop me an email- here . <p> The best of luck = <p> ** Screen captures- of test site page load and uptime reports .

However- you still need to watch out for the telltale signs . <p> What is bloggers burnout ? Just in case you 're new to all this and wondering what this is bloggers burnout is simply exhausting yourself and all of your resources when it comes to creating content for your blog , or just working on your blog period . <p> I was so busy writing content every single day that I really did n't  think about hitting the wall . <p> But then in the summer of 2013 , after almost 3 years of flat out writing and publishing posts everyday , I hit the wall in blogging , and my creative mind simply came to a grinding halt . <p> My bloggers burnout experience did n't  just last a few days either , it went on for three whole months . <p> In that timespan I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , not a comment nothing ! <p> I do n't  really know to this day , what came over me , I just woke up one morning and did n't  feel like blogging , I just stopped everything ! <p> I tried hard to get back into the swing of things , but I could n't find my creative flow and became bored quickly . I tried everything to motivate myself , but- I 'd usually end up procrastinating more than doing anything productive <p> So how did I overcome this feeling ? <p> I finally decided to do something about this , because in all honesty , I actually love blogging . There was certainly passion when I first started , and it lasted for almost three years , so I had to find that burning flame again . <p> Here are 10 things that helped me to find my rhythm and creative flow in blogging again , these 10 things can certainly help YOU too , if you 're going through a dry spell with your blog . <p> #1 . Develop a blogging routine that works for YOU Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and working on your blog . <p> I 've found from my own personal experience that writing blog posts roughly the same time each day helps a lot , however , you do n't  have to be posting everyday , just writing something everyday helps to stay on track . <p> Update 29/03/2015 : I no longer write and publish a post daily , I now put out a really good post once per week . Although I still write daily , as a post now takes me a whole 7 days to put together ! I work on the same- post for around 30 to 45 minutes each day . <p> If you get- yourself into a routine where youre- working on your blog- for 2 or 3 hours every evening , starting roughly the same time each day , let 's say from 9pm to midnight , then keep to that routine . <p> In any event , a blogging routine can only be effective if you 're motivated to keep to that routine . <p> Sometimes distractions can knock you off course , especially if you live a busy life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have other commitments. - But if you can keep to a regular blogging routine as often as you can , you 'll be doing one positive- thing to help you keep from burning out . <p> #2 . Set yourself " realistic " - reachable goals Creating small daily objectives can certainly help you get more done , in addition , goal setting is a great way to measure your success . <p> Having something to focus and aim for daily can completely dispel any possibility of suffering from bloggers burnout , since your focus is on reaching your objective , and not trying to complete lots of things in one day . <p> Update : I use a to-do list daily , but these days my to-do list only consist of one thing , if I can complete one thing daily to help me move forward with my blog , then I 'm making progress . <p> #3 . Brainstorm for post ideas - What 's the benefit of brainstorming for post ideas ? - So that you can always have a list handy , of the things you might want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started doing a lot more of after hitting writers- block . <p> Heres what you can do , spend 10 minutes or so each week looking through your comments , checking out what 's popular on social media sites , visiting blog communities and forums , reading other blogs , and make a list of post ideas you can write about . <p> You can use your computer to do this or good old fashion pen and paper . I use Evernote to write my list of post ideas so that I can access it from all of my other devices . <p> At the end of the day , you might find you do n't  end up writing about anything that 's on your list , - or you might find you only use one or two post ideas from your list , but sometimes just having some ideas already down on paper , can spark off other interesting post topics to write about . <p> If you use WordPress , I 'd highly recommend you check out the Editorial Calendar plugin. - I 've been using this plugin for sometime now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write and have scheduled for what days . <p> #5 . Get inspired by getting offline- - I totally agree that blogging is great fun and can be rewarding at the same time , but its not all about getting inspired through doing online activities , you also need to get out more ! <p> Get out more what ? You mean go outside ? <p> Yes ! Shut down your computer completely , and go off for a walk , spend time with friends , family , socialise in the real world , read a real book , cook a meal ( and eat it ) , just do something inspiring that does n't  involve being online or using a wireless device . <p> If its not possible to go outside , maybe because the weathers on the grim side , find things to do in your home like- washing some of the dishes , cleaning , sorting out your filing system <p> Doing these things can help motivate you , it gets you thinking lots about what you want to do or want to write about next. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing , just give it a try . <p> For me- its either painting , reading or watching a movie . <p> #6 . Fuel your mind and body ( eat healthily ) You 're probably thinking what on earth has your diet got to do with avoiding bloggers burnout right ? A lot is the answer ! <p> If you do n't  fuel your mind and body with the right nutrients , how are you suppose to concentrate , stay focused , energetic , productive and creative ? And I do n't  mean grab your laptop and head down to McDonalds for lunch either <p> Go outside and get some fresh air ( by this I do n't  mean have a cigarette break ! ) , just get away from your computer , grab a cup of green tea or what ever you love drinking ( lay off the caffeine if possible ) . After a short break carry on with your blogging . <p> As a general rule I like to take a 15 minute break every 2 hours I spend in front of my computer . <p> Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Blogging can actually be- BAD for your health if you do n't  regulate it properly . <p> I mentioned- in tip number 5 ; - inspire yourself by doing offline activities , in addition to socialising , you should also ensure that you 're taking regular exercise . <p> You do n't  have to go to the gym to exercise and keep fit , check out YouTube for videos on tips on how to stay fit and exercise from your home or office . <p> #9 . Bring in some guest writers Sometimes when no matter how hard you try , you simply cant muster the motivation to write , or cant think of anything really worth putting words together for , its time to call in some guest writers . <p> Guest posts , no sorry , let me rephrase that , - super high quality guest posts from industry experts and trusted bloggers can help to ensure that your blog stays updated , whilst you get yourself organised for writing again . <p> #10 . Sleep more- OK so my last top tip for helping you avoid- bloggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you raising your eyes up to this tip So you think writing your next post with your brain half in gear , where you 're almost dozing off at your keyboard is good practice do you ? <p> Far from it , I do n't  recommend anyone sacrifice sleep for blogging . If its advice you 've been given then its bullsh*t advice if you ask me . <p> Missing out on rest and quality sleep is bad business for your health , what 's more , blogging when you 're mentally drained- is only going to reflect in your work . <p> Know your limits , get sleep , eat well , take regular exercise and keep inspired and organised ! Get yourself in a routine and you 'll never suffer from bloggers burnout period . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 
@@76508744 @5208744/ <h> What is AMP ? <p> To make it very simple for anyone to understand AMP , it was designed to make web pages load almost instantly when searched for and viewed on mobile devices . <p> What visitors will actually see is a completely deconstructed version of a web page , without styling or much in the way of design , to allow for fast loading of course , where just the content and featured image is visible . <p> If you run a news blog , or if you have a blog full stop , its imperative that you have AMP set up correctly , especially if you want to play by Googles rules in the future , and ensure your content has priority in mobile search . <p> Now from what Ive read elsewhere online through various forums , and from what I already know , AMP is n't enabled in every country as of yet . Whether that 's true or not , I cant tell you . Personally I have n't noticed anything here in the UK using mobile search Yet . <p> In any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no doubt in my mind that Google will be making this the case in the coming months , when they roll out their latest- updates . <p> OK so enough chatter from me , here 's how to ensure AMP is correctly setup on your WordPress blog , the easiest way possible , step-by-step . <p> Quick note : - I just want to quickly mention that for this to work , I will assume you have the WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin already installed . If you do n't  , the Glue for Yoast plugin obviously wont work , but I 'm sure you already knew that . Just a quick heads up that 's all . <h> Step Two : Configure <p> Head over to Yoast &gt; AMP and first select what post types youd like to apply AMP to . <p> By default you 'll notice that " posts " is automatically enabled . This is all you need for your blog , unless you 'd like other post types enabled , such as your pages . <p> Once you 're done , hit save changes . <h> Step Three : Customise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMP pages will appear on mobile devices . <p> Here you can upload an icon that 's 32 x 32 px in size . You 're able to add a default image of 696 px wide for posts that do n't  have a featured image . You 're also able to change the header color , content text colours , link colours , apply custom CSS and more . <p> Play around with the customiser until you find a perfect match to your blogs identity . To find the hex colour codes of your website , use something like Photoscape. - Or if you 're on a Mac computer , the Colour Picker app is very useful . <p> Now go and visit one of your blog posts , then add /amp/ at the end of the URL string to see what your post will look like . <p> For example , if you were to add /amp/ at the end of the URL for this particular post , you would see something that looks like this . This is what your visitors will see when they click on an AMP supported page on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  need to add Analytics tracking code if you already use the Google Analytics plugin , tracking will automatically take place apparently . <p> OK so let 's go through a quick recap : <p> Ensure you have Yoast SEO insalled . <p> Install and activate AMP plugin by Automattic . <p> Install and activate Glue for Yoast plugin . <p> Configure types of posts youd like to apply Amp to on your site . <p> Add some style to your Amp pages using the built in design tool in- Glue for Yoast plugin . <p> If you want to stay on the safe side of Googles rules , do this immediately before the updates occur . Theres been plenty of warnings from Google , and from people talking about this on Webmaster forums , that this is coming . So be prepared , get your site Amped up . <h> Checking results in Webmaster Tools <p> Do n't  forget to log into your Google webmaster console in few days time , to check your Accelerated Mobile Pages index and errors reports . If you get any errors perhaps you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see from the image below , when I set up AMP for this site , I had a few errors which I had to take care of . Some errors are a lot more complex than others though . <p> Well I hope this short tutorial has helped you out in some way. - If you have any questions please do n't  hesitate to ask me in the comment section below , or send me an email- even . <p> Best of luck Fabrizio Van Marciano <p> Post Views : 655 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> I 'm glad you wrote this post and I want to be sure and personally thank you . <p> As you know from my recent conversation , I want to stay on top of the changes that Google continues to make and whether or not I use my mobile device to search for content , I know that SO many people do . I do n't  think my nieces or nephews have ever gotten on a computer to search for anything , their phones are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part its just their cells . So I have to step up my game and do what I know is best for me moving forward and that 's making sure that my content will be found on their mobile device and of course load quickly . <p> Thank you for explaining what this is and how to set it up on our blogs . I was on a webinar last night and they were claiming to have the only plugin available for this which I had a feeling just was n't true . Thank you for proving me right . <p> Hi Adrienne , you 're most welcome , always happy to be as helpful as I can be . <p> I 'm in total agreement with you Adrienne , I much prefer to play by Googles rules , even though I do n't  necessarily cater for them when it comes to my blog writing at times , but search traffic is important for business , no one can deny that . <p> I hope many more folks get themselves and their blogs prepared in time . All the best Adrienne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fun filled one with the family . <p> I am trying to install this to my blog now but I do have some questions in mind . 1 ) Will adding so many plugins increase load time on my main blog ? 2 ) Will ads be there in the amp pages ? thank you = <p> Hi Swadhin , no worries at all my friend , happy to help . OK so the AMP plugin itself is extremely light weight , almost non existent , it has no settings at all on its own , just a simple plug and play plugin . <p> The Glue plugin by yoast simply adds a light weight extension to the Yoast SEO plugin which also extends the AMP plugin , i.e. adds customisations option . There should be very minimal difference if any in page loading . <p> To answer your question two , no there wont be any ads shown in amp pages , unless they 're placed inside the content pages I suppose . If you 're promoting a product or service and add banner ads inside the content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidebar , header etc wont be shown . <p> All visitors get is a stripped down , bare bone version of your web page . The Glue by Yoast plugin makes the exception of allowing you to add some styling = <p> In an era of mobile obsession you better speed up your site for phone and tablet consumption . <p> My developer did the https thingee a month ago . Night day difference on speed for mobile and laptop users , as increased security seemed to keep spammy gremlins out . May have also did something else ; I 've no clue in hell LOL . <p> I 've heard bits and pieces about AMP but not looked into it properly . Now , I do n't  need to with this easy-to-follow tutorial thanks ! <p> You 're right , I 'm sure Google will start rolling it out worldwide over time so we may as well get rolling with it ourselves now . If the guys at Automattic have developed the AMP plugin then there must be some credibility in the idea . <p> Hey Robin , yeah the 32 x 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your site on mobile search . The design tool in Glue for Yoast plugin is a great little feature , even if very basic and light weight . <p> I 'm not sure every business would benefit by implementing Google AMP , at least for how things are right now . Google AMP pages , for instance , do n't  allow forms on pages , plus they have some design restrictions that might be a deal breaker for some businesses . You can find more in this blog post I recently wrote : The mobile content consumption revolution is here : Google AMP and WordPress . <p> My point being : if you publish new content regularly and have several ways to collect email addresses from your visitors , then go all-in with AMP . If you do n't  fall into this category , like if you run an e-commerce with no blog for example , Google AMP pages are n't  something worth trying ( at least for now ) . <p> Hi Matteo , thank you for your input , very good point made , and thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my blog where I have various forms and items for sale through an ecommerce setup . But you 're right , I cant imagine that every online business will benefit from setting up AMP on their sites , but for bloggers and and news website owners for sure . <p> We may even see a reverse effect actually , where online businesses and ecommerce websites have n't considered setting up a blog before , actually making the move to place a blog on their sites . I mean blogging is essential to many businesses right ? Mobile search is also important , so I guess some businesses will feel they have no choice but to go with the flow . Who knows huh ?

For instance , you might get referral traffic from- reputable websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities and networks , forums , print marketing , PDF publications and so on . <p> Note : I do n't  expect you to implement every single strategy in this list , and chances are , you 're probably already using some of these tactics . <h> 10 Smart Ways To Increase Referral Traffic To Your Blog <h> #01 . Do guest blogging <p> Out of all the blog promotion strategies that exist , guest blogging has to be- the best way to increase exposure for your blog . <p> Guest blogging is a great way to connect with influencers , build new relationships , and find new readers and subscribers for your blog . <p> Just a quick note , however , if you 're thinking about using guest blogging just for SEO gains , i.e. building backlinks etc , whilst this tactic might still work to some degree , these days its pretty much useless . <p> In most cases , a lot of blogs and websites no-follow their outbound links just to be safe . <p> What guest blogging should be used for is relationship building and increasing exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost your blog traffic . <p> Matt Cutts , by the- way , was head of Googles webspam team back in the day . <h> #02 . Send email newsletters <p> Your email newsletters can be a great source of referral traffic to your blog . I think every blog should send out an email newsletter at least once a week . <p> Also , all your other outgoing emails should be considered as ways to drive blog traffic . You should consider using something like the WiseStamp App to add a custom signature with a link to your blog from your outgoing emails . here 's an example of mine below . <h> #04. - Curate content <p> Content curation- can be very beneficial for driving referral traffic , although I will say , it can be a little time-consuming . <p> Curating content involves collecting together interesting pieces of content from around the web , relevant to your niche , and combining it with original content of your own , and then sharing it with your followers . <p> Use tools and sites like Scoop.it and Storify to curate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog community sites <p> There are some great- blog community- sites around and new ones are cropping up all of the time , however , just be careful not to put too much of your energy in using them . <p> The trick is to find the ones most relevant to you , and the most popular ones . <p> Personally , I 've had some reasonably good success with sites like BizSugar and Inbound.org if your blog about marketing . <p> These sites are great for not just promoting your own blog content , but for also engaging with other bloggers , providing value and helping others , thus driving new readers back to your blog. <h> #06 .

You need to have a strategy in place for regularly promoting your blog content creatively on social media to boost engagement and referral traffic . <p> Having a Facebook page or Twitter account is all well and good , but its simply not enough anymore . In addition , most social media platforms are now Pay-to-Play . <p> Here are some things you can do to increase engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the social platforms that are working for you , and crush them ! If Facebook is n't working , do n't  waste your time with it . If Instagram is working , that 's where you need to be . <p> Engage on a whole new level , that means- to reply to comments , be helpful , add value and all the rest of it . <p> The mistakes a lot of bloggers make when they do blog commenting is that they leave crappy comments for starters . And secondly , they try and comment on way too many blogs . <p> The best way to do blog commenting is to pick just a small handful , around a dozen credible blogs , get to know the author , show your face and read the blogs content regularly , then leave meaningful comments . <p> When I say meaningful comments I do n't  just mean one-liners either . here 's an example of a meaningful comment I left on a good friend of mines blog , Sherman Smiths blog . <p> As you will see , its a good few paragraphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories- and try to add some value to the conversation too . <p> I think that 's the best way to get on other bloggers radars and get the most benefits from blog commenting . <h> That 's it peeps ! <p> Like I said at the very beginning , you do n't  have to go nuts and use- every single technique Ive mentioned above , but add one or two to your traffic building efforts and I 'm positive you 'll come out on top . <p> here 's a quick summary of the things you can do to increase referral traffic to your blog . <p> Do guest blogging . <p> Link to your latest posts from your email newsletters . <p> Make better use of Pinterest . <p> Start curating content , both on your blog and using content curation sites . <p> Join and collaborate on blog network sites . <p> Create videos to post on YouTube and Facebook . <p> Grow your social media audience- and promote content there regularly , and smartly . <p> Repurpose your blog content into infographics . <p> Provide value on other blog posts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow your own tribe . <p> So what other ways can you increase referral traffic to your blog ? <p> Best of luck ! <p> Post Views : 1,185 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 <p> Absolutely Ryan , I enjoy commenting when I 'm at a lose end , usually when I 'm out and about I 'll read a post on a blog and comment . <p> I love curating too . Sometimes if I 'm putting a list of articles from around the web on a particular topic , it gives me a good reason to reach out to a few blogs and say , " hey I 've mentioned your amazing blog post in my list of top articles post , please check it out and feel free to share it , keep up the great work . " <p> After series of jerks with Panda , Penguin , Hummingbird it is so risky to trust organic traffic because it can nosedive at anytime . So it is high time to boost direct and referral traffic . For the latter one your tips are awesome and will surely bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you on that theory Muba , Penguin killed my last blog after years of working so hard on it . The mistake I made was to rely on organic search . I know not to make the same mistake , glad you enjoyed the tips my friend = <p> I have to agree with Mi , we can not wait on or trust search engine organic traffic . You 're suggestions are spot on . <p> Personally , I 've been connecting with some amazing people on directories . In particular , I 've been using <p> Kingged.com DoSplash Inbound.org BizSugar <p> I have tried Triberr in the past , but not consistently and I need to jump back on it . <p> Another thing working extremely well for me is commenting on blog articles of influential bloggers . The key is to not leave some fluff piece or one or two sentences . I am seeing an uptick in traffic and as I 've been sharing with the bloggers , I 've also been sharing it out on social media . <p> You 're one suggestion was really great and worked awesome for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog . Its a list of great blogs from the week that had an impact or influence on me . I even included yours last Saturday . <p> Thanks again for the great article . I 'm happy to be a regular now so you can get used to seeing my long comments , lol <p> Did not know how influential Pinterest has become , I 'll have to get more active on my account . <p> Also had never thought about the content curation concept combining your blogs with others and sharing them together , I 'll have to try that . And thanks for the resources on where to post it . <p> Great links to the blog communities , and can relate the idea you posted to the social media to this one as well . The importance of engagement on these sites can not be overlooked . <p> Personally find social media , and commenting on blogs having the best impact for me . In particular google + recently , being active in communities , and developing circles with influences and active users . Regularly sharing each others content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep track of engaging followers and great content providers . And pinning your most recent post on your twitter profile is a great way to drive extra traffic . 
@@76508747 @5208747/ <p> If you 're planning on spending anything less than $1,000 for a custom website , then expect to get what you pay for , its as simple as that . <p> If you end up with a website that looks like this Well that 's exactly what you paid for right ? <p> This is 2016 for goodness sake , paying for a website that has nothing more but a bunch of fancy texts and headlines , badly unaligned design elements that look amateurish . Or- poor quality graphics and images that look like they were picked from a clipart library , is not going to do much for your brand . <p> Your design should not just be modern and clean , but more importantly it should connect and communicate with your audience . It should stand out yet offer impeccable user experience . <h> #2 . Their website looks like crap for starters <p> That should be the first telltale sign that you 're about to hire the worst web designer possible . <p> Just take a look at their own site from top to toe . Analyse- every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Look at the header and menu section . Scroll down to the content layout and check the alignment of elements . Check- the footer section even . If any part of their site- looks shabby and distinctively mediocre , then ask yourself this : <h> #3 . Their sales page looks like it was put together by a five year old <p> No offence intended to any smart five year olds out there , but if you 've landed on an amateurish looking sales page offering web design services , just think twice before committing . <p> A sales page should welcome you as an individual person with an individual problem . It should demand your attention . <p> It should communicate with you , and understand right off the bat what it is you 're looking for in a bespoke website design . <p> It should reinforce your trust with credible testimonials , and give clear reasons and proof as to why your service works . <p> All of this should be presented in a nicely designed page , accompanied by some great visual content that leaves you saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the sales page you 've landed on is just filled with bloated chunks of texts that 's filled with egocentric bullsh*t , then avoid at all costs . <h> #4 . Their communication with you is shameless <p> Communication is absolute critical when it comes to- working with a web designer , especially when you need them to clearly understand your goals , visions and strategies with your new website project . <p> If you find a designer that sends you an email once a fortnight , then you 're one unlucky individual is all I can say . <p> Solution ? Ditch immediately and find another one as fast as you can ! <h> #5 . They ask no questions <p> A good web designer will always arrange a consultation over the phone or Skype when you first make contact with them . And theyll have a lot of questions to ask you as well . <p> If not , theyll almost always have a link to a new client questionnaire from their web design information page , a little bit like this one . <p> If you feel as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or learning more about your goals , visions and ideas , then you know the drill <p> Drop them fast and run like your life depends on it <h> #6 . They wo n't create copy for you <p> Now respectfully not all web designers will offer copywriting . However if you 're asking them to build you a website in an industry they might be familiar in , they may well include copywriting in their design service . <p> And again , from a clients point of view , not every client will want their designer to create copy for their site . Often if its niche specific , theyll want to create copy themselves , or hire someone who knows the industry well enough to write compelling copy for them . <h> #7 . They wo n't produce a wireframe for you <p> What ? No wire framing ? That 's ludicrous ! <p> Wire framing is the- first critical step in designing and building a great website. - All it requires is the designer- to come up with a few mockups and layouts of how the site will be organised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designer to work from . <p> If your designer is just jumping straight into the design stage without creating a wire frame for you , kindly email him or her , and ask them- what the heck is going on ? <h> #8 . They lack diversification <p> If your designer has a portfolio , which they should have , look and- make sure that they have a diversified- flare for creativity . <p> Ensure that each and every website theyve ever created does n't  look almost identical , asides- some customised graphics and icons and of course content . <p> A great web designer will be competent in using a wide range of design tools from graphic design softwares , code editors , programming softwares , sketching and drawing tools , testing engines , project management tools and a whole lot more . <p> Your designer has- to understand exactly what you 're looking for with your new website project , so he or she should be very familiar with your goals and objectives . If they 're not then there 's a problem . <p> It all boils- down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication , and your designer asking relevant questions about your project right off the bat . <h> #10 . They offer every other services you can possibly imagine <p> Lastly but not least is this Im sure you 've heard the saying " Jack of all trades " and " master of none " . <p> Well that may not be the case always , because there are some genuine folks out there that are great at providing services in many areas . <p> But if you find that your web designer is offering literally everything you can imagine- under the sun on their services menu , then sometimes it can feel as if there 's no exclusivity with them . I mean there 's no speciality involved . <p> In my opinion , and this is just my opinion . Bespoke web design is a speciality , it shouldnt part of a package or deal or what ever bull$h*t that might be going on . It should be a unique service provided at the highest level possible . <p> Its a bit like hiring out a freelancer who specialises in writing health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law website ! <p> Its possible to do that of course , its possible to hire a jack of all trades , but it just does n't  make sense in my opinion . <p> Maybe you think differently , do let me know . <p> If you 're looking for someone who specialises in creating great looking and conversion focused websites . And if you 're looking for someone that will meet your goals and objectives with your website design projects , then avoid the jack of all trades where ever possible , and find yourself a specialist . <h> Final words of wisdom to YOU <p> Finding the right web designer for your web projects is something that you should take your time in doing . <p> If you find web design service that is dirt cheap , and one that is part of an online package deal of some kind , just be aware that you 'll get exactly what you pay for . <p> Do your research carefully and take your time with it . There are some great sites you can visit to start doing research or even find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An UpWork company ) , PeoplePerHour or my personal favourite- Freelancer.com . <p> Best of luck to you ! <p> People ignore design that ignores people If you want to make sure that does n't  happen with your next web design project , click here . <p> Post Views : 368 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417

@@76508751 @5208751/ <h> The Complete Beginners Guide To Starting A Blog With WordPress <p> Many congratulations for wanting to start a blog . If you are as committed as I think you are , you 'll look back upon this day someday , and think to yourself you made one of the best decisions of your life . <p> In this post I will take you through the process of creating a WordPress blog or website from start to finish . <p> Do n't worry , I will cover all the essentials . I 'll tell you what pitfalls to avoid and everything else you need to know to make this the best start ever . <p> I 'll also try and make this tutorial as simple as possible to follow , however if you get stuck , I 'm here to help you , so do n't hesitate to reach out and connect with me . <h> How difficult is it to start a blog with WordPress ? <p> Setting up a WordPress blog is really not that difficult to do at all , I know you probably think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in my time . <p> But you 'll see for yourself as you read through this guide . Once you 've set up your first blog , you 'll be able to do it again a second time without any guidance . <p> If you 're completely new to the world of blogging and using WordPress , this guide is for you . I created it just for you . <p> Even if you 've had experience before but need a refresher , you can still use this guide to get started . <p> Important note:Just to make you fully aware , this tutorial will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to start a hosted blog , using a web host provider and the WordPress open source software . ( WordPress.org ) <p> This guide will not cover starting a free blog with a free blogging platform such as WordPress.com or Blogger.com . <p> OK so here 's what we 're going to cover . <p> Why start a blog and what it takes to build a successful blog ( Yes this part matters ) . <p> Choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web host provider . <p> Installing WordPress into your hosting account . ( In this tutorial I 'll be recommending and using SiteGround as the web host provider ) . <p> Recommended plugins and settings , how to install a plugin . <p> Free themes vs paid themes , how to install a theme . <h> Why Start a Blog and what it takes to succeed <p> If you do n't want or feel the need to read this part , just skip straight to the 5-step setup guide . However if you 're new to the world of blogging , I urge you to read this part before you do anything else . <p> I 'm sure you already know why you want to start blogging , but let 's try and clarify things a little bit better , because it 's so critical from the very first step , that you know why you really want to start blogging , <p> Embrace success by all means , but be very prepared to fail , especially if you 're completely new to this . <p> Fortunately though , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of failing should be pretty slim . ( No pressure on me then to ensure that I deliver nothing but awesome content huh ? ) . <p> I 've made the mistakes , I 've written about them on my blog , so that hopefully you can avoid them yourself . <h> The long road to success ... <p> Creating a blog is the very first step I know . But it 's also the easiest step . <p> The road to blogging success will be a long one , and if you 're determined and driven enough to want to succeed as I think you are , then you will succeed . <p> What ever your goal might be for starting a blog and doing blogging , just remember that it 's going to take a lot of hard work upfront first , and time as well , before you can reach your ultimate goal . <p> I 've been blogging for over 6 years now , and I 'm still trying to reach my ultimate goal , but that 's cool , because I 'm in no rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Right , let 's get started with getting your WordPress blog up and running . <h> Five Steps To Setting Up A WordPress Blog <h> Step #1 - Choosing a Domain Name <p> So the first step of successfully setting up a WordPress blog is choosing a domain name . <p> Remember this tutorial post assumes that you 're completely new to all of this , so let 's first look at what a domain name actually is . <p> A domain name is simply the address to where you blog will live . For instance the domain name for this blog Magnet 4 Blogging is www.magnet4blogging.net . <p> When somebody wants to access your blog , they 'll simply go to the ' www.yourdomainname.com ' . Or they will click on a link to your domain name perhaps from another website , or from the search engine search result pages . Or from a social media link . <p> So how do you choose the right domain name for your blog ? <p> There is no definitive answer to that question in my opinion , choosing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your pet goldfish , it can literally be ' what ever you want it to be ' . <p> That being said , here are some tips and a few guidelines to help you find the perfect domain name for your blog . <p> Choose a domain name that is the same name as your website . Here 's an example of this : <p> If you want your blog to be called Gina 's Singing Tips , then you would choose the domain name ginasingingtips.com . <p> This might sound like pretty logical and obvious advice , but you 'd be surprised at how many people make the silly mistake of naming their blog something completely different , to what their domain name actually is . <p> Choosing a domain name that is the same name as your blog allows you to build your brand and identity around that domain name , and it also makes it way easier for your users to find you online . <p> Choose something ' unique and memorable ' . By this I mean choose a domain name that will stick out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crowd . At the same time choose one that is easy for your users to remember . For example something like ' zigsurfblog ' or ' montysbmxblog ' . <p> Avoid hyphens in your domain name . This tends to make your domain name look cluttered and cheap in my opinion . Also folks online are so used to typing domain names without the use of hyphens , so beware of that , you rarely see a hyphen in a domain name . <p> Use a top level domain extension . So a top level domain extension would be a . net or definitely . com if possible . Unless you are starting a localised or non profit blog of course , then something like . org might be ok . <p> Where to purchase your domain name ? <p> You can purchase a domain name from any reputable online provider such as Godaddy.com or 123-reg.co.uk , however since you 're setting up a WordPress blog for the first time , the simplest way to purchase a domain name is with your web host provider . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . If you 're signing up for a new account with them , you automatically get a FREE domain name registration for 1 year , worth $19 . <h> Step #2 - Choosing The Right Web Host Provider <p> OK so by now you should have an idea what you 'd like to have as your domain name , it 's time to see if it 's available and purchase it with some reliable and affordable web hosting . <h> What is Web Hosting and Why Do I Need It ? <p> Again just to remind you that this post assumes that you 're totally new to blogging and the world of web hosting . <p> Here 's the best way to understand what web hosting is : <p> Imagine a house is built on a piece of land . The same for a website that 's built on a piece of web space . <p> Here 's a clearer breakdown of this : <p> Web hosting space = plot of land , your space on the web.Web host service provider = real estate agency , a company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot of land , your WordPress blog for example.Blog theme or skin = Interior and exterior decor , a unique custom blog design . ( More on this later on ) <p> There are many different levels of services available when it comes to web hosting . Usually when you 're starting out for the first time , you begin with a shared hostingn++ plan . <p> As your blog grows with popularity and in size , you can consider upgrading to perhaps a VPS ( Virtual Private Server ) , or a dedicated server . You do n't need to worry about this just yet though . <p> So now you have some idea as to what web hosting is , the different tiers of service available and why you need it , let 's look at what to look for when purchasing web hosting online . <p> There are essentially three things you need to keep in mind when purchasing web hosting : affordability , reliability and customer service . <p> There 's a lot of choices when it comes to choosing the right web host , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them - HostGator , DreamHost , HostMonster , and I 've been a BlueHost customer since 2010 before moving to SiteGround , which is the web host provider I use and recommend today . <p> Shared web hosting generally starts from around a few dollars each month , though I would advise that you do n't just shoot for the cheapest solution and be done with it . <p> Remember reliability and customer service is important , regardless of who you choose to host your WordPress site with . <p> I consider paying between $6 to $9 each month to be reasonably affordable when starting out , and if you 're planning on monetizing your blog later on , you 'll soon be making back what you spend on web hosting each month . <p> Once again , I choose SiteGround for most of my web hosting requirements as they offer not only affordability and extremereliability , but also great uptime , customer service , and technical support . <p> Disclaimer:Should you choose to purchase hosting from SiteGround using my affiliate link above , I will earn a small commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost to you . If you do choose to use my affiliate link , I 'd like to thank you in advance for your support . I appreciate you . <p> The " one-click " feature just means that you can install WordPress into your domain name via your hosting company , with just a single click of the mouse . <p> Back in the day you 'd have to install WordPress via FTP , you can still do that today but it is far too technical to do as a newbie . Instead you 're going to install WordPress with a single click of the mouse . <p> Let me show you how to install WordPress on a new domain name in SiteGround : <p> Step Two : Scroll down and click on the WordPress icon under ' Auto-installers ' . See image below . <p> Step Three : Click Install and then enter the details for the installation . You should always select the http : //www. protocol where possible , and then select the domain name in which you would like to install WordPress . <p> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name , site description and admin username and password . <p> Keep these in a safe place by the way . You 'll need them to log into your site after the installation is complete . <p> Choose an admin email address and language , then select the security plugins you 'd like to have installed with your set up . <p> When the installation is complete , you should be able to log into your new WordPress site by going to http : **35;374;TOOLONG <h> Step #4 - Recommended Plugins and Settings <p> OK so at this stage you 've pretty much completed all the steps for setting up your WordPress blog , and you 're almost ready to start blogging and writing your first post . So next , let 's do a little configuration . <p> Let 's start with installing a few essential plugins . <h> What are plugins ? <p> Plugins are part of what makes WordPress so flexible and functional , you can pretty much create a WordPress website and make it do what ever you want it to do , simply by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . WordPress SEO by Yoast - This is by far the most powerful and free SEO plugin available for WordPress , with over 5 million downloads to date . I 'm currently using this plugin on Magnet4Blogging . <p> If you 're looking for something a little more advanced , I 'd recommend trying SEOPressor Connect , however this is a third party premium service that will set you back $9 per month subscription based . <p> 2 . WP Super Cache - This plugin will generate a static HTML files from your WordPress blog . After a HTML file has been generated , your web server will actually serve that file instead of processing the heavier WordPress PHP scripts . This simply means your site will load faster , and less demand will be placed on your server . Your users will see cached versions of your pages . <p> 3 . Akismet - Akismet is automatically installed when you set up a WordPress blog for the first time . It is the industry 's recommended anti web-spam plugin for WordPress , however to take full advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to signup for an API key which will cost you around $5 per month . Doing so means that you wo n't have to worry too much about comment spam . <h> How to Install a WordPress Plugin <p> Once again this tutorial assumes that you 're totally new to WordPress and using plugins . The process of installing a plugin is the most simplest thing you can do with your WordPress blog . <p> Once you 've logged into the back end of your WordPress blog ( dashboard ) , simply scroll down and in the right sidebar you 'll see plugins . <p> Hover your mouse over the plugins link and it will open up a drop-down menu with more options , simply select add new . See image below . <p> Once you 're on the plugins page you can then search for a plugin you want to install , or upload one that you 've downloaded from the WordPress repository . See image below . <h> Step #5 - Installing a Premium WordPress Theme <p> OK so the last part of setting up your WordPress blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a theme ? <p> A theme , also known as a skin , is what makes a blog built on WordPress truly unique . WordPress on it 's own is just a platform with no style , a theme is what will give your WordPress site a unique look and layout . <p> By default WordPress uses their own Twenty Twelve theme , along with a host of other available themes in the theme file . Most ' serious ' bloggers that I know will often go for a custom designed theme or invest in a premium quality theme such as Genesis or Thrive . <p> The other option you have is to hire a web designer to help you create the look and layout you want for your WordPress blog , however this can be costly and if you 're just starting out , you 're probably better off going for a premium WordPress theme to begin with . <h> Installing Genesis Theme <p> If you so happen to choose Genesis , here 's a quick video on how to install the theme into your new WordPress blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the process of installing this software has n't changed a bit . <p> OK peeps so that 's it , you 're all set up ready to start blogging like a pro ! <p> I will be updating this post as and when required , so be sure to bookmark this page for the future . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417

If you want to learn when the best time is to publish your blog posts , you 'll find a link to a useful article below this post . <p> I think writing content for your blog is a very personal thing to do . <p> You set the time aside to write . <p> You turn off notifications on all your devices . <p> You switch your phone over to answer-phone . <p> You even draw the curtains and lock the doors so that you hopefully wont be disturbed when you are in full writing mode . <p> Great stuff ! <p> But seriously , though , - When is it actually a good time to write your blog posts ? <p> There is no definitive answer to that question I 'm afraid , however , let me share with you some of my personal blog writing experiences which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to write blog posts . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> It is ideal if you are not being distracted but not everyone is lucky like you that you have plenty of time to write in private . I work full time and can only write in the evenings , hey ho , with family time : ) ) <p> But I fully agree with your second point that at evenings and night time , when you are tired and drained , it is difficult to be creative and more productive . Mornings and afternoons are better . <p> Point 3 I agree hundred percent , a big factor . <p> Point 4 I respectfully disagree , I have a frequency of once a week publishing . Now it does n't  matter if I am motivated or not , I always try to hit the target and be disciplined . So it is a tricky one but I appreciate your point that it is best and most ideal if you are fully pumped up and inspired . <p> Final point couldnt agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create something which is useful for others . <p> Hey Ahmad , first of all thank so much for your detailed comment , I really appreciate your honesty . Welcome to my blog too . <p> As for point 4 , yes I definitely appreciate where you 're coming from with this . Certainly each to their own . It must be wonderful to be able to write content on demand and meet schedules and deadlines as you can , and still feel totally inspired and motivated . I 've tried that myself and it has n't  really worked for me . <p> I used to set myself deadlines for writing a piece of content , but have n't always felt like writing . Thanks for sharing your views on this though , I really appreciate it man . <p> All the best Ahmad , I hope to see you here again soon buddy . Have a great rest of the week . <p> When I was in college , I used to write when I come home and I was usually very much tired at that time and I used to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a graduate , I research at night and I start writing when I just wake up when Im fresh . So , this makes me complete the 1500-2000 words post in an hour or two last . Otherwise I used to take 5-6 hours for a single post . <p> Great article ! I definitely would agree that the time at which your write your posts can impact the quality of your writing .

@@76508754 @5208754/ <p> This post is going to be a little bit different from the normal stuff that I put out on the blog . <p> I 'm not going to be sharing with you my life story as such , but more appropriately , - how I got into blogging and what blogging means to me from a business stand point , and more critically how blogging helped to change my life . <p> I hope my short story will help inspire you and many others to want to do something great . <p> In 2007 I set about building my first online business in eCommerce as a struggling artist ( painter ) . <p> Homeless because at around the time I started to get online , I was also living under the stairs of my mothers house , with a single rolled-up battered mattress and a black bin-bag which- carried most of my clothes and personal belongings . <p> And for the record , my mother did n't  really want her 29-year old son living under the stairs in her house , it was quite embarrassing for her when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have felt for me . <p> Sometimes though I would sleep in my car . It was n't a bad thing during the summer in all honesty , because when I was n't working in the office , or working on building my online business , I was travelling up and down the coastline surfing. - Being out in the ocean was my sanctuary , I still love to get myself lost out there now and again .. <p> But the fact of the matter couldnt be ignored . At the age of 29 I was going nowhere . I had zero motivation left in me . I was stuck in a dead-end job . I was broke and my relationship with my girlfriend had ended bitterly after three years . <p> Do you know something else ? - I would sometimes cry myself to sleep where ever that may be , under my mothers stairs or in the back of my clapped out car . <p> All I kept thinking was that this was all going to end badly for me at some point , and more so with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon and officially made completely homeless . <p> I came too close to accepting failure . <p> That was up until two- life-changing things happened to me in 2008 . <p> I found my soulmate , the women that would put a rocket in my backside- to do something with my life <p> I became motivated and inspired to seriously take- my business online and to the next level , and discovered the world of blogging for the first time . <h> How online business changed my life <p> I loved being an- artist ( painter ) , and being so fortunate to live so close the some of the best surfing beaches and coastline in the whole of the UK and indeed Europe , inspiration was always plentiful . <p> I met my girlfriend Samantha in late 2008 and by mid 2009 we had moved in together . She shared my passion for art , the surfing lifestyle and being a business woman herself , she helped me to make a real go of things . She became my rock . <p> My website got a lot more traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing exhibitions together , and I was also leveraging other eCommerce platforms like eBay and Etsy to sell more artwork online . <p> Business was going great- and I really felt a great sense of achievement . <p> Again , I felt as if none of this would have been possible had I not met Samantha , I know the headline title of this post doesnt- reflect that at all . We all need some encouragement sometimes right ? <p> This time I was n't feeling defeated . I felt- motivated enough to want to find another solution . I had taken my art business to new heights of success and wanted to continue painting , but I also wanted a new challenge . <p> That challenge came in late 2009 when I discovered blogging for the first time . ( Thank you John Chow and Darren Rowse ) . <h> How blogging changed my life <p> After playing around on web 2.0 blogging sites like Squid00 , HubPages and InfoBarrel , I finally started my first WordPress blog in the summer of 2010 . Magnet4Marketing was born . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was using a lot of tools for the first time , including WordPress , plugins , themes , hosting , SEO and a bunch of other online services . <p> All the tools Ive used since I started online is mentioned here by the way . <p> During those early years I found- a lot of great support around the blogosphere . I got opportunities to write for some great blogs , including BasicBlogTips.com and ComLuv.com . <p> Sure I wanted a new challenge and wanted to make money I 'll be honest , but I think I was covering way too many broad topics as well . <p> I was writing about marketing , blogging , eCommerce , WordPress , money , lifestyle , technology and all the rest of it . <p> I wanted to become more focused on something specific , and something that I truly enjoyed doing and cared about . <p> Then came the blessing in disguise I was looking for . Two furry little algorithmic animals- called Google Panda- and Google Penguin . <p> By the time 2013 came around , Google Penguin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trying to frantically fix things , spending a ton of money with it , it was clear that recovery was never going to happen . <p> But of course and I 'll say this again , none of what Ive achieved since 2008 would have been possible without meeting Samantha , my soul partner- for the last 8 years , and in 12 weeks time we finally get married . <h> Its time to take charge of your life , make something happen ! <p> I was so fortunate to meet someone like Samantha who inspired and pushed me forward to make something of my life . But putting aside meeting someone special that can motivate you , no one can change your life for you , only YOU can do that. - You can get a helping hand of course , but its up to you to make the move . <p> We can all sit and complain about how much we hate our jobs , or how we wish we had more time and money to do the things we want in life . <p> Complaining is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  have a choice is easy too . <p> This internet thing has opened up so many new opportunities for everyone who has access to it , we are so , so , so blessed to be living in this era . Right now matters . You matter and YOU have something valuable to share , even if you do n't  know it yet , so do n't  waste another day . <p> If you want to make a start and change your life for good , that 's what I 'm here for .

I 'm not a business coach either , and nor do I have the ultimate solution that will help you change your life . <p> What- I can do is help you create the most epic web presence ever , to kick-start your blogging or online business journey . <p> Start with an epic blog or website design . <p> Click here- to connect with me , and let 's arrange to have- a- friendly chat about some of your ideas . <h> Why start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if they have the time to do it . <p> Whether you 're a stay at home dad like myself , or stay at home mum , or someone that 's currently unemployed , or someone who 's just looking for a new challenge .

I will head over to your post and check it out for sure . <p> I 'm so glad that you could related to my story , and I was happy to hear that blogging has transformed your life too . I really believe that it takes just that , for us as humans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the better persons we become in the end . <p> I love reading inspiring stories and never really thought mine was good enough to share until most recently . Thank you for your comment mate , and I 'll head over to read your post now . <p> I agree with James , this is definitely a very inspiring post . This is what I love about bloggers who are open and honest with their audience about who they are , where they came from and their own obstacles they 've had to overcome . Were not perfect , were all just human being trying to find our way and where we belong in this world . <p> This is why I also believe that the connections we make are the biggest take away period . I 'm SO thankful that you met Samantha as of course I know you are since you finally popped the question and you guys are making this official . Congratulations on that by the way . <p> I have my neighbor over this morning helping me with an issue in my bathroom , he s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time as well as his favorite chocolate chip cookies . Anyway , he s moving next month and Ive known him for 21 years . I told him to please stay in touch because he s become like family to me and I 'm going to miss him terribly . Its the people in our lives that mean the most , all our accomplishments are awesome but without that support they really are n't  all that cool . <p> I 'm so glad we met as well , thanks for the mention and I 'm very happy for where you are in your life and what blogging has done for you . I can definitely relate to all you 're saying here . Long live blogging ! <p> Hi Adrienne , thanks so much for your lovely comment . I apologise for the time it takes for me to respond sometimes , but I eventually get to it lol . Being the Easter holidays for the kids , I 'm being all out Superdad at the moment . <p> I 've always thought that every single human on this planet is capable of great things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this world would be a completely different place if we were all given one chance , but I know that 's not possible for various reasons . <p> For those of us that are able , the opportunities await like nothing else . So to all who are reading this , make today count . <p> Thanks for the congrats , yes we 've been engaged for a while and since meeting we 've achieved so much in our personal lives as with business . I 'm sorry to hear your good friend neighbour is leaving , its always sad when you 've known someone for so long and so well that theyve become part of your family , and they have to leave . <p> I hear you , connections and communication are so important in blogging . I appreciate bloggers have to create other types of useful content that will earn them a buck or two , or content that will provide great value in other ways , but its also important for bloggers to stay connected with their audience , and there 's no better way than to use story telling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with online business I think , you can always draw your audience in and share something with them they can relate to and be inspired by , as apposed to just writing boring old generic content that detaches them away from their readers , if any of that makes sense lol . <p> Hey Awazie how are you ? Great to see you here again , and yes I definitely agree with you on that one , I do n't  think I would have met some of the great folks that I have , had I not started blogging and networking . Like Adrienne says , making those all important connections is so vital to blogging and online business success . <p> I 'm so happy to hear blogging has had a positive effect on your life too . You know something Awazie , I keep telling folks both online and offline that blogging and online business is so powerful , and has the ability to change lives . Often I get the impression from some folks that they 're just not interested , by you cant please everyone huh ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if more folks knew how to use it to make their lives better , it would be a wonderful thing . I 'm so thankful for being totally able and having met the awesome people in my life whom have helped me become the person I am today . <p> Thanks again Awazie for your continued support , keep rocking and have a great weekend ahead . <p> I know how that pain feels . And how it feels to glide through these trying circumstances . I dig posts like this because I get to know you , by you sharing what you 've been through . I mean , REALLY know you . Thank you for opening up and sharing because I get to see .. the rest of the story . <p> Example ; if you said how you went through tuff times , I 'd definitely feel ya , but knowing specifics like living under the stairs of your moms home , makes me think of when I moved in with my future mom in law because I was just failing so breaking badly . Sold everything , broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So reading this , I really , REALLY know how you felt bro , and more than that I am overjoyed at the success you have had , with this humble start . <p> Hey Ryan , my apologies for the delay in replying , crazy busy these days but I eventually do get there . <p> Thanks for sharing that with me Ryan I appreciate it and love it even more that we can relate to each others stories . I could n't agree more with you about the humiliation , that feeling almost always comes back to haunt me sometimes when I think of the circumstances I was in , I can imagine how it must of felt for you too . <p> You came far my friend , blogging in paradise , endorsed by so many influencers and industry leaders , I cant imagine a better way to live life . <p> I 'm am so thankful for the path Ive chosen and the people I met in my life . And for Samanthas ruthless and sometimes aggressive push and determination for me to make a change in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@76508759 @5208759/ <p> To this day- AdSense is still the simplest , - and probably the laziest- way to earn a few bucks- from your blog . <p> Yes that 's right just a few bucks , in most cases probably not even that . <p> Let 's face it , unless you 're fortunate enough to have a website or a blog that generates hundreds of thousands of unique visits and page views each- month , you 're probably only going to earn cents from AdSense . <h> Why I loved using Google AdSense <p> As I said , when I got started back in 2010 , I was using AdSense everywhere on my site , and yes I was obsessed with it . <p> Each day I would see the earnings increase ever so slightly . Earning around- $70 per month , just from 4 or 5 clicks per day . It was free and easy money ? <p> But I was blind , and I should have paid more attention to creating other more profitable income streams , rather than just depend- on AdSense . <p> Many bloggers either use AdSense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do both . <p> So if I loved using Google AdSense so much , why do I think its bad business , asides from the fact that its not very profitable ? <p> If you 're trying to build a brand , a business from your blog or your website ( which you should be doing ) , using AdSense is n't such a great idea . <p> Let me explain in more detail . <h> Why adding- AdSense to your- business website is a mistake ! <p> If you have a blog or a- website you use for business , and you 're trying to build a brand to promote your own products or services , using AdSense to monetise will potentially kill any- conversion opportunity you have . <p> OK maybe not every opportunity , but you 're putting a lot at risk . <p> As for a personal blog ? I would n't even consider adding AdSense to one , here 's some things you might want to think about when using AdSense on your business or personal blog . <p> AdSense can help drive- your bounce rate- through the roof . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people leave your site instantly via an AdSense click is a big no . <p> Adding AdSense ads everywhere on your site makes for poor user experience , especially those intrusive ones that interrupts readers halfway down a blog post or page . <p> AdSense scripts can sometimes increase your page load times . <p> AdSense is the least profitable way to monetise your blog , unless you have a ton load of traffic . <h> Isnt using AdSense the same as displaying affiliate banners ? <p> This is another question I get asked a lot . <p> I do n't  use affiliate banners on my site either , although if I did and they converted well enough , the revenue would be much greater- than what I 'd get from a dozen AdSense clicks . <p> I would much prefer to earn $75 from a banner click leading to an affiliate sale , than an AdSense click that could earn me just 20 cents . <p> These days , website visitors are much more savvy- than they used to be , and most of them are blind to blatant advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> What sites are great for AdSense then ? <p> I 'm not saying that AdSense is bad altogether , I just really do n't  think displaying them on a business website or a personal blog , where you 're trying to- build a brand and promote your own products and services , is a smart idea these days . <p> However if you want- to use AdSense , they 're probably best suited on small niche websites with high-traffic . And on websites- where you 're not- going to ever create and sell your own products on . <h> What should you do instead of using AdSense ads on your business website ? <p> Those many visitors you lost through an AdSense click ? They 're never coming back <p> So if you 're thinking of using AdSense on your personal blog or small business website , please , please , please think very carefully about it before doing this . <p> Forget about the stories you read about folks making tons of money though AdSense . They probably have a website that gets millions of hits each month , and in a super profitable- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own info-based products , such as an eBook or online course . Or how about promoting some affiliate products and services that you use and trust , at least the commission rate will be- much higher . <p> Think about it , you could earn $1,000 from just 20- referrals each month . Or earn $2 from 20 AdSense clicks , its your choice . <p> Check out this post I wrote on how to promote affiliate products , increase sales on your blog without increasing traffic . <h> Your turn to have your say <p> Let me know your thoughts on this debate . <p> Do you think Google AdSense should be placed on a small business website or personal brand blog ? <p> Do you already use AdSense on your blog or business website ? And if so , do you think you could be missing out on a whole lot of potential , conversion wise ? <p> Start a conversation with me below in the comment section . <p> Thanks for reading , I appreciate you and happy blogging as always . <p> Post Views : 415 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adsense is bad branding unless your brand is so strong and HUGE ie Huff Post that it overpowers the Adsense . Super points dude . Stick with the eBooks and services and list building to make things happen from a well branded , clear and focused space . <p> Hey Ryan you 're right a large online media outlet like Huff Post or Mashable would do well with AdSense , makes you wonder just how well those brands do with AdSense . But small business sites and blogs are a definite no go in my experience . <p> Completely agree with you ! Before I knew any better I had Adsense on my site and I only earned coppers from it . Then i managed to break one of their T&amp;Cs , so they closed me down and kept the balance of the money I 'd earned anyway . I never figured out what I did wrong , but by then I 'd started to realize that Adsense was taking my visitors away and I was pleased to lose it . ALSO , sometimes , the sites displayed were direct competitors ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block every one . A lesson well worth emphasizing ! Joy <p> Hey Joy , thanks for dropping by , I was the same . I remember getting off the phone to the tax man way back in 2005 and he mentioned something about Google AdSense and I should look into it , first time I ever heard of it at the time . I opened my account in 2006 I think . I used it on several old blogs and did OKish , but soon learned it was the ultimate conversion killer . I currently use AdSense on one parenting niche site of mine and that 's about it as it earns pence each day . Have a great weekend Joy = <p> I used it several years ago made a couple of hundred dollars from it and then promptly removed it . <p> Apart from the fact you make peanuts from using it , as you say it is ugly and devalues your site . Its also a conversion killer because people click off and do n't  get into our own content as much , which defeats the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy way to make a few bucks , but so is affiliate marketing and is much more profitable . <p> Bloggers should focus on the basics list building , promoting their own products/services , as well as affiliate offers . <p> Hi Kim so glad you agree with me here . I prefer affiliate marketing as well , you work hard writing some great reviews , case studies etc , and promoting the heck out of it , and it pays off 50 times more than AdSense could ever give you back , that 's awesome . <p> List building and creating my own products , eBooks are also a big part of my strategy . Have a great weekend Kim .

Seriously folks , for years I 've been chugging along with my good old trusty PC , which I will say was adequate enough for me then . <p> However , I was always told that PCs were the work horse of computers , and Macs were used mainly by creative people , graphic designers , musicians etc . <p> In 2014 I decided to buy myself a new laptop as mine eventually- died , and so after careful consideration I made the decision to purchase a 13 ? MacBook Air ( aff ) , going against the grain and what I 've been told otherwise about Macs . <p> After working with- my new Macbook- for a few months , I then realised just how wrong I 'd been about Macs . <p> Sure it took me some time to get used to , but looking back now even a year later , I really do n't  know how the heck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  say that to be all biassed towards Apple , I love my Mac and it truly is a workhorse for me , especially since I now offer custom WordPress- design , and graphic design services through my blog . <p> Anyway I 'm getting myself lost here . I love some of the apps that are available for the Mac too , a lot of them are free to download and use , - and- Ive also invested in two or three really great paid apps which is really helping me with my web design and graphic design services . <p> So peeps , if you 've recently- invested in a Mac yourself , or you 're about to , and want to get your hands on some amazing productivity apps to help you blog more efficiently , then here 's the top 10 apps I 've used and therefore highly recommend you check out . <h> My Top 10 Productivity- Mac Apps For Bloggers <p> 01 . Byword This is a super clean app for all those bloggers looking for a gimmicks free desktop writing tool . I love this app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple to use , I actually enjoy writing with it installed on my Macbook when I 'm away from the desk . This app is great for WordPress bloggers as it allows you to publish to your blog , select tags and categories and much more . You can download Byword or learn more here . <p> 02 . PhotoScape X If you 're a regular reader of my blog you will have seen that I 've mentioned this app quite a bit previously . This is by far one of the best free photo editing apps that there is for the Mac , and the premium version has a few more goodies in store . I use PhotoScape to help me create and customise most of the featured blog post images you see here on Magnet4Blogging . Check it out here . <p> 03 . Skype This app truly is one of the most used apps on my desktop right now , I seriously use the Skype app on a daily basis , talking to clients , conducting interviews and communicating with my audience in general . Definitely worth having on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another well used app on my Desktop is the Evernote app , I know this is quite a popular one too . Now I use the free version myself which does the job fine for me . I use the Evernote app to write blog posts , post title ideas , create email templates , write to-do lists and more . <p> I also use this app to write blog comments before posting them to other blogs , write guest posts , do research for future posts , curate content , bookmark posts , copy and paste and more . <p> The other obvious thing that I love about this app is that I can access all of the content that I add to Evernote across all my other iOS devices , I definitely recommend you instal this app on your Mac . <p> 05 . TextWrangler I started using TextWrangler only a few weeks ago to be really honest with you folks , but I had to add it here because its super useful , not just for editing simple texts , but also- for writing code to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . I love some of the built in functions like the Syntax colouring , like I said useful when creating source codes . <p> 06. iMovie iMovie was the very first application that I started to use on my Macbook . Previously to that I was using Windows Media Player . Learning how to use this app for the first time took some getting used to I will admit , but once I was past the learning stage , I grew to love this app even more . All of the videos I now create for my YouTube channel and other platforms are edited and finalised in iMovie . <p> Some of the features like themes and enhanced editing tools are really great for making your videos look pro , without having to spend a fortune on other editing software. - The updated iOS version of this app is awesome as I also use my iPhone to record and edit videos on the go . Download iMovie here . <p> 07 . Chrome Love , love love this app even better than Safari and FireFox put together , super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , get it here . <p> 08 . Affinity Designer OK so this is n't an app for every WordPress blogger perhaps , but if you 're a web or graphic designer like myself , and you 're looking for a professional vector graphic design software app for the Mac , this is it , there 's nothing else that comes remotely close to Affinity Designer . <p> Affinity Designer has way too many features to list here , but I 've thoroughly enjoyed using this app over the last few months myself to not only create custom graphics and logos for my clients projects and my own , but I 've also been able to use the app to create custom featured post images , infographics , eBook cover artwork , social media cover photos and more . It really has helped me to get creative with my brand . Check out the app here . <p> 09 . Screencast-O-Matic Another great app for WordPress bloggers that uses Macs is Screencast-O-Matic . Now whilst this is n't an app available directly from the Apple app store , it can be obtained from the screencast website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my on-screen product reviews and tutorials . I then edit them in iMovie later on . <p> 10 . Pomodoro Time - This is simply the best productivity optimiser app if there ever was such a thing . I 've got this timer app installed on both my Macbook and iMac and love , love , love working with it running in the background . I 've created several tasks with allocated time for each one , and when I set the timer to start work I can see how much time I have left before its time to move onto the next task or even take a break . Check it out here . <p> So peeps those are my 10 best productivity Mac apps for bloggers that I recommend , and ones that I currently have installed on my own computer. - I hope some of these will come useful for you too . <p> If you use any of these yourself or want to recommend any that I 've not mentioned here , please do leave me a comment here on Google+ . <p> Happy blogging as always , chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Views : 344 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 
@@76508762 @5208762/ <p> Hey folks , this week I want to share with you my little review of a cool WordPress plugin I discovered . About a week ago I purchased a plugin called Zero Bounce created by ForceSpark . I actually purchased the single site licence which set me back just- $19 . <p> Before I start I need to give some credit . I actually first learned about this plugin by reading two great reviews on two other blogs , ShoutMeLoud.com and EnstineMuki.com , both reputable blogs which I follow and respect , so naturally I had to check the plugin out for myself . <h> What Is It ? <p> Let me be clear about what this plugin actually is and what it can do . <h> Is Reducing Bounce Rate Important ? <p> Yes absolutely , for SEO purposes- for sure , it is said that the higher your bounce rate the further down the search results your posts and pages will end up , so having reasonably low bounce rate is important for improving your rankings naturally , but asides the search engine factor , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take something away from your blog , I mean- having them leave empty handed is a potential loss right ? - Well you can with this amazing little plugin in force . <p> I suppose you could argue that if someone clearly wasnt- interested in your site or your content , and they bounced off , then surely you should n't force them to stay right ? <p> I completely agree , however- there is still the opportunity to let them go away from your site with something valuable , and I 'll explain how you can do that using this plugin later on in the post . <h> How does the Zero Bounce plugin work ? <p> OK once you have the Zero Bounce plugin installed and have added your license key , imagine- someone visits your blog from maybe doing a search in Google , and they land on one of your posts or your pages . <p> Now usually , if they decide to click the back button for any reason , maybe because the page did n't  contain the information they needed , instead of them bouncing- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can decide which page they land on instead , in other words you can redirect them to a specific page . <p> This could- be an external page or even a website such as Amazon with your Amazon affiliate link . This could also be your Facebook business page , or another page within your website which you feel- might be useful for your uninterested visitors , such as an email landing page or a customised page created just for your bounced visitors . <h> My setup with this plugin <p> Ive been using this plugin for around a week now , and how I have this setup , is that if someone visits my blog for the first time from doing a Google search , when they click the back button , instead of them heading back to Google , they actually end up on my email capture page with my free incentives . <p> I have two email capture pages , and so I have this plugin setup to use which ever page alternatively . I 'll explain how you can do this in more detail later on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this setup , and I must stress that I 'm still fine tuning the settings and experimenting with this plugin , I 've been able to reduce my blogs bounce rate very slightly- from around 70%- to around 60% in just a week , not a great improvement but its a start . In addition- Ive also been able to increase the number of email signups to my blog with the redirects . <h> Zero Bounce Plugin Features <p> OK let me show you what this plugin has to offer in the back end . <h> Plugin Options <p> The screenshot above shows the plugin options that are available . In the Global URLs field you can use one URL or multiple URLs to redirect your visitors . As you can see above I 'm using two email landing pages to redirect visitors to , these execute alternatively . <p> By default the plugin redirects regardless of the page , post etc your visitor has landed on . However you can over-ride this setting by disabling redirection for either the homepage , posts or pages . <h> Conditions <p> The screenshot above shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaves for you . For instance , you can activate for specific referrers and add more referrers in the field , i.e. Twitter , Google Plus , specific target websites etc . <p> You can also choose to deactivate Zero Bounce after a set amount of time , maybe 30 or 40 seconds later , or redirect by specific device , or choose to only redirect a certain percentage of your visitors . <p> Another feature in Zero Bounce is the ability to redirect if your visitors wants to close the window or browser . Personally I think that 's a little too forceful for a personal blog , but if you 're using this plugin on a sales page or niche site for example , then this feature might prove to be a useful one . <p> The final option on this page is whether you want to redirect a visitor only once. - So as you can see there 's quite a few conditions you can set to your preference here . <p> Now let 's look at some of the advanced options . <h> Advanced Options <p> OK so if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this page you have options to set custom redirects for each referrer , i.e. Facebook , Twitter etc , and send them to specific pages on your blog or website . <p> You can also redirect by geo-location , again this could be very useful if you wanted to create custom pages , signup forms or offers on your blog targeted at those geo-located visitors . <h> Individual Page Setup <p> The last thing I want to talk about is the ability to configure this plugin on individual pages or posts on your blog . <p> A good use for this would be for example a product review post , instead of sending visitors back to Google again from your reviews , you could actually send them to the product page itself , maybe containing your affiliate link . Again this could be seen as being a little too forceful or sneaky even , but its an option for you to use to boost your affiliate earnings . <p> Create custom pages with offers , videos specially- for your bounced traffic or visitors and redirect them there , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few ideas to use this plugin . <h> Conclusion <p> The idea of reducing bounce rate should appeal to most bloggers , it certainly appeals to me , and using this plugin is just one way to help reduce bounce rate , I would n't recommend just relying on this plugin alone because there are other effective ways you can reduce bounce rate . You could combine some other strategies with using this plugin . <p> As you can see from the suggested usage you can really make the most of the Zero Bounce plugin , and it could prove to be an even more powerful plugin when used with landing pages , sales pages , affiliate pages etc . <p> I would safely recommend giving it a try , for a single site license its only $19- which is n't really bad , and if you 're not happy you can take advantage of the 30-day money back guarantee . Check out the chart below for all other price plans . <p> Please note that the image below is a clickable , containing my affiliate link . This means should you purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be paid a small commission at no- additional cost to you ! <p> I hope you 've enjoyed this little review of the Zero Bounce plugin , if you already have this plugin do let me know your thoughts and how you 're getting on with it . If you do n't  have it , hope you 'll give it a try . <p> Have a super week ahead . <p> Fabrizio Van Marciano <p> Recommended Posts <p> Here are some recommended WordPress plugin reviews and related posts you might be interested in reading . 62416 @qwx682416 62414 @qwx682414 62413 @qwx682413 62417 @qwx682417 62415 @qwx682415 <h> Comments <p> I really appreciate your thoughtful review of this product , Fabrizio .
