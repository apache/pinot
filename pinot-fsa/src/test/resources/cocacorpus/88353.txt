Some individuals who possess a reasonably good level of fitness ( because they bicycle or swim or participate in other sports ) could probably go out and run 9 miles on very little training . They might be sore the week after the race , but they still could finish . <p> But if you 've made the decision to run a 15-K ( or 10-mile ) race , you might as well do it right . Here is a ten-week training schedule to help get you to the finish line . It assumes that you have no major health problems , are in reasonably good shape , and have done at least some jogging or walking . If running 2 miles for your first running workout seems too difficult , you might want to begin by walking , rather than running . Or , if you have more than ten weeks before the 15-K race you plan to run , switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance base before preceding . <p> 10-Mile Training : The difference between 15-K ( 9.3 miles ) and 10 miles is minimal . You can use these same programs to train for a 10-mile race . <p> The terms used in the training schedule are somewhat obvious , but let me explain what I mean anyway . Further information and explanations are included in my Virtual Training Programs available through TrainingPeaks , where I send you daily emails telling you what to run and how to train . <p> Stretch &amp; Strength : Mondays are the days in which I advise you to do some stretching along with some strength training . This is actually a day of rest following your weekend long run . Do some easy stretching of your running muscles . This is good advice for any day , particularly after you finish your run , but spend a bit more time stretching on Mondays . Strength training could consist of push-ups , pull-ups , use of free weights or working out with various machines at a Health Club . Runners generally benefit if they combine light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumping very heavy iron . I also suggest that you do some strength training following your Thursday workouts , however you can schedule strength training on any two days that are convenient for your business and personal schedule . <p> Running workouts : Put one foot in front of the other and run . It sounds pretty simple , and it is . Do n't worry about how fast you run ; just cover the distance--or approximately the distance suggested . Ideally , you should be able to run at a pace that allows you to converse comfortably while you do so . This is n't always easy for beginners , so do n't push too hard or too fast . Under this workout plan , you run three days of the week : Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays , Saturdays being a longer run . ( See below . ) <p> Cross-Training : On the schedule , this is identified simply as " cross . " What form of cross-training works best for runners preparing for a 15-K race ? It could be swimming , or cycling , walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could include strength training if you choose to do it on Wednesdays and Saturdays instead of as indicated on the schedule . And feel free to throw in some jogging as well if you 're feeling good . What cross-training you select depends on your personal preference . But do n't make the mistake of cross-training too vigorously . Cross-training days should be considered easy days that allow you to recover from the running you do the rest of the week . <p> Rest : The most important day in any running program is rest . Rest days are as important as training days . They give your muscles time to recover so you can run again . Actually , your muscles will build in strength as you rest . Without recovery days , you will not improve . In this program , Friday is always scheduled as a day of rest to compliment the also easy workouts on Mondays . <p> Long Runs : The longest runs of the 10-week schedule are planned for Saturdays , since you probably have more time to do them on the weekends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs , feel free to do them on Sunday--or any other day of the week for that matter . Do n't run these long runs too hard . Keep them at a " conversational " pace ; meaning , at a pace slow enough that you can converse with a running companion without getting too much out of breath . <p> Walking : Walking is an excellent exercise that a lot of runners overlook in their training . I do n't specify walking workouts , but feel free to walk during your running workouts any time you feel tired or need a break . In the 15-K or 10-miler you choose , nobody cares whether you run every step of the way ; they 're more concerned that you finish . If this means walking every step in practice and in the race , do it ! <p> Stepback Weeks : You will notice that the weekly mileage does not progress upwards in a straight line . In Week 4 and Week 7 , you run somewhat less than the weeks before . This is the " stepback " approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : giving runners a brief break every third week so that they could gather strength before pushing up to the next level .

Is this your first marathon ? Have you only begun to run ? Novice 1 was designed with you in mind . If you have been running for a year or more and have run a number of races from 5-K to the half marathon , you might want to consider a slight nudge up to Novice 2 , although many experienced runners also favor Novice 1 , because of the ( relatively ) gentle way it prepares you to run 26 miles 385 yards . <p> Let me explain some of the workouts you will run during the 18 weeks of Novice 1 .

( After that , you taper 3 weeks to get ready for the marathon . ) You can skip an occasional workout , but do not cheat on the long runs . Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer , every third week is a " stepback " week , where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward . <p> Rest : Novice 1 marathoners rest on Mondays and rest again on Fridays . This is both to recover after the weekend long runs and to gather energy before them . Scientists suggest that it is during the rest period ( the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise ) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger . Coaches also will tell you that you ca n't run hard unless you are well rested . And it is hard running ( such as the long run ) that allows you to improve . The secret to success in any training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with your training during the full 18 weeks of the program , you can afford--and may benefit from--extra rest . <p> Run Slow : Normally I recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds or more per mile slower than their marathon pace . The problem with offering this advice to first-time novice runners , however , is that you probably do n't know what your marathon pace is , because you 've never run a marathon before ! Do n't worry . Simply do your long runs at a comfortable pace , one that allows you to converse with your training partners . As far as I 'm concerned , there is no such thing as " too slow . " The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance ; how fast you cover it does n't matter . <p> Walking : Don'g be embarrassed to take walking breaks . Walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy in trying to finish a marathon . It works during training runs too . While some coaches recommend walking 1 minute out of every 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking again , I suggest that in the marathon runners walk when they come to an aid station . Here 's why : you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running , It 's a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well . Walking gives your body a chance to rest , and you 'll be able to continue running more comfortably . It 's best to walk when you want to , not when your ( fatigued ) body forces you too . <p> Cross-Training : Sundays in the Novice 1 training program are devoted to cross-training . What is cross-training ? It is an form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting ( usually ) after your long run . In the Novice 1 program , we run long on Saturdays and cross-train on Sundays , although it certainly is possible to reverse that order . The best cross-training exercises are swimming , cycling or even walking . Activities requiring sudden or sideways movements are not always a good choice . You do n't need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine two or more exercises : walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a health club . <p> Strength Training : A frequently asked question is : " Should I add strength training to my marathon program ? " If you have to ask , you probably should not . I strongly endorse strength training for maximum fitness and long life , but if you never have pumped iron before , now is probably not the time to start . Wait until after you have that medal around your neck . If you already hang out at the gym , Tuesdays and Thursdays work well for strength training--after you finish your short runs on those days . <p> Midweek Training : Training during the week should be done at a comparatively easy pace . As the weekend mileage builds , the weekday mileage also builds . Add up the numbers , and you 'll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the week as you do during long runs on the weekends . Midweek workouts on Wednesdays build from 3 to 10 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are similar slight advances on Tuesdays and Thursdays although these are planned as " easy " days . <p> Races : Normally , I do n't prescribe races--or at least too many races--for first-time marathoners . Races can get in the way , particularly if you taper before a race and need extra recovery afterwards . But some racing is convenient , because it introduces newcomers to the racing experience . I suggest you consider doing a half marathon in Week 8 , a week when in the normal progression you might do 13 miles as your long run . No half marathon in your neighborhood that week ? You can juggle the training schedule to match the local racing calendar . One advantage of doing a half is that afterwards , you can use one of the pace calculators available on the Internet ( best is by Greg McMillan ) to predict your marathon pace and finish . <p> Training : If you would like more help with your marathon training , sign up for one of my interactive training programs , and I will send you emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to train , -+All my training programs are available in an interactive format through TrainingPeaks .

But change of pace can be an important training tool as your fitness begins to increase . You do n't need to walk at the same pace day after day . In fact , you should change paces if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go the distance . Here are descriptions of three pace changes prescribed in the program . <p> Pace <p> Description <p> Breathing <p> How to Do It <p> Stroll <p> " Window shopping " walking <p> Normal <p> Enjoy your walk <p> Easy <p> Continuous comfortable walking <p> Almost Normal <p> Move somewhat faster <p> Brisk <p> Walking with real purpose <p> Harder , but still conversational <p> Quicker-than-normal steps <p> Distance : Most of the workouts are prescribed in minutes rather than miles . Do n't worry how far you walk ; just walk for the prescribed length of time . If you know about how fast you walk , you can estimate distance , but during the week , distance is not important . You just want to get out on a regular basis and exercise your legs . On Sundays , however , the training schedule does dictate workouts at distances , from 3 to 10 miles . Do n't worry about walking precisely those distances , but you should come close . Pick a course through the neighborhood , or in some scenic area where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course either by car or bicycle . Or you can purchase a GPS watch , which uses satellite technology to accurately measure your pace and distance and record your heart rate . In deciding where to train , talk to other walkers or runners . They probably can point you to some accurately measured courses for your workouts . <p> Time : Comparing time and distance sometimes can be a trap . If you become fixated on how fast you walk , you can push yourself too hard and increase your risk of injury . But it 's handy to know about how fast you are walking , particularly if you are worried about finishing the half marathon in less than four hours . To get a precise measurement of your ability , go to a track for an occasional workout . Outdoor tracks at colleges and high schools are generally 400 meters long . Two laps ( 800 meters ) walked in the inside lane is about a half mile ; four laps ( 1600 meters ) is just short of a mile . If you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk near a track and slip in the gate for a few laps to see how fast you 're going . <p> Rest : Rest is as important a part of your training as the workouts . You will be able to do the long walks on the weekends better--and limit your risk of injury--if you rest before , and rest after . <p> Long Walks : The key to getting ready to finish a half marathon is the long walk , progressively increasing in distance each weekend . Over a period of 12 weeks , your longest walk will increase from 3 to 10 miles . Do n't worry about making the final jump from 10 miles in practice to 13.1 miles in the race . Inspiration will carry you to the finish line , particularly if you taper the final week . The schedule below suggests doing your long runs on Sundays , but you can do them Saturdays , or any other convenient day , as long as you are consistent . ( See " Juggling , " below . ) <p> Cross-Train : As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on different days of the week . Runners usually refer to this as " cross-training . " What form of cross-training works best for a fitness walker ? It could be swimming , cycling , cross-country skiing , snowshoeing , or even some combination that could include stretching or strength training in a gym . The type of cross-training you select , should you choose to go that route , depends on your personal preference . Do n't make the mistake of cross-training too vigorously . <p> Jogging : One way to get to the finish line faster is to do some jogging . If you were a competitive racewalker , you could get disqualified for starting to run , but since you are not competing for a prize , feel free to jog occasionally , either in training or in the half marathon itself . Jog in small segments : Fifty to 100 meters every 10 minutes or so might be enough at first . Eventually you might want to expand your jogging segments , or even run the entire way , but do n't do too much at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so be cautious . Your goal should be to finish the half marathon , not finish it fast . ( If you do plan to do some jog/walking in a race that offers prizes in a " walking " category , you need to enter in the " running " division . It 's unfair to those who walk the whole way for you to be ranked as finishing faster because you ran . ) <p> Take Time : Does the 12-week progression from 3 to 13.1 miles seem too tough ? Do you have more than a dozen weeks before your half marathon event ? Lengthen the schedule ; take 18 or even 24 weeks to prepare . Repeat the week just completed before moving up to the next level . Do n't be afraid to insert " stepback " weeks , where you actually cut your distance every second or third week to gather forces for the next push upward . This training schedule is not carved in stone . Feel free to innovate if you feel you need more time to prepare . <p> Juggling : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to day and week to week . If you have an important business meeting on Thursday , do the Thursday workout on Wednesday instead . If your family is going to be on vacation one week when you will have more or less time to train , adjust the schedule accordingly . Be consistent with your training , and the overall details wo n't matter . <p> Books on Walking : For more information on walking , check out Mark Fenton 's The Complete Guide to Walking for Health , Weight Loss and Fitness , published by Lyons Press . Fenton also collaborated with me to produce a chapter on walking for Hal Higdon 's How To Train . The schedule that follows is based partly on material from that chapter . Another book you might want to consider is my best-selling Marathon : The Ultimate Training Guide . Although written with runners in mind , a lot of the tips and information on being an endurance athlete make sense for walkers too . <p> Interactive Training : For further instruction and motivation , sign up for my Interactive Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will send you a daily e-mail message telling you what to train that day along with additional information related to health and fitness . You can also record your workouts in a computer log . <p> Walking 13.1 miles is not easy . If it were easy , there would be little challenge to an event such as the half marathon . Whether you plan your Half as a singular accomplishment or as a stepping stone to the even more challenging full marathon ( running or walking ) , crossing the finish line will give you a feeling of great accomplishment . Good luck with your training .

Regardless of your age or ability , you would like to run as fast as you possibly can . You want a training program that will challenge you .

You can do this by ( 1 ) running more miles , ( 2 ) running faster , or ( 3 ) some combination of both .

" ) Run 60 to 90 minutes at a comfortable pace , not worrying about speed or distance . Think minutes rather than miles , which allows you to explore different courses that you have not measured , or run in the woods where distance is unimportant . You should be able to carry on a conversation while you run ; if not , you 're going to fast . Do n't be afraid to stop to walk , or stop to drink .

Run 400 meters hard , then recover by jogging and/or walking 400 meters . A second variation is to run 200 meter repeats at 800 race pace with 200 jogging between . Before starting this workout , warm up by jogging a mile or two , stretching , and doing a few sprints of 100 meters . Cool down afterwards with a short jog . <p> Tempo Runs : This is a continuous run with an easy beginning , a build-up in the middle to near 10-K race pace ( or slightly slower than your pace in a 5-K ) , then ease back and slow down toward the end . A typical Tempo Run would begin with 5-10 minutes easy running , build to 10-15 minutes at 10-K pace , then 5-10 minutes cooling down .

Mondays and Wednesdays would be good days to combine stretching and strengthening with your easy run , however , you can schedule these workouts on any day that is convenient for your business and personal schedule . <p> Rest : You ca n't train hard unless you are well-rested . The schedule includes one designated day of rest ( Friday ) when you do nothing and a second day ( Wednesday ) when you have an option to also take a day off .

@@102096097 @6296097/ <h> Training <h> Stretching <h> Flexibility Can Make You Faster <p> IT WAS NOT A PULL , but more a strain of my hamstring muscle . I had injured the left hamstring while training last summer for the World Veterans Championships in Gateshead , England . Going over hurdles did me in . I strained the muscle further while running a sub-par 1,500 meter run at Gateshead . Warming up for the 2,000 meter steeplechase two days later , I could barely move , so pulled out of the race . <p> A month later , even though I could still run , the hamstring was not getting any better . That was a problem , since I had a commitment to run a 12-mile leg in the Klondike Road Relay in Alaska within a week . Running a sub-par race bothered me less than letting down my teammates . <p> That 's when I decided to see Debbie Pitchford . <p> Pitchford is a physical therapist for Novacare and works at Medical Group Outpatient Rehabilitation in Michigan City , Indiana . She had run cross-country and track ( 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but her main sport was gymnastics . Pitchford placed tenth at State in the uneven bars her senior year , despite competing with a broken ankle . " Landing was an adventure , " recalls Pitchford with a rue smile . <p> She did not participate in sports while obtaining degrees at Purdue University ( B.A. ) and the University of Evansville ( B.S. ) that led to her current career as a physical therapist , but jogged for enjoyment , an activity she continues today . Pitchford usually runs 3-5 miles , 3-4 times a week near her home in New Buffalo , Michigan . <p> As a physical therapist , Pitchford understands how to stretch correctly , something she claims not all runners know how to do . She offers the following advice for runners who want to increase their speed and prevent injuries by developing flexibility . <p> Warm Up and Cool Down : Stretching is important during your warm-up , before you run , because it increases blood flow to the muscles . But stretching during your cool-down may be even more important . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscle , which in turn reduces muscle soreness , " says Pitchford . " That promotes better flexibility . " Stretching afterwards also will help you relax . <p> Do n't  Overstretch : While stretching can promote flexibility , stretching too far actually can damage the musclesparticularly if you 're recovering form an injury . " A healthy muscle can elongate up to 1.6 times its length , " suggests Pitchford , " but generally does n't  respond well to that much stretching . " By overstretching , you create an automatic myotatic reflex that actually will cause the muscle to recoil to protect itself from tearing and injury . Also , do n't  bounce while stretching . Holding your stretch in a static position works best . <p> Combine Stretching and Strengthening : A good time to do your stretching exercises is while resting between lifts during your strength training . ( See : Strength . ) Strength training will not decrease your flexibility , says Pitchford , as long as you do it properly and perform your lifts through their full range of motion . <p> Use MICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way of treating an injury : Rest , Ice , Compression and Elevation . But Pitchford promotes MICE . " Move it , " she says . This is because immobilizing a muscle can lead to decreased blood flow and muscle atrophy . If you stretch properly while recovering from an injury , you can speed that recovery . <p> Resist Aging : Pitchford believes it a myth that aging is the only factor that causes us to lose flexibility . " Its lack of exercise , " she says . " Studies show that a sedentary lifestyle is a bigger factor in decreasing flexibility than aging . " If you stay active aerobically and use stretching to maintain your flexibility , you will look and feel younger because of the way you move . <p> Finally , the key to the exercises presented below is to maintain good form . Do n't  look sloppy stretching . The 90-degree angles featuring straight backs and carefully positioned limbs that work in the strength exercises promoted by personal trainer Cathy Vasto also work well in many of the stretching exercises promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Hold each stretch for 10 seconds , repeating 10 times. ) <h> 1 . Quadriceps Stretch <p> The quadriceps is the muscle in the front of the thigh , important for lifting your knees and increasing your speed . It is the " quads " that often go at the end of marathons , causing runners to come shuffling across the finish line because they have a hard time lifting their feet off the ground . To do this exercise while standing , simply grab hold of a stationary object for balance with one hand and use the opposite hand to grasp the leg around the ankle , lifting it toward your buttocks . Pitchford points out several form faults : " You want to keep your back straight and not allow the knee to drift forward ahead of the stance leg . A lot of runners slouch forward , which effectively negates the stretchs effectiveness . " <p> An even more effective way to do this exercise , however , is lying on a bench , using a towel wrapped around the ankle to pull your foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the bench with the foot of your dangling leg forward , knee bent , leg relaxed . As with the other stretching exercises , hold each stretch for 10 seconds and repeat as many as 10 times for each leg . <h> 2 . Hamstring Stretch <p> This is the exercise that got me ready to run the Klondike Relay . Most runners do this exercise by putting their foot on a waist-high stationary object ( or a hurdle if at the track ) and slowly leaning forward , reaching down the shin until they feel a stretch in the hamstring . The hamstring is the muscle that runs from just below the knee up into the buttocks . Its the muscle that lifts the lower leg and bends the knee after the quads have lifted your knees . Sprinters pull this muscle more than distance runners , but as I discovered , even straining your hamstring can limit your ability to run fast . <p> The best way to do this exercise , however , is not with your foot on a stool , but rather while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the hamstring stretch . Lie on your back , keeping the back flat and your eyes focused upward . Grasp the back of one thigh with both your hands and ( leg bent ) pull that thigh into a 90-degree position vs. the floor . Then slowly straighten your knee . After you 've gotten used to doing this exercise , you can achieve a better stretch by pulling your thigh closer to your chestbut do n't  overdo it ! <h> 3 . Piriformis Stretch <p> The piriformis muscle is responsible for lateral rotation of the hip . It is particularly important to athletes who have to change direction , such as tennis players and running backs in football . But though runners run straight ahead , keeping the piriformis muscle loose is important for overall flexibility . Lying on your back , cross your legs just as you might while sitting in a chair . Grasping the " under " leg with both hands , pull the knee toward your chest until you feel the stretch in your buttocks and hips . <h> 4 . Gastroc Stretch <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing before races . Typically , they lean against a wall to stretch the calf musclesbut they do n't  always do it right , claims Pitchford . The gastroc muscle , along with the soleus , is located in the back of the calf . It is the calf muscle that actually propels your leg across your grounded foot while running . Lean against a wall or other stationary object , both palms against the object . The leg you want to stretch is back , several feet from the wall , your heel firmly positioned on the floor . Your other leg is flexed about halfway between your back leg and the wall . Start with your back straight and gradually lunge forward until you feel the stretch in your calf . " It is important to keep your back foot straight and angled 90 degrees from the wall , " says Pitchford. <h> 5 . Soleus Stretch <p> " This is the stretch that most runners forget , " says Pitchford . " They stretch their gastroc muscles ( as above ) without realizing there 's a similar stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major muscle in the calf , located in front of the gastroc . It is important for planting the foot on the ground before your push off . Position yourself similar to the gastroc stretch with back straight and palms against the wall . The difference is that you start in a " seated " position with your legs bent , your buttocks dropped .

Run at a comfortable pace , one that allows you to converse with your training partners , at least during the beginning of the run . Toward the end , you may need to abandon conversation and concentrate on finishing with good form . Or , if you paced yourself properly , pick up the pace and finish strong .

It 's a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well . <p> Cross-training : Sundays in this training program are devoted to cross-training , an hour each time although you do not need to do exactly 60 minutes . What is cross-training ? It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles the day after your long run . The best cross-training exercises are swimming , cycling or even walking , aerobic exercises . One tip : You do n't have to cross-train the same each weekend .

Listen to your body signals as much as the signals coming from your GPS watch . Wednesdays feature a mini-build-up from 3 to 5 miles with some of those workouts done at race pace . If you strength train , Tuesdays and Thursdays would be the best days to combine lifting with running . Usually its a good idea to run before you lift rather than the reverse . <p> Pace : What do I mean by " pace " in the chart below . I mean race pace .

@@102096100 @6296100/ <h> Training <h> Spring Training <h> A 12-Week Schedule to Get You Ready to Race <p> Here is the training program you 've been looking for : Spring Training . I designed this 12-week program several years ago to bridge the gap between the end of winter , signaled in Chicago by the LaSalle Bank Shamrock Shuffle toward the end of March , and the start in early June of my 18-week training program to prepare runners for the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon in October . <p> Race dates in Chicago often cause minor variations between the Shuffle and the Marathon , which signal the beginning and end of the racing season in that city . In 2005 , for instance , Easter pushed the Shuffle into April . But normally in Chicago , runners usually can begin with Week 1 the day after the Shuffle and complete Week 12 just in time to start Week 1 of my marathon training program . That 's roughly 30 weeks of training designed to make sure you 're ready to run the marathon in the fall . You may live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even be preparing to run Chicago , but the training principle of doing some preliminary training ( sometimes introducing speedwork ) before starting your marathon training remains the same . <p> So let us begin . While all of the information on how to do specific workouts is contained in the Novice , Intermediate and Advanced introductions that follow from this screen--as well as in my various books--it 's not always convenient to surf to get what you want to know . You want that information now ! And you have it here . You 'll find the weekly Spring Training screens that follow from the introductory screens crammed with information on how to train . And if you would like to sign up for one of my Virtual Training programs where I send you daily e-mail messages telling you how to train , you have that option too . Click on the logo in the right margin below . Regardless of which one of my programs you choose , Spring Training specifically is focused on how to get ready to run and ready to race . <h> Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have run before--this may mean getting into some semblance of shape so that they can begin my 18-week marathon training program . For those of you who have been running several years , Week 1 , which is climaxed by a 6-mile long run on the weekend may not seem that tough , but it 's like Mount Everest for those who have never run before . This Spring Training program will give novice runners a chance to gradually raise their fitness level so they can begin that first week of training with some chance of success . <p> Advanced runners often have a different problem . They 've run a bunch of marathons and other races at different distances , and they want to improve their performances , not merely in the marathon , but in other distances they run frequently , like the 5-K , 8-K or 10-K . These advanced schedules will tell them how to do just that , showing how to mix various forms of speedwork ( interval training , tempo runs , hills , fartlek ) into their training week . They also get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) with goal 5-K and 10-K races in the last few weeks . <p> The Intermediate runners fall somewhere in between . These are runners who probably have been running several years , may have run one or two marathons , have faithfully trained through the winter , maintaining a certain mileage base , and now they want to build on that base . They want to continue to maintain that fitness level--perhaps improve on it slightly--so they can start marathon training in better shape than before . The 12-week Intermediate schedule offers some speedwork and some racing and should provide what they want . <p> So here is Spring Training in multiple variations . Whichever one of my programs you choose , I hope it will help you to achieve your running goals . 
@@102096102 @6296102/ <h> Training <h> Fitness Walking <h> Becoming a fitness walker can be fun . Here 's how to do it <p> The greatest number of walkers walk just to walk , suggests Mark Fenton , editor-at-large for Walking magazine . " They like being outdoors , " he says . " They like getting some exercise and improving their health . At the other end of the scale are racewalkers , those hip-swinging , elbow-pumping , glory-seeking individuals who have as a goal a place on the Olympic team , or at least a medal at their local walking race . <p> Fenton believes , however , that an additional class of walkers exists between these two extremes . These are the individuals who seek not merely health benefits but also physical fitness . They dress like athletes , not like someone out for a stroll . They walk tall , eyes forward . They take quick steps . They push off on their toes . Whether or not they swing their hips , many bend their arms and look ( somewhat ) like racewalkers . They probably do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , a discipline to be pursued with some vigor--and enjoyment . <p> They have been described by various reporters as aerobic walkers , striders , and power walkers . Fenton prefers to use the term fitness walkers . He even incorporated that label into the title of a book he wrote with fellow Walking editor Seth Bauer , The 90-Day Fitness Walking Program . <p> " You 'll get some health benefits by going out and walking at any pace , any distance , whenever you can catch time away from your work or other duties , " Fenton says . " But all the scientific research proves rather conclusively that you can attain a much higher level of conditioning and well-being if you actually train to improve your aerobic fitness . Every tenth of a liter of aerobic capacity that you can cram into your body by walking farther and faster is going to increase your health and longevity as well . <h> Quick Steps <p> Fenton believes one thing that separates fitness walkers from ordinary walkers ( other than walking tall and bending the arms ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , but quicker steps , " he says . " It 's natural for your stride to lengthen a bit as you speed up , but frequency is important , too , although it 's overlooked by most walkers . " <p> Fenton preaches consistency over speed . " In seeking consistency , " he says , " it is most important that walking becomes a regular habit , not something you do on the weekends or when the weather is good . The fitness walker must make a positive commitment to exercise a certain number of days a week over a specific distance or length of time , even if some of those days show fairly modest efforts . " He suggests that easier days can be used when other duties demand your time . <p> Once you have become accustomed to a regular pattern of workouts ( as opposed to merely walks ) , you can achieve a higher level of physical fitness not merely by increasing the distance of the workouts but also by varying the distance from day to day . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , " Fenton says . " Perhaps once or twice a week , set aside time for slightly longer walks , or much longer ones on the weekends . " If your goal is losing weight , the more you walk the more calories you 'll burn . Walking , like running , burns approximately 100 calories for every mile covered . <p> One way to ensure success is to build some competition into your fastest walks . Or train for a " running " race where you start in the back and do n't worry about your time compared to those around you . " You do n't need to try to win , " Fenton advises . " Merely being part of a racing environment with large numbers of other fitness-minded individuals will guarantee that you get a good workout . " Most runners consider walkers their equals , regardless of when they cross the finish line . <p> Adapted from Hal Higdon 's How To Train , available from him at Books by Hal Higdon.

Following the popularity of the Goofy Challenge , which involved running the half marathon on Saturday and the full marathon on Sunday , Disney created an even tougher challenge for the toughest of tough marathoners . Run a 5-K on Thursday . Run a 10-K on Friday . Run a Half Marathon on Saturday . Run a full Marathon on Sunday . As for Monday , I hope those of you walking around with a half dozen medals hung around your necks scheduled a massage before heading home or to the Theme Parks for one more ride on the Tower of Terror . <p> Can those of you signed up for Dopey handle the high level of training necessary to your survival during four races on four successive days ? The marathon , any marathon , is an unforgiving foe . You ca n't cheat on the exam . There is no crib sheet you can strap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need to do the training . Fast forward--or perhaps more accurately , fast downward--to the chart for my Dopey Challenge Program below . Look at Week 1 , specifically the Sunday run scheduled for Week 1 . Holy Mickey : 13 miles ! Seems like a lot for the first week of any training program . Maybe so , but unless your attitude is " ho hum , " I hope you have not sent Disney your $495 entry fee . Do n't kid yourself . Dopey is not for first-timers . It is a hard-core and in-your-face challenge . Only experienced runners need apply , meaning : those of you with more than a few half marathons and full marathons under your belts , not to mention a few 5-K 's and 10-K 's too . <p> Assuming you are not quivering with fright , let me point out a few unique aspects of the Hal Higdon Dopey Challenge Program . In creating Dopey , I used as my base Novice 2 , one of my gentler marathon training programs . Compare the first two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will see they offer mirror images . That is partly because I do not want you to overtrain for Dopey . I do not want you to mindlessly pile on extra miles , which you might do if I chose as my base one of my Intermediate or Advanced programs . The key to Dopey is in the weekend runs , not merely increasing miles weekly , but gradually introducing you to running on more consecutive days than you might otherwise run : two days , three days , inevitably four consecutive days . <p> After a gradual mileage build-up , the fun begins in Week 9 , where I ask you to run on Friday , Saturday and Sunday . The mileage is not that great yet : 2 , 7 and 17 mile runs on those days . But the Dopey pattern has been established . Every other weekend , I will ask you to do consecutive-day training . Weeks 11 and 13 feature three consecutive days of running . The climactic Week 15 ( always the toughest week in my programs ) features four consecutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of racing you will encounter after three weeks of taper leading into the Walt Disney Marathon . <p> That 's the Big Picture . Following are some further directions for those accepting the Dopey Challenge : <p> Long runs : The key to the program is the long runs on weekends , which build from 13 miles in Week 1 to 20 miles in the climactic Week 15 . ( After that , you taper to get ready for the marathon . ) You can skip an occasional workout , or juggle the schedule depending on other commitments , but do not cheat on the long runs . Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer , every other week is a " stepback " week with the long run on Saturday and cross-training on Sunday , a reduction in run mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward . Rest is an important component of any training program . <p> Run slow : For experienced marathoners , I recommend that they do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is not your first marathon . You should have a good idea of how fast you can run a marathon based on your current fitness level . As for your ability to run that time after races on three prior days , well , we 're all in unfamiliar territory . So do n't worry . Simply do your long runs and maybe the runs before those long runs at a comfortable pace , one that allows you to converse with your training partners , at least during the beginning of the run . Toward the end , you may need to abandon conversation and concentrate on the act of putting one foot in front of the other to finish . However , if you find yourself finishing at a pace significantly slower than your pace in the first few miles , you probably need to start much slower , or include regular walking breaks . It 's better to run too slow during these long runs , than too fast . The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance ; how fast you cover it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfectly acceptable strategy in trying to finish a marathon . It works during training runs too . While some coaches recommend walking 1 minute out of every 10 , or even alternating running and walking as frequently as every 30 seconds , I teach runners to walk when they come to an aid station . This serves a double function : 1 ) you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running , and 2 ) since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations , you 'll be less likely to block those behind . It 's a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well . You will lose less time walking than you think . I once ran a 2:29 marathon , walking through every aid station . My son Kevin ran 2:18 and qualified for the Olympic Trials employing a similar strategy . And Bill Rodgers took four brief breaks ( tying a shoe on one of them ) while running 2:09 and winning the 1975 Boston Marathon . Walking gives your body a chance to rest , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best to walk when you want to , not when your ( fatigued ) body forces you too . <p> Cross-training : Alternate Sundays in this training program are devoted to cross-training . What is cross-training ? It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting ( usually ) after your long run . The best cross-training exercises are swimming , cycling or even walking . What about sports such as tennis or basketball ? Activities requiring sideways movements are not always a good choice . Particularly as the mileage builds up toward the end of the program , you raise your risk of injury if you choose to play a sport that requires sudden stopping and starting . One tip : You do n't have to cross-train the same each weekend . And you could even combine two or more exercises : walking and easy jogging , or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a health club . Cross-training for an hour on Sunday will help you recover after your Saturday long runs . <p> Strength Training : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength training to my marathon program ? " If you have to ask , you probably should not . I strongly endorse strength training for maximum fitness and longevity , but if you never have pumped iron before , now is probably not the time to start . Wait until after you have the bling hung around your neck . For gym rats , continue to work out , but you might want to cut back on the weights as the long run mileage moves into the double digits . Tuesdays and Thursdays work well for strength training--after you finish your runs on those days . Obviously during weeks where you do three or four consecutive runs , you may need to bypass the weight room . <p> Midweek training : Training on Tuesdays and Thursdays should be done at a comparatively easy pace . As the weekend mileage builds , the Tuesday and Thursday mileage also builds from 3 to 5 miles . Midweek workouts on Wednesdays build from 5 to 8 miles , many of them done at race pace . ( I call these my Sorta-Long Runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursdays . The program is built on the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start . That sounds logical , does n't it ? Believe me--as tens of thousands of marathoners using this schedule have proved--it works . How fast is " comfortably easy ? " That might vary from day to day . On Tuesday after a day 's rest , you might find yourself running faster than race pace . On Thursday after two days of running , your pace might be significantly slower . <p> Race Pace : What do I mean by " race pace ? " It 's a frequently asked question , so let me explain . Race pace is the pace you plan to run in the race you 're training for . If you 're training for a 4:00 marathon , your average pace per mile is 9:09 . So you would run that same pace when asked to run race pace ( sometimes stated simply as " pace " on the training charts ) . If you were training for a 5-K or 10-K , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run in those races . Sometimes in prescribing speedwork , I define paces for different workouts as 5-K pace or 10-K pace . One final comment about Race Pace . You are training for four separate race distances . So which race do you use for measuring pace . I would say , all four . Feel free to innovate . Listening to your body always works . <p> Rest : Despite my listing it at the end , rest is an important component of this or any training program . Scientists will tell you that it is during the rest period ( the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise ) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger . Coaches also will tell you that you ca n't run hard unless you are well rested . And it is hard running ( such as the long runs ) that allows you to improve . If you 're constantly fatigued , you will fail to reach your potential . This is why I include two days of rest each week for Dopey runners . If you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late night at the office or a sick child--do so . The secret to success in any training program is consistency , so as long as you are consistent with your training during the full 18 weeks of the program , you can afford--and may benefit from--extra rest . <p> Consecutive Days : You probably already have figured this out , but the key to this Dopey program is within Weeks 9 , 11 , 13 and 15 , when I ask you to run three and eventually four consecutive days . That is the pattern you will face when you arrive at the Magic Kingdom ; that is the pattern you need to use in your training . The chart for Dopey training is below .

By going at it gradually , you should be able to improve your walking ability without discomfort or risk of injury . <p> Wednesday : Rest or walk . Hard/easy is a common pattern among runners .

You need to make sure your muscles are well rested so you can train hard on the weekends . Depending on your own particular schedule , you may want to juggle workouts , substituting one day 's workout for another . It does n't matter much on which day you do specific workouts as long as you are consistent with your training . <p> Saturday : The Saturday workouts are stated in miles rather than minutes . This is to give you an idea of how much distance you are able to cover over a specific period of time as well as to give you confidence in your ability to walk 5 kilometers .

In between , I ran ten during the space of one year so I could run my 100th marathon at the 100th Boston Marathon in 1996 . <h> Stunts to impress <p> While such stunts impress those who have run only a few marathons , I am far from being unique--or being the most obsessive multiple marathoner . Midway through my 7-7-70 quest , I ran the Heart of America Marathon in Columbia , Missouri on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered a runner who was doing 100 marathons in two years . He had just arrived in town after running a marathon in Tupelo , Mississippi earlier that Sunday morning ! <p> A survey of those using my forums revealed that many run two or three marathons a year . They succeed by maintaining a training base near 25 miles a week year-round , which allows them to ramp up to 50 weekly miles during any marathon build-up . My training programs run 18 weeks . Do the arithmetic ( 3 x 18 = 54 ) , and it does become possible to squeeze three marathons into a single year . <p> But there are probably more efficient ways to run Multiple Marathons , particularly since you do n't have to back all the way down to the first ( low-mileage ) week each time you set your sights on a marathon . After a reasonable amount of time for rest , you can begin in the middle . One approach is to follow my Senior Marathon Training Program , " senior " in that it is designed for experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days of running a week , but with workout runs longer than in most of my other schedules . <p> Actually , experienced runners know that after several weeks recovery , an 8- or 12-week build-up probably suffices , except for those seeking peak performance . An intelligent option is running some marathons at less-than-best effort just to enjoy the experience . A 26-mile run thus becomes an extra-long workout . <h> Training strategies <p> To run multiple marathons without raising your risk of injury , you do need to know what you 're doing . Here are some training strategies : <p> 1 . Plan your schedule early . Select multiple marathons well in advance . That allows you to plan your training around more than one race . <p> 2 . Do n't ignore rest . Your body needs time to rebound before training hard again . Muscle soreness ends after a few days , but full recovery may take three to four weeks . <p> 3 . Try shorter events . Races at 5-K , 10-K and half-marathon distances still are worthy of your attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't run all marathons hard . Enter some seeking less than peak performance . This makes most sense if running back-to-back marathons with less than eight weeks between . <p> 5 . Take time to prepare . When serious about a marathon , prepare very carefully . Use the full 18 weeks in my marathon training programs to ensure a Personal Best . <p> Here are some training strategies for runners running marathons two , four , six and eight weeks apart . If you 're running marathons with an odd number of weeks between ( three , five , seven , etc. ) , simply repeat one of the middle weeks . I have interactive versions of my multiple marathon programs for each of those weeks-between . ( Click on one of the TrainingPeaks links at the top or bottom of this screen . ) For a slightly different approach on the subject , see the chapter on " Multiple Marathons " ( pp. 77-84 ) in Hal Higdon 's How To Train . And while you 're surfing around my Web site , check also my Post Marathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks between <p> With only two weeks between marathons , you really do n't have time to train . Focus instead on recovery . Maintain the same high-carbohydrate diet between marathons one and two that you ( hopefully ) did before the first . Schedule a massage 48 to 72 hours after the first marathon and ( if your budget permits ) a second massage before the second . You may want to do as much walking as running in the workouts below . The 6-mile run suggested for Saturday very definitely should not be fast . And what do I mean when I prescribe " 1-2 hours " on Sunday ? To be quite honest , I 'm not quite sure . Let your body dictate whether you want to spend that time running , walking , cross-training or just lying in front of a TV set . Regardless of what you do during these two weeks , you are not going to improve your fitness . So concentrate instead on easy activities that will promote your recovery . <p> Week <p> Mon <p> Tue <p> We 'd <p> Thu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rest <p> 2 m run <p> 3 m run <p> Rest <p> 6 m run <p> 1-2 hours <p> 1 <p> Rest <p> 4 m run <p> 2 m run <p> Rest <p> Rest <p> 2 m run <p> Marathon <h> Four weeks between <p> With four weeks between marathons , you have the opportunity to at least do some training . It will be more for your mind than for your body . Physically , your body should still be in recovery mode , but I know from my own multiple marathon experiences that successful running is as much psychological as it is physical . So do some training ; just do n't overdo it . In the four-week training program below , the first week should be entirely for recovery ( and do n't overlook what I said above about the benefits of massage ) . The fourth week is your taper week . The two weeks between provide time to do some training . As above , I have prescribed the Sunday workouts in hours rather than miles to allow you some flexibility . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to doing speedwork , you might want to pick Tuesdays and/or Thursdays to do some fast running . But please do n't overdo it . What kind of speedwork ?

Thus the conundrum : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I ca n't answer that question . You will need to read your own body signs . I am inclined to suggest that you continue to think " recovery " the first and second weeks after the first marathon ( Weeks 6 and 5 ) and think " taper " two weeks before the next marathon ( Weeks 2 and 1 ) . That allows you two weeks of what might be described as serious training . That could include some speedwork as suggested to the Four-Weeks-Between group above . But be very cautious about pressing too hard on the accelerator pedal . And do n't be afraid to program in more rest days , if necessary .

@@102096106 @6296106/ <h> Training <h> Beginning Runner 's Guide - Where to Run <p> One of runnings appeals is its simplicity . You do n't  need membership in an expensive club . You do n't  need a playing field . Step out your front door , and you 've found your first running arena . Most runners begin by running around the block or down the street in their neighborhoods . Only later , do they seek varied locations for their running activities . Here are some points to consider about where to run : <p> + ROAD RUNNING : Most runners train and race on the roads , thus the name for the sport of road running . When possible , run in low-traffic areas . Dodging cars is not fun . Run facing traffic so you can see cars coming at you in your lane and step aside if necessary . If you have a choice , asphalt is " softer " than concrete . Flat roads are easier to run on than those with a high crown . <p> + PATHS : Many cities have parks with paths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant places to run , because you can avoid automotive traffic , plus its fun ( and safer ) to run in areas frequented by other runners . Plan to do at least some of your running on popular paths . The best ones feature : toilets , water fountains and even mile markers . <p> + CROSS-COUNTRY : Once you develop an ability to run 3-4 miles non-stop , consider heading into the woods . Uneven ground may seem difficult at first , but running on soft ( rather than hard ) surfaces can help prevent injuries . The ideal running surface is smooth grass , such as on a golf course , but golfers often object to runners invading their turf . <p> In an ideal world , we should be able to run anywhere at any time without fear of being assaulted .

Would you like to get in really great shape ? Improve your speed ? Better past performances ? Learn how to compete ? Maybe you 'd like to run in The LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon , or another marathon , later this fall with an aim to improving your P.R . <p> If so , here is an effective 12-week intermediate training program for you . It was designed originally for Chicago runners to fill the 12-week gap between The LaSalle Bank Shamrock Shuffle in March and the start of the Chicago Area Runners Association ( CARA ) Marathon Training Class in June . That highly popular class uses my 18-week program to get runners ready to run The LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon in October . <p> But you do n't need to live in Chicago to take advantage of this Spring Training program , which can become an " Off-Season Program " other times of the year . Use it now to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will permit you later to train for a marathon peak performance with less stress and more success . Indeed , the best time to do speed training is during the spring , when the weather is warming and you can get to the track or into the woods . Speed training also works best at a time of year when you 're not trying to build your mileage for a marathon . <h> Less stress , more success <p> The following schedule is for Intermediate runners : individuals who want to improve their performances . What defines an Intermediate runner ? You should be running five to six times a week , averaging 15-25 miles a week . You probably also should have run at least a half dozen or more races at distances between the 5-K and the Half-Marathon . With that as background , you now need a somewhat more sophisticated schedule so as to improve . If that does n't sound like you , you might be more comfortable using one of my programs designed for Novice or Advanced runners . <p> The program lasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can begin the program in Week 1 anyway , even though you may not complete the full 12 weeks . A somewhat more risky alternative is to skip the first several weeks and end your Spring Training at Week 12 . If you are interested in an Virtual Training program where I send you daily emails describing each workout and offering training tips , click on the logo to the right . <p> Easy Runs : The runs of 3-6 miles on Mondays , Tuesdays and Thursdays are designed to be done at a comfortable pace . If you ca n't carry on a conversation with your training partner , you 're running too fast . For those who use heart monitors to measure their level of exertion , you would be running between 65 to 75 percent of maximum . In other words , run easy . If you want to run with others , be cautious that they do n't push you to run faster than planned . On a few occasions ( indicated in the weekly schedules ) , I may suggest you do a Wednesday workout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part of your training , a very important part . Friday is always a day of rest in the Intermediate program . Be realistic about your fatigue level and do n't feel guilty if you decide to take an additional day off . ( Best bet for an extra rest day is Monday , and I 've also programmed in additional days of rest before races . ) <p> Hill Training : Hill training is scheduled for the first six weeks of this program on Wednesdays . The speed benefits of hill training are similar to those for interval training on the track ( below ) , but in the early spring it may be easier doing this workout on the road than doing repeat 200s or 400s at the track . Select a hill about a quarter-mile long , but do n't worry about pitch or the exact distance . Run up hard , as hard as you might doing a 200 or 400 repeat . Then turn and jog back down , repeating the uphill sprints until finished . Be sure to warm up by jogging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance after . <p> Interval Training : Beginning with the seventh week of the program , move from your hill course to the track and begin doing interval training : 200s one week , 400s the next . Warm up before and cool down afterwards--and do n't forget to stretch . Run the 200s at about the pace you would run in an 800-meter race ; run the 400s at about the pace you would run in a 1,500-meter or mile race . Walk or jog 200 to 400 meters between each repeat . If you do n't have access to a track , you can do these workouts on a golf course fairway or straight-away . <p> Tempo Runs : A tempo run is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near race pace . ( Notice I said " near " race pace . You do n't want to go faster than your 5-K or 10-K race pace . ) In this program , tempo runs are scheduled for Saturdays , alternating with fartlek runs . A tempo run of 30 to 40 minutes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerate over a period of 10-20 minutes , building to peak speed , then decelerate gradually to finish with 5-10 minutes easy running . The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout and only for a few minutes . You can do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , on trails or even on a track . In this program , tempo runs alternate with fartlek on Saturdays . <p> Fartlek : Fartlek was developed in Sweden ; the word means " speedplay . " Fartlek is similar to tempo training in that it features a continuous run that starts and ends slow with fast running in the middle . The difference is that fartlek includes multiple changes of pace over varied ( mostly short ) distances . Run as you feel . Be creative . Pick out a tree and run hard to it . Ease back into a jog until rested , then pick out another landmark for your next sprint . Hard , easy , hard , easy . You define the tempo by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training that can either be your toughest or easiest workout of the week . There 's an entire chapter on fartlek in my book , Run Fast . <p> Warm-Up : Warming up is vital , not only before races , but before speed workouts . My usual warm-up is to jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy strides ( 100 meters at near race pace ) . And I usually cool down afterwards by doing half of the warm-up . <p> Stretch &amp; Strengthen : Stretching is an important part of the warm-up on days when you plan to run fast ( Wednesdays and Saturdays ) . Strength training is important too , but is best done on days when you do n't plan to run so fast ( Mondays and Thursdays ) . Push-ups , pull-ups , use of free weights or working out with various machines at a health club can help build the kind of strength that will improve your speed . Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more information , check the screens elsewhere on this Web site for Stretch &amp; Strengthen . <p> Cross-Training : Not everybody can tolerate running six days a week . Run more than three or four days , and they get injured . If this is you , consider substituting cross-training for some of your easier running . Although I have not included cross-training as a regular part of this schedule , good days to cross-train would be Mondays or Thursdays when you otherwise might do a 3-mile run . Bike , swim , walk--whatever works best for you . Warning : Do n't train too hard on cross-training days . Train only as hard as you would during a running workout . <p> Long Runs : As an Intermediate runner , you probably already do a long run on the weekends . In my marathon training program , depending on level , runners start with long runs of 6-10 miles and finish a dozen weeks later with one or more long runs of 20 miles . No similar progression is planned for this schedule . Just get out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what the schedule dictates . And run at an easy pace . If you run too far and too fast , it will compromise the other parts of the program . You ca n't do effective speedwork if you are fatigued from too much mileage . Mileages are kept relatively low in this program for this purpose . <p> Races : In most of my training programs , I do not prescribe races . But a certain amount of racing is good , because it forces you to run at peak speed and provides feedback related to your fitness level . Racing works best away from the marathon mileage buildup , however , which is one reason I have scheduled three races in the second half of this program . I chose 5-K , 8-K and 10-K as the distances , spacing them three weeks apart , but feel free to adjust your racing schedule depending on the dates and distances in your local area . An extra day of rest before the race may help you perform better ; do n't be afraid to rest the day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's hard work . It takes discipline . But it 's also a lot of fun .

There is also more training at marathon pace ( usually Saturdays , the day before Sunday long runs ) . Please note that we do not recommend doing your long runs at marathon pace . That adds too much stress , particularly when coupled with the speed sessions scheduled for Thursdays . If you overtrain , your performance will suffer . <p> Speed sessions consist of hill repeats , interval training and tempo runs in various combinations . Explanations on how to perform each workout follow below and in the daily email messages for those signing up for an Interactive program through TrainingPeaks . Admittedly , not everybody wants to do speedwork , or enjoys going to the track . If that is your philosophy , you are better off following one of my intermediate programs . The advanced schedules ( 1 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those willing to take it to the limit . Only a small percentage of today 's runners classify themselves as " Advanced " or want to follow this demanding a schedule . We track how many runners sign up for my various schedules , and fewer than 10 percent choose Advanced . If that is you , welcome aboard . <p> I might add that you can be male or female , a 2:30 marathoner or a 4:30 marathoner and still train as an advanced runner . Speed does n't count . Sex does n't count . Age does n't count . What decides whether or not you are an advanced runner is your background and your familiarity with this type of training plus your attitude . If this is your first marathon , regardless of your talent , consider following the Novice 2 program and simply set as your goal finishing , rather than finishing fast . See you a couple of marathons from now . If you have n't done the various types of speedwork included in this program , it 's also Bye Bye . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have not done it before . For an introduction to speedwork , check the shorter-distance training schedules on this Web site . All of my training programs are available in interactive versions ( more tips , more instructions ) , which you can get from TrainingPeaks . <p> Here is an explanation of the type of training you will encounter in the Advanced 1 program : Long Runs : The key to all my marathon programs are the long runs on weekends , which build from 10 miles in the first week ( Week 1 ) to a maximum of 20 miles , done three times ( Weeks 11 , 13 and 15 ) . Although some experienced runners do train longer , I see no advantage in doing 23 , 26 or even 31 mile runs . ( I 've tried that myself in the past , and it just wore me out . ) Save your energy and concentrate on quality runs the rest of the week . Consistency is most important . You can skip an occasional workout , or juggle the schedule depending on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer , every third week is a " stepback " week , where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward . Rest is an important component of any training program . Run Slow : I know this is tough for you . You want to go out on those long runs and BLAST ! Do n't ! Normally I recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 or more seconds per mile slower than their marathon pace . This is very important , particularly for advanced runners who do speedwork during the week . Listen to what the Coach is about to tell you ! The physiological benefits kick in around 90-120 minutes , no matter how fast you run . You 'll burn a few calories and trigger glycogen regenesis , teaching your muscles to conserve fuel . Running too fast defeats this purpose and may unnecessarily tear down your muscles , compromising not only your midweek workouts , but the following week 's long run . Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of days during the rest of the week , when you can run fast . So simply do your long runs at a comfortable pace , one that allows you to converse with your training partners , at least during the beginning of the run . Which brings up my next point . 3/1 Training : Toward the end of the run , if you 're still feeling fresh , you may want to pick up the pace and finish somewhat faster . This will convert your long run into what I call a 3/1 Run . That means you run the first three-fourths of your long run ( say the first 12 miles of a 16-miler ) at an easy pace , then do the final one-fourth ( 4 miles of a 16-miler ) at a somewhat faster pace--though still not race pace . This 3/1 strategy is advised for only the most experienced runners--viewers like you--and I do n't recommend you do it more than once out of every three weekends . In other words : first weekend , easy run ; second weekend , 3/1 Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My philosophy is that it 's better to run too slow during long runs , than too fast . The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance ; how fast you cover it does n't matter . Note : You will only be able to accelerate into a 3/1 Run if you run in control during the " 3 " portion of the workout . In other words : slow . Hill Training : Hill training in this program is scheduled for every third Thursday . I alternate hill training with tempo runs and interval training mainly to provide you with some variety in your training . If you want to juggle the workouts for your convenience , feel free to do so . Even though your marathon of choice has a flat course ( i.e. , Chicago ) , hill repeats can be an important part of your training , because running hills will strengthen your quadriceps muscles . Also , there is less impact running up a hill than running fast on the flat . If your planned marathon is on a hilly course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill workouts I 've included in the Advanced 1 schedule . Best choice would be to substitute hill repeats for some , if not all , of the interval workouts . And/or do your tempo runs over a hilly course--if one is available to you . The speed benefits of hill training are similar to those for interval training on the track ( below ) . Olympic champion Frank Shorter refers to hill training " as interval training in disguise . " Select a hill about a quarter-mile long , but do n't worry about the pitch or the exact distance . Run up hard , as hard as you might during a 400 track repeat . Then turn and jog back down , repeating the uphill sprints until finished . If you plan to run a marathon with more downhill than uphill running ( such as Boston ) , do some of your hill repeats down as well as up . This will condition your muscles to absorb the shock of downhill running . But do n't overdo it , otherwise you 'll increase your risk of injury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I generally do two up to one down ( 2/1 ) , but you might want to begin with 3/1 as your ratio . <p> Interval Training : In training for a marathon , long repeats ( 800 , 1600 , or even longer ) generally work better than short repeats ( 200 , 400 ) . I 've prescribed 800 repeats for this program , also done every third week . Run an 800 at faster-than-marathon pace , rest by jogging and/or walking 400 , then start again . Further instructions are included in the Interactive emails , but you might want to consider running these like " Yasso Repeats . " Regular readers of Runner 's World are familiar with what I mean . Bart Yasso is Promotions Director for the magazine . Bart suggests that you run your 800 repeats using the same numbers as your marathon time . In other words , if you run a 3-hour marathon , you do the 800s in 3 minutes . A 3:10 marathoner does 3:10 repeats ; 3:20 marathoner , 3:20 repeats , etc . It seems silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can run 10 x 800 in 3:10 , there is no guarantee that you can run 3:10 in the marathon . It works the other way around : If you can run a 3:10 marathon , you probably can do that workout without straining too much . <p> Tempo Runs : A tempo run is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near 10-K race pace . Notice I said " near " 10-K race pace . Coach Jack Daniels defines the peak pace for tempo runs at the pace you might run if racing flat-out for about an hour . That 's fairly fast , particularly if the tempo run is 45 minutes long , but you 're only going to be near peak pace for 3-6 minutes in the middle of the run . In the Advanced 1 programs , tempo runs also are scheduled for Thursdays . Here 's how to do this workout . A tempo run of 30 to 40 minutes would begin with 10-15 minutes easy running , build to peak speed during the next 10-20 minutes , then finish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout and only for those few minutes mentioned above . You can do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , on trails or even on a track . Tempo runs should not be punishing . You should finish refreshed , which will happen if you do n't push the pace too hard or too long . It helps also to pick a scenic course for your tempo runs . You can do your tempo run with another runner , but usually it works better to run solo . There 's less danger of going too slow or ( more the problem ) too fast if you choose his pace , not yours . <p> Cross-Training : There 's no cross-training scheduled for advanced runners . Sorry , but we do n't have a place for it . If you feel you need to ( or like to ) cross train as a means of avoiding injuries ( or as a variation from running ) , you can substitute an aerobic workout ( swimming , cycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mondays or Wednesdays . Go for about the same length of time it would take you to do the running workout scheduled for that day . For instance , if you would normally take a half hour to run an easy four-miler , cross-train for that length of time . Resist the temptation to turn this into a hard workout , which is easy to do because you 'll be using muscles different from those you use running . Cross train at about the same stress level as you would on a running day . Friday is not a good day to cross train . I feel you need this day of rest to prepare yourself for the tough weekend workouts . <p> Race Pace : Most of the Saturday runs are done at race pace . What do I mean by " race pace ? " It 's a frequently asked question on my forums , so let me explain . Race pace is the pace you plan to run in the race you 're training for . If you 're training for a 4:00 marathon , your average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same pace when asked to run race pace in this program ( sometimes stated simply as " Pace " ) . <p> Races : In most of my training programs , I do not prescribe races . I do n't want runners feeling that they are obligated to race on a specific weekend , and at specific distances , because that 's what the schedule says . But a certain amount of racing is good , because it forces you to run at peak speed and provides feedback related to your fitness level . If you know your 10-K time , for instance , you can use one popular formula and multiply that time in minutes by 4.66 and get an estimate of your marathon potential . If you run other distances , you can use various prediction calculators to do the same . My favorite calculator is that offered on McMillanRunning.com . I suggest doing a half marathon in Week 9 to help you assess your fitness , but there is no magic to that distance or that week for racing . As an advanced runner , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit your schedule . <p> Easy Runs : Training on Mondays and Wednesdays should be done mostly at a comparatively easy pace . These are days of semi-rest , nevertheless , as the weekend mileage builds , the weekday mileage also builds . Add up the numbers , and you 'll see that you run only slightly more miles during the week as you do during long runs on the weekends . The program is built on the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start . That sounds logical , does n't it ? Believe me--as tens of thousands of marathoners using this schedule have proved--it works . <p> Rest : Despite my listing it at the end , rest is an important component of this or any training program . Scientists will tell you that it is during the rest period ( the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise ) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger . Coaches also instruct that you ca n't run hard unless you are well rested . And it 's the hard running that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will fail to reach your potential . This is why I designate Friday as a day of rest even for Advanced 1 runners . It allows you to gather forces for hard running on Saturdays and Sundays . If you need to take more rest days--because of a cold or a late night at the office or a sick child--do so . And if you 're tired from the weekend , take Monday off as well--or cut the length of your Wednesday run . The secret to success in any training program is consistency , so as long as you are consistent with your training during the full 18 weeks of the program , you can afford--and may benefit from--extra rest . <p> Interactive Training : If you would like more help with your marathon training , sign up for my Virtual Training Bulletin Boards .

@@102096109 @6296109/ <h> Training <h> Strength Training <h> Strength Training <p> RUNNERS NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR SPEED , and one of the best ways to do that is with strength training , so claims Cathy Vasto , a three-time Olympic Trials qualifier from Jacksonville , Florida . " The benefits are amazing , " says Vasto . <p> Look at Vasto , and you would not mistake her for a bodybuilder , yet she has bench-pressed 180 pounds . She uses her strength to compliment her speed . " Strength helps at the end of a race when your form starts deteriorating , " advises Vasto . " The faster you can move your arms at the end , the faster you can move your legs and the higher you can lift your knees , propelling yourself toward the finish line . " <p> Vasto recommends : <p> Go High/Low : If you 're training for a running race , you do n't  want to bulk up . Extra weight will slow you down . To avoid putting on pounds , keep the pounds of the weights you lift low and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the maximum weight you can lift in a set of 12 repetitions . Two sets of 12 work well for most lifts . For maximum benefits , without wasting a lot of time , do your strength training two or three times a week , after you run , not before . <p> Look Good Lifting : Keep your formnot for vanity , but to prevent injury . Think 90-degrees . Most seated lifts work best if your body parts are at right angles : legs straight , feet flat against the floor , trunk erect , chin up , eyes forward . Practice the pelvic tilt where you press your torso back against the chair , or floor , to keep your back from slumping . " Good form works in lifting as much as it does in running , " says Vasto . <p> Breathe Right : The worst mistake you can make while lifting is to hold your breath . That simply tightens the muscles that you want to keep loose . Inhale while you prepare to lift the weight , then exhale while lifting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to breathe is naturally , " says Vasto , " so that you 're not even aware you 're doing it . " <p> Rest by Stretching : When moving from exercise to exercise , do n't  rush and do n't  waste time chit-chatting with friends . Stay focused on your workout by stretching in between . " Its very important while strength training to have a stretching routine , " warns Vasto . " You do n't  want to lose your flexibility , which can happen if you forget to stretch . Eccentric contractions ( which occur when lowering the weights ) actually can tighten the muscles . " Stretching while strength training provides a double dose of conditioning in a minimum of time . <p> Finally , the key to the exercises presented below is to go slow and remain in control . " You 're not trying to see how fast you can get in and out of the weight room , " says Vasto . " You 're trying to win your race on the road . " Vastos six spectacular strength exercises follow . <h> 1 . Bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all bodybuilders , but you can use it to build strength and speed . Lie on your back on a bench ( although you can also use the floor ) . For weight , use a barbell or dumbbells . Keep your back flat , your knees bent . Your palms should be facing forward , your hands should be equal distant and over your shoulders . Lift the bar or dumbbells straight up ( think 90-degrees ) and lower slowly . Do two sets of 12 reps . For an alternate workout without weights , do simple push-ups . ( Strengthens the pectorals , deltoids , triceps and biceps. ) <h> 2 . Rowing <p> Gripping dumbbells , sit on the edge of a bench or firm chair . ( Remember to keep your back straight . ) Hold the dumbbells with your arms extended , palms facing inward against your knees . Raise the dumbbells to just opposite your chest , then return to the starting position . Do two sets of 12 reps . You can also do this exercise while standing , keeping your knees bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another option is to use a single weight gripped in both hands and bring it up to your chest . ( Strengthens the rhomboids. ) <h> 3 . Overhead Pull <p> " This is an easy exercise , " says Vasto . " You can do it with a 16-ounce can of soup , a 5-pound bag of flour , or a water bottle if you do n't  have a dumbbell . The angle multiplies the effect of even light weights . " Take the object and hold it overhead , elbows forward , back straight , knees slightly bent to take the pressure off your back . ( You can also do this exercise while seated . ) Lower the weight behind your head toward the back of your neck , then return to the starting position . Do two sets of 12 reps . ( Strengthens the triceps. ) <h> 4 . The Curl <p> Sit in a chair , feet flat on the floor , stomach in , shoulders back , head up . Your elbows should be against your waist above your hips , your palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 90-degree angles . ) Raise the weights to your shoulders , lowering slowly . Do two sets of 12 reps . This exercise can also be done standing up . ( Strengthens the biceps. ) <h> 5 . The Crunch <p> Although Vasto once did as many as 400 sit-ups a day , she recommends crunches to her clients , because it isolates the abdominal muscles . " The abs are your core of balance , " says Vasto . " They support your upper body , important at the end of a race . " ( A crunch is a sit-up where you stop after raising your shoulders off the floor . ) In the starting position , your back should be flat against the floor , your head up , eyes on the ceiling , hands gripping the back of your neck , your knees relaxed and bent , feet on the floor . Raise only to the point where you feel your stomach muscles tightening , hold then release , returning your back to the floor . Vasto recommends starting with 3 sets of 15 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to tilt sideways , pointing toward your " love handles , " on alternate lifts . ( Strengthens the abdominal muscles , referred to as the " abs . " The love-handle variation strengthens the oblique muscles. ) <h> 6 . The Lunge <p> The five previous exercises strengthen the upper body , often neglected by runners . The lunge will help strengthen several of the muscles of the lower body . Start this exercise with your feet shoulder-width apart . If you use a barbell , it should rest across your shoulders and behind your neck . If using dumbbells , hold them beside your thighs . Take a long step forward with one leg and descend to a low position , then rise . Bring the lead leg back and repeat with the other leg forward . Form is very important in doing this exercise to avoid injury . " Again , think 90-degrees , " warns Vasto . In the forward position , your knee should be over your feet , forming a 90-degree angle . Allowing your forward knee to move too far ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee should not touch the ground . The back lower leg should be parallel to the ground , forming still another 90-degree angle . ( Strengthens many of the muscles of the legs , including the quadriceps , hamstrings , gluteals and erector spinae . ) <p> Strength is important , says Vasto , not only to improve your speed for running races , but it will make you feel good and look good and improve the quality of your life , throughout your lifetime .

You are one-third of the way through my Spring Training program with four weeks behind you and eight weeks ahead . If you have n't already done so , now is the time to evaluate your equipment beginning with your footwear . On this day of relative rest , consider how well you are being served by your running shoes . Are they beginning to wear ? Will you need to replace them soon ? If so , you might want to get a new pair now and gradually break them in on easy days like today , rather than having to suddenly switch to a new pair . Usually it 's a good idea to have several pairs of shoes so that you can alternate shoes from day to day . This allows them to dry out between runs , both prolonging their life and allowing them to " bounce back , " so they provide all the cushioning they were designed to provide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we add another mile to your Tuesday workouts . The two most important factors for improvement , claims Coach Jack Daniels , is consistency and moderation . Consistency means identifying long-range goals to work toward while achieving short-range goals . If you allow enough time for your long-range goals , you can employ moderation . You wo n't need to overtrain . " Doing unbelievably strenuous workouts in order to get in shape fast does n't work , " says Daniels . <p> Wednesday : Today 's midweek speed workout is 5 x Hill . Warm up by jogging a mile or two before running your hill repeats and cool down with about a mile afterwards . Think " 1500/mile " pace while heading up the hill . Most hard workouts should feel about the same , regardless of how long and how fast .

Today 's workout is a 35-minute tempo run . Remember : two or three hard workouts a week are probably all you need . And most of these hard workouts ( including today 's tempo run ) do n't have to be that hard . The secret is to continue at a steady level throughout the year , limiting the amount of time you lose either because of injury or because of mental fatigue . The tempo run is my favorite workout . That 's because I usually do my tempo runs at Indiana Dunes State Park , a beautifully scenic spot where the trails ( both flat and hilly ) are perfect for training .

Because the emphasis in this program is on quality , rather than quantity . Save the long runs for the time of year when you are emphasizing endurance rather than speed , perhaps training for a marathon . This is called " periodization . " Different periods of the year emphasize different training elements . Does this workout seem too easy for you in your advanced state of condition ? You might want to consider picking up the pace a bit in the final few miles just to see how you feel . <p> Running Tips : Running faster than race pace from time to time will help develop your basic speed , which can be translated into better performances .

During the following four weeks , I 'm going to tell you how to build back to a steady state of training . <p> Tuesday : As was the case during the 18-week marathon training program , Tuesday is a day when we do an easy workout . No particular set pace ; just go out and run . How about a two-miler today ? <p> Wednesday : Four miles easy .

It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting ( usually ) after your long run . In the Novice 1 program , we run long on Saturdays and cross-train on Sundays , although it certainly is possible to reverse that order .

@@102096117 @6296117/ <h> Training <h> Post Marathon Training Guide - Advanced Schedule <p> After a week of little-or-no running , your sore muscles should have begun to recover . Your glycogen stores should have begun to rebuild . Psychologically , you should be about ready to begin training again , maybe to begin contemplating another marathon--or a race at some intermediate distance . <p> Notice my qualifying use of the word begin . Only you can tell when you 're ready to start training again . Take another week or two off if you feel you need it--even a month off , if necessary . <p> The following four-week , Post-Marathon Training Guide is a near mirror image of the training you did toward the end of your marathon build-up . It allows you to build your body back to the level it was at before you started your 18-week marathon training program . There is a suggested 5-K ( or 10-K ) race at the end of this short , training tunnel mainly to offer some incentive to continue training and also give you a fix on your fitness level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you just need to start running again . <p> Here is the route to post-marathon recovery if you are an Advanced runner , or followed the Advanced training schedule for the marathon . Follow this schedule below for the next four weeks . ( If you feel you need more than four weeks , repeat some of the weeks before moving to the next level . ) <p> Rest : Rest is an important factor in any form of training--as you probably discovered during the 18-week build-up to the marathon . As during that build-up , rest is indicated for Fridays . Take more days off if you think you need them . You 're trying to ease your way back to a steady state of fitness , not fight your way back . <p> Long Runs : Running long once a week is always a good training strategy . But you do n't  need to do those really long runs of 10-20 miles you were doing during your marathon build-up . During the post-marathon period , I suggest you think minutes , rather than miles . I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but just get out and do something ! I 'm prescribing a broad range of 60-90 minutes , because everyone recovers differently . Use your best judgment concerning what is right for you . And do n't  be afraid to walk at any point during the run , or even for the whole length of the workout . Be easy on yourself . You deserve it . ( Although the schedule above prescribes long runs on Sundays and tempo runs on Saturdays , you can flip-flop workout days for your convenience . ) <p> Tempo Runs : During my 18-week marathon training schedule , the tempo run was a key part of your training . Its a useful workout where you start easy , build in the middle to near your 10-K pace , then finish easy . Tempo runs are usually refreshing , plus they 're an excellent way to improve your anaerobic threshold , which translates into faster race times . But tempo runs do not need to be hard . During this recovery period , I 'm going to suggest that you build only to marathon pace during your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 10 minutes at an easy pace , then during the middle 10 minutes gradually accelerate to marathon pace , then spend the final 10 minutes cooling down . At your level , that should be a relatively easy workout . But it can be a stepping stone to a higher level of fitness as you move past the post-marathon period . For an entire chapter on tempo training , see my book , Run Fast . <p> Repeats : In the 18-week marathon training schedule , repeats were another important form of speedwork , both 800s on the track or road and hill repeats . In this form of training , you run a set distance ( usually between 200 meters and 2 miles ) at a relatively fast rate of speed . Then you rest briefly , walking or jogging . For most repeat workouts , I recommend a rest of 3 to 5 minutes . Then you repeat the fast distance ( sometimes called by track coaches a " rep , " as in repetition . ) For the post-marathon training period , I suggest you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this workout on the road , rather than a track . The first week , run a mile at marathon pace , walk or jog , run another mile same pace , walk or jog , then finish with a final repeat . Marathon pace is n't that fast ; you can do it . But for the second and third weeks , I suggest you run repeat 400s miles at 5-K pace , doing 4 of them in the first week , 6 in the second , 8 in the third . In the fourth week , increase the distance of the repeats to 800 , but do only 3 at 5-K pace . By then your body should be well on its way to recovery and ready ( following a mini-taper ) to cap the four-week recovery schedule with a 10-K or 5-K race . You 'll also find an entire chapter on repeat training in Run Fast . <p> Cross-Training : Unlike Novice and Intermediate runners , I normally do n't  recommend cross-training for Advanced runners . If you 're near the top of your sport , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most specific to that sport : in other words , running . However , I do believe in strength training for all levels of runners . And the best time to do strength training is during a period of the year when you 're not in your marathon mode , which consumes a lot of your energy . So do n't  suddenly run to the gym and begin pumping iron for an hour--otherwise you 'll need to be lifted out of bed with a crane the next day . Instead , begin to phase strength training back into your regular schedule , beginning with light weights and few repeats and increasing both as you move out of the post-marathon period into regular training . Good days for Advanced runners to do strength training would be Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays . If you want to save Friday as a complete day of rest , strength train on Saturdays--after your tempo runs . ( Its always a wise idea to strength train after , rather than before . ) I recommended to both the Novice and Intermediate runners that they consider cross-country skiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're a hard-core Advanced runner , you probably want to do nothing else but run--and I do n't  disagree with that approach , as long as you can stay healthy and remain injury free . <p> Maintenance : The Monday and Wednesday workouts are for maintenance : staying in shape . Ive prescribed slightly different distances on different days partly for variety and partly to offer a slight mileage boost . Do n't  be afraid to speed up or slow down on different days . Too many runners get in the habit of running the same distance at the same pace day after day after day . Learn to be innovative--even if it means deviating somewhat from my schedule . <p> Races : If you 're an Advanced runner , you probably race fairly frequently , even during your marathon build-up as a test of your speed and fitness . You probably do n't  want to return to racing too soon immediately after an all-out marathon . That 's a recipe for injury . I 've suggested a 5-K or 10-K race at the end of the five-week period that includes Zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to racing sooner ? Possibly , depending on your fitness level . I do n't  recommend racing until at least three weeks after the marathon , however . If you want to know how fast you should expect to run based on your marathon finishing time , there is a very good prediction calculator on the Runners World Web site . Or , check the prediction chart in my Marathon : The Ultimate Training Guide . <p> Once you finish this four-week post-marathon training program , you are ready to consider other running possibilities : whether just maintaining your fitness level or training for another race from the 5-K to even an ultramarathon .

You need that too , because you enjoy exercising , even if you 've discovered that three days a week running is more than enough to keep you in shape . <h> Here 's the program <p> Monday : This is always a good day of the week to rest , particularly if you ran long over the weekend . All of the Mondays in the schedule below are designed as days of rest , but if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest . <p> Tuesday : Modifying a term that I use in my other marathon training programs , let 's call this our Sorta-Short Day . You 're still recovering from your weekend long run , so do n't go too far . I suggest that in Weeks 8 , 6 , 4 and 2 , you run 4 miles at your marathon pace--or faster . In other words , run short but at a good speed , and I 'm not going to define what is a good speed . You being an experienced runner should know how fast you want to run , or if you want to run fast at all . In Weeks 7 , 5 , 3 and 1 , run 6 miles but at a comfortable pace , one during which you can converse easily with a training partner if you desire . Or not converse if you 're a Boring Individual . <p> Wednesday : Today 's workout is Stretch &amp; Strengthen ( S&amp;S ) , because that again is a term I 've used frequently in other training programs to designate semi-rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too much . In honesty , I do n't care what you do today as long as it is not running . If you want to run more than three days a week , you should have chosen another program . Cross-training is an option today too : cycling , swimming , even walking . Or some combination of that with work in the gym . <p> Thursday : This is your Sorta-Long Day , balancing the Sorta-Short Day on Tuesdays . The mileage varies from 6 to 8 miles most weeks with a single 10-miler thrown into the middle of the program just to prove you can do it . Running these Sorta-Long Runs at an easy , conversational pace makes the most sense to me . However , if you feel you need some extra fast running , consider converting the 6-miler in Weeks 7 , 5 and 3 into a " 3/1 run , " a term I use in many of my intermediate and advanced training programs . Run the first three-fourths of the run ( 4.5 miles ) at a comfortable pace , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) at an up tempo . You do n't need to sprint in ; just run somewhat faster . <p> Friday : Another Stretch &amp; Strengthen day . Do something similar to the workout prescribed for Wednesdays . This might mean that if you cycled or swam on Wednesday , you might want to walk today or simply spend your time in the gym hopping from machine to machine . I 'm not going to tell you everything to do . You 're a Big Boy--or Big Girl . <p> Saturday : This is your second Rest day . With a long run planned for each weekend , you want to make sure you have plenty of time to rest both before and after . In this schedule , I 've prescribed doing your long runs on Sunday , because that 's a popular day for experienced runners . If you would rather run long today , that 's okay . In fact , feel free to juggle all the workouts to suit your particular lifestyle . And you do n't need to always run the same three days all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , and you 'll be okay . <p> Sunday : Run long . Today you do your Long Run , and you 'll notice that the build-up in this Senior program goes from 12 to 20 miles , not the 6 to 20 miles in my 18-week Novice programs . That 's because you 're an experienced runner . You train regularly 52 weeks of the year and never get out of shape , so doing a 12-miler is no big deal . I 've prescribed that distance for Weeks 8 , 6 , 4 and 2 with longer runs Weeks 7 , 5 and 3 leading up to the marathon in Week 1 . Only one 20-miler ? Do you really want to run more than one ? Do so in the odd-numbered weeks . <h> Here are some additional points to consider <p> Racing : As an experienced runner , you probably enjoy going to the starting line more than two or three times a year .

If you were interested in logging miles in your training diary , you would have selected a different training schedule . <p> Speedwork : I enjoy doing speedwork , and so do a lot of experienced runners . I 'm trying to keep this program simple , so I 'm not going to prescribe tempo runs , hill repeats or interval training as I do in several of my other programs . If you want to do speedwork , choose your own brand of poison . Tuesday would be a good day for this type of training , because I 'd like you going long and sorta-long on the other two days of the week .

" Why the limit ? " the runner asked . She recently had completed one of my novice half marathon programs with 10 its peak long run mileage . But for intermediate and advanced half marathoners , the last long run peaks between 12 and 16 miles . Following this logic , should not some of my marathon programs peak anywhere from 24 to 32 miles ? <p> " Its such a stretch between 20 and 26.2 miles , " worried the runner . " If I want to push my mileage farther , how far should I go ? " <p> " Go no farther , " I warned . I feel strongly that 20 is plenty for all novice and even for most intermediate and advanced marathoners . Yes , runners might achieve a somewhat higher level of fitness by pushing beyond 20 . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile added . I would rather send those following my programs to the starting line undertrained than overtrained . They are much more likely to have a positive experience . <p> That did n't  satisfy my questioner . She wanted a better reason . She wanted to understand the science behind the 20-mile limit . Unfortunately , the science is fuzzy . Its a tough topic to study . Are metric-oriented runners who peak at 30-K ( 18.5 miles ) less prepared than linear runners peaking at 20 or 22 or 24 or even beyond ? My scientific friends generally agree that the benefits of long-run training begin around 16 miles and may continue beyond 20 miles , but I am aware of no studies that prove this , and I 'm not even sure how one might design such an experiment . <p> My proof comes from outside the human performance laboratories , specifically my experience from having coached perhaps a million runners to finish marathons . These were runners who made the jump from 20 to 26.2 without a twitch . The three-week taper is the reason , providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced runners with 5-10 marathons on their resume want to train harder and longer , they can experiment with that approach , but in the meantime , I advise against going too far too soon . <p> We are all different . We all come to this marvelous sport of long distance running with different abilities and different talents and different desires . A confession : During my years of peak training , my longest long runs were 23.2 miles ; my midweek sorta-long runs 15.6 miles . Those distances were dictated partly by availability of convenient courses . <p> Keep in mind also : I was young and foolish , training twice daily , averaging more than 100 miles a week . Runners operating at that mileage level can float through long runs of 20 barely breaking a sweat . Othersthe majority of recreational runnersstretch to achieve mileage levels one-third of that level . I do not want to push them beyond their abilities . More miles should be added to any program only gradually and perhaps with a coach closely observing . <p> Should 20 miles continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my programs .

What defines an Intermediate runner ? You should be running five to six times a week , averaging 15-25 miles weekly training . You probably also should have run a half dozen or more races at distances between the 5-K and the Half-Marathon . With that as background , you now need a somewhat more sophisticated schedule so as to improve . If that does n't sound like you , you might be more comfortable using one of my programs designed for novice or advanced runners . All my interactive training programs where I send you daily emails are available through TrainingPeaks . <p> Below is your training schedule . <p> Runs : The runs of 3-6 miles on Mondays , Tuesdays and Thursdays are designed to be done at a comfortable pace . If you ca n't carry on a conversation with your training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who use heart monitors to measure their level of exertion , you would be running between 65 to 75 percent of maximum . In other words , run easy . If you want to run with others , be cautious that they do n't push you to run faster than planned . <p> Rest : Rest is an important part of your training . Friday is always a day of rest in the Intermediate program . Be realistic about your fatigue level , and do n't feel guilty if you decide to take an additional day off . ( Best bet is Monday . ) Specifically consider scheduling at least one extra rest day during the stepback weeks . <p> Tempo Runs : A tempo run is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near race pace . ( Notice I said " near " race pace . You do n't want to go faster than your 8-K race pace . ) In this program , tempo runs are scheduled for every other Wednesday , alternating with interval training on the track . A tempo run of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running , build to 10-20 minutes near the middle , then 5-10 minutes easy toward the end . The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout and only for a few minutes . You can do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , on trails or even on a track . <p> Speedwork : If you want to race at a fast pace , you need to train at a fast pace . Interval training where you alternate fast running with jogging or walking is a very effective form of speedwork . The training schedule includes interval training featuring 400-meter reps ( repeats ) every other week , alternating with the tempo runs discussed above . Run the 400s at about the pace you would run in a 5-K race . Walk or jog between each repeat . Although the best venue for speedwork of this sort is on a 400-meter track , these workouts can be done on the road or on trails , either by using measured courses or by running hard approximately the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , if you normally run 400 reps in 90 seconds , do fast reps for that length of time and do n't worry about distance . For more information on speed training , see my book , Run Fast . <p> Warm-up : Warming up is important , not only before the race itself , but before your speed workouts above and pace workouts below . Most novice runners do not warm up , except in the race itself . This is okay , because they 're more interested in finishing rather than finishing fast . As an Intermediate runner , you have a slightly different goal , otherwise you would n't be using this program , so warm up before you run fast . My usual warm-up is to jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy strides ( 100 meters at near race pace ) . And I usually cool down afterwards by doing half of the warm-up . <p> Stretch &amp; Strengthen : Also important as part of the warm-up is stretching . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . Strength training is important too : push-ups , pull-ups , use of free weights or working out with various machines at a Health Club . Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions , rather than pumping very heavy iron . Mondays and Thursdays would be good days to combine stretching and strengthening with your easy run , however , you can schedule Stretch &amp; Strength workouts on any day that is convenient for your business and personal schedule . <p> Cross-Training : On the schedule , this is identified simply as " cross . " What form of cross-training works best for runners preparing for an 8-K ? It could be swimming , or cycling , walking , other forms of aerobic training or some combination that could include strength training . And feel free to throw in some jogging as well if you 're feeling good . What cross-training you select depends on your personal preference . But do n't make the mistake of cross-training too vigorously . Cross-training days should be considered easy days that allow you to recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Stepback : Please notice that the mileage is slightly reduced during Weeks 3 and 6 . These are " stepback " weeks in which you relax your training--again slightly--to gather yourself for the next push upward in difficulty . I use stepback weeks in my marathon training programs and find that they provide not only a physical , but also a mental break . <p> Long Runs : As an experienced runner , you probably already do a long run on the weekends anyway . This schedule suggests a slight increase in distance as you get closer to race date : from 4 to 8 miles . Do n't get hung up on running these workouts too fast . Run at a comfortable , conversational pace . <p> Here is your 8-K training program . Feel free to make minor modifications to suit your own particular schedule .

Many are fenced to keep people off the fairways , a necessary precaution for both the privacy of the golfers and the safety of others . But in winter , you are more likely to gain access to courses that might be closed to you at other times of the year .

With trees around , you will be protected from the wind while skiing . Some parks groom the trails and offer rental equipment ; most do not . In my area , I often ski on the open trails of the Dunes National Lakeshore . <p> Nordic Centers : Parks in northern areas of the U.S. where snow is frequent and deep often respond to public demand by establishing Nordic Centers . They groom the trails , packing them and setting tracks . They also rent equipment and often provide instruction . If you want to begin the sport right , go to a Nordic Center .

One advantage in selecting a downhill resort as your vacation destination is the availability of good rooms and restaurants plus a Winter Vacation ambiance . Resorts such as Crystal Mountain , Shanty Creek and Boyne Mountain in Northern Michigan have great Nordic Centers attached with 30 kilometers or more of superbly designed trails . Crested Butte , Winter Park and Copper Mountain in Colorado are resorts that take cross-country skiing seriously . Other resorts such as Big Sky in Montana , Lake Tahoe in California or Mont Ste.

@@102096124 @6296124/ <h> Training <h> Going Downhill <p> The aspect of cross-country skiing that worries most beginners--in fact , keeps them out of the sport--is going downhill . And even when people become skiers , uncertainty over their ability to navigate hilly areas often keeps them off the most scenic trails . With a few simple techniques , however , you can learn to not merely survive downhills , but also to enjoy them . <p> Here is what to do the next time you are at the top of a hill faced with the necessity of getting down it still standing up : <p> Trust the tracks : Analyze the hill . It may be easier to navigate than you think . Nordic trail designers usually know what they 're doing , and they realize skiers possess different levels of ability . At least on the blue trails , there often is a straight run-out into the flat , so even if you do pick up speed on the descent , you can use that speed to carry you over the flat , gradually slowing down before starting to poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill ; now it 's cash-in time . Leave your skis in the tracks and enjoy the ride down . <p> Position yourself properly : Unlike going uphill where you weight the backs of your skis , you want to keep your weight forward going downhill . If not , your skis will slide out from under you , dumping you on your behind . The proper downhill position , thus , is ankles flexed , knees bent , butt back , shoulders forward , hands out in front of you . In fact , one way to get into this flexed-forward position is to reach out with your hands toward the tips of your skis . Make this a conscious movement every time you start downhill . Reaching further forward will lower your profile and cause you to move faster because of decreased wind resistance . But you 'll be less likely to fall in this lowered position , and if you do fall , you 're closer to the ground . You 'll kiss the snow , not smack it . <p> Learn the tricks of slowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since lowering your profile decreases wind resistance , standing more upright and catching the wind will slow you . ( Be sure to maintain your forward lean , however . ) You can also shave some of your speed by dragging your poles . Since the snow often is slower outside the tracks , moving one or both skis into this softer slow will help you slow down . To really put on the brakes , you can place your poles between your legs and sit on them , digging them into the snow . They 'll bend , but should n't break . Before doing this , however , you should learn how to snowplow ( below ) . <p> Snowplow : This is the first technique that instructors teach beginning downhill skiers . Snowplowing is the reverse of the herring-bone that got you up the hill . Instead of separating the tips of the skis , you point them together . Your tails draw apart , forming a reverse " V , " or snowplow . The farther apart you push them , the slower you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of the snowplowing skis . Unfortunately , the skinny skis employed by cross-country skiers offer less drag than wider downhill skis , but you can still slow your speed using this basic technique . Another variation is to use a half-snowplow with one ski , keeping the other ski in the track . <p> Bailing out : Alas , some hills are either so steep or so slick , even the most practiced skiers need to take defensive action . This particularly may be true if the trail curves left or right with trees on side . ( Turning is a technique we 'll discuss next . ) Falling is one way to come to a stop . In a controlled fall , simply crouch and let your skis slide out from in front of you , letting your poles drag behind so you do n't run over them . Then get up and figure out how you 're going to complete the rest of your descent . For more on how to bail out , see : Stopping . <p> Chickening Out : Do n't be embarrassed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the American Birkebeiner , the 55-K ski race that attracts only the most seasoned skiers , they even have side trails beside some of the steeper descents . This allows competitors to take off their skis and walk down . Before doing that , however , you may be able to sidestep your way down the hill . This is the reverse of the sidestep described in Going Uphill . Place your skis perpendicular to the slope , plant your uphill pole firmly into the snow , and lower your downhill ski to a point lower on the slope . Plant your downhill pole for support and lower the uphill ski to a point next to the downhill one , then repeat . Maintaining your weight over your skis is very important if you do n't want to slide down the hill . If you decide to remove your skis and hike down the hill , please be considerate and move to the side of the trail so you do n't ruin the tracks for those who follow . <p> Although most cross-country trails are marked to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this relates to relative difficulty within each specific Nordic center , not as compared to other Nordic centers . A green trail at one center might be a blue or black at another--and vice versa . Similarly , snow conditions can affect trail difficulty . Soft snow may make a blue or black trail easier to ski ; ice may convert even a green trail into one advanced skiers may avoid . Learn the techniques of going downhill , skiing will become easier and more enjoyable for you . 
@@102096125 @6296125/ <h> Training <h> Half Marathon Training Guide - Intermediate Program <p> THE SCHEDULE BELOW IS FOR EXPERIENCED RUNNERS : individuals who have left their Novice roots behind and who want to improve their performances . You should be capable of running 30 to 60 minutes a day , five to seven days a week , have competed in at least a few 5-K and 10-K races , if not a marathon , and at least be willing to consider the possibility that some speedwork might help you improve . If that sounds like too much training , and this is your first half marathon , you might be more comfortable training using the Novice 1 or 2 Program . <p> The terms used in the training schedule are somewhat obvious , but let me explain what I mean anyway . Further information and explanations are included in my interactive training programs available through TrainingPeaks , where I send you daily emails telling you what to run and how to train . <p> Easy Runs : The runs on Tuesdays and Thursdays and sometimes Saturdays are designed to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast you run these workouts . Run easy ! If you 're training with a friend , the two of you should be able to hold a conversation . If you ca n't do that , you 're running too fast . ( For those wearing heart rate monitors , your target zone should be between 65 and 75 percent of your maximum pulse rate . ) <p> Distance : The training schedule dictates workouts at distances , from 3 to 12 miles . Do n't worry about running precisely those distances , but you should come close . Pick a course through the neighborhood , or in some scenic area where you think you might enjoy running . Then measure the course either by car or bicycle or GPS watch . In deciding where to train , talk to other runners . They probably can point you to some accurately measured courses for your workouts . <p> Stretch &amp; Strength : Mondays and Thursdays are days on which I advise you to spend extra time stretching--and do some strength training too . Monday is a rest day and Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdo it . If you want to stay away from the gym so that Monday becomes a complete day of rest , switch some of your stretching and strengthening to Tuesday or another day of the week . It 's wise to stretch every day , particularly after you finish your run . And do n't forget to stretch while warming up for your hard runs on Wednesdays . I ca n't emphasize this strongly enough . Strength training could consist of push-ups , pull-ups , use of free weights or working out with various machines at a health club . Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions , rather than pumping very heavy iron . <p> Rest : Rest is as important a part of your training as the runs . You will be able to run the long runs on the weekend better--and limit your risk of injury--if you rest before , and rest after . Be realistic about your fatigue level--particularly in the closing weeks of the program--and do n't be afraid to take an extra day off now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to finish a Half Marathon is the long run , progressively increasing in distance each weekend . Over a period of 11 weeks , your longest run will increase from 5 to 12 miles . And in the final week , you get to run 13.1 miles in the race itself . The schedule below suggests doing your long runs on Sundays . You can do them Saturdays , if more convenient , but it is easier to do a long run the day after a pace run , than vice versa . <p> Walking : Walking is an excellent exercise that a lot of runners overlook in their training . I do n't specify walking breaks , but feel free to walk during your running workouts any time you feel tired or need to shift gears . In coaching marathon runners , I usually recommend that they walk through the aid stations to allow them to drink more . <p> Racing : Most experienced runners enjoy racing , so I 've included three races during the training period : one every third week , building from 5-K to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular distances , and there is no necessity to race . Plug in whatever races look interesting from your local area wherever they fit in your schedule . ( See " Juggling , " below . ) You can use races to test your fitness and predict your finishing time in the half marathon and what pace to run that race . <p> Speedwork : If you want to run at a fast pace , you need to train at a fast pace several days a week . This training schedule for intermediate runners alternates interval running with Tempo Runs . ( See below ) . An interval workout usually consists of fast repeats separated by walking or jogging . The program begins with 5 x 400 meters in the first week and adds one more 400 every other week to reach 10 x 400 meters the week before your half marathon . Walk or jog between each repeat . The best place to run 400-meter repeats is on a track , although you can also use an accurately-measured road course . Run the 400s at about your pace for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , see my book , Run Fast . <p> Tempo Runs : This is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near 10-K race pace . A Tempo Run of 30 to 45 minutes would begin with 10-15 minutes easy running , build to 15-20 minutes near the middle , then 5-10 minutes easy toward the end . The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout . Hold that peak only for a minute or two . I consider Tempo Runs to be the " Thinking Runner 's Workout . " A Tempo Run can be as hard or easy as you want to make it , and it has nothing to do with how long ( in time ) you run or how far . In fact , the times prescribed for Tempo Runs serve mainly as rough guidelines . Feel free to improvise . Improvisation is the heart of doing a Tempo Run correctly . <p> Pace : A lot of runners look at my training schedules and ask , " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " race pace , " the pace at which you expect to run the half marathon . Some workouts are designed as pace runs to get you used to running the pace you will run in the race . In Week 10 , for example , I ask you to do " 5 m race pace . " Hopefully that is self-explanatory , but I offer more directions in the weekly screens . You might want to do a short warm-up before starting each of these pace runs . <p> Warm-up : Warming up is important , not only before the race itself , but before your speed workouts and pace runs . Most novice runners do not warm up , except in the race itself . This is okay , because they 're more interested in finishing rather than finishing fast . You have a different goal , otherwise you would n't be using the intermediate program , so warm up before you run fast . My usual warm-up is to jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I usually cool down afterwards by doing half the warm-up distance . <p> Cross-Train : I do n't always prescribe cross-training for intermediate runners . That 's because you 're usually somewhat more focused on pure running than novice runners . But if you find that cross-training helps you prevent injuries , or if you enjoy it , feel free to substitute cross-training on one or more of the easy days . ( In this program , that would be Tuesday or Thursday . ) Notice I used the word " substitute . " Usually it 's not a good idea to add cross-training , particularly hard cross-training , to an existing schedule under the mistaken belief that it will make you stronger . It may actually cause you to overtrain , which can have a negative effect on performance , because you never get a chance to rest . What form of cross-training works best ? It could be swimming , cycling , walking , cross-country skiing , snowshoeing , or even some combination that could include strength training . <p> Juggling : Do n't be afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . If you have an important business meeting on Thursday , do that workout on Wednesday instead . If your family is going to be on vacation one week when you will have more or less time to train , adjust the schedule accordingly . If this means running hard on successive days , so be it . Program in an extra day of rest to compensate . Be consistent with your training , and the overall details wo n't matter . <p> Here is your Intermediate half marathon training program . It is only a guide . Feel free to make minor modifications to suit your own particular schedule . Feel free to make minor modifications to suit your work and family schedule .

This week you 'll actually run 7 miles total and 3 on the weekend . Regardless of the plan for the full week , this is your day for no running . Just stretch and strength . Check the screens on those disciplines for some good stretching and strengthening exercises . <p> Tuesday : A slight increase in distance this week brings you up to 2.5 miles for today 's workout , and you will be asked to run this distance on Tuesday for the next two weeks also . Big gains in fitness can be made with small increases . Your fitness should be improving in this third week of your training . <p> Wednesday : I 'm bumping your cross-training time today up to 35 minutes , a nudge more than you did the last two weeks . Walk , swim , cycle , even jog a little : I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort level low . If you would like to switch some of your strength training to this day , be my guest . This program is flexible--and should be flexible so as to fit comfortably into your schedule of business and family activities . <p> Thursday : The Thursday mileage remains near the same as the previous two weeks : 2 miles coupled with stretching and strengthening . Need more rest ? Do n't be afraid to run today 's workout at a slower pace . Nobody is going to be standing by the side of the road timing you on these workouts . Experienced runners learn how to " listen to their bodies " when it comes to deciding both how fast and how far to run on any given day . <p> Friday : With only a total of 7.5 miles run this week , you may not think you need a day off on Friday . And maybe you do n't considering the fact that I 'm not going to ask you to run only 3 miles this weekend . But a plan is a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is what you do over the entire period of the training program . And regular rest is an important part of that program . Having said that , I concede that it does n't matter that much which days you rest and which days you run , to a point . If your family or business schedule dictates a different workout mix , be my guest in making changes--but do n't change too much or you defeat the entire purpose of this Shamrock Shuffle training program . <p> Saturday : Forty minutes of cross-training , a jump from the 30 minutes you did the last two Saturdays . This is not without purpose . I am gradually increasing your training load . Do n't push yourself too hard on this cross-training day . <p> Sunday : Three miles for today 's " long " run . Not much , you say , but when you get this far in the race , you will be two-thirds home . Use today 's workout to mentally rehearse how you are going to run those first 3 miles . Consider also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers ( 3.1 miles ) . You might want to enter a 5-K race this weekend as a rehearsal for your race at the end of this program . <p> Run Fast : One advantage of a class situation is the group support you get from others of equal ability . This certainly is true with the marathon class I teach in Chicago , but it 's also true at every level , from novice to intermediate to advanced . One reason why the Kenyans have been able to dominate the world distance running ranks recently is that they train together and push each other every day in practice . Top runners gather in cities like Eugene , Boulder , Albuquerque and Jacksonville for mutual support . Group dynamics can be very important in achieving success . If you have the opportunity to join a class , or hire a coach , or train with other runners , do so . You all will run better-and faster ! 79546 @qwx939546 
@@102096127 @6296127/ <h> Training <h> Marathon Training Guide - Alternate Marathon Program <p> What do you do when your marathon gets cancelled ? <p> Within a few hours after President Bush launched an attack on Iraq , the organizers of the DC Marathon announced that its race had been canceled because of security concerns . And looking back two years , several marathons were canceled in the wake of the World Trade Center attack on September 11 . Also , runners sometimes have to cancel marathons for other reasons , everything from illness to family or business situations . Often , the logical thing to do is shrug and rationalize : " There are more important things to life than racing 26 miles 385 yards . " <p> That 's true , but that does n't make the decision to postpone your marathon any easier . What do you do ? First , you cry . Then you begin to consider your options . I 'm going to suggest several options and also provide some training programs if you have to postpone your marathon one or two or three weeks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't panic : Do n't make a sudden and rash decision that may not be the wisest approach to the problem . Take time before committing yourself to a new course of action . When it comes to an injury , the best approach is often rest , ice and anti-inflammatories . You can skip the ice and anti-inflammatories , but maybe you need to at least rest your mind . Take anywhere from 24 to 72 hours or more to plot your next strategy . <p> 2 . Run anyway : The official marathon may be canceled , but run 26 miles 385 yards anyway . Given security restrictions in the District of Columbia , running the planned course of the DC Marathon may not be possible . If so , find another route of the exact marathon length . You will not get a T-shirt , and you will not get a medal , but at least you will have completed your marathon . I concede that this may not be the most satisfactory strategy for those doing their first marathon , but it may work for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway elsewhere : Well , maybe you should have panicked and immediately lined up a different marathon scheduled for the same day . To locate a marathon , check the calendars available on the Runner 's World website . On the same weekend as the DC Marathon , Runner 's World listed six other marathons from Rome , Italy to Hilo , Hawaii . Unfortunately , none were close to the District of Columbia , so some scrambling was necessary . That brings us to the next option . <p> 4 . Postpone your marathon a week or more : This seems most sensible . Runners who follow my 18-week training programs taper for three weeks following their climactic 20-mile long run in Week 15 . Extending your taper an extra week is not much of a problem . I 'll tell you how to do so below . Stretching into a fifth or sixth taper week is somewhat problematical , but I 'll help you there too . <p> 5 . Postpone your marathon a month or more : This gives you an opportunity to pause , move back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less feasible for those planning a first marathon , who may be drained of psychic energy by their 18-week commitment . ( " You mean I have to run another 20-miler ? " ) Experienced runners may be able to regroup more easily . My recommendation would be to plan some " race " the weekend scheduled for your marathon , then hit the training again . You may find that you will actually achieve more success this way , if your motivation is high . A half-marathon might be the best alternative race , although I concede finding one in the exact time slot may not be easy . <p> 6 . Cancel your marathon entirely : This is the toughest option , but it 's one often forced on us for various reasons , beginning with injury . The base of fitness built over the previous 18 weeks will not be lost . And if you do decide to do your next marathon six months or a year later , you probably will be even better prepared . Depending on when that " next marathon " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it comes time to begin marathon training again . There are numerous programs offered on my website . Pick one . <p> Assuming that you choose options 3 , 4 or 5 above , here 's what to do . ( The following schedules all begin with Week 16 of my 18-week program . The postponed marathon , thus , would have come at the end of Week 18 . ) <h> Alternate Marathon Training Schedules <p> Let 's begin with the last three weeks of my training program , the taper following the final 20-miler in Week 15 . If you have been using one of my training programs , you already know what these three weeks look like . If you are using another training program , I 'm going to suggest that the numbers may be different and in different boxes , but that pattern of gradually decreasing effort will be about the same . This is the Novice 1 schedule , so runners using my Intermediate or Advanced schedules may need to compare and interpolate the numbers with their last three weeks . <p> Week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sat <p> Sun <p> 16 <p> Rest <p> 5 m run <p> 8 m run <p> 4 m run <p> Rest <p> 12 <p> Cross <p> 17 <p> Rest <p> 4 m run <p> 6 m run <p> 3 m run <p> Rest <p> 8 <p> Cross <p> 18 <p> Rest <p> 3 m run <p> 4 m run <p> 2 m run <p> Rest <p> Rest <p> Marathon <h> Postpone your marathon one week <p> This is both easy and difficult to do . Easy , because all you need do is add another easy week by repeating one done before . Hard , because if you are into the final week , it may be too late to make significant changes . ( Those running the canceled DC Marathon learned only Thursday morning . ) For the sake of the chart below , let 's assume you have one week notice on your canceled race , two weeks notice on your substitute marathon . If so , repeat Week 2 of your taper , then do Week 1 . But in all honesty , following a schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to maintain both your fitness and sanity . Intermediate or advanced runners can follow my usual advice to maintain the quality of your workouts ( same pace ) but hold or lower the quantity ( number of miles ) . <p> Week <p> Mon <p> Tue <p> We 'd <p> Thu <p> Fri <p> Sat <p> Sun <p> 16 <p> Rest <p> 5 m run <p> 8 m run <p> 4 m run <p> Rest <p> 12 <p> Cross <p> 17 <p> Rest <p> 4 m run <p> 6 m run <p> 3 m run <p> Rest <p> 8 <p> Cross <p> 18 <p> Rest <p> 4 m run <p> 6 m run <p> 3 m run <p> Rest <p> 8 <p> Cross <p> 19 <p> Rest <p> 3 m run <p> 4 m run <p> 2 m run <p> Rest <p> Rest <p> Marathon <h> Postpone your marathon two weeks <p> This is a tougher stretch , since you now will have five weeks of what I sometimes refer to as " Taper Madness . " That recognizes the fact that when I ask runners to cut their mileage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They miss that daily run , and they 're unhappy when I tell them to cut that 6-miler back to 3 miles--or even to take a full day of rest . So the problem is psychological more than physical . Nevertheless , my approach would be the same as above . Simply back up in your program two weeks . This means doing a second 12-miler for a long run and a second 8-miler as well . You should have no difficulty maintaining your fitness using this approach . If you feel a bit " overtrained " because of being forced to extend your marathon program from 18 to 20 weeks , cut back even further on the miles .

And if you have an opportunity to do a shorter-distance race , take it . A half marathon would be the best choice , but if it is more convenient to run a 5-K or 10-K , that 's fine too .

What defines an Intermediate runner ? You should be running five to six times a week , averaging 15-25 miles weekly training . You probably also should have run a half dozen or more races at distances between the 5-K and the Half-Marathon . With that as background , you now need a somewhat more sophisticated schedule to improve . If that does n't sound like you , you might be more comfortable using one of my programs designed for novice or advanced runners . <p> This Intermediate program counts down from Week 1 to Week 8 ( race week ) for a 10-K race . Following are explanations of the terms used in the training chart below . Further information and explanations are included in the day-by-day schedules in the training program available through TrainingPeaks . <p> Runs : The runs of 3-6 miles on Mondays , Tuesdays and Thursdays are designed to be done at a comfortable pace . For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of maximum . In other words , run easy . <p> Rest : Rest is an important part of your training . Friday is always a day of rest in the Intermediate program .

Run the 400s at about the pace you would run in a 5-K race . Walk or jog between each repeat . Best is to train on a 400-meter track , but you can also run this workout on the road or on trails , by running hard approximately the length of time you would run a 400 on a track .

The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden . You can do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , on trails or even on a track . <p> Warm-up : Warming up is important , not only before the race itself , but before your speed workouts . Jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy strides ( 100 meters at near race pace ) .

A lot of people play at running , working out three or four days a week , doing a long run on the weekends , entering an occasional race , sometimes gearing up for a marathon . For a while , they 'll improve just on accumulated mileage , but after several years it becomes increasingly difficult to set Personal Records . To do that , you need to train . Training is when you follow a schedule , such as this one , where each day has a purpose . If the weather is bad , you still run . If you have important business , you simply rise an hour early to run . Why ? Because I told you to ! And if Hal tells you to run 3 miles today and afterwards do some strength training , please do it ! Not this one workout , but the accumulation of workouts over a period of a dozen weeks , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's workout is a run of 3 miles , the same as last week on Tuesday and the same distance you did yesterday and will do Thursday as well . This workout should n't take a great deal of your time : a half hour or less if you run at a 10:00-mile pace or faster . But forget I said that ! I do n't want you to go out and time yourself for 3 miles . In fact , your course does n't need to be precisely 3.0 miles . It can be about that distance . The easiest way to pick a course of 3.0 miles would be to get in your car and figure out how far you need to run to go about half that distance ( 1.5 miles ) , either from your home , from your office or from wherever you plan to run on Tuesdays . Then run this 1.5-mile course out and back . Do n't wear a watch , at least for the time being . <p> Wednesday : Today 's workout is to run 3 hill repeats , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you to run a fast 400 on the track . In other words , if you run 400 repeats in 90 seconds , your hill repeats should take about that time too . Warm up before and cool down after . Because hills vary so greatly in their length and pitch , do n't get too fussy about the precise details of this workout . More important is the application of energy you bring to hill training during the first half dozen weeks of this program . Finding a hill to train on is not always easy , particularly if you live in the flatlands . Jacksonville , Florida , where I have my winter training base , seems flat as a pancake . Runners there do their hill training on the high and steep bridges that cross the St. Johns River downtown . You can also do your hill training on a treadmill , if necessary . <p> Thursday : Run 3 miles and do some strength training afterwards . During the length of this 12-week program , you will run 26 separate 3-mile runs . That can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different courses at this distance--and for other road distances . Tuesday I discussed how to find a 3-mile course , suggesting that you simply get in your car and measure approximately half that distance , then run it out and back . For a second course , you might measure a " loop " course , meaning you circle around without retracing your steps . But as you run this and other distances , consider utilizing completely different courses , perhaps one in a scenic area frequented by other runners . Be inventive . You might as well make running as pleasant as possible . <p> Friday : A day of rest . I 've been focusing on course measurement for most of this week . You might even call this the " Theme for Week Two . " So if you 're looking for something to do with your extra time while not running today , go out and measure a series of courses from 3 through 8 miles . You 'll use them during the remaining weeks of this Spring Training program . <p> Saturday : Each Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workout . Since you did your tempo run last Saturday , this is the Saturday you run fartlek Fartlek is similar to tempo training in that it features a continuous run that starts and ends slow with fast running in the middle . The difference is that fartlek includes multiple changes of pace over varied ( mostly short ) distances . Run as you feel . Be creative . Pick out a tree and run hard to it . Ease back into a jog until rested , then pick out another landmark for your next sprint . Hard , easy , hard , easy . You define the tempo by how you feel . It 's an enjoyable form of training that can either be your toughest or easiest workout of the week . <p> Sunday : Today 's distance is 7 miles for your long run , a mile further than last week , although my goal is not to increase the mileage each week . Just cover the distance . I do n't care how fast you run . In advising people training for a marathon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the pace at which they plan to run a marathon . But it 's too early for you to think marathon pace--if you even plan to start training for a marathon at the end of this program . Do n't sweat the small details . Simply go out and enjoy your run . <p> Running Tips : The magic workout ? If I had to name one single type of training capable of converting a plodder into a runner , it would be interval training . Tom Ecker , an expert on coaching techniques from Iowa , once described interval training , as " the most effective single training system ever devised . " The University of Oregon 's Bill Dellinger states : " Interval training--if it 's done properly--develops speed in a runner more quickly than any other form of training .

Start skiing pigeon-toed with your ski tips angled outward . Even a slight shift into this " V " or " herring-bone " position may provide enough traction to keep you moving uphill . Do n't forget to use your poles to provide extra push and weight that downhill ski on each stride . Proper weight transfer is essential to practically every cross-country skiing technique . <p> Steeper : If the hill is steeper still , you may need to start herring-boning .

( In instructing runners on proper hill-climbing form , I tell them the same ; you do n't want to let your chin drop . ) <p> Steepest : If the hill is very steep , or if the snow is deep , even the herring-bone may not work . In that case , you may need to sidestep the hill . Place your skis perpendicular to the slope , plant your downhill pole firmly into the snow , and raise your uphill ski to a point higher on the slope .

@@102096132 @6296132/ <h> Training <h> Turning <p> Going downhill will be easier--and less stressful--if you also learn how to turn . This is particularly important on steep hills , or hills with turns in the middle or at the end . And if there are trees beside the trail , this can make beginning skiers very uneasy--as well it should . Collisions with trees are not fun and are best avoided . Here are some turning tips to make your next sojourn on cross-country skis more enjoyable . <p> Point your skis where you want to go : This bit of advice seems so obvious , I almost hesitate to make it . If you 're on the flat in untracked snow , and want to go left , simply move your left ski left , then do the same with your right ski . Pitter-patter , pitter-patter : You 're around the turn . There 's no secret to turning on the flat . Most beginners figure out how to do it without being told . <p> Push off the way you want to go : This sounds the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather than merely pointing your skis the way you want to go and pitter-pattering around the turn , make an aggressive move to get around that turn . If going left , place your weight first on your right ski , lift your left ski slightly and point it directly to where you want to go , then shift forward onto that ski . Pushing with both poles will give you extra momentum . This is how skaters move , and it is a particularly effective way for getting around a turn . Just because you 're a classic skier , that does n't mean you ca n't adapt a few skating moves . <p> Trust the tracks : I offered the same words of advice on the previous screen , Going downhill . Particularly at Nordic centers where the trails have been groomed , the tracks will get you around most turns if you simply relax and let them do the job . Keep your weight forward , your hands out in front , and your weight more or less balanced across both skis , and you can ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too steep or the turn too sharp . <p> Steer like on a bicycle : So now what do you when you encounter steep hills and sharp turns ? Answer : steer like on a bicycle . If you position yourself correctly , you should have your hands well out in front of you , almost over the tips of the skis . The poles that those hands hold should be close to your body , pointing straight back . Pretend that you are on a bicycle and that your hands are gripping the handlebars . Turn your bike the way you want to go , rotating your hands on the handlebars . If turning left ( for example ) , your left hand will come down , your right hand will come up , and your entire body will rotate slightly , leaning left , just as it would making a left turn on a bicycle . When this happens , your skis also will tilt slightly in the tracks , left edges down , right edges up . This subtle movement will help you ride the tracks through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowplow is described in the previous screen : Going downhill . This basic technique used by downhill skiers works on cross-country trails too , particularly when there are no set tracks . While in the snowplow , you simply weight the downhill ski ( i.e. , the one that will be downhill after you complete the turn ) and let the skis do their job taking you left or right . Turning while you are snowplowing also will help slow you down . <p> Take lessons : The best way to learn different cross-country ski techniques is to take lessons . That seems obvious , but less obvious is the fact that you can become an even better Nordic skier if you also take lessons on downhill skis . Perfect your downhill ski technique , and you can apply what you learned while cross-country skiing . Similarly , downhill skiers would be well advised to take some cross-country skiing lessons . What they will learn is how to shift their weight from ski to ski , treating each ski as an independent steering unit .

@@102096133 @6296133/ <h> Training <h> Marathon Training Guide - Intermediate 2 <p> This is Intermediate 2 . The Novice and Advanced training programs in my Marathon Training Guide represent the extremes . The former programs are designed for runners running their first marathons , or experienced runners who are happy with that level of training and see no need to do more . The latter programs are designed for those very experienced runners , who have done a number of marathons , perhaps have plateaued in their times , and want to maximize their ability by training hard and incorporating speedwork into their training . In between , there 's a broad area for runners just like you ! If you previously have trained using one of the novice programs ( 1 or 2 ) , or Intermediate 1 , you now can increase your mileage a bit , run some workouts at a faster pace , and seek improvement . <p> Intermediate 2 offers a slight jump in difficulty from Intermediate 1 . You begin in Week 1 with a long run of 10 miles instead of 8 miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Week 11 , which permits a third 20-miler in Week 15 . Midweek mileage is slightly higher , but instead of cross-training on the weekends , you get more serious about your running and do a second run of 5-10 miles , often at marathon race pace . You now do your cross-training on Mondays , instead of taking the day off . Incidentaly , Intermediate 2 is the ideal training program for those doing the popular " Goofy " run at the Walt Disney World Marathon , where you run a half on Saturday followed by a full marathon on Sunday . This program 's 10-mile pace run followed by a 20-mile long run offers the perfect jumping-off platform for racing 13-26 . <p> Additional tips and instructions are available if you sign up for the interactive version , available through TrainingPeaks . <p> Long Runs : The key to the program is the long run on weekends , which builds from 10 miles in the first week to a maximum of 20 miles . Although some experienced runners do train longer , I see no advantage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I 've tried that myself in the past , and it just wore me out . ) Save your energy and concentrate on quality runs the rest of the week . Consistency is most important . You can skip an occasional workout , or juggle the schedule depending on other commitments , but do not cheat on the long runs . Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer , every third week is a " stepback " week , where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward . Rest is an important component of any training program . <p> Run Slow : Normally I recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 or more seconds per mile slower than their marathon pace . This is very important . Listen to what the Coach is about to tell you ! The physiological benefits kick in around 90-120 minutes , no matter how fast you run . You 'll burn a few calories and trigger glycogen regenesis , teaching your muscles to conserve fuel . Running too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles , compromising not only your midweek workouts , but the following week 's long run . Save your fast running for the marathon itself . There are plenty of days during the rest of the week , when you can run race pace . So simply do your long runs at a comfortable pace , one that allows you to converse with your training partners , at least during the beginning of the run . Which brings up my next point . <p> 3/1 Training : Toward the end of the run , if you 're still feeling fresh , you may want to pick up the pace and finish somewhat faster . This will convert your long run into what I call a 3/1 Run . That means you run the first three-fourths of your long run ( say the first 12 miles of a 16-miler ) at an easy pace , then do the final one-fourth ( 4 miles of a 16-miler ) at a somewhat faster pace--though still not race pace . This 3/1 strategy is advised for only the most experienced runners , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every three weekends . In other words : first weekend , easy run ; second weekend , 3/1 run ; third weekend , step back to a shorter distance . My philosophy is that it 's better to run too slow during long runs , than too fast . The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance ; how fast you cover it does n't matter . <p> Walking Breaks : Walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy even for intermediate runners , and it works during training runs too . While some coaches recommend walking 1 minute out of every 10 , or walking 1 minute every mile , I teach runners to walk when they come to an aid station . This serves a double function : 1 ) you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running , and 2 ) since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations , you 'll be less likely to block those behind . It 's a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well . ( You may want to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water on your training course . ) You will lose less time walking than you think . I once ran a 2:29 marathon as a master , winning a world title , walking through every aid station . My son Kevin ran 2:18 and qualified for the Olympic Trials employing a similar strategy . And Bill Rodgers took four brief breaks ( tying a shoe on one of them ) while running 2:09 and winning the 1975 Boston Marathon . Walking gives your body a chance to rest , and you 'll be able to continue running more comfortably . It 's best to walk when you want to , not when your ( fatigued ) body forces you too . <p> Race Pace : What do I mean by " race pace ? " It 's a frequently asked question , so let me explain . Race pace is the pace you plan to run in the race you 're training for . If you 're training for a 4:00 marathon , your average pace per mile is 9:09 . So you would run that same pace when asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace " on the training charts ) . If you were training for a 5-K or 10-K , " race pace " would be the pace you planned to run in those races . Sometimes in prescribing speedwork , I define paces for different workouts as 5-K pace or 10-K pace , but you wo n't be asked to run this fast in the Intermediate 2 program . Cross-Training : Mondays in the intermediate programs are devoted to cross-training . What is cross-training ? It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting ( usually ) the day after your long run . In this program , we run long on Sundays and cross-train on Mondays . The best cross-training exercises are swimming , cycling or even walking . What about sports such as tennis or basketball ? Activities requiring sideways movements are not always a good choice . Particularly as the mileage builds up toward the end of the program , you raise your risk of injury if you choose to play a sport that requires sudden stopping and starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same each week . And you could even combine two or more exercises : walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a health club . Cross-training for 30-60 minutes will help you recover after your Sunday long runs . <p> Midweek Training : Training during the week also should be done mostly at a comparatively easy pace . As the weekend mileage builds , the weekday mileage also builds . Add up the numbers , and you 'll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the week as you do during long runs on the weekends . Midweek workouts on Wednesdays build from 5 to 10 miles . There are similar slight advances on Tuesdays and Thursdays . The program is built on the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start . That sounds logical , does n't it ? Believe me--as tens of thousands of marathoners using this schedule have proved--it works . <p> Rest : Despite my listing it at the end , rest is an important component of this or any training program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period ( the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise ) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger . Coaches also state that you ca n't run hard unless you are well rested . And it is hard running ( such as the long runs ) that allows you to improve . If you 're constantly fatigued , you will fail to reach your potential . This is why I designate Friday as a day of rest for intermediate runners . It allows you to gather forces for hard running on Saturdays and Sundays . If you need to take more rest days--because of a cold or a late night at the office or a sick child--do so . And if you 're tired from the weekend , take Monday off as well--or cut the length of your cross-training . The secret to success in any training program is consistency , so as long as you are consistent with your training during the full 18 weeks of the program , you can afford--and may benefit from--extra rest . <p> Speedwork ? There is no speedwork involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedwork to improve , check out the advanced training schedules , which offer hill training , interval training and tempo runs on different days of the week . Normally , however , I recommend that marathoners save their speedwork for times of the year when they are not doing a marathon mileage buildup . Check the shorter-distance training programs elsewhere on this web site for more on that . Modifying the program : My training programs are not carved in concrete , and you can make appropriate changes based on your experience , or to suit your convenience . One frequent request made by runners using my forums is to modify the order of the weekend runs , particularly those who want to run long on Saturdays instead of Sundays , because that 's when their friends do their long runs . Running with friends is certainly more fun than running alone , but the pace runs are placed on Saturdays ahead of the long runs on Sundays for a purpose . The main reason is to tire you out a bit in the first workout Saturday so you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also difficult to hit race pace on Sunday the day after a draining long run . Some runners ask if they can split these two workouts , for example , running pace on Friday and long on Sunday . They can , but it defeats somewhat the purpose of two " hard " workouts back to back on Saturdays and Sundays . Most runners have more time for their training on the weekends . So modify the program if you want , but if you make too many modifications , you 're not following the program . <p> Interactive Training : If you would like more help with your marathon training , sign up for one of my interactive training programs , and I will send you emails daily telling you how to train along with tips on how to train , plus you can log your training and use other features .

Luxurious hotels . Pristine beaches . Great food with a Latin beat . Nevertheless , living as we do in Long Beach , Indiana during the summer and Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida during the winter , Rose and I sought more than Sea-and-Sun . We shifted our attention to the area of Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula below Cancun called Riviera Maya , the Mayan Riviera . Archeological ruins . Underground rivers .

" <p> Taninah consists of ten acres of land , five of which have been landscaped around four palapa , or thatch-roofed guest houses , perfectly sized for our family of eight adults and nine children , aged one through fifteen . Beside a duck pond stood a hut with a padded floor , also suitable for sleeping . A large open-air palapa served as the cooking area overlooking a pool in which a plastic alligator floated .

Ample adult eyes provided security .

We eventually found seats on four separate airlines with flights landing within a few hours of each other . <p> We used e-mail for most planning , between members of the family and Marino . David reserved rental cars for everybody . Rose reviewed menus and ordered groceries , since we planned to use a caterer for several of our meals . Pete arranged several golf dates with Marino .

Lane straddling is the norm south of the border . If you see a faster car looming in your rear vision mirror , you move onto the shoulder so the car can pass straddling the middle line . Approaching cars also shift to the shoulder to avoid head-on collisions . If you want to turn left , you first pull over to the right shoulder and wait for traffic to clear before making your left-hand turn .

Back home , several of the women in Rose 's exercise class wrinkled their noses when told this , but there was no smell . The younger grandkids appreciated the compost toilets most . " You do n't have to remember to flush , " we overheard one boast to another . Bugs were no more than we might have anticipated in Florida , although we did encounter one tarantula that looked like a not-too-smaller version of the spider in the last part of Lord of the Rings . I pleaded to spare the spider , but got outvoted . Squish ! <p> Having spent Saturday traveling to Taninah , we used Sunday mostly to get used to the property , heading late afternoon to nearby Playa del Carmen for shopping and dinner at La Parrilla , a rooftop restaurant . Monday , we all drove to Tulum , an archeological site south on the coast not far from our resort . It reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our stay was short to give us time to stop on the return at Xel Ha ( say " Shell-Ha " ) , an ecological park . Too late to swim with the dolphins , we tubed down a mile-long river . The brave among us did **30;0;TOOLONG imitations , jumping off cliffs into the river . Further downstream , two ropes stretching parallel over the water reminded Kevin and David of Boy Scout days at Camp Topenepee near Michigan City , Indiana . You stand on the lower rope and hold onto the upper one . The object is not to get from one end to the other as much as it is to shake the ropes so others fall off into the water . All the older grandkids handled the ropes well . Toughest was 10-year-old Jake who made two trips . Indelible will be my memory of 11-year-old Angela , who at one time dangled in a horizontal position , close to tears , yet gamely hanging on . <p> Back in the compound , three-year-old David amused us all driving a battery-operated car on the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite figured out steering . When he came to a tree or other object , one of the other grandkids had to turn him around . We enjoyed the interplay between children from three families ; the older getting along with the younger and vice versa . <h> Luna met all challenges <p> Each morning several groups would go running , more often on the dirt road leading into the property rather than the path around it . Kevin trained with his son , 15-year-old Kyle , who runs on his high school track team . Although David is more a tennis player , he ran regularly too as did Laura . I brought up the rear . Best runner was Taninah 's dog , Luna , who met every challenge . After returning with one group , if another was heading out to run , she would turn and join them too . There were also two cats , who Luna terrorized if she found them intruding on her territory . Rose normally cares little for pets , but was ready to take Luna home after several days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided the three-hour drive to the Mayan ruins in Chichen Itza might prove too long for the youngest children . We piled the older ones into two cars , following a two-lane highway where every few miles , and while passing through small villages , we encountered topes , that being the Mexican name for speed-bumps . But topes were unlike speed-bumps you might encounter in a typical American suburb . Huge ridges , or sometimes metal balls imbedded in the pavement , they seemed designed to bring even a Humvee to a screeching halt , or maybe they were planned to slow traffic so roadside peddlers could hawk their wares . <p> " Chicken Pizza , " as our nine-year-old grandson Nicholas renamed Chichen Itza , proved the high point of the trip for me , both literally and figuratively . Central to the ruins was a single pyramid that screamed to be climbed despite warnings in both English and Spanish that anyone over the age of 60 should think twice before doing so . So steep was the slope that I felt like Spider-Man clinging to a skyscraper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gusting winds threatened to suck me into space . I descended fearfully , sitting on each step and praying to whatever Mayan gods remained for salvation . <p> Enthralled , we stayed too long , then got lost returning through the town of Valladolid . It grew dark . We navigated the topes safely , but banged into a pothole so deep it dented a tire rim , blowing one tire . I lay down in a puddle trying to figure out where to position a jack . It was inky black , and we had no flashlight . Marino later told me that banditos sometimes roamed the side roads looking for prey , but when a Volkswagen Beetle stopped , it contained a Mexican caballero with his child . He helped me change the flat , then refused an offer of pesos in payment . <h> A shower of candy <p> Wednesday 's destination was Xcaret ( say " Esh-car-ate " ) , another ecological/recreational park , where we snorkeled down a half-mile-long underground river , then stayed for a musical extravaganza that included a field hockey game with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep and were transported home early . After three hectic days of touring , I needed rest myself , so chose Thursday to do nothing much , content to lie around the compound reading a book and sipping Sol Beer , a local favorite . <p> To help us celebrate not only Rose 's birthday , but February birthdays of Sophie ( seven ) , Holly ( 10 ) and Holly 's mother Camille ( undisclosed ) , Marino appeared with a piata . He hung it from a zip line , normally used by the grandkids to streak through space from one tree to another . With Marino tugging the piata up and down , each grandkid except one-year-old Daniel took turns swinging away with a bat until the piata exploded in a shower of candy . <p> That same afternoon , Kyle and his younger brother Wesley , 13 , got into a barefoot soccer game on the lawn with two of the Mexican workers . It was a friendly game with a lot of passing back and forth and shooting through goals marked by beach sandals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your track coach is n't going to be happy , " I scolded him . <p> We spent most of Friday on the beach at Akumal , a few miles down the road . Returning to Taninah , we made one last visit to the cenote with its slide into the underground river . Marino seemed impressed that Grandma Rose and Grandpa Hal made the biggest splashes . That night after dinner , we sat around beside a blazing fire next to the duck hut talking , telling and retelling stories , both eager to head home , yet wishing our big , fat , Mexican vacation would never end . Saturday , it was time to head for the airport even though I still had not found my long lost shaker of salt .

( Although this program was designed for The LaSalle Bank , sponsors of the Shamrock Shuffle and Chicago Marathon , we are happy to have you use it to prepare for the race of your choice . ) Your " long " run yesterday was 4 miles ; your total mileage , 16 miles . This week we will ratchet your training up to 20 total miles with a 5-miler on Sunday . Today is a day of comparative rest . Run 3 miles and do some strength training afterwards . Do n't forget to stretch also . <p> Tuesday : Today 's workout is 3.5 miles , run at an easy pace , similar to last week . Why 3.5 miles and not 4 or 5 or some other distance ? Because I said so , that 's why . It does n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training program . More important is consistency in training regularly to meet your goal . I 'm in charge of determining how you will meet that goal , so trust me ! Next week I 'll ask you to run slightly more on Tuesday , all part of the overall plan . <p> Wednesday : Head to the track . Your interval workout today is 6 x 400 meters with the fast repeats done at about 5-K pace . Walk and jog 400 meters between . Jog a couple of miles before to warm up and about the same distance after to cool down . If you need directions on how to do an interval workout such as this one , back up to the schedule screen for Intermediate runners and check what I had to say about speedwork . <p> Thursday : Run 4 miles and add some stretching and strengthening after you finish the run .

And it insures that you get your run in , since things can interfere if you plan to run at lunch or in the evening . But if you 're preparing for the Shamrock Shuffle in March , that means running in the dark .

Even if you have only an hour for lunch , you may be able to run , shower and grab a quick snack at your desk ( yogurt , a glass of juice ) in the time available . Training for a road race takes discipline , but often the discipline involves activities around the run as well as the run itself . <p> Friday : Thank God It 's Friday . ( TGIF ) There 's even a restaurant chain that uses that name . For many of us who love to run , we do n't always want a day off . Nevertheless , it 's important to program rest days so that you do n't overtrain and set yourself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I always ask the runners who train using my programs to do a bit more on the weekends when they have more time . <p> Saturday : Sixty minutes of cross-training--and it should be aerobic ! Do n't convert what is designed as an " easy " day into a punishing workout , where you thrash in the pool or pump as hard as you can on your bicycle . Stay cool . Swim or cycle or walk or do whatever you choose in a " relaxed " mode . I mainly want you do something that massages your cardiovascular system while allowing you to burn a few calories . The tough workout of the week is tomorrow when you run long--and I 'm going to ask you to run a mile further than your did last week . <p> Sunday : Today is the day when you run long , and today 's long run is 5 miles . That 's only a mile further than last week , but subtle mileage changes work best .

( Green is a very appropriate color , by the way , if you 're training for the Shamrock Shuffle . ) And be cautious about dueling with training partners , since excessive hard running is counterproductive . Consistency is what counts . <p> Run Fast : If you 're a beginner , running fast means merely getting started . If you 've never run before , except when you were a child ( when running was perceived as fun and not as hard work ) , simply to jog for a few hundred meters is to move faster than if you were to walk that same distance . Improvement comes easily when you begin from a base of zero fitness . After that , you need to learn how to train properly . 79546 @qwx939546

Most training programs are progressive , meaning you gradually increase mileage over a period of weeks and months . This program is no different , but the progression is not in a straight line .

It 's a movement so familiar that it seems almost foolish to describe it . One-two , one-two , one-two , and you move forward over the ground . <p> Cross-country skiing is about the same , but with some differences . As a skier you carry poles . Beginners often allow the poles in their hands to merely swing back and forth as they move down the trail , but if you use your poles to push yourself down the trail , you 'll go much faster and with less energy expenditure .

When I competed in track at Carleton College many , many , many years ago , this was the furthest distance I ran in dual meets .

So Friday is the day when you do n't have to think about what course you 're going to run or how to fit your workout into a busy schedule . You can even skip taking a shower , but if you brush your teeth , do n't forget to floss . Relax . Take a day off . <p> Saturday : Walk for 30 minutes . Depending on your pace , that could carry you close to 2 miles .

Walking for 30 minutes today will burn about 200 calories . Okay , maybe closer to 150 calories if you do n't push too hard . Since you lose 1 pound for every 3,600 calories burned , you should be able to lose a pound every second or third week following this program , assuming your eating habits do n't change . You can lose weight faster by combining diet and exercise , which is the best way to lose weight as well as keep it off . <p> Sunday : Run for 4.5 miles , your longest distance so far and a significant personal achievement , if you are a beginner . That 's halfway between the popular race distances of 5-K and 10-K . That 's a lot of running ! Did you ever think that you would be able to run this far when you started my program ?

They are generally more comfortable and practical than the old floppy sweat pants runners I once wore when I started running long before the Lycra Age . If one of your reasons for beginning to run is to lose weight , however , you may want to postpone your purchase of tights for a while .

Some individuals who possess a reasonably good level of fitness ( because they bicycle or swim or participate in other sports ) could probably go out and run 5-6 miles on very little training . They might be sore the week after a race at one of those distances , but they still could finish . <p> But if you 've made the decision to run an 8-K race , you might as well do it right . Following is an eight-week training schedule to help get you to the finish line of your first 8-K . ( For those metrically challenged , 8-K is a shade less than 5 miles . ) <p> To participate in my 8-K program , you should have no major health problems , should be in reasonably good shape , and should have done at least some jogging or walking . If running 2 miles for your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might want to begin by walking , rather than running . Or , if you have more than eight weeks before your 8-K , switch to my 5-K schedule to build an endurance base before starting . Interactive versions of all my training programs are available through TrainingPeaks . <p> The terms used in the training schedule are somewhat obvious , but let me explain what I mean anyway . <p> Stretch &amp; Strength : Mondays are the days in which I advise you to do some stretching along with strength training . This is actually a day of rest following your long run on Sundays . Do some easy stretching of your running muscles . This is good advice for any day , particularly after you finish your run , but spend a bit more time stretching on Mondays . Strength training could consist of push-ups , pull-ups , use of free weights or working out with various machines at a health club . Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions , rather than pumping very heavy iron . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday workouts , however you can schedule strength training on any two days convenient for your business and personal schedule . <p> Running workouts : Put one foot in front of the other and run . It sounds pretty simple , and it is . Do n't worry about how fast you run ; just cover the distance--or approximately the distance suggested . Ideally , you should be able to run at a pace that allows you to converse comfortably while you do so . This is n't always easy for beginners , so do n't push too hard or too fast . Under this workout plan , you run three days of the week : Tuesdays , Thursdays and Sundays , Sundays being a longer run . <p> Cross-Training : On the schedule , this is identified simply as " cross . " What form of cross-training works best for runners preparing for a 8-K race ? It could be swimming , or cycling , walking , cross-country skiing , snowshoeing , or other forms of aerobic training , or even some combination that could include strength training if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as indicated on the schedule . And feel free to throw in some jogging as well if you 're feeling good . What cross-training you select depends on your personal preference . But do n't make the mistake of cross-training too vigorously . Cross-training days should be considered easy days that allow you to recover from the running you do the rest of the week . <p> Rest : The most important day in any running program is rest . Rest your muscles time to recover so you can run again . Actually , your muscles will build in strength as you rest . Without recovery days , you will not improve . In this program , Friday is always scheduled as a day of rest to compliment the easy workouts on Mondays . <p> Long Runs : The longest runs of the 8-week schedule are planned for Sundays , since you probably have more time to do them on the weekends . If Sunday is n't a convenient day for your long runs , feel free to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter . What pace should you run ? Go slow . There is no advantage to going fast during your long runs , even for experienced runners . <p> Walking : Walking is an excellent exercise that a lot of runners overlook in their training . In the training schedule below , I do n't specify walking workouts , but feel free to walk during your running workouts any time you feel tired or need a break .

@@102096145 @6296145/ <h> Training <h> Voyage to the Bottom of the World 79545 @qwx939545 <h> An Alumni Antarctic Adventure offers an icy delight <p> " Why would you want to go to Antarctica ? " <p> Before our departure to the White Continent , it seemed so many of our friends asked that question . Not always stated was the fact that Antarctica at the bottom of the world can be a very cold place . Winds of 150 mph and temperatures 50 or more degrees below zero ( Fahrenheit ) are not uncommon at the South Pole , at least during the Antarctic winter in July . <p> But we were going in January , the Antarctic summer . And we would be exploring the Antarctic Peninsula that reaches upward toward the tip of South America , still a long distance from the actual South Pole far inland . When my wife Rose and I suggested to our friends that we would encounter sunny days with temperatures in the 30s , they did n't always believe us . And I was n't sure I believed it myself , particularly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antarctica the previous year only to be bombarded by 30-foot waves crossing the Drake Passage , the 400-mile stretch of water separating Antarctica from South America . <p> Too late to cancel . Rose and I were participating in an Alumni Adventure sponsored by Carleton College , my alma mater . Of the hundred participants on our ship , nearly half were Carleton graduates , a tribute to Laurence McKinley Gould , president of that college during my stay on campus . Dr. Gould had been second in command on Admiral Richard E. Byrd 's 1928 expedition to the South Pole . When the college offered a trip to Antarctica , the opportunity to visit this remote corner of the world seemed too good to miss . <h> Southernmost City <p> Our voyage began at Ushuaia , the southernmost city in the world . We boarded the National Geographic Endeavor late on an afternoon with the sun still high in the sky . We were traveling with Lindblad Expeditions , a Swedish tour company that provides a first-class cruise staffed with scientists and naturalists , who describe what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a once-in-a-lifetime experience , we splurged , getting a cabin with two portholes for viewing scenery . <p> After unpacking , we reported on deck for an obligatory life preserver drill . Next , I located the library with computers for sending e-mails via a satellite connection . During our voyage , I would post daily messages to my Internet blog . Dinner proved delicious , as it would through our voyage . The waiters , mostly Filipino , went out of their way to make us feel comfortable . Despite Lindblad being Swedish , the Endeavor boasted an international crew with members from Germany , Great Britain , Croatia and other parts of the world . <p> Before leaving , on the recommendation of our physician , we had purchased seasickness patches that you attach to your neck . The cost : $40 per person , but we were crossing the Drake Passage , arguably the roughest stretch of water in the world . Our preparations seemed unnecessary when we awoke the next morning and looked out our portholes at a smooth ocean . Trip Dennis , the Endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that smooth . " We got lucky , " he said . <p> Weather circulates around the Antarctic Continent counterclockwise , a half dozen stormy lows tracking each other . We fortunately slipped through between lows . Ocean currents below circle clockwise . Water temperatures drop to several degrees below freezing , because salt water freezes at a lower temperature than fresh water . Warmer waters from the North collide with the cold currents , sliding past , converging with them so to speak , but not merging . <h> Crossing the Antarctic Convergence <p> This is the Antarctic Convergence , and while the political boundary of Antarctica is pinned at 60 degrees latitude , the geophysical boundary is actually at this convergence of water . A single geographical degree represents 60 nautical miles . Within that distance , water temperatures can plunge nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit . Air temperatures drop accordingly , from 45 to 35 , noticeable as we stood on the stern . <p> The next morning after reaching the South Shetland Islands , we went ashore , and for the next ten days we would depart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the weather , I donned every layered item I had brought topped by a parka provided by Lindblad Expeditions , bright red so our guides easily could spot us against the white landscape . " We do n't want to lose anybody , " explained Trip . I also wore mukluks , a life preserver and a backpack , containing camera , sketching equipment and extra gloves . Thus dressed , Rose and I clambered into Zodiacs for transport from ship anchored just offshore to the beach . Zodiacs are rubber rafts , powered by an outboard engine and specially designed for hard use in Antarctic waters cluttered with chunks of ice . They can <p> carry a dozen passengers and driver . Once ashore , we removed our life preservers , donning them again before being transported back to the ship . <p> Our first landing was on Aitch Island , also our first encounter with penguins . A hike up from the beach brought us to mounds of rocks where penguins clustered--male and female--guarding their chicks . We had been warned not to get too close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several seemed as curious of us in our red parkas , as we of them in their tuxedo-like plumage . They would waddle close , cocking their heads sideways to see us out of one side eye or the other . <h> March of the Penguins <p> Seemingly , penguins move awkwardly ashore . Maybe so if viewed in films , such as last summer 's March of the Penguins , but after seeing these remarkable birds in their natural environment , I realized they are quite swift . They waddle , but they can move fast , particularly if another penguin enters their space , resulting in a pecking duel . Penguins do a lot of pecking . <p> I saw one penguin ascend a sheer rock face . No human climber could have kept pace with him . Chinstrap penguins , such as those we first encountered , possess very strong claws , good for climbing . In the water , the birds swim swiftly , skimming along the surface like porpoises . Exiting the water , they jump onto ice shelves ten feet or more high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my layers , I definitely felt overdressed . The sun was out , the temperature probably 40 with relatively little wind if you stayed off the ridges . I unzipped my jacket and removed bulky ski gloves , extracting a sketchbook so I could draw some pictures of the bay , the rock cliffs and the penguins . Rose used a throwaway camera purchased just before leaving to take pictures . Photographically , we definitely were outclassed by shipmates wielding digital cameras with telescopic lenses . <p> During our time in the Antarctic , we would see massive penguin colonies . On one stop , a naturalist estimated 100,000 nesting pairs . Since each pair had one or two chicks , that came to 350,000 penguins , almost within eyesight . On another occasion , the captain slowed the ship and everybody clambered onto the deck at 5:22 AM , many wearing night clothes under their red parkas , just to see a single pair of Emperor penguins , standing on an ice flow . These are the penguins seen in March of the Penguins and they seldom venture north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare treat . Other penguin breeds seen were Adelie and Gentoo penguins . Rose seemed to be able to tell one breed from another ; I never could . <h> Watching Whales <p> We also saw whales , at one time a mother and calf frolicking off the bow of our ship . The calf , according to Ingrid Visser , a New Zealand whale expert , probably had been birthed last June or July off the west coast of Columbia or Peru and had come down with Mum to feed in the Antarctic . The calf could not yet dive deep , so Mum did the food gathering . At one point , she disappeared below for four minutes , feeding on krill , shrimp-like creatures , an inch or two long , one of the main food sources in these waters , the bottom of the food chain so to speak . Penguins also feed on krill . And seals feed on penguins and krill . And whales feed on seals and penguins and krill . It 's nature 's way . <p> The calf , nervous with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show . But neither whale saw the Endeavor and its red-parka inhabitants as threats . We were not whalers . We were not going to sink a harpoon into them . The calf was about 20 feet long ; Mum , about 35 feet . Ingrid said it would be another half year or more before the calf would move on to its own life . <p> My encounter with the giant skua proved less pleasant . It happened on Devil Island , which got its name from twin peaks near 600 feet high on each side of our landing . I climbed the first without incident , but halfway up the side of the other I approached too close to a nest guarded by a giant skua , a bird near the size of an owl . I looked up and saw the skua aimed straight at my head . The skua hoped to scare me off , the invader . I ducked , and the skua swooped past without striking and floated through a 180-degree turn to make another run at me . I did n't know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which way to move . Another swoop ; another near miss . <p> I held my hand high overhead since Gillian Dennis , our guide , claimed skuas aimed at the highest point of the body . Eventually as I moved away between swoops , the bird lost interest in me . <p> Later , while on the beach walking back to our pick-up point for return to the Endeavor , Rose spotted another giant skua perched on a rock . It was pecking at a dead penguin chick snatched from the chick 's mother . When we described this later to shipmates , several winced visibly . Penguins are oh-so-cute , and our friends did n't want to think of one becoming a skua 's meal . But skuas need to feed . Life can be cruel in the wild . <h> Stranded over the winter <p> Sliding across the smooth surface of the western Weddell Sea later that evening before a sunset near 11:00 , I was stunned by the emptiness of this part of the world . Surely , this is how Antarctica looked thousands , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an era 150 million years ago when the Antarctic landmass broke away from the Earth 's single , super-continent and drifted southward to begin accumulating the glacial ice that makes it the White Continent today . <p> I learned all about plate tectonics and continental drift during a lecture by Carleton geology professor Shelby Boardman . Geology aside , our voyage to the White Continent was more than an exercise in scientific theory , something we could have achieved watching the Discovery Channel back home . Our voyage needed to be experienced emotionally . It is fine to know why Antarctica is there and got that way . More important is our own reaction to the experience , what happens while standing on the stern and watching icebergs slide by , albatrosses soaring overhead . <p> The next morning we stopped at Paulet Island , historically significant because of twenty-two Norwegian explorers stranded there over a winter , eventually to be dramatically rescued . They built a stone shed for protection , and all survived . <p> We examined the remnants of that shed and wondered , with our elegantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have done the same ? Those of us from Carleton remained inspired by the memory of our late president , Laurence McKinley Gould . I wonder what he would think of us following in his footsteps ? <h> Creatures from the Black Lagoon <p> A loudspeaker announcement the next day alerted us to our arrival at Neptune 's Bellows , a slender channel into Deception Island . Rose and I grabbed our red parkas and rushed on deck . The fog was thick , the narrows narrow . Rocky cliffs hovered overhead . I prayed our captain knew his job . We passed the wreckage of a beached boat , signaling one captain who failed to check his charts before sailing through . <p> Life is easier for Antarctic travelers today than when that boat floundered in the channel . Our luxury cabin offered a hot shower and cozy bunks . The Endeavor featured fine dining , a gym , a massage therapist , a library , a satellite email connection . During our journey , I posted a daily blog to the Internet that attracted several thousand views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be rapid . Early explorers whose ships got stuck in the ice often had to wait an entire winter for rescue , if and when it came . <p> Our captain navigated Neptune 's Bellows flawlessly , and we cast anchor beside a black lava beach . Deception Island is actually an active volcano . The black lagoon into which we had sailed was the caldera of the volcano . We changed into bathing suits to go swimming . Given the temperature of the Southern Ocean ( 29 to 30 degrees ) , that seemingly would require some courage were it not for thermal currents that oozed up from beneath the rocks . Shedding our red parkas , we submerged ourselves , being careful not to sit too close to the thermal currents . I put my hand down on one and had to yank it away to prevent being burned . Later , we wrapped ourselves in towels and stood on the beach sipping hot chocolate laced with Schnapps . Dr. Gould never had it that good . <p> After lunch , we moved to another area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lagoon , protected from winds and waves , served as a perfect harbor . Whalers would bring their ships loaded with blubber to be converted into oil for the lamps of China . Read Herman Melville 's Moby Dick if you want to learn all the uses for slaughtered whales . Toward the middle of the twentieth century , petroleum products began to supplant whale oil . Then in 1970 the volcano burped , creating a mudslide that destroyed the whaling village . We wandered the village 's crushed buildings , wondering whether they were part of man 's pollution of the Antarctic , or part of its historical record . <h> Kodak Alley <p> We sailed early the next morning through the Lemaire Channel , nicknamed " Kodak Alley " because of the scenery . Alas , dense fog shrouded the snowy mountains that seemed to explode upwards from the still waters . We landed at Petermann Island , dropping three scientists from Oceanites ashore . They would spend the next thirty-three days doing research , mostly counting penguins . In March , on its last voyage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return home . <p> We went ashore briefly , roaming over snow and ice , our first experience hiking on anything but rock . Back onboard , we resumed our day 's goal : to reach the Antarctic Circle , that line below which the sun never sets during the summer solstice . Latitude for the Circle is 66 degrees , 33 minutes , 39 seconds , and since we were midway into the 65 's , the goal seemed achievable . <p> The sea was smooth as glass , everything above the horizon reflected below the horizon . We sliced past icebergs and ice flows , but the White Continent seemed anything but white . The depth of blue you see within many of the icebergs can not be found on any artist 's palette . Toward the end of the long day , we slowed , then stopped . We had reached 66 degrees , approximately 30 miles from the Antarctic Circle , but we would go no further . Ice blocked our path . We spent an hour or two exploring in Zodiacs , sneaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the Endeavor , schedules were flexible , capable of alteration if some opportunity for sightseeing presented itself . <p> Such an opportunity occurred at 11:00 PM as we cruised back northward . Orcas sighted , announced Trip Dennis , our tour leader . He invited us to come up on deck in whatever we were wearing--or not wearing . After nearly a week seeing penguins , seals , skuas and petrels , did we really need witness one more whale ? Rose thought so . She started throwing on clothes . I could n't remain in the cabin . Without bothering to don underwear , I put on jeans , sweater and the ubiquitous red parka . <h> Orcas sighted <p> The Endeavor drifted on the calm sea . It was not one Orca , but a pod of maybe a half dozen . Orcas , known also as " Killer Whales , " actually are dolphins , easily identifiable by their white-striped faces . They circled a piece of pack ice with a Crab-Eater Seal lying in the center , trying to distance himself from the predators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as 800 pounds , a good Orca meal . As we watched fascinated , the pod circled the flow , pushing it , rocking it , going beneath and butting the ice 's underside . Suddenly the flow split in half , the seal scrambling to the larger piece , but with less margin of safety between him and the Orcas , who occasionally poked their heads high above the water to regard their prey . <p> More rocking and pushing . Then two Orcas created a wave aimed at the flow tumbling the seal into the water . A groan rose from our group , most of whom were cheering for the seal 's survival . I was backing the Orcas , but stayed silent . <p> We thought the seal dead , but suddenly it reappeared on another flow , seemingly having eluded his pursuers underwater . Or had he ? Because as we continued to observe , it now appeared that the so-called Killer Whales were playing with their prey . Incredibly , one of the Orcas had grabbed the seal and spit it back onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumping the seal into water , spitting it onto another flow . This time , four Orcas worked together and pushed a huge wave toward the flow , swamping it . We next saw the seal in the mouth of an Orca , now bloody , dying if not dead . We got to bed after midnight , the sky still not yet dark . <h> Kayaking among icebrgs <p> We chose kayaking for our next day adventure at Port Charcot on the north side of Booth Island . On kayaking days , our guides towed a kayak-laden raft to a staging area . In groups , we moved to the raft and boarded the kayaks . Our guide warned us not to get too close to icebergs , which sometimes roll over without warning . Glaciers can calf icebergs onto your head if you float too close to shore . We paddled cautiously around the flows and small bergs , but the wind rose while we were downwind from the raft . The pull back took all the energy we could muster . <p> Our return passage through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed the photographers to capture the beauty of sun-splashed mountains . In the next bay , we sighted two dozen Orcas heading south . We turned and trailed them for an hour , stopping late afternoon at Paradise Bay , site of a former Argentinean research station . We climbed a snowfield to a rocky pinnacle , tobogganing back down on our behinds . <p> Another icy landing a day later occurred at a former British airstrip overlooking Port Lockroy . The airstrip was slanted uphill ; the climb in lightly packed snow , proved arduous . One by one , people in our party turned back and returned to the Endeavor . I felt compelled to push upward with a small group , but for the first time during our trip , I felt cold because of wet feet . Snow had entered over the tops of my mukluks . Tired , I stumbled often as my foot plants struck deep snow . I turned and headed back to the Endeavor . Unlike explorers a century ago , I could return to a warm shower . <p> We climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers from the British Antarctic Survey . In addition to keeping a penguin count , they also operate a gift shop for cruise ships that visit on the average of one a day during the summer season . We purchased gifts for grandkids . Port Lockroy would be our last footplant in the Antarctic , before sailing into Dallmann Bay as prelude to the Drake Passage separating us from South America . Following my exhausting hike , I lounged in the library , reading a book titled The Race to the Antarctic . When whales were sighted and my shipmates gathered on the bow to watch , I joined them wearing only a sweatshirt . I was warm again . <h> Breath of the behemoth <p> Then Trip announced we would launch Zodiacs to get closer to the whales . Still fatigued , I might have returned to the library and my reading , but each different adventure seemed to top the previous one . This time proved no exception . At one point , a humpback whale surfaced so close to our Zodiac that I could feel the spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath of the behemoth . <p> But it was time to return to what might be described as civilization . We remained in placid Dallmann Bay long enough to enjoy dinner ; morning found us again crossing the Drake Passage , twenty-foot waves testing our ability to not get seasick . I attached a seasickness patch to my neck for the first time . The waves lessened the further north we sailed . <p> We spent our final day on the Endeavor hanging out in the lounge and listening to lectures . I finished my book on Polar exploration , amazed at the difficulties faced by the first ones who viewed the White Continent . We docked the next morning in Ushuaia . Then the worst part of the trip began : airport to airport to airport . From Ushuaia to Santiago to Miami , where we climbed in our car for the final drive north to our winter home near Jacksonville . As we cruised the expressway , I wondered what the late Larry Gould would have thought of our two-week Alumni Adventure . Given its luxury , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still would have appreciated our following in his footsteps .

@@102096146 @6296146/ <h> Training <h> Spring Training - Advanced Schedule , Week 4 <p> Monday : Congratulations ! You are about to begin your fourth week of Spring Training , which means you have three weeks behind you and nine ahead . It 's always a good idea at the beginning of each workout week to take a few minutes to both evaluate running past and contemplate running future . You can do that while floating through your 3-miler today ( assuming you run alone and do n't have someone to converse with ) . There will be increases in the number of hills you do this week ( to 8 ) , the length of your Wednesday run ( to 6 miles ) and the length of your sorta-long run ( to 9 ) . In fact , this is one of the tougher weeks in the 12-week program . Next week , you will climax the week with a 5-K race . Strength training after today 's 3-miler , and do n't forget to stretch between lifts . <p> Tuesday : Run 8 hill repeats , being sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liquori lived and trained in Gainesville in a state that is flat as an alligator 's profile . To do " hill " training , Liquori would run up the stadium steps at the University of Florida . He did this during the transition period between distance and track work ( same as our plan ) . " When you run a lot of distance , your stride shortens , " says Liquori . " Your leg muscles are not extending , so they become fairly weak . You go to a hill phase to make a transition , to force you to open up your stride by bounding up hills . You exaggerate knee lift and arm swing , push off with the toes and the calves . This strengthens your quadriceps and buttocks muscles before going back onto the track . " <p> Wednesday : Six miles today and stretch afterwards . In my instructions leading to the weekly schedules , I suggest that most of the Monday , Wednesday , Friday and Sunday workouts should be at a conversational pace . Nevertheless , you might want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday runs , which are geared much more to recovery . Speaking in terms of target heart rate , I normally suggested doing easy runs at a pace that would raise your pulse to between 65 to 75 percent of maximum . Thus , the Monday and Friday runs could be done closer to 65 percent with Wednesday runs closer to 75 percent . In stopwatch times , it might be the difference between 8:00 pace and 7:30 pace . Do n't agonize over hitting those numbers exactly if you 're wearing a heart monitor or looking at your watch . Look to your own body for pace cues . <p> Thursday : Today 's fartlek run is 45 minutes , a slight increase from two weeks ago . In all honesty , does it really matter whether or not you run 45 rather than 40 minutes ? At the risk of giving my secrets away : No . Most important is to have a plan . Balancing hard and easy days with rest is part of my overall plan . Once you complete this 12-week Spring Training program and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll begin to understand the overall wisdom of the hard-easy approach . In the meantime , simply have faith . And enjoy the workout . Fartlek workouts can be challenging , but they 're also fun . <p> Friday : Run 3 miles with strength training afterwards . If you 're training for speed , you do n't want to bulk up . Extra weight will slow you down . To avoid putting on body fat pounds , keep the poundage low . Personal trainer Cathy Vasto recommends lifting 50 to 60 percent of the maximum weight you can lift in a set of 12 repetitions . Two sets of 12 work well for most lifts . The reason for doing your strength training after you run , is that lifting can at least temporarily diminish your flexibility . You 'll have a harder time running after lifting than before . To retain flexibility , do your stretching exercises between lifts . <p> Saturday : Thirty minutes for the tempo run today . This can be a relatively easy half-hour run , depending on how hard you push in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount of judgment is required on your part . I ca n't be hovering over you in a helicopter--and would n't if I could . One of the purposes of the tempo run is to serve as a " swing " workout to allow you to adjust the level of difficulty of your training for the entire week . Quality is the key to success , one reason I emphasize it in this Spring Training program . Rest , however , is important to maintain quality . <p> Sunday : Run 9 miles . Regardless of the distance , you should be able to maintain about the same pace used for your previous workouts at 6 to 8 miles . Remember : the pace should be " conversational , " meaning that if you are running with a friend , the two of you should be able to talk without undue strain . If you are wearing a heart monitor , your pulse rate should fall in the zone of 65 to 75 percent of your maximum heart rate . At the end of your workout , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired ? Out of breath ? Some fatigue is normal , but you do n't want to finish exhausted , otherwise you are training too hard . <p> Running Tips : The single most important piece of equipment you must purchase as a runner is a pair of shoes . With some exceptions , it does n't matter how you dress . You can get by without a heart rate monitor , treadmill , or computer diary for recording your workouts , but you wo n't get very far without a comfortable pair of running shoes . <p> How to Improve : Running a marathon may be far from your thoughts , but when you do contemplate training for a 26-mile race , the best book to buy is Hal Higdon 's Marathon : The Ultimate Training Guide . It will help get you to the starting line and , most important , get to Books by Hal Higdon.

In an eight-week 8-K program , it seems appropriate to taper the final week . If yesterday 's run of 4.5 miles seemed difficult to you , that 's because it came at the end of a hard week of training . The Shamrock Shuffle will come at the end of this easy week of training , and I think you 'll find being rested will allow you to both finish and enjoy what is a truly great race . Today is the day you stretch and strengthen . But do n't pump iron too hard ; you should taper your strength training too . <p> Wednesday : Thirty minutes of cross-training will do quite well today , thank you . Go for a bike ride . Swim a few laps in the pool . Take a gentle walk rather than the brisk one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch to make sure you worked out for exactly 30 minutes . Just listen to your body signals and quit early . <p> Thursday : The 2 miles run today is the same as previous Tuesdays , but cut back on the strength training today if you plan to run the Shamrock Shuffle on Sunday . <p> Friday : Rest for Sunday 's race today and tomorrow . Pick as food choice for dinner something that will be easily digested . Tonight is probably not the night for prime ribs or chili and beans . Get a good night 's sleep , but do n't worry if you have a hard time getting to sleep because of nervous anticipation . That 's natural . The sleep that you stored up during the week will send you to the starting line well rested . <p> Saturday : Today is a day of rest for those running the 8-K . <p> Sunday : This is the day many of you prepared for : the Shamrock Shuffle . You 'll be one of 15,000 people standing on the starting line in Grant Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first major race , you 'll discover that the excitement of being among a crowd of runners with a shared goal and shared interests will help carry you to the finish line . Before you know it , you 'll be past the 4.5-mile mark ( your longest run in this training program ) and in sight of the finish line . Smile when you cross that line . It will be a singular experience , but one I know you will want to repeat again . The Shamrock Shuffle is behind you . For some of you , it will be the only road race you may run during your lifetime . For others , particularly those living in the Chicago area , it will be a prelude for The LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon later this year . If so , be sure to check my Marathon Training Guide for an 18-week program to prepare you for that popular race . Others may want to drop down in distance to a 5-K or 10-K . I hope this training program was useful in preparing you for the Shamrock Shuffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you train too hard , you may compromise your performance because of excessive fatigue--or you may even become injured . Warning signs for overtrained runners are restlessness at night , a slightly elevated pulse rate just before rising , or dead legs and a general feeling of fatigue . Race times suffer , too . You 're likely to catch colds because of lowered resistance . A certain amount of muscle soreness and stiffness is a natural part of the training process , but if symptoms of fatigue persist for more than two or three days , do n't take an aspirin or see a doctor as you might for that cold .

The mileage also continues to increase in Week 6 , actually the fifth week of your training . You will run 36 total miles this week with an 8-miler at the end of the week . You need this day of comparative rest . So run an easy 3-miler followed by your stretch and strengthen routine . Do n't overdo the pumping-iron . There 's a subtle difference between training and overtraining . If you do n't do enough of the former , you wo n't be ready to run the race . If you do too much of the latter , you risk injury or excessive fatigue . This schedule should help you walk the tightrope between . <p> Tuesday : Now we 're getting into the serious part of the training : 45 minutes for your tempo run .

The middle part is n't always done at the same pace and that pace does n't have to be flat out . Think of the classic Bell curve that flattens out near its peak . If you do push really hard in the middle--and sometimes it 's fun to do just that--it should n't be for too long a time . Usually I get up to over 90 percent of maximum in my tempo runs , but I do n't hold it too long . <p> Wednesday : The progression of difficulty of your interval workouts at the track continues . Today , run 9 x 400 meters at 1500/mile pace with a 400 in between jogging and walking . Break the workout in the middle if you feel you need some relief .

One reason for doing an occasional race--even if you do n't run that much faster than you might in training--is to check out the sights and sounds of the racing world . Races are fun . If you plan to shift to marathon training at the end of this 12-week Spring Training program , doing an occasional race at distances between 5-K and 10-K will get you used to procedures around racing : everything from how to position yourself in a large field to how to use the aid stations .

Continue to focus on your running , and do n't allow your mind to drift , particularly on the back straightaway when the fast pace may feel painful . I find that when I head to the track for speedwork early in the season , I sometimes have difficulty keeping my mind on what I 'm doing . And this slows me down . Usually after about three or four track sessions , my concentration improves , and I find myself able to run faster . This is partly from improved muscle conditioning , but partly because I 'm more focused . Using associative strategies in races is n't enough . You have to learn to associate in practice too , particularly during speedwork sessions . <p> Thursday : Three miles followed by strength training . And do n't forget to stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . Research shows that warm tissues stretch better than cold tissues . Many runners interpret this to mean that you jog 5-10 minutes before stopping to stretch . Robert Forster , however , offers another opinion .

" When people are prone to injuries--or if they 've been sitting down all day--they need to stretch before exercise as well . " Forster recommends that runners develop a routine that begins with some simple pre-workout stretches , then continues after a short jog warms the muscles . Stretching after the workout also is a good time to increase flexibility . " There is no best time to stretch , " he concludes . " You need to continually work on your flexibility to achieve success as a runner .

Runner-journalist Merrill Noden once wrote : " In any interval session--on or off the track--you are measuring two variables : the distance you run and the time it takes . Real fartlek always leaves one or both of these variables unmeasured . " As a result , Noden concluded , you make it impossible to pass judgment on your effort .

Take a good swig of water just before you start to run and if there are any water fountains on the course you choose , do n't run past them . You might even consider carrying a water bottle . Dehydration becomes more of a factor the longer you run and the higher the temperature . It is also cumulative , meaning you still could be somewhat dehydrated from yesterday 's fartlek run as well .

@@102096151 @6296151/ <h> Training <h> Stopping ( also--oops--Falling ) <p> How do you stop on skis ? Simple : you quit moving your arms and legs . If on the flat , you will slide to a halt . If on a downslope , you may need to use one of the techniques described in the preceding screens : Going Downhill and Turning . Most effective is a hockey stop , where you suddenly shift skis to the perpendicular--although this takes practice . <p> No , the subject of this screen is actually falling down--though also getting up . I was afraid of scaring beginning skiers by suggesting in the list of screens that " falling " was part of the ski package . Most of you probably figured that out anyway , and the fear of falling prevents a lot of people from starting the sport . Here 's how to avoid falling , as well as how to get up after you do fall . <p> Take lessons : I 've offered this before , and will offer it again , but proper instruction is the key to learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by skiing in a local park , you will progress faster if you eventually take lessons at a Nordic Center . Lou Awodey , the Nordic director at Boyne Mountain , begins each lesson by teaching skiers how to get up after falling down . At the same time , he is teaching them not to fall down . <p> Follow the leader : I was skiing with my granddaughter Holly at Boyne Mountain one winter . She was six , and this was her first time on cross-country skis . Skiing from behind , I kept telling Holly what to do , but she kept falling . Fearful that I was distracting her more than helping her , I moved ahead down the trail . Glancing back , I saw that she had fallen again , and was crying , more from frustration than from anything else . So I went back and simply skied a few strides ahead of her . She did what I did , and suddenly she stopped falling . A smile creased her face ! If you can slide in behind a good skier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to ski--and stay upright--much quicker . <p> Stay focused : Most of my falls occur on the flat . I 'll schuss down a steep hill and zip around a tricky turn in perfect form , then while I am skiing across a flat meadow--bloomp ! Suddenly , I 'm picking myself off the snow . What happened ? An experienced skier like me should not fall down on the flat . But I had lost concentration . My mind had wandered , and I was n't focused on proper technique . That had been Holly 's fault too ; she had been listening to Grandpa instead of doing what he was doing . If you can stay focused , you will be much less likely to fall down . <p> Quit while you 're ahead : Fatigue probably causes more falls than poor technique . This is true in downhill as well as cross-country skiing . It 's difficult to focus when you 're tired , or cold because you 're soaked with sweat and too far from a warming hut . Do n't ski too long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know you drove 200 miles to get to the ski resort and paid for lodging , lessons , and a trail pass , but do n't feel that you have to ski all day to get your money 's worth . Sitting by a warm fire and sipping a hot chocolate while reliving an hour on skis often can be more fun than spending two or three hours on those skis and dragging yourself back to the lodge . <p> Practice proper nutrition : Cross-country skiing soaks up a lot of energy . Not only does doing the sport burn more calories than almost any other physical activity , but you 'll also burn calories staying warm . Think like a marathoner . Eat well and drink well . See Nutrition for more information on this subject . If you can maintain a high energy level through proper nutrition , you will be much less likely to fall down . <p> Suppose you do fall down ; how do you get up ? Awodey tells skiers to squiggle around and get in a position where they are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is much easier to accomplish on cross-country skis than downhill skis , because your heels are not attached to the ski . " Make sure that your skis are perpendicular to the slope , so you do n't start to slide , " says Awodey . From a kneeling position , it should be easy to stand up , pushing off the snow with your hands . If even this proves difficult , remove one boot from the ski . Practice getting in and out of your bindings before you start , so you know how to accomplish this . <p> If you follow all of the advice above , you will be less likely to fall . However , if you do fall down , do n't be embarrassed . At some point , everybody falls--even the good skiers . In fact , some skiers claim that if you never fall down , you 'll never improve , because you 're not pushing against the edge of your ability . I do n't believe this , preferring to remain upright , but it 's a good rationalization to use while brushing off the snow .

By Hal Higdon <p> A low-lying fog bank smothered the surface of the St. Johns River as I drove over the Hart Bridge at 7:00 on a Saturday morning in early March . I was headed to the starting line of the Gate River Run . The skyscrapers of downtown Jacksonville several miles westward seemed suspended in a sea of gray , creating a mystical moment . <p> Several evenings before , I had attended a pre-race pasta party with weatherman Tim Deegan , who had predicted 100 percent humidity for the River Run 's 8:30 start . He got that one right ! <p> Tim also predicted temperatures rising to near 80 degrees by 10:00 , about the time I hoped to again be crossing the Hart Bridge , this time on foot . Sure , the scenery is superb , but few runners can summon the strength at that point to look upriver . With a mile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy of his forecasts . <p> I followed Tim to the podium at the pasta party and offered my own prediction : that I would start in the back row and run only to finish . That seemingly easy goal seemed far from assured until I voiced it , because I was n't sure I would start until a day or two before . Following a period last year when I ran seven marathons in seven months , I took January off to heal my wounds . Most of my runs in February were a mile or two at most , walking as much as jogging . Only a week into March , I was faced with the River Run . While I wanted to run the 15-K ( the American championships ) , I did n't want to die doing it , figuratively or literally . Then I managed a five-miler on Ponte Vedra Beach . Then another , and another after that . This convinced me that I was in middling shape . Inspiration on race day should allow me to bridge the distance from five to nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " certainly has fearful connotations to the 8,000 or so who enter the Gate River Run each year . The 15-K race features two bridges over the St. Johns River , one in the early miles , one in the late miles . Near the start , the Main Street Bridge presents only a minor challenge . Near the finish , the Hart Bridge definitely seems a bridge too far . Toward the end of the eighth mile , runners turn onto the Hart and begin a half-mile climb featuring a 6 percent grade that peaks 141 feet over the river before descending . The climb punishes the lungs ; the descent pummels the legs . <p> Nevertheless , I put on a brave front when interviewed earlier in the week by Florida Times-Union correspondent Laurie Cason , who was writing a story on the challenge imposed by the Hart Bridge .

Although I had told the pasta party crowd that my goal was merely to finish , a secondary goal was to run the entire distance . The previous two years , I had walked on the ascent of the Hart Bridge . I did n't care how fast my time was , I just wanted to hit the top of that bridge running ! <h> A steady if slow pace <p> Starting in the back row provided me with the slow start I needed to make that goal achievable .

Passing the 8-mile mark , I glanced left at downtown Jacksonville . With the sun high and the temperature now 80 as predicted by Tim Deegan , the fog was long gone , but I did n't waste much time on the scenery . I flew past people on the descent and finished feeling exhilarated by the fact that I was back running again . <p> Meb and Deena successfully defended their championships .

You are three-quarters through your 12-week Spring Training program--but this is a key week : the peak of your training . ( Since Weeks 11 and 12 feature 5-K and 10-K races at the end , I 'll ask you to taper a bit for them , so you 'll actually run less . ) While running your 3-miler today , contemplate your race run yesterday . One reason for doing an occasional race--even if you do n't run that much faster than you might in training--is to check out the sights and sounds of the racing world . And practice racing techniques . Races are fun . If you plan to shift to marathon training at the end of this 12-week Spring Training program , racing at distances between 5-K and 10-K will satisfy some of your desire to test yourself against other runners . Try to learn from every race you run in . <p> Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jogging and/or walking 200-400 between . Continue to focus on your running , and do n't allow your mind to drift , particularly on the back straightaway when the fast pace may feel painful . I find that when I head to the track for speedwork early in the season , I sometimes have difficulty keeping my mind on what I 'm doing . And this slows me down . Usually after about three or four track sessions , my concentration improves , and I find myself able to run faster . This is partly from improved muscle conditioning , but partly because I 'm more focused . Using associative strategies in races is n't enough . You have to learn to associate in practice too , particularly during speedwork sessions . <p> Wednesday : Three miles today with stretching afterwards . You 've reached a point in this program where your workout sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays are getting harder . This is because you 've learned to push yourself harder . Also , the weather may be getting better , allowing you to run faster . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and before a tough fartlek run . Thus , make this an easier workout than usual . Pamper yourself . In fact , today would be a great day on which to schedule a massage . While I sometimes suggest you move a bit faster on Wednesdays than on Mondays , today is not one of those " sometimes . " <p> Thursday : The fartlek workout for today is 45 minutes . Runner-journalist Merrill Noden once wrote : " In any interval session--on or off the track--you are measuring two variables : the distance you run and the time it takes . Real fartlek always leaves one or both of these variables unmeasured . " As a result , Noden concluded , you make it impossible to pass judgment on your effort . As such , fartlek lends itself to the cross-country setting , because training venues away from the track are almost always unmarked and undefined . The burden falls on the shoulder of each runner to make each fartlek workout as it good as it can get . <p> Friday : Three miles followed by strength training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and between lifts . Warm up is important . Research shows that warm tissues stretch better than cold tissues . Many runners interpret this to mean that you jog 5-10 minutes before stopping to stretch . Robert Forster , however , offers another opinion . " Nobody said you ca n't stretch cold muscles , " says the California physiotherapist , who included Jackie Joyner-Kersee among his clients . " When people are prone to injuries--or if they 've been sitting down all day--they need to stretch before exercise as well . " Forster recommends that runners develop a routine that begins with some simple pre-workout stretches , then continues after a short jog warms the muscles . Stretching after the workout also is a good time to increase flexibility . " There is no best time to stretch , " he concludes . " You need to continually work on your flexibility to achieve success as a runner . " <p> Saturday : Thirty minutes is the recipe for the tempo run today . Consider this a " swing " workout . Depending on how fatigued you are from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run this in " cruise control " without the obligation to push to your limit in the middle . Always listen to your body when doing workouts like this ! Maybe I should give you permission to let your mind drift during this run so you can consider how far you have come since starting to run . Individuals who have been running for several years or more do n't notice improvements as much as beginning runners . You may not have lost 10 pounds in the past 10 weeks . You may not have discovered muscles you did n't know you had . But you should begin to notice some improvements in your fitness level and , hopefully , some improvement in your overall ability to run fast because of the speed training you 've been doing . You should be able to race better too . <p> Sunday : Ten miles of running today added to three hard days running this week means that you will have logged some tough miles in the last seven days .

Take a good swig of water just before you start to run , and if there are any water fountains on the course you choose , do n't run past them . You might even consider carrying a water bottle . Dehydration becomes more of a factor the longer you run , the harder you run , and the higher the temperature . It is also cumulative , meaning you still could be somewhat dehydrated from the running you did all week . Nevertheless , enjoy your run . <p> Running Tips : One way to benefit from your speed sessions is to pace yourself so that you finish each workout faster than you began . For example , Coach Robert Vaughan of Dallas , Texas suggests that in a workout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each 400 four or five seconds slower than the concluding 200 meters . " You shift gears in the middle , " instructs Vaughan . " You kick at the end of each rep . " There 's nothing magic about 400 reps and nothing magic about 200 meters as the kick point . Sometimes Vaughan has his runners start their kicks 100 meters out--or 300 meters out . " Our runners seem to enjoy the pace changes , " he says . " It provides an adrenaline rush , both in races and in workouts . Their bodies adapt to quick shifts , and they learn that they can go fast at the end of a race . " Running long runs faster at the end than at the beginning is another strategy worth pursuing . <p> How to Improve : Running a marathon may be far from your thoughts , but when you do contemplate training for a 26-mile race , the best book to buy is Hal Higdon 's Marathon : The Ultimate Training Guide .

Some runners eat gobs of butter on a dinner roll , big dollops of sour cream on a potato , and enough dressing to drown a salad . These fatty foods fill both the stomach and fat cells but leave muscles poorly fueled . The better bet is to trade the fats for extra carbohydrates .

Novice 2 consists of several different increments : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run on weekends , which builds from 8 miles in Week 1 to 20 miles in the climactic Week 15 . ( After that , you taper to get ready for the marathon . ) Starting at 8 miles , you get up over 15 miles sooner than in Novice 1 and have an additional run above that distance . You can skip an occasional workout , or juggle the schedule depending on other commitments , but do not cheat on the long runs . Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer , every third week is a " stepback " week , where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward . Rest is an important component of any training program . <p> Run slow : For experienced marathoners , I recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds or more per mile slower than their marathon pace . The problem with offering this advice to many novice runners , however , is that they probably do n't know what their marathon pace is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an experienced runner , you may or may not have run a prior marathon , but hopefully you have done enough races , including a half marathon , so that you can predict your marathon pace . If not , do n't worry . Simply do your long runs at a comfortable pace , one that allows you to converse with your training partners , at least during the beginning of the run . Toward the end , you may need to abandon conversation and concentrate on the act of putting one foot in front of the other to finish . However , if you find yourself finishing at a pace significantly slower than your pace in the first few miles , you probably need to start much slower , or include regular walking breaks . It 's better to run too slow during these long runs , than too fast . The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance ; how fast you cover it does n't matter . <p> Walking breaks : Walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy in trying to finish a marathon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend walking 1 minute out of every 10 , or even alternating running and walking as frequently as every 30 seconds , I teach runners to walk when they come to an aid station . This serves a double function : 1 ) you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running , and 2 ) since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations , you 'll be less likely to block those behind . It 's a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well . You will lose less time walking than you think . I once ran a 2:29 marathon , walking through every aid station . My son Kevin ran 2:18 and qualified for the Olympic Trials employing a similar strategy . And Bill Rodgers took four brief breaks ( tying a shoe on one of them ) while running 2:09 and winning the 1975 Boston Marathon . Walking gives your body a chance to rest , and you 'll be able to continue running more comfortably . It 's best to walk when you want to , not when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross-training : Sundays in this training program are devoted to cross-training . What is cross-training ? It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting ( usually ) after your long run . In this program , we run long on Saturdays and cross-train on Sundays , although it certainly is possible to reverse that order . The best cross-training exercises are swimming , cycling or even walking . What about sports such as tennis or basketball ? Activities requiring sideways movements are not always a good choice . Particularly as the mileage builds up toward the end of the program , you raise your risk of injury if you choose to play a sport that requires sudden stopping and starting . One tip : You do n't have to cross-train the same each weekend . And you could even combine two or more exercises : walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a health club . Cross-training for an hour on Sunday will help you recover after your Saturday long runs . <p> Strength Training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add strength training to my marathon program ? " If you have to ask , you probably should not . I strongly endorse strength training for maximum fitness and long life , but if you never have pumped iron before , now is probably not the time to start . Wait until after you have that medal around your neck . For gym rats , continue to work out , but you might want to cut back on the weights as the long run mileage moves into the double digits . Tuesdays and Thursdays work well for strength training--after you finish your runs on those days . <p> Midweek training : Training on Tuesdays and Thursdays should be done at a comparatively easy pace . As the weekend mileage builds , the weekday mileage also builds . Add up the numbers , and you 'll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the week as you do during long runs on the weekends . Midweek workouts on Wednesdays build from 3 to 8 miles , many of them done at race pace . ( I call these my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesdays and Thursdays . The program is built on the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start . That sounds logical , does n't it ? Believe me--as tens of thousands of marathoners using this schedule have proved--it works . How fast is " comfortably easy ? " That might vary from day to day . On Tuesday after a day 's rest , you might find yourself running faster than race pace . On Thursday after two days of running , your pace might be significantly slower . <p> Race Pace : What do I mean by " race pace ? " It 's a frequently asked question , so let me explain . Race pace is the pace you plan to run in the race you 're training for . If you 're training for a 4:00 marathon , your average pace per mile is 9:09 . So you would run that same pace when asked to run race pace ( sometimes stated simply as " pace " on the training charts ) . If you were training for a 5-K or 10-K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to run in those races . Sometimes in prescribing speedwork , I define paces for different workouts as 5-K pace or 10-K pace , but you wo n't be asked to run this fast in the Novice 2 program . <p> Rest : Despite my listing it at the end , rest is an important component of this or any training program . Scientists will tell you that it is during the rest period ( the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise ) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger . Coaches also will tell you that you ca n't run hard unless you are well rested . And it is hard running ( such as the long runs ) that allows you to improve . If you 're constantly fatigued , you will fail to reach your potential . This is why I include two days of rest each week for novice runners . If you need to take more rest days--because of a cold or a late night at the office or a sick child--do so .

@@102096166 @6296166/ <h> Training <h> Half Marathon Training Guide - Advanced Program <p> HALF MARATHON ADVANCED IS FOR VERY EXPERIENCED RUNNERS : individuals who compete regularly in 5-K , 10-K , half-marathon and even marathon races and who want to improve their performances . You should be capable of running 30 to 60 minutes a day , five to seven days a week and have a basic understanding of how to do speedwork . If that sounds like too much training , and this is your first half marathon , you might be more comfortable training using either one of the novice Programs or the intermediate Program . <p> Easy Runs : The runs on Mondays , Wednesdays and sometimes Fridays or Saturdays are designed to be done at a comfortable pace . Do n't worry about how fast you run these workouts . Run easy ! If you 're training with a friend , the two of you should be able to hold a conversation . If you ca n't do that , you 're running too fast . ( For those wearing heart rate monitors , your target zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse rate . ) <p> Stretch &amp; Strength : Mondays and Wednesdays are also days on which I advise you to spend extra time stretching--and do some strength training too . These are actually " easy " days , so do n't overdo it . It 's wise to stretch every day , particularly after you finish your run , but spend more time stretching on Mondays and Wednesdays . And do n't forget to stretch while warming up for your hard runs . I ca n't emphasize this strongly enough : Advanced runners need to spend more time stretching than novice or intermediate runners ! That 's because you probably run faster and train harder , which can stiffen the body . And do n't forget at least some strength training , which could consist of push-ups , pull-ups , use of free weights or working out with various machines at a health club . Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions , rather than pumping very heavy iron . <p> Distance : The training schedule dictates workouts at distances , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on your ability ) may actually take you further than your half marathon race distance . Do n't worry about running precise distances , but you should come close . Pick a course through the neighborhood , or in some scenic area where you think you might enjoy running . Then measure the course either by car or bicycle or a GPS watch . As an advanced runner , you probably already know the distances of many of your courses . When the prescribed workout ( as on Sundays ) is in hours rather than miles , forget distance entirely . <p> Rest : Rest is as important a part of your training as the runs . You will be able to run the long runs on the weekend better--and limit your risk of injury--if you program some easy training before and after . Be realistic about your fatigue level--particularly in the closing weeks of the program--and do n't be afraid to take a day off . <p> Hills : Some hill training will help strengthen your quads and build speed . Look for a hill between 200 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between each repeat . I prescribed only three hill sessions , all in the first half of the program , but if you want to do more hill training , be my guest . You can substitute hill repeats for any of the interval workouts , or even in place of a Tempo Run or two if you want . <p> Speedwork : If you want to race at a fast pace , you need to train at a fast pace several days a week . The training schedule begins with 400-meter repeats , but also includes 800- and 1600-meter repeats in later weeks . Walk or jog between each repeat . You can do the 400 and 800 repeats on a track , although you may want to do the 1600 ( mile ) repeats on the road . For more information on speed training , see my book , Run Fast . <p> Warm-up : Warming up is important , not only before the race itself , but before your speed workouts above and pace workouts below . Most Novice runners do not warm up , except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're more interested in finishing rather than finishing fast . You have a different goal , otherwise you would n't be using the Advanced program , so warm up before you run fast . My usual warm-up is to jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy strides ( 100 meters at near race pace ) . And I usually cool down afterwards by doing half the warm-up distance . <p> Tempo Runs : This is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near 10-K race pace . A Tempo Run of 40 to 60 minutes would begin with 10-20 minutes easy running , build for 20-30 minutes near the middle , then 5-10 minutes easy toward the end . The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout . Hold that peak only for a minute or two . I consider Tempo Runs to be the " Thinking Runner 's Workout . " A Tempo Run can be as hard or easy as you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long ( in time ) you run or how far . In fact , the times prescribed for Tempo Runs serve mainly as rough guidelines . Feel free to improvise . Improvisation is the heart of doing a Tempo Run correctly . <p> Pace : A lot of runners look at my training schedules and ask , " What do you mean by ' pace ? ' " I mean " race pace , " the pace at which you expect to run the half marathon . Some workouts are designed as pace runs to get you used to running the pace you will run in the race . In Week 10 , for example , I ask you to do " 5 m pace . " Hopefully that is self-explanatory . You might want to do a short warm-up before starting each of these pace runs . <p> Long Runs : As an experienced runner , you probably already do a long run of around 60-90 minutes on the weekends anyway . The schedule suggests a slight increase in time as you get closer to race date : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get hung up on running these workouts too fast and forget about how many miles you cover . And , yes , you may actually find yourself running further than 13.1 miles when you run two hours . Run at a comfortable , conversational pace , except on those days where a 3/1 run is prescribed . A 3/1 run is one in which you run the first three-fourths of the distance at a comfortable pace , then accelerate to near race pace over the last one quarter of the workout . ( You should finish refreshed , not fatigued . ) The schedule below suggests doing your long runs on Sundays , and while you can do them Saturdays or any other convenient day , you will generally find it easier to run the long runs the day after the pace runs instead of vice versa . <p> Cross-Train : Normally I do n't prescribe cross-training for advanced runners . That 's because you 're usually more focused on pure running than novice or Intermediate runners . But if you find that cross-training helps you prevent injuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-training on one or more of the easy days . Notice I used the word substitute . Usually it 's not a good idea to add cross-training , particularly hard cross-training , to an existing workout under the mistaken belief that it will make you stronger . It may actually cause you to overtrain , which can have a negative effect on performance , because you never get a chance to rest . What form of cross-training works best ? It could be swimming , cycling , walking , cross-country skiing , snowshoeing , or even some combination that could include strength training . <p> Juggling : Do n't be afraid to juggle the workouts from day to day and week to week . If you have an important business meeting on Thursday , do that workout on Wednesday instead . If your family is going to be on vacation one week when you will have more or less time to train , adjust the schedule accordingly . If this means running hard on successive days , so be it . Program in an extra day of rest to compensate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details wo n't matter . <p> Racing : Most experienced runners enjoy racing , so I 've included three races during the training period : one every third week , building from 5-K to 10-K to 15-K . There is nothing magic about those particular distances , and there is no necessity to race . Plug in whatever races look interesting from your local area wherever they fit in your schedule . ( See " Juggling , " above . ) You can use races to test your fitness and predict your finishing time in the half marathon and what pace to run that race . <p> Here is your half marathon training program .

Further information and explanations are included in the day-by-day schedules that I will email you if you sign up for the interactive version of this program available through TrainingPeaks . <p> Runs : The runs of 3-6 miles on Mondays , Thursdays and Fridays are designed to be done at a comfortable pace . If you ca n't carry on a conversation with your training partner , you 're running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure their level of exertion , you would be running between 65 to 75 percent of maximum . <p> Rest : Rest is an important part of your training . On Fridays you are offered the option of resting or taking an easy 3-mile run . Be realistic about your fatigue level and do n't feel guilty if you decide to take a day off . Specifically consider scheduling at least one rest day during the stepback weeks . ( See below . ) <p> Tempo Runs : A tempo run is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near 8-K race pace . In this program , tempo runs are scheduled for Tuesdays . A tempo run of 30 to 40 minutes would begin with 10-15 minutes easy running , build to near 5-K race pace for 10-20 minutes near the middle , then 5-10 minutes easy toward the end . The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout . ( You do n't need to maintain peak speed for more than a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , on trails or even on a track . <p> Speedwork : If you want to race at a fast pace , you need to train at a fast pace several days a week . Interval training where you alternate fast running with jogging or walking is a very effective form of speedwork . The training schedule begins in Week 1 with a workout of 6 x 400 meters and peaks in Week 7 with 10 x 400 . Run the 400s at about the pace you would run in a mile or 1500 race . Walk or jog between each repeat . Although the best venue for speedwork of this sort is on a 400-meter track , these workouts can be done on the road or on trails , either by using measured courses or by running hard approximately the length of time you would run a 400 on the track . For instance , if you normally run 400s in 90 seconds , do fast reps at that length of time and do n't worry about distance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race itself , but before your speed workouts above and pace workouts below . Most novice runners do not warm up , except in the race itself . This is okay , because they 're more interested in finishing rather than finishing fast .

My usual warm-up is to jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy strides ( 100 meters at near race pace ) . And I usually cool down afterwards by doing half of the warm up . <p> Stretch &amp; Strengthen : Also important as part of the warm-up is stretching . Do n't overlook it--particularly on days when you plan to run fast .

Strength training is important too : push-ups , pull-ups , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Health Club . Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions , rather than pumping very heavy iron . Mondays and Thursdays would be good days to combine stretching and strengthening with your easy run , however , you can schedule strength training on any day that is convenient for your business and personal schedule . <p> Pace : A lot of runners look at my training schedules and ask , " What do you mean by ' pace ? ' " I mean " race pace , " the pace at which you expect to run the 8-K . Saturday workouts include some running at race pace to get you used to running the pace you will run in the race . However , somewhat like in the tempo runs , you want to start and finish running easy . In the accompanying schedules , I prescribe the total distance of the run plus the approximate amount of that distance that should be run at race pace . Thus , " 5 total/3 pace " means that in a 5-mile run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race pace . Obviously , you need to run on a course that has been pre-measured . If you ca n't find an accurately measured course , use a GPS watch or even your car odometer to at least approximate the mile splits ( realizing that car odometers are invariably somewhat inaccurate ) . <p> Stepback : Please notice that the mileage is slightly reduced during Weeks 3 and 6 . These are stepback weeks in which you relax your training--again slightly--to gather yourself for the next push upward in difficulty . I use stepback weeks in my marathon training programs and find that they provide not only a physical , but also a mental break . On Fridays during these stepback weeks , you might also want to choose rest instead of a 3-mile run to further reduce your mileage and increase your strength . <p> Long Runs : As an experienced runner , you probably already do a long run of around 60-90 minutes on the weekends anyway .

But forget I said that ! I do n't want you to go out and time yourself for 1.5 miles . In fact , your course does n't need to be precisely 1.5 miles . It can be about that distance . The easiest way to pick a course of 1.5 miles would be to get in your car and figure out how far you need to run to go about half that distance ( 0.75 miles ) , either from your home , from your office or from wherever you plan to run on Tuesdays . Then run this 0.75-mile course out and back . Do n't wear a watch , at least for the time being . <p> Wednesday : Three miles today . Yesterday I discussed how to find a 1.5 mile course , suggesting that you simply get in your car and measure approximately half that distance , then run it out and back . To select a 3-mile course , you obviously could either drive twice as far while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out and back again . Or if your 1.5-mile course is a " loop " course , meaning you circle around without retracing your steps , you run this loop twice . But consider selecting a completely different course , perhaps one in a scenic area frequented by other runners . Be inventive . At this stage in your workout , this is a " long " distance for you . You might as well make running as pleasant as possible--and , following last week 's advice , do n't be afraid to throw in occasional walking breaks if that 's what it takes to go the distance . <p> Thursday : Run 1.5 miles , the same as last week on Thursday , the same as this week on Tuesday . In fact , during the first three weeks of this program , you will do a half dozen runs at this distance . The simplest and easiest way to accomplish this is to run the same measured course each time . But consider having separate Tuesday and Thursday courses . Particularly as the mileage progresses , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Friday : A day of rest . I 've been focusing on course measurement for most of this week . You might even call this the " Theme for Week Two . " So if you 're looking for something to do with your extra time while not running today , go out and measure a series of courses from 1.5 through 6 miles . You 'll use them during the remaining weeks of this Spring Training program . <p> Saturday : Saturdays will continue to be walking days throughout the program , and from a time standpoint , you 'll be walking on Saturdays about the same length of time you 'll be running most Sundays . This is more from coincidence than from any deep design on my part . Today 's walking prescription is 35 minutes . And if tomorrow you run 3.5 miles at 10:00 pace , it would take you about 35 minutes . But do n't get hung up on time . Some of you may want to walk or run faster than others ; some of you may want to run or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The important goal is to achieve at your own level of ability . <p> Sunday : Today 's distance is 3.5 miles for your run . Just cover the distance . I do n't care how fast you run . In advising people training for a marathon , I usually recommend that they run 45 to 90 seconds slower than the pace at which they plan to run a marathon . But it 's too early for you to think marathon pace--if you even plan to run that distance . You may not even know how fast you can run a 5-K , and wo n't until you try . No problem . Do n't sweat the small details . Simply go out and run the prescribed 3.5-mile distance . And remember my earlier advice : if it 's too difficult to run that distance without stopping , either slow down or take some walking breaks in the middle of your run . And remind yourself : You 're doing great ! Today you 've finished your second week of serious training . <p> Running Tips : There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over another sport .

@@102096172 @6296172/ <h> Training <h> Spring Training - Intermediate Schedule , Week 6 <p> Monday : This week , your sixth in my 12-week Spring Training program , features a race on Sunday . It will give you an opportunity to test your fitness level . Also , for intermediate and advanced runners races offer an opportunity to push yourself beyond your normal training level . Too much racing can result in staleness , but occasional races can help you fine-tune your speed . The schedule suggests a 5-K race on Sunday , but if your local calendar offers a race at a different distance on a distance day--or even in a different week--do n't be afraid to adjust accordingly . Today being Monday , run an easy 3 miles to recover from yesterday 's long run and do some strength training . <p> Tuesday : Today 's run is 5 miles . I 've been running a long , long time and have finished more than 100 marathons , and I find this a comfortable distance for mid-week workouts . At the pace I currently run , it fills the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to be out running . One way to do this workout is to run half the distance in one direction , then stop to walk for a minute or two . Then turn around and--starting at the place you stopped--begin running again headed home . Often , I find myself running faster on the return journey than going out . That should not necessarily be your goal , but you might want to do this 5-miler at a pace slightly faster than your easy 3-milers on Monday and Thursday . <p> Wednesday : Today is Wednesday , so that means you probably are going to be asked to run hills . Let me check the schedule . Yep , that 's correct . Hal told me to do it ! Run 5 x hill . After six weeks in the program , this is your final hill workout . Next week on this day , you switch to the track and begin doing some interval training . Combining hill training with interval training in this manner was an approach pioneered by the New Zealand coach Arthur Lydiard , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Peter Snell ( 1960 , 64 : 800 , 1,500 ) . Jog a mile or two to warm up , then stretch , before tackling the hill . Cool down with a mile jog and do some more stretching afterwards . <p> Thursday : Three miles at an easy pace , then do some strength training . Learn to breathe right when you do your lifts . The worst mistake you can make while lifting is to hold your breath , warns personal trainer Cathy Vasto . That simply tightens the muscles that you want to keep loose . Inhale while you prepare to lift the weight , then exhale while lifting it , inhaling again while lowering it . " The best way to breathe is naturally , " says Vasto , " so that you 're not even aware you 're doing it . " <p> Friday : . Rest is always an important component of any training program . Sometimes rest is important for the mind as much as for the body . Although I love running and find that my day is not complete without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that not everybody feels the same way--yet ! So Friday is the day when you do n't have to think about what course you 're going to run or how to fit your workout into a busy schedule . You can even skip taking a shower , but if you brush your teeth , do n't forget to floss . Relax . Take a day off . <p> Saturday : This is the weekend when I send you to the starting line of a 5-K as a test of your fitness level . For this reason , I have programmed in an extra day of race--if you want to take it . Often I like to rest two days before a race , then use the day before to do some light jogging and stretching to loosen my muscles and also to relieve some of the pre-event nerves that come with competition . Typically , I jog a mile or so , sit down and do some easy stretching , then do 3 or 4 strides ( 100 meters at race pace ) , then jog another mile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : thinking of strategy , deciding what pace I plan to run , etc . Not every workout needs to be hard to contribute to your ability to compete . <p> Sunday : Race day . As your strategy , you might want to consider going out at a conservative pace in the first mile with your goal " reverse splits . " That is , try to run each successive mile faster than the one before . This takes some of the curse off the necessity to set a P.R . in this race , since the purpose is more to do some very fast running to compliment the rest of your program . When you cross the finish line and complete your cool-down jog , you will be halfway through this12-week Spring Training program ! Break out the champagne--or at least a bottle of Perrier . If you race on Saturday rather than Sunday , you may want to juggle the workouts around your race . This would mean resting on Thursday and Friday and using today for an easy run of about a half dozen miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep you running without limiting your ability to move fast . They are generally more comfortable and practical than the old floppy sweat pants runners once wore when I started running long before the Lycra Age . And actually they will not slow you down that much , if any . At least one study I saw suggested that tights allowed runners to run faster because they improved aerodynamics . I do n't know about that one , but I do know that at a certain temperature level , I will race in tights vs. shorts . The temperature dictating this switch is about 35 degrees , but wind chill and wet affects my decision . Other runners may have different comfort levels . Experience will tell you how to dress for different weather conditions . <p> How to Improve : Planning to run a marathon ?

Cross-train for 30-40 minutes : biking , swimming or walking and begin to consider doing some strength training . There is a subtle increase in mileage this week , so you want to make sure that you 're well-rested as you continue your post-marathon training .

The best time for doing that is immediately after your warm-up jog . <p> Thursday : Five easy miles . It seems that all I 've been saying for the last several days ( and several weeks ) is : " Take it easy ! Take it easy ! " Well , it 's true . That 's exactly what you should be doing . <p> Friday : Over the previous days , you 've run 4 , 5 and 4 miles for a total of 13 miles in three days .

Time to stay out a little later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing . <p> Saturday : Do a tempo run of 40 minutes . Begin by jogging about 10-12 minutes , then gradually accelerate to marathon pace for about 15-20 minutes in the middle . Notice that this should be a gradual acceleration , not a sudden increase from jog pace to marathon pace . Then gradually decelerate to the finish . As with all tempo runs , you should finish feeling invigorated , not overly fatigued . <p> Sunday : Today 's run is 90 minutes . This weekend , I 'm giving you no options . I want you to put in at least an hour and a half of running . Now that you 're in good shape , that should be almost the minimum time for any future long workouts you do in training . I do n't care how fast you run , just spend the time in motion . <p> TIP OF THE WEEK : Since 1974 , Jack H.

You should be capable of running 30 to 60 minutes a day , five to seven days a week and have a basic understanding of how to do speedwork . If that sounds like too much training , you might be more comfortable using one of the programs designed for novice or intermediate runners . <p> The program utilizes a countdown from Week 1 to Week 8 ( race week ) for a 10-K race . Let me explain the terms that follow . Further information and explanations are included in the daily emails that those signed up for the interactive programs on TrainingPeaks receive . <p> Runs : The runs of 3-6 miles on Mondays , Thursdays and Fridays are designed to be done at a comfortable pace . For those who use heart monitors , you would be running between 65 to 75 percent of maximum . <p> Rest : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fridays you are offered the option of resting or taking an easy 3-mile run . Be realistic about your fatigue level and do n't feel guilty if you decide to take a day off . Consider scheduling at least rest day before and/or after you race . <p> Tempo Runs : A tempo run is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near 10-K race pace . In this program , tempo runs are scheduled for Tuesdays . A Tempo Run of 30 to 40 minutes would begin with 10-15 minutes easy running , building to to peak pace for 10-20 minutes near the middle , then 5-10 minutes easy toward the end . The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden . You can do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , on trails or even on a track . <p> Speedwork : If you want to race at a fast pace , you need to train at a fast pace . Interval training , where you alternate fast running with jogging or walking , is a very effective form of speedwork . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 6 x 400 meters and peaks in Week 7 with 12 x 400 meters . Run the 400s at about the pace you would run in a mile or 1500 race . Walk or jog between each repeat . Best on a track , but these workouts can be done on the road or on trails , by running hard approximately the length of time you would run a 400 on the track . For more information on speed training , see my book , Run Fast . <p> Warm-up : Warming up is important , not only before the race itself , but before your speed workouts above and pace workouts below . My usual warm-up is to jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy strides ( 100 meters at near race pace ) . And I usually cool down afterwards by doing half of the warm up . <p> Strength : Consider adding some strength training two or three days a week . Best time is after an easy workout . I usualy recommend light weights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . Do n't forget stretching . <p> Pace : This is the pace at which you expect to run the 10-K . Saturday workouts include some running at race pace . Start and finish easy , similar to the tempo runs . In the accompanying schedules , I prescribe the total distance of the run plus the approximate amount of that distance that should be run at race pace . Thus , " 5 total/3 pace " means that in a 5-mile run , three of those miles should be done at your 10K race pace . <p> Race : As an advanced runner you can benefit from at least a few test races to fine-tune your fitness . Thus , I 've scheduled a 5-K race and an 8-K race for Weeks 4 and 6 . If you ca n't find races at those exact distances in your area , use whatever convenient races are available . Juggle days and weeks if necessary . And if that does n't work , you can always do a time trial at the suggested distance . <p> Long Runs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Run at a comfortable , conversational pace , except on those days where a 3/1 workout is prescribed . A " 3/1 " workout is one in which you run the first three-fourths of the distance at a comfortable pace , then accelerate to near race pace over the last one quarter of the workout . If Sunday is n't a convenient day for your long runs , feel free to do them on Saturday--or any other day of the week for that matter . <p> This 10-K training schedule is only a guide .

The first person of record to run from London to Brighton was F. F. Randall , who took 6:58 to cover the distance in 1899 .

Unfortunately so , for by the mid-way point Garlepp and Elderfield had wilted like the crease of trousers in a London rain . <p> John Tarrant of the Hereford L.I.T.A . ( Light Infantry Territorial Army ) then moved to the front . Tarrant led to around 35 miles or where most super-marathoners will tell you the race begins . Gomersall closed on him . One of the officials following the race described the action : " As soon as Gomersall caught Tarrant they had a bit of a ding dong for a while . Then Gomersall got a 50-yard lead and Tarrant walked off the course .

" Gomersall extended his lead over Corbitt to five minutes in the next five miles and held it to crumple , as much from joy as fatigue , into the arms of his father , Sydney and his wife , Ruth , at the finish line . " Brighton Welcomes You , " said the sign in red letters on the steel pier that nearby jetted out into the channel . <p> Afterwards , they asked Corbitt , who is 45 years old compared to Gomersalls 33 , if he would go back in 1966 . <p> He smiled and shrugged : " It gets harder and harder . " <p> Gomersalls handler Peter Goodsel meanwhile provided a blow-by-blow description for reporters : " Last year Corbitt came back a lot at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked early .

Garlepp , the other early leader , finished 10th . Of the other Americans , Nat Cirulnick and Vinnie Kern finished too far back to help their team . Aldo Scandurra , bothered by sciatica , dropped out at 20 miles . John Kelly , an Irishman by way of Australia where he was light heavyweight boxing champion ( and no relation to two other better-known John Kelleys ) , quit at 45 miles troubled by varicose veins . " Its a devil when you have to stop after that far , " he said . <p> In running a race like Brighton , the athletes reach a plateau of pain perhaps unapproached in any other athletic competition . Running a 440-yard dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-quarters of a minute . A super-marathon , on the other hand , drags on for the better part of a day . It is the difference between burning your finger with a match or being slowly roasted over a hot skillet . <p> Apart from the Brighton , the only other important international super-marathon is the Comrades Marathon , which covers 54 miles between Pietermaritzburg and Durban , South Africa . Bernard Gomersall previously won the Comrades Marathon in record time , but the State Department frowns on American participation in South Africa because of the apartheid problem . Anyway , the only world-class American super-marathoner , Ted Corbitt , is a Negro . <p> " It was very painful , " Gomersall admitted while soaking in a steaming tub in the Brighton baths shortly after his victory . He is an intense-looking individual with deep eyes and short hair . He spoke rapidly out of enthusiasm over his win . " It was mostly the mental strain . Nobody had ever won the race three times . In the first few miles all the people were going away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I worried from start to finish . It was the least enjoyable of all the Brightons . " He has run six . In preparing for this one he averaged 100 miles a week in training , often as much as 55 miles in two long runs over the weekend . Twice a week he would run the four miles from home to where he works as a laboratory clerk . Later on those evenings he would do interval running ( quarters , halves , and miles ) on a track with his wife , Ruth , holding the stopwatch . The couple have a five-year-old daughter named Bernadette . <p> Why would anyone want to make a hobby of running 54 miles ? Bernard quite frankly admits it is the only distance he ever clicked at . Although he has run a reasonably fast ( for a marathoner ) 4:35 mile , his swiftest clocking for three miles is a non-Ron Clarkian 15:30 , and his marathon best is a barely respectable 2:31 . <p> " With all due respects to Bernard Gomersall , " said J. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and County Harriers , " he could no more win a 15-mile race in this country than fly . " <p> In general , super-marathoners are older than regular marathoners , who are older than 10,000-meter runners , who are older than milers , who as youths ( if they ran at all ) could find no races other than midget 60-yard dashes . Ted Corbitts first track and field competition was an intramural 60-yard dash in junior high school , and he won . Born 45 years ago on a farm in South Carolina , Corbitt ran the 220-yard dash while attending the University of Cincinnati and graduated to long-distance running only after a tour in the Navy during the war . He has finished sixth in the Boston Marathon three times , once unofficially when the examining doctors at the start thought his heart just did n't  sound right . Since then he always brings his own medical certificate to races , and sits around nervously quiet until he has been approved . <p> AS A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN OLYMPIC TEAM in 1952 , Corbitt placed 44th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way to double the marathon distance . He runs 100 miles a week and occasionally 200 miles . On certain days he will rise at four in the morning and cover 30 miles by first doing 52 laps around a 440-yard track near his home in the Bronx , then running around the bottom of Manhattan to the Institute for Crippled and Disabled Children , where he works as a physical therapist . In preparing for this years Brighton , over the Labor Day weekend he had three 60-mile days in succession , each workout taking over 10 hours , during which period all he did was wake , eat , run , eat , and then fall back in bed to rest for the following days workout . Corbitt has a 14-year-old son , Gary , who is also interested in track . <p> Ted Corbitt first ran the Brighton in 1962 . " I finished fourth and really suffered , " says the physical therapist in him . " The fatigue manifested itself by an extreme pain in the lower quadriceps . " For two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , and couldnt . " To run you have to be able to get your feet off the ground . I could n't . " <p> Another American who learned the definition of pain not ordinarily found in the dictionary was John Garlepp , who could n't take time from his job as an elevator repairman in the Seventh Avenue garment district and flew to London only the Thursday night before the Saturday race , getting no sleep on the plane and arriving Friday morning . That night he retired in his London hotel at eight , only to awaken three hours later . Because of the time difference , it was then six in the evening in New York , and he could n't get back to sleep . He eventually dragged out of bed at 5:30 a.m. for a pre-race meal , only to be confronted by the typical continental breakfast of tea and toast . Garlepp finally talked the waiter into bringing two raw eggs , which he drank with apparent relish . <p> He led to the mid-way point , then faded . Three runners passed him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few hundred yards only to lose ninth place by the width of a quadriceps . He slumped onto the first flat surface which happened to be a table and moaned : " I almost fell asleep on the road . " <p> At one point he got a cramp in his stomach , undoubtedly the aftermath of those raw eggs . In an attempt to relieve the cramp , Garlepp lay down by the side of the road and attempted to sit up . He not only failed in this , but could n't get back to his feet . He had to roll over on his stomach and rise , using his knees . Later he slowed to a walk while accepting a glass of water . " You 're not going to pack it in , are you ? " asked an official .

( Although this program was designed for The Lasalle Bank , sponsors of the Shuffle , we are happy to have you use it to prepare for the race of your choice . ) Your long run yesterday was 6 miles . This week we will ratchet your training slightly upward to 32 total miles with a 7-miler on Sunday . Today is a day of comparative rest . Run 3 miles and do some strength training afterwards . Do n't forget to stretch also . <p> Tuesday : Today 's tempo run is 35 minutes . Start easy for the first 5-10 minutes until you are well warmed-up . Then begin a gradual acceleration until you achieve a comfortably hard pace , close to the pace you are going to run in the 8-K . ( Notice I said " close to . " Obviously it would be impossible--or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) This central portion of the tempo run should last maybe 15-20 minutes with about 5 minutes of that time at the fast pace . Then ease back into the same easy pace at which you began the workout . All the pace transitions should be smooth , not sudden . This workout works best on a soft , forest trail if one is available where you live . <p> Wednesday : Head to the track . Your workout for today is 7 x 400 at your 1500 or mile pace with a 400 jog/walk between . Remember : that 's the pace at which you run a single mile , not your pace for 5 or 6 miles . If you can run a mile in 6:00 at maximum effort , you would run your 400s in about 90 seconds . ( Notice that I said " about . " External factors , such as weather , may affect your ability to hit each 400 exactly . ) Jog a couple of miles before to warm up and about the same distance after to cool down . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 100 meters at the pace you plan to run in the workout will also help you loosen up before starting 400 number one . <p> Thursday : Run 5 miles and add some stretching and strengthening after you finish the run . Give some thought to the " when " as well as the " how far " of this workout . Most runners run in the morning , because that 's a convenient time , particularly for those who have a 9-to-5 job . And it insures that you get your run in , since things can interfere if you plan to run at lunch or in the evening . But if you 're preparing for the Shamrock Shuffle at the end of March , that means running in the dark . You might want to consider whether or not you can find time mid-day to do this and other mid-week workouts . Even if you have only an hour for lunch , you may be able to run , shower and grab a quick snack at your desk ( yogurt , a glass of juice ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline , but often the discipline involves activities around the run as well as the run itself . <p> Friday : Thank God It 's Friday . ( TGIF ) There 's even a restaurant chain that uses that name . For many of us who love to run , we do n't always want a day off . For that reason , you may want to get in a 3-miler . Nevertheless , it 's important to program rest days so that you do n't overtrain and set yourself up for injuries . Selecting Fridays as rest days works well , because I always ask the runners who train using my programs to do a bit more on the weekends when they have more time . <p> Saturday : Today 's pace run is 4 miles with half ( 2 miles ) of that distance at race pace . What ? You have n't run an 8-K recently and are uncertain about your current level of fitness ? You can estimate your 8-K time by using one of several prediction charts that can make estimates based on how fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or various other distances . Go to the on-line version of Runner 's World and check the training site on the left of the screen . <p> Sunday : Today is the day when you run long , and today 's long run is 7 miles . That 's only a mile further than last week , but subtle mileage changes work best . Run this at a comfortable pace 45 to 90 seconds slower than your race pace . If you 're feeling frisky , pick up the pace a bit in the last 2 miles , but do n't feel you have to finish in a sprint because I gave the green light . And be cautious about dueling with training partners , since excessive hard running is counterproductive . Consistency is what counts . <p> Run Fast : If you 're a beginner , running fast means merely getting started . If you 've never run before , except when you were a child ( when running was perceived as fun and not as hard work ) , simply to jog for a few hundred meters is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same distance .

Clearly , overhydration can be as dangerous to your health as underhydration . So what does a sweaty endurance runner need to know about staying adequately hydrated without stomach sloshing ? Dr. Timothy Noakes ' book Waterlogged : The Serious Problem of Overhydration in Endurance Sports is an interesting yet controversial resource that addresses that question . <p> According to Dr. Noakes , the sports drink industry has effectively marketed a positive image ( successful athletes ) despite having an overhyped product ( salted sugar-water ) . Noakes believes the sports drink industry has brainwashed athletes to overhydrateand this has created life-threatening problems . For example , between 1983 and 1998 , more than 700 cases of exercise-induced hyponatremia ( overhydration that leads to low blood sodium , brain swelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gatorade-sponsored Ironman Hawaii Triathlon . The participants had been encouraged to drink copiously . Did that advice backfire ? For the Comrades Marathon , participants were told to drink according to thirst . Race organizers placed aid stations every 5 km ( 3 miles ) , and cases of hyponatremia dropped . <p> The information in Waterlogged challenges the theory drink before you get thirsty . Noakes believes elite athletes who become champions can tolerate significant sweat loss without intolerable thirst . He contends the associated weight lost via sweating enhances performance . Others question if those athletes could run better if better hydrated ! <p> Below are a few droplets of less-controversial hydration information to help you quench your thirst , perform well , and stay out of the medical tent when you are doing extended exercise in hot weather . <p> Our bodies can deal with transient underhydration that lasts from 4 to 8 hours . In contrast , chronic dehydration leads to health issuessuch as happens when elderly people are trapped in hot apartments during a heat wave . <p> Most runners feel thirsty at about 2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for water . Ultrarunners can maintain performance at 3% dehydration . ( To determine your percent dehydration , weigh yourself naked before and after your workout . A one-pound drop equates to a loss of 16-ounces of sweat ; 2% dehydration equates to a 3-pound sweat loss for a 150-lb. runner . ) <p> Thirst is a powerful fluid regulator . Noakes disapproves of the advice to drink before you are thirsty because that can create problems with overhydration . Yet , others contend drinking on a schedule can help endurance runners maintain proper hydration , as long as they do not aggressively overhydrate but rather replace fluids according to their sweat losses ( as learned during training via pre-post exercise weigh-ins ) . <p> The amount of sodium lost in sweat varies from person to person . Some runners are salty sweaters . Runners accustomed to exercising in the heat retain more sodium than unacclimatized runners . ( Compare the saltiness of your sweat on first hot day of spring vs. in the fall . ) <p> Athletes lose relatively more water than sodium , so under standard conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( unless you overhydrate ) . But with abnormally high sodium high losses , such as during an ultramarathon , blood sodium can be low even in a dehydrated runner . Hence , sodium replacement can be a wise idea . <p> The amount of sodium in a sports drink is smalland unable to counter the dilution of body fluids that occurs with over-drinking . The 220 milligrams of sodium in 16 ounces of Gatorade is far less than 1000 milligrams of sodium in 16 ounces of sweat loss . <p> Noakes says evidence is lacking to prove that runners who cramp have low serum sodium or are more dehydrated than non-crampers . He suggests muscle cramps are related to fatigue , not sodium deficiency . If sodium deficiency were the problem , would n't the entire body cramp , not just one muscle ? <p> Exercise-induced muscle cramps occur in muscles that perform repetitive contractions . Runners who get cramps tend to be those who do high intensity exercise , as well as those who have a history of cramping . Note : Many exercise scientists believe there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others related to sodium imbalance . The science of cramping lacks a clear consensus ! <p> A 2.5 oz. mouthful of ( salty ) pickle juice has been shown to alleviate muscle cramping within 90 seconds of drinking the pickle juice . This rapid benefit is unlikely due to changes in blood sodium levelstoo quick ! Noakes speculates drinking the ( acidic ) pickle juice triggers a reflex in the throat that lessens or stops the cramps . <p> A runner who collapses after the finish line is most likely experiencing blood pressure changesnot severe dehydration . When exercise stops , the heart stops pumping enough blood to the brain ; the runner collapses . What to do ? Noakes advises to quickly raise the athletes feet and pelvis above the level of their heart . This aids the return of blood to the heart and rapidly corrects the situationwithout any IV fluids . <p> So what 's a sweaty endurance runner supposed to do during prolonged exercise ? Learn your sweat rate and drink accordingly . If fluid in your stomach starts " sloshing " , stop drinking ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women/ men ) . Adding carbohydrates and sodium to the water enhances fluid absorption as well as palatability and performance . Consuming " real " foods ( salty pretzels , pickles , chicken broth , ham-cheese-mustard wrap ) during ultraendurance events can do a fine job of providing needed electrolytes .

This is a week with a 5-K race planned for the weekend . Hopefully you have one in mind .

On this day of relative rest , consider how well you are being served by your running shoes , both those you use in training and in races ( assuming you also have a lighter pair for when you want to run fast ) . Are they beginning to wear ? Will you need to replace them soon ? If so , you might want to get a new pair now and gradually break them in on easy days like today , rather than having to suddenly switch to a new pair .

Warm up by jogging a mile or two before running your hill repeats and cool down with about a mile afterwards . Think " 1500/mile " pace while heading up the hill . Most hard workouts should feel about the same , regardless of how long and how fast . The numbers may change as you gradually get in better shape , but your perception of them as difficult should not . Any time that you finish a workout exhausted , you probably have run too hard . If you 're training properly , you should finish each workout looking forward to your next workout . <p> Wednesday : Three miles for today 's midweek run followed by stretching . Since running a 5-K race at the end of this week will add extra stress to your total work week , I ask you to cut back on mileage making this more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four weeks of the Spring Training program . The two most important factors for improvement , claims Coach Jack Daniels , are consistency and moderation . Consistency means identifying long-range goals to work toward while achieving short-range goals , such as this weekend 's 5-K . If you allow enough time for your long-range goals , you can employ moderation . You wo n't need to overtrain . " Doing unbelievably strenuous workouts in order to get in shape fast does n't work , " says Daniels . <p> Thursday : Today 's workout is a 30-minute tempo run , shortened from the 45 minutes you did last week because of the 5-K race scheduled for the weekend . Remember : three or four hard workouts a week are probably all you need as an advanced runner . And most of these hard workouts ( including today 's tempo run ) do n't have to be that hard . The secret is to continue at a steady level throughout the year , limiting the amount of time you lose either because of injury or because of mental fatigue . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I usually do my tempo runs at Indiana Dunes State Park , a beautifully scenic spot where the trails ( both flat and hilly ) are perfect for training .

You want to look good lifting--not for vanity , but to prevent injury . Think 90-degrees . Most seated lifts work best if your body parts are at right angles : legs straight , feet flat against the floor , trunk erect , chin up , eyes forward . Practice the pelvic tilt where you press your torso back against the chair , or floor , to keep your back from slumping .

While you might be able to find better " bargains " at chain stores in the mall , it 's better to shop in a specialty store owned by runners who understand our sport . ( Please note the purposeful use of the word " our . " ) <p> Sunday : Run a 5-K race today , and I hope you can find a convenient race at this distance in your area .

Race hard enough to get the feel of the wind in your hair , but do n't get too nervous about today 's competition . Consider it more a speed trial than a chance for peak performance . I 'll give you another chance to run a 5-K toward the end of the program when you can go for a P.R . <p> Running Tips : Running faster than race pace from time to time will help develop your basic speed , which can be translated into better performances .

Conversely , manufacturers have begun to produce shoes designed for running in snow as opposed to crossing deep drifts . Snowshoe races have begun to attract runners and cross-country skiers in the northern states . Many of the better ski stores now carry snowshoes , but if you 're an endurance athlete , make sure that you purchase narrow shoes suitable for moving fast . If the salesperson does n't know what you 're talking about , find another store . <p> Ski resorts lately have begun to provide snowshoeing tours for their guests , both skiers and those who do not ski . During a recent visit to Crested Butte in Colorado , my wife Rose and I signed up for such a tour with three of our grandchildren : Kyle , Wesley and Angela .

And it 's fun if you 're a cross-country skier as well . <p> Once you get the snowshoes on your feet , you 'll be surprised how easy it is to walk or run on them . The learning curve for a fit person is about 30 seconds . Just start walking or running . No expensive lessons necessary . You can wear boots , but I just wear my regular running shoes . The best kind to wear are those designed for running on trails , since they usually offer more protection , including a tight fit around the ankle so snow ca n't get in .

Barney once set an American record for 50 miles ; Janis won the 1992 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials . The trials were held midwinter in Houston , so much of her pre-race training was on snowshoes . One advantage of wearing snowshoes is that there is little impact . Barney and Janis found that they could do a hard snowshoe run and come back the following day and run hard on the roads . In fact , after one summer stress fracture , Janis rehabbed by running on snowshoes on the golf course . <p> I 'll don snowshoes on occasions when there is snow , but snow that is not much fun to ski on . If the snow is deep untracked , I 'll use my snowshoes to beat down a track so I can return later with skis .

And there are areas , because of hills coupled with dense vegetation ( trees and bushes ) , that may resist the efforts of even the best back-country skiers to penetrate .

( You 've just come off two days of tough training . ) Most important is to get out and cover the distance at a comfortable pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8-K race , and I 'm asking you to run it on a weekday . Distance is less a problem with advanced runners ; time is . It 's not easy always to find time to run close to an hour a day , but it 's essential if you want to achieve a peak performance . <p> Friday : Rest is particularly important in this penultimate week of the 8-K training program . I have your longest run planned for you over the weekend . That being the case , you might want to skip the 3-miler you might otherwise have done today and opt for complete rest . <p> Saturday : Today 's pace run is 5 miles with 3 of those miles at or near race pace . What do you plan to eat for dinner tonight ? You might experiment with the meal you plan to have the night before the Shamrock Shuffle . A meal rich in complex carbohydrates usually works best ; that 's one reason why runners usually opt for pasta the night before their marathons , but it makes sense for 8-K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 miles , several miles further than your race distance . Coupled with yesterday 's pace run and the hard workouts earlier in the week , that 's a lot of stress . Make this a dress rehearsal for everything you plan to do on race day , from clothing to shoes to warm-up to fluids taken during the run . For those running the Shuffle , this is your final tune-up for success . Note also that this is designated as a " 3/1 " workout , meaning that you run the first + of the distance ( 6 miles ) at your usual relaxed , long-run pace , then run the final + of the distance ( 2 miles ) at an up tempo . No sprinting at the end , but finish strong . Next week , we taper . <p> Run Fast : No matter how fit you may be from other physical activities , when you begin to run you 're probably going to experience sore muscles .

But if you want to become a fast runner , you may need to accept some soreness as a natural part of the conditioning process . After your muscles recover , they actually should be stronger . 79546 @qwx939546 
@@102096183 @6296183/ <h> Training <h> Marathon Training Guide - Marathon 3 <p> All my marathon training programs follow a logical progression from Novice to Intermediate to Advanced , with two stages at each level . Lately , based on comments by runners visiting my Virtual Training Message Boards , I have become aware of a need for a new and different marathon training program , one to fit conveniently between my two novice programs and the the intermediate program following . <p> I have decided to call this program Marathon 3 . <p> It features three running days a week . It climaxes with three 20-mile runs . Stepback weeks come every third week in a program lasting 24 weeks . <p> Marathon 3 is designed for experienced runners , those who have been running for several years , who enjoy running road races between 5-K and the marathon , but who find it difficult to run more often than three times a week . Perhaps it is because of a lack of time or perhaps it is because too frequent running raises their risk of injury . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <p> It features three days of running a week , but somewhat more mileage on each of those days . I also have lengthened the program from 18 to 24 weeks , providing a longer ramp for the ramp-up . And to make room for three long runs of 20 miles . Yes , there remains ample mileage in Marathon 3 to get you ready to run 26 miles 385 yards . <p> Another innovative feature of Marathon 3 : The stepback weeks are true stepback weeks . In most of my other marathon training programs , I cut back only on the long-run mileage . In Marathon 3 , I cut back at least slightly on that weeks other workouts too . <p> The stepback weeks on the schedule below are easy to identify . At least at the beginning of the schedule , they come every third week . Toward the end of the program , once you begin doing 20-milers , you step back every other week . After the final 20-miler comes the taper to ready you for the marathon . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , the terms in the schedule should be self-explanatory . And if you sign up for the interactive version of Marathon 3 , you 'll received daily directions by email , but let me offer explanations anyway of the workouts you 'll be asked to do each day . <p> Monday-Rest : If you expect to train properly , rest is essential . Mondays ( and Fridays ) are rest days . This is to allow you to recover from the tough training you do on the weekends . <p> Tuesday-Run : A day of easy running , similar to the Sorta-Long runs in my other marathon programs . You begin in Week 1 with 3 miles and peak in Weeks 17 , 19 and 21 with 10 miles . Run at a comfortable pace , slow enough so that can hold a conversation with a training partner without getting too out of breath . Do n't  force the pace on these Tuesday workouts under the mistaken belief that this will make you a better runner . It may not . You dramatically increase your risk of injury when you overtrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Wednesday-Bike : I prescribe bicycle riding for Wednesday , because most runners enjoy getting out on their bikes . But you could just as easily pick another aerobic discipline : walking , swimming , cross-country skiing . If you enjoy strength training , this might be a good day to pump some iron . If you want a fourth day of running , do it today . Because of the variability of various exercises , I prescribe this workout in minutes , not miles . Note that there is a gradual increase in time as the program continues : 30 minutes increasing to 60 minutes . <p> Thursday-Run : The " hard " workout of the week , because you run somewhat faster . On Thursdays , you alternate pace runs , tempo runs and regular runs . A pace run is one where you run at your marathon pace . A tempo run is one that starts easy and builds to a peak midway through the run before finishing easy . And every third week , you do an easy run . <p> Friday--Rest : Friday is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because runners train hardest on the weekends when they have more time . Do n't  compromise your weekend workouts by thinking you have to do something extra on Friday . <p> Saturday-Long Run : If you 're training for a marathon , long runs are obviously the most important workout of the week . The progression begins with a 6-mile workout and increases one mile a week to peak at 20 miles on Weeks 17 , 19 and 21 . Long runs should be conducted at a pace slower than you plan to run in a marathon . Running too long and too fast and too often will simply wear you out and prevent you from achieving your goals . <p> Sunday-Cross-Training : If you enjoy biking on Wednesdays , you may want to climb back on your bike on Sundays too . Nothing wrong with that . But consider other aerobic exercises : walking , swimming , cross-country skiing ( in season ) . Given the variety of different exercises , the prescription is in time , not distance . You cross-train an hour in Week 1 and progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to flipflop workouts ( cross-training on Saturdays and running on Sundays ) , that is okay too . <h> Some further explanations : <p> Strength Training : I strongly endorse strength training for runners : for general fitness as much as for making you a faster runner . If you strength train regularly , you do n't  need to stop while preparing for a marathon , but if new to this activity you may not want to begin . I recommend light weights and high repetitions . Mondays and Wednesdays might be good days on which to strength train , depending on your schedule . <p> Races : For experienced runners , twenty-four weeks is a long time to go without some races , so I suggest you consider entering some races , but do n't  feel obligated to do so or to follow the schedule exactly as it is written . Distance is unimportant , although if you need feedback on marathon pace , the half marathon is your best predictor . <p> Tempo Runs : I 've used this term for years to describe a workout featuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , define Tempo Runs as workouts run at a fast and continuous pace . Regardless , when I ask you to do a Tempo Run , it means that you start easy , then gradually accelerate to near 10-K pace halfway through the workout . Hold that pace for five minutes or more , then gradually slow down . I prescribe time rather than distance and suggest that you get off the roads and into the woods where you can listen to your body rather than run to the rhythm of a GPS watch . Tempo Runs should be intuitive . <p> Those signing up for one of my interactive programs available from TrainingPeaks will receive further instructions plus tips on training in the emails I will be sending you daily . This is Marathon 3 . Good luck using it to train for your next marathon .. 
@@102096184 @6296184/ <h> Training <h> 8-K Training Guide - Intermediate Program - Week 8 <p> Monday : It 's time to taper . In this situation , it 's a matter of listening to your body to determine whether or not a bit of rest would help with your final push . In my marathon training program , I ask runners to spend the last three weeks of an 18-week program tapering and regaining strength so they can run the race . In an eight-week 8-K program it seems appropriate to taper the final week . If yesterday 's 7-miler seemed difficult to you , that 's because it came at the end of a hard week of training . The Shamrock Shuffle will come at the end of this easy week of training , and I think you 'll find being rested will allow you to both finish and enjoy what is a truly great race . Today is the day you stretch and strengthen after a 3-mile run . But do n't pump iron too hard ; you should taper your strength training too . <p> Tuesday : In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 miles today . As with previous Tuesday workouts , keep a comfortable pace . <p> Wednesday : Today 's interval workout takes a drop down : 4 x 400 meters with a 400/walk/jog between . Keep the pace of the repeats consistent , however : 5-K pace . Usually in any taper , I tell runners to maintain the quality ( i.e. , pace ) of their previous workouts , while cutting the quantity ( i.e. , distance ) . <p> Thursday : The 1-3 miles run today is a cutback from the usual 3-4 miles I ask you to do on Thursdays . Any miles you run at this late stage in your training will not get you in better shape and could tire you out . So run mainly to loosen up--and keep from going crazy ! Also , skip the weights today . For those of you preparing for an 8-K race not scheduled for Sunday , juggle the workouts accordingly . Today might be a day of complete rest if you 're racing on Saturday . <p> Friday : Rest for the weekend 's race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a Sunday race , it 's okay to go out and do some light jogging coupled with stretching . Often I 'll throw in 3-4 easy strides of about 100 meters near race pace just to loosen my legs , but this works only for experienced runners . <p> Saturday : A day of rest . Pick as food choice for dinner something that will be easily digested . Tonight is probably not the night for prime ribs or chili and beans . Get a good night 's sleep , but do n't worry if you have a hard time getting to sleep because of nervous anticipation . That 's natural . The sleep that you stored up during the week will send you to the starting line well rested . <p> Sunday : This is the day you prepared for : the Shamrock Shuffle . You 'll be one of 15,000 people standing on the starting line in Grant Park just east of Chicago 's Loop skyscrapers . It 's an impressive sight . While this might sound intimidating to some , you know that the excitement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shared interests will help carry you to the finish line . Before you know it , you 'll be past the 4-mile mark program coming through the Loop and heading for the finish line . Smile when you cross that line . It will be a great experience , but one I know you will want to repeat again . For some of those following my novice schedules , this will be the only road race they may run during their lifetimes . For others , particularly those living in the Chicago area , it will be the only race until they do until The LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon later in the fall . Maybe you did n't set a PR for your running career , but you certainly set a 8-K PR for this year , or this week , or that day . That 's fine . Take and enjoy your victories when you get them . But for many in the intermediate and advanced programs , this 8-K will be a springboard to other races , perhaps to a marathon . If so , be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare you for that popular race . <p> Run Fast : Beware overtraining . If you train too hard , you may compromise your performance because of excessive fatigue--or you may even become injured . Warning signs for overtrained runners are restlessness at night , a slightly elevated pulse rate just before rising , or dead legs and a general feeling of fatigue . Race times suffer , too . You 're likely to catch colds because of lowered resistance . A certain amount of muscle soreness and stiffness is a natural part of the training process , but if symptoms of fatigue persist for more than two or three days , do n't take an aspirin or see a doctor as you might for that cold . The best advice is simply to cut mileage until you recover your pep . 79546 @qwx939546 
@@102096185 @6296185/ <h> Training <h> Boston Bound <h> How to Train for the Boston Athletic Association Marathon <p> This Boston Bound Training Program is designed specifically for those runners talented or dedicated enough to have qualified for the Boston Athletic Association Marathon . It assumes an already high level of fitness , otherwise you would not have been able to meet Boston 's strict qualifying standards . If a long run of 14 miles in only the second week sounds too far , you probably need to pick another training program . Also , unlike my usual 18-week marathon training programs , Boston Bound is only 12 weeks long , beginning in late January for the April race . Its increments are designed to prepare you for the unique challenge that Boston presents . Finally , it includes only a two-week taper , not three as in most of my other marathon programs . <p> To understand the logic of this program , you must consider the profile of the traditional point-to-point course from suburban Hopkinton into downtown Boston , as described on pp. 144-145 of my book , Boston : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1995 of that book is now out of print , but a text-only version is available on Kindle . And Amazon also offers some " used " copies available at prices from $3.05 to ( would you believe this ? ) $900.00 . Click here for more information . <p> The course starts at a height of 462 feet above sea level in Hopkinton , drops precipitously , particularly in the first mile and a half , rolls , descends again through about 4 miles , then flattens somewhat with an occasional hill before bottoming out at 49 feet above sea level at Lower Newton Falls ( 16 miles ) . Then begin a series of four hills--what Coach Bill Squires calls the Killer Chain--culminating in the infamous Heartbreak Hill ( 21 miles ) . It is not so much the height of the hills ( Heartbreak is only 236 feet above sea level ) , but where they come in the race that poses difficulty for marathoners who have failed to prepare for them . <p> The final 5 miles to the finish line on Boylston Street present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet above sea level , and it is here where the legs of unprepared runners take a beating . If you enter this stretch fatigued and unable to maintain running form--particularly if forced back onto your heels--you will pound the muscles of your lower legs to pulp . This is why you see runners heading home at Logan Airport late on a Monday walking with the stiff legs of the Frankenstein Monster . It is also why their strategy descending stairs for a week after the race will consist of walking down those stairs backwards . <p> The important message here is that to prepare for Boston--and the aftermath of Boston--you must condition your legs by training on hills , not only many of your long runs , but also hill repeats , both up and down hills . You must also lift weights to strengthen your legs : specifically the quadriceps muscles , but also the calf and hamstring muscles . To fail in this regard is to invite injury and to insure an inferior performance . This Boston Bound Training Program takes this message seriously . <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frozen North is that they must train through a winter when snow and ice may make it difficult to match their usual training pace in the spring or fall . Speedwork--at least outdoors--may be out of the question . This is only a problem if you make it a problem . This Boston Bound Training Program will help you succeed . One cold weather strategy is that many of the long runs are prescribed in hours and minutes rather than in miles . <p> The Boston Bound Training Program consists of the following workouts on various days of the week : Monday : Run Easy . In my Boston Bound Training Program , Mondays are easy days with short runs that begin at 3 miles in the first week , then move upward to 4 and 5 miles . The main purpose of the workout is to do some easy miles while recovering from one hard workout and getting ready for another one . If you have access to a fitness center , you might want to do this workout on a treadmill , then do some strength training afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart rate . <p> Tuesday : Run Fast . On alternate Tuesdays , run either fast 800 repeats at the track ( Yasso Repeats ) or hill repeats on a hill that could be almost any length between 200 and 800 meters , as long as running up it pushes you into the 80 to 90 percent maximum zone . Because Boston is a downhill course , run every third repeat downhill to strengthen your legs for the pounding they will get in the marathon . <p> Wednesday : Run Easy . Similar to Monday , do a short and easy run today , coupling this run ( outdoors or indoors ) with some stretching and strength training . Stay in the 65 to 75 percent comfort zone . <p> Thursday : Run Fast . Weather permitting , you will do a Tempo Run on most days . I define a Tempo Run as one where you start easy at a jogging warm-up pace ( 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate ) , then after a mile or two , begin to gradually accelerate to just slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your maximum heart rate ) . Then , after holding that fast pace for 3 to 5 minutes , gradually decelerate and finish the run at the same jogging pace at which you started . While I suggest Thursdays for Tempo Runs , be aware of weather conditions . Feel free to shift your Tempo Run--or any other prescribed workout--to the day of the week most convenient for you . <p> Friday : Rest . Fridays are rest days in all my programs . You need to be well rested to obtain maximum benefit from the tougher workouts on the weekends . <p> Saturday : Pace Training . Saturday runs vary from 8 to 4 miles with about half of them done at marathon pace . I say this despite the fact that it may be very difficult to achieve your normal marathon pace in bad weather while wearing heavy clothes and with snow and ice on the pavement . So you do the best you can , knowing that as Boston approaches the weather should warm allowing you to hit the pace you want . Two possibilities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a heart rate monitor to measure how hard you are working . I would shoot for 75 to 80 percent of your maximum heart rate . Please note in the schedule below that I suggest doing several test races to measure your fitness level and provide motivation . I suggest a 5-K , a 10-K and/or a Half Marathon . If you ca n't find races at those distances on the days I suggest , adjust your schedule accordingly . <p> Sunday : Run Long . Because winter weather conditions can impact your ability to run certain distances , every other Sunday the long run prescription is in minutes rather than miles . This recognizes the fact that 14 miles in difficult weather can be the Moral Equivalent of 16 or 18 miles in perfect conditions . When the prescription is in minutes , you do n't need to worry about distance . Just run your best effort . I do n't care how far or fast you run in your allotted time ; I simply want you out running . Even runners with access to a treadmill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week to run long . Stay in the 65 to 75 percent comfort zone . For the time-based runs , I suggest doing them as a 3/1 run , where the first 3/4 of the run is done at an easy pace , picking up the pace in the last 1/4 of the distance . Your goal at Boston also should be to finish faster , or as fast , as your started . Time-based training aside , miles do have their place in any training program , so every other Sunday I suggest you do run specific distances . If you would rather do your long runs on Saturday rather than Sunday , feel free to modify the program . In fact , weather conditions on any one day may force changes in your planned program .

This article offers droplets of information to enhance your water IQ , optimize your water balance , and help you feel &amp; perform better . <p> You do n't  have to drink plain water to get adequate water into your body . All fluids count , as do foods that have a high water .

For example , blood is approximately 93% water , muscle is about 73% water , and body fat is about 10% water . Water constantly moves between the inside and the outside of cells .

( 250-500 ml ) water per day during normal metabolic processes . During a marathon , a runners muscles can produce that much water over 2 to 3 hours . When muscles burn glycogen , they simultaneously release about 2.5 units water for each one unit of muscle glycogen ; this helps protect against dehydration . <p> Coffee is a popular source of water . Although once thought to have a diuretic effect , current research indicates coffee ( in amounts normally consumed ) hydrates as well as water over a 24-hour period . That is , after drinking coffee , you may urinate sooner , but you will not urinate more than you consume . Army research on caffeine and dehydration confirms coffee is an acceptable source of fluids for athletes , even during exercise in the heat . Hence , coffee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your water intake . <p> An increased concentration of particles in your blood triggers the sensation of thirst . If you are a 150-pound runner , you 'll start to feel thirsty once you 've lost about 1.5 to 3 pounds of sweat ( 1% to 2% of your body weight ) . Sweat loss of more than 10% body weight is life threatening . <p> Body water absorbs heat from the working muscles and sweat dissipates the heat . That is , the evaporation of a liter ( about 36 ounces ) of sweat from the skin represents loss of about 580 calories . Sweat keeps you from overheating during exercise and in hot environments . <p> To determine how much water you lose when you sweat , weigh yourself ( with little or no clothing ) before and after an hour of hard exercise with no fluid intake .

The water outside the cells is rich in sodium , an electrolyte that works in balance with potassium , an electrolyte inside the cells .

Yet , during cold weather , you are less likely to experience reduced performance , even at 3% dehydration . Three to 5% dehydration does not seem to affect muscle strength or performance during short intense bouts of anaerobic exercise , such as weight lifting . But distance runners slow their pace by 2% for each percent body weight lost by dehydration .

@@102096187 @6296187/ <h> Training <h> Half Marathon Training Guide - Intermediate 1 <p> With the publication of my latest book , Hal Higdon 's Half Marathon Training , I added a new intermediate schedule . Previously , there was only one , titled " Intermediate . " Now there are two : " Intermediate 1 " and " Intermediate 2 . " The difference is that Intermediate 1 is an endurance-based program ; Intermediate 2 is a speed-based program . These two intermediate schedules exist in a parallel universe , the same level of difficulty , just slightly different approaches to training . They are part of the logical progression upward from Novice through Intermediate to Advanced . <p> Here is how to use Intermediate 1 to run your best half marathon . <p> The terms used in the training chart are somewhat obvious , but let me explain what I mean anyway . Further information is included in my interactive training programs available through TrainingPeaks , where I send you daily emails telling you what to run and how to train . ( During construction , interactive versions of Intermediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Long runs : The key to the program is the long run , which builds from 4 miles in Week 1 to 12 miles in the climactic Week 11 . ( After that , you taper a week to arrive at the half marathon well rested . ) Do not cheat on the long runs . Although the schedule suggests long runs on Sundays , you can switch to Saturdays or even other days of the week to suit your schedule . <p> Run slow : For experienced runners , I recommend that they do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 or more seconds per mile slower than their planned half marathon pace . Run at a comfortable pace , one that allows you to converse with your training partners , . The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance ; how fast you cover it does n't matter . <p> Walking breaks : Walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy in trying to finish a half marathon . It works during training runs too . While some coaches recommend walking at prescribed points , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . This serves a double function : 1 ) you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running , and 2 ) since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations , you 'll be less likely to collide with someone . It 's a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well . <p> Cross-training : Mondays in this training program are devoted to cross-training , building from 30 to 60 minutes . What is cross-training ? It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles the day after your long run . The best cross-training exercises are swimming , cycling or even walking . One tip : You do n't have to cross-train the same each weekend . And you could even combine two or more exercises : walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a health club . Cross-training for an hour on Monday will help you recover after your Sunday long runs . <p> Midweek training : As the weekend mileage builds , the Tuesday and Thursday mileage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase from 4 to 8 miles . Run these miles at a comfortable , pace . Do n't  get trapped by numbers . Listen to your body signals as much as the signals coming from your GPS watch . If you strength train , Tuesdays and Thursdays would be the best days to combine lifting with running . Usually its a good idea to run before you lift rather than the reverse . <p> Pace : Saturdays , run pace , the pace you hope to run in your goal half marathon . If you 're training for a 2:00 half marathon , your average pace per mile is 9:09 . So you would run that same pace when asked to run race pace . If you were training for a 5-K or 10-K , " race pace " would be the pace you planned to run in those races . <p> Races : I suggest running a 5-K in Week 6 and a 10-K in Week 9 . Consider races as an " option . " Doing at least some racing in a training program can be a valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness and predict how fast you might run in your goal race ( using various prediction charts on the Internet ) . But too much racing can wear you out and distract from your training , so embrace this option cautiously . Finally , there is nothing magic about 5-K or 10-K as distances or Week 6 or Week 9 for when to race . Seek races in your area convenient to your schedule . <p> Rest : Scientists say that it is during the rest period ( the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise ) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger . You ca n't run hard unless you are well rested . If you 're constantly fatigued , you will fail to reach your potential . This is why I prescribe rest on Fridays to get ready for the hard weekendand ( easy ) cross-training on Sundays to recover . If you need to take more rest days--because of a cold or a late night at the office or a sick child--do so . The secret to success in any training program is consistency .

Our trails through the woods become covered with snow . Ice and snow also make running on the roads tricky . Cold weather forces us to bundle up , slowing our stride . Add to that , the narrow window of daylight that forces many runners to train , at least during the week , in darkness . For that reason alone , winter is no fun even for those who live in warmer climates . <p> But winter also can be an advantage , since it forces us to change training patterns . If we ca n't do fartlek in the woods or repeat 200s on the track , we can at least run long and build our base mileage and aerobic fitness . The mere difficulty of running when the temperature dips below freezing makes us tougher .

Keep running this winter Here is a Winter Training Program to motivate yourself to not only stay fit , but to improve your fitness . It lasts 13 weeks and features five running workouts a week with one day of rest and one day of cross-training . Most significantly , It is a time-based training program , meaning that workouts are prescribed in minutes rather than miles . That recognizes the variability of running conditions due to weather . When it 's cold and slippery , it 's hard to maintain the same fast pace you might in the spring or fall with equal effort . <p> On days featuring bad weather , simply run at a comfortable pace without glancing at your watch to check pace . Let your instincts tell you how slow or fast to run . On days when the weather improves and the weather has warmed and the roads are clear , pick up the pace . <p> The Winter Training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week : <p> Monday : Run Easy . In my Winter Training Program , Mondays are easy days with short runs alternating between 15 , 20 and 25 minutes at a pace between 65 and 75 percent of your maximum heart rate . If you have access to a fitness center , you might want to do this workout on a treadmill , then do some strength training afterwards . <p> Tuesday : Run Long . If you have used one of my 18-week marathon training programs , you know that I usually prescribe what I call " sorta-long " runs for the middle of the week . About the best way to describe them is that they are runs not as long as the long runs on the weekends . Tuesdays in this program are set aside for sorta-long runs between 45 and 60 minutes . Run between 65 to 75 percent of your maximum heart rate . <p> Wednesday : Run Easy . Similar to Monday , do a short and easy run today , coupling this run ( outdoors or indoors ) with some stretching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort zone . <p> Thursday : Run Fast . Weather permitting , do a Tempo Run . I define a Tempo Run as one where you start easy at a jogging warm-up pace ( 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate ) , then after a mile or two , begin to gradually accelerate to just slower than your 10-K pace ( between 80 and 90 percent of your maximum heart rate ) . Then , after holding that fast pace for 3 to 5 minutes , gradually decelerate and finish the run at the same jogging pace at which you started . While I suggest Thursdays for Tempo Runs , be aware of weather conditions . Feel free to shift your Tempo Run--or any other prescribed workout--to the day of the week most convenient for you . <p> Friday : Rest . Fridays are rest days in all my programs .

I do n't care how far or fast you run in your allotted time ; I simply want you out running . Even runners with access to a treadmill in a gym probably need to get outdoors at least once a week to run long . Stay in the 65 to 75 percent comfort zone . Please note that , unlike my marathon programs , the mileage ( or time ) does not build over the length of the program . I 'm not training you for a marathon or any other race . My interest is in having you maintain a high level of fitness during the winter , so that you can move into a race-focused training program once the weather warms . If you are training for a spring marathon at the end of this Winter Training Program , feel free to modify upward the length of time or distance for these long runs . <p> Sunday : Cross Train .

Janis Klecker , winner of the 1992 Olympic Marathon Trials , trained through a Minnesota winter to get ready for that race , spending a lot of her training time on snowshoes designed by her husband Barney Klecker , the US 50-mile record holder . Deena Drossin Kastor , bronze medalist in the 2004 Olympic marathon , uses snowshoes while training winters at Mammoth Lake , California . <p> To provide a light at the end of the tunnel , I suggest you run a race in the 13th and final week of the program .

How is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about form ; just get out and run . But once runners attain a base level of fitness , how they run is worth some consideration . For the rest of the week , I 'm going to sneak some tips on running form into the daily instructions . As you run 6 miles today , consider your posture . You should run upright . Your back should be straight , roughly at a 90-degree angle to the ground . Ignore anyone who tells you to " lean into it , " even when running uphill . <p> Wednesday : Today 's track workout is 10 x 200 meters , jogging and/or walking 200 between . Run at the pace you would race an 800 . Do n't forget to warm up thoroughly and cool down afterwards . Warm-up is particularly important when you train this fast . It 's too easy to injure yourself if your muscles are cold . Here 's another tip on form related to head carry that you can consider while running the 200 reps . Look straight down the track . Your eyes should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of you . Try to run in a straight line and not wander back and forth in your lane . While running the curve , focus on staying just right of the inside line and do n't wobble back and forth across it . Interval training is an excellent way to improve your concentration , which becomes critical when you race . <p> Thursday : Three miles at an easy pace followed by strength training . Continuing the discussion on running form , swing your arms naturally . The angle at the elbow between your upper and lower arms should be about 90 degrees . Your hands should be loosely cupped , about belly level . Let your arms swing in rhythm with your legs . The legs should control arm swing , not the other way around . Form is also important not only in strength training exercises , but it is also important when you stretch . Do n't be sloppy in anything you do connected with your running . <p> Friday : This is your usual end-of-week day of rest , and it 's interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week , we talked briefly about the fact that runners usually modify their diets , eating more carbohydrates than they might have before . Typically , they change their drinking habits too , realizing that moderation is the key . Rarely do I see runners drinking alcoholic beverages other than wine or beer--and usually not much of that . That 's because when you start to run , you quickly realize that it 's no fun to run with a hangover . Thus does running create positive habits for those who pursue it . <p> Saturday : With a race scheduled tomorrow , you may want to take an extra day of rest to make sure you compete well . Or do some easy jogging and a few strides on one of the two days leading to the race . One final word on form , and it concerns footplant . The most natural landing is mid-foot , the ball of the foot landing first , the heel contacting the ground a fraction of a second later . The toes push off a fraction after that . Some runners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on what feels natural to them . Attempt to modify this natural gait at your own risk . <p> Sunday : Today is race day . The schedule suggests an 8-K race , although the exact distance you run is n't that important as long as you keep the distance between 5-K and 10-K . St. Paul once said , " Do you not know that those who run in a race , all indeed run , but only one receives the prize ? So run as to obtain it . " ( St. Paul , 9:24 ) I do n't know , Pauly , that message might have been accurate 2,000 years ago , but if you were around today and had an opportunity to experience today 's mass-participation marathons , you might agree that more than one runner receives the prize , or benefits from their participation .

Stay focused on your workout by stretching in between . " Its very important while strength training to have a stretching routine , " warns personal trainer Cathy Vasto . " You do n't  want to lose your flexibility , which can happen if you forget to stretch . Eccentric contractions ( which occur when lowering the weights ) actually can tighten the muscles . " Stretching while strength training provides a double dose of conditioning in a minimum of time . <p> Saturday : With tomorrow a race day , today is an option day : Either run 3 easy miles or rest .

The new standards , posted toward the end of June on the BAA 's Website , offer a 5-minute break for men and women over 45 , up to an hour for those still running at age 80 . <p> The standards date back to 1970 . A record 1,152 runners started Boston the previous year , way too many thought trainer Jock Semple , who shepherded runners each Patriot 's Day along with race director Will Cloney , a full-time employee of Keystone Funds . Tired of poseurs , who trained improperly and sometimes appeared dressed as King Kong or smoking cigars , the pair asked runners to certify their ability to finish faster than four hours . " I could walk that fast , " claimed Semple , who had placed ninth in 1944 with 2:51:34 . <p> As a writer for Runner 's World ( then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in print and to Semple personally the next time I saw him . I felt the standards would stifle both Boston 's and running 's growth . How wrong I was ! As the standards were progressively tightened over the next decade , runners accepted them as a challenge and trained harder to make the field . <h> Tightening standards <p> For the 1976 race , Cloney and Semple tightened entry standards to an imposing 3:00 for men and 3:30 for women and masters ( those over 40 ) . But nothing helped stem the tide . The running boom had begun . The ranks swelled to 7,877 entrants in 1979 , with easily a third as many bandits tagging behind . So in 1980 , standards came down to 2:50 for men , 3:10 for masters men and 3:20 for women , eventually 3:30 for masters women ( defined then as those over age 40 ) . Numbers dipped in 1981 , but by 1982 7,439 entered . <p> By then , the flood had crested .

During the 1990s , a new breed of runner arrived more interested in finishing a marathon , rather than finishing it fast . With greater volunteer support , the BAA realized it could tolerate fields near 10,000 and decided to relax its qualifying times to 3:10 and 3:40 for men and women aged 18-34 . Every five-year age group after that , runners received a 5-minute qualifying cushion up to maximums of 3:50 and 4:20 for men and women over 70 . <p> Those standards worked for younger runners , but failed to reflect the fact that past age 50 , aging runners lose more than they gain . According to one survey posted to my Virtual Training Forum , while 637 men and women aged 35-39 qualified for Boston at the fast 2001 LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon , only 12 men and 1 woman over 60 made the cut .

But younger runners get no break , and not all posting to Virtual Training seemed pleased .

But high mileage is not what this Spring Training is about , as I believe you already have come to understand . Given the fact that this is at the end of your workout week , monitor your body signals throughout this run . Any extra fatigure ? Or do you feel like you could run even harder .

If you continue on to my marathon training program , you 'll see that I use 3/1 long runs for some of the Intermediate and Advanced schedules . <p> Running Tips : To improve , vary your routine . Work a little harder one day , then make the next an easy day . Program in occasional rest days when you do no walking and jogging , or cross-training days when you do some other exercise .

Mountains do that to you , but at 20,320 feet , Denali seemed more than a mere mountain . It was akin to a legend . <p> Denali is the highest peak in North America . Wait a minute , you say : are n't  I talking about Mount McKinley ? I am , but during our visit to Alaska for the Klondike Road Relay , I discovered that President William McKinley not only never saw the mountain named after him , but cared little about it . Like many Alaskans , I now prefer the name used by the Athabaskan Indians , which means " The High One . " <p> After the Relay , Rose and I caught a flight out of Juneau to Anchorage , landing late on a Sunday evening . Monday morning , we breakfasted at the Anchorage Hilton with Alden Todd , a friend who had moved to Anchorage . Alden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we climbed into our rental car to head north up Route 3 toward the town of Talkeetna . <p> " Be cautious , " warned Alden . " Moose can appear out of nowhere . They weigh 1,200 pounds and will bounce right through the windshield if you hit them . " <p> Thus warned , we headed north beside Cook Inlet and , after a turn west near Palmer onto Route 3 , we passed through Willow , the low snow years starting point for the Iditarod , the famous multi-day sled dog race . We might have stopped to visit the Sled Dog Mushers Hall of Fame , but a narrow window of three days for our travels allowed little time for ordinary sightseeing . <h> Mesmerized by the Mountain <p> There was plenty to see from the porch of the Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge . The Lodge , though outside the borders of Denali National Park , reportedly offered a better view of that mountain 60 miles away than any viewpoint within the park . Mesmerized by the mountain as viewed through the window of our room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday afternoon , the upper reaches of Denali were obscured by low-lying clouds . The same proved true during a ride by a jet boat managed by Maheys Riverboat Service up the Sinitsa river to a nature preserve . Instructed by a naturalist , we learned how trappers from the previous century lived as well as which berries or leaves could poison us if ate or touched them ! Heading back , we saw a small black bear frolicking at the edge of the water , our only bear sighting during a week stay in Alaska . Had we more time , we could have chosen a sightseeing flight around the mountain <p> Tuesday morning , visibility had improved . Denalis twin peaks stood stripped before me . Perched on the Lodges porch , I began sketching the mountain . Although we were XX miles away , the air was so clear , I felt I could stroll across a separating meadow and begin climbing this highest of North American mountains . <p> Mountain climbing , however , did n't  tempt me . It was too dangerous for an aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each year 1,000 climbers attempt an ascent , taking nearly three weeks to do so . Some succeed ; others lose their lives . Later , stopping at a roadside overlook and I learned from a display that there are 44 higher peaks in South America and 650 more in the Himalayas ! No matter : Denali is as good as it gets . <h> Spectacular Drive <p> Bypassing the national park , we turned eastward at Cantwell onto the Denali Highway , a gravel road that would take 135 miles to reach Paxson to continue our circle tour south . The road would have been more suitable for the Ford Explorer I left parked in my driveway in Long Beach than our rental car , so we slowed our pace--no problem considering the scenery .

Why had I waited so long to visit this most beautiful of the 50 states ? <p> Our stop Tuesday night was at Tangle Lakes Lodge . For $85 , you could get a cabin with a canoe , but one of the Lodges attractions was bird-watching , guided by naturalist Audubon L. Bakewell IV , who works at the Lodge . Yes , that 's his name .

" Once you get atop the ridge , the footing gets easy , " he said . Getting to that ridge , however , proved tricky , since no natural path led to the top . We stumbled through bushes and brambles before reaching the high ground . There , as Audie predicted , the footing was easier , the tundra forming a carpet across which I felt I could hike for hours . <h> Whooping It Up <p> From Tangle Lakes on Wednesday , our final day , we drove south along Highway 4 , which parallels the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline . Occasionally we could spot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down dale . It is this pipeline , and not gold , that is at the heart of Alaskan prosperity today , bringing black gold from Prudhoe Bay to the docks of Valdez . A turn west aimed us back toward Anchorage along the Alaskan Highway . Views of glaciers were only slightly less impressive because of low-lying fog . Stopping at one roadside overview , we spotted a moose beside the road , but it was a baby moose and showed no interest in leaping through our windshield . <p> We were back in Anchorage Wednesday night , this time staying at the Anchorage Hotel ( 907/272-4553 ) , older than the glitzy Hilton Anchorage next door , but recently remodeled . Alden Todd met us for dinner and retrieved his maps . We promised to return soon to Alaska .

All too often , I hear seemingly lean marathoners express extreme frustration with their inability to lose undesired bumps and bulges : <p> Am I the only runner who has ever gained weight when training for a marathon ? ? ? <p> Why does my husband lose weight when he starts running and I do n't ? <p> For all the exercise I do , I should be pencil-thin . Why ca n't I simply lose a few pounds ? <p> Clearly , weight loss is not simple and often includes debunking a few myths . Perhaps this article will offer some insights that will lead to success with your weight loss efforts . <p> Myth : You must exercise in order to lose body fat . <p> To lose body fat , you must create a calorie deficit . You can create that deficit by <p> 1 ) exercising , which improves your overall health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Even injured runners can lose fat , despite a lack of exercise . The complaint " I gained weight when I was injured because I could n't run " could more correctly be stated " I gained weight because I mindlessly overate for comfort and fun . " <p> Adding on exercise does not equate to losing body fat . In a 16-week study , untrained women ( ages 18 to 34 ) built up to 40 minutes of hard cardio or weight lifting three days a week . They were told to not change their diet , and they saw no changes in body fatness ( 1 ) . Creating a calorie deficit by eating less food seems to be more effective than simply adding on exercise to try to lose weight . <p> Runners who complain they " eat like a bird " but fail to lose body fat may simply be under-reporting their food intake . A survey of female marathoners indicated the fatter runners under-reported their food intake more than the leaner ones . Were they oblivious to how much they actually consumed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-exercise hours of their day ? <p> Myth : If you train for a marathon or triathlon , surely your body fat will melt away . <p> Wishful thinking . If you are an endurance athlete who complains , " For all the exercise I do , I should be pencil-thin , " take a look at your 24-hour energy expenditure . Do you put most of your energy into exercising , but then tend to be quite sedentary the rest of the day as you recover from your tough workouts ? Male endurance athletes who reported a seemingly low calorie intake did less spontaneous activity than their peers in the non-exercise parts of their day ( 4 ) . You need to keep taking the stairs instead of the elevators , no matter how much you train . Again , you should eat according to your whole day 's activity level , not according to how hard you trained that day . <p> Myth : The more miles you run , the more fat you will lose . <p> Often , the more miles you run , the hungrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or 2 ) the more you believe you " deserve " to eat for having survived the killer workout . Unfortunately , rewarding yourself with a 600-calorie cinnamon roll can quickly erase in a few minutes the 600-calorie deficit you generated during your workout . <p> The effects of exercise on weight loss are complex and unclearand depend on the 24-hour picture . We know among people ( ages 56-78 ) who participated in a vigorous walking program , their daily energy needs remained about the same despite adding an hour of exercise . How could that be ? The participants napped more and were 62% less active the rest of their day ( 3 ) . Be sure to pay attention to your whole day 's activity level . One hour of running does not compensate for a sedentary lifestyle <p> Myth : You should run six days a week to lose weight . <p> Research suggests exercising four times a week might be better for weight control than six times a week . A study with sedentary women ( ages 60 to 74 ) who built up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who did four workouts a week burned about 225 additional calories in the other parts of their day because they felt energized .

They burned about 200 fewer calories in the non-exercise parts of their day ( 5 ) . Yes , they were ages 60 to 74 , but the info might also relate to you ? <p> Myth : Couples who run together , lose fat together . <p> Not always . In a 16-month study looking at exercise for weight loss , the men lost 11.5 pounds and the women maintained weight , even though they did the same amount of exercise ( 6 ) . In another study , men who did an 18-month marathon training program reported eating about 500 more calories per day and lost about five pounds of fat .

Well , a husband who adds on exercise will lose more weight than his wife if he 's heftier and thereby burns more calories during the same workout . But , speaking in terms of evolution , Nature seems protective of women 's role as child bearer , and wants women to maintain adequate body fat for nourishing healthy babies . Hence , women are more energy efficient . Obesity researchers at NY 's Columbia University suggest a pound of weight loss in men equates to a deficit of about 2,500 calories , while women need a 3,500-calorie deficit ( 8 ) . No wonder women have a tougher time losing weight then do men .... <p> The bottom line <p> If you are running to lose weight , I encourage you to separate exercise and weight . Yes , you should run for health , fitness , stress relief , and most importantly , for enjoyment . ( After all , the E in exercise stands for enjoyment ! ) If you run primarily to burn off calories , exercise will become punishment for having excess body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . ( A better idea is to seek personalized help by meeting with a local sports dietitian . Use the referral network at www.SCANdpg.org . ) <p> Instead of focusing just on exercise as the key to fat loss , pay more attention to your calorie intake . Knocking off 100 calories a day from your evening snacks can theoretically result in 10 pounds of fat loss in a year . One less cookie a day seems simpler than hours of sweating ... ?

And if you ski for more than an hour , you also need to pay attention to drinking fluids . When temperatures are below freezing , you may not feel motivated to drink , but you will still lose fluids though perspiration . Since a dehydrated skier ca n't ski as fast or as well as one properly hydrated , bring an energy drink with you on the trails . Also pack some snack food , such as an energy bar . If you compete in ski marathons , you need to pay very close attention to refueling , particularly since , compared to road races , there often are fewer aid stations in the woods . <p> Also important is nutrition before and after skiing .

( South Shore Line posters can be purchased at The Framing Station in Michigan City , Indiana or at the Chicago Historical Society and numerous poster shops in Chicago . ) <h> Running in the Dunes <p> But none of the posters , past or current , featured my sport of running . Notre Dame football , yes . Running , no . This oversight needed to be addressed . I not only wanted to own such a running poster ; I wanted to draw one . <p> I chose the cross-country ski poster as my guide , retaining the classic design but changing the girl in the poster from skier to runner . " Winter Sports in the Dunes by South Shore Line " became " Running in the Dunes by South Shore Line . " <p> This would not be my first attempt at mimicking the South Shore Line posters . Several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Dunes Beaches , " but with Wonder Woman in place of the bathing suit girl . I later painted another featuring The Batman . But both were single paintings on canvas , not posters that might be reproduced in large numbers . <p> Clearly , I was operating out of my league , so I decided to consult several individuals with poster expertise . One was Jo Ann Finney , owner of The Framing Station in Michigan City . The other was Neil Kienitz , a local watercolor artist who has done numerous posters , including several featuring the South Shore Line theme . <h> Legal Issues <p> With my first paintings , I dodged the legal issue of using " South Shore Line , " substituting " Lake Shore Line . " But for a poster in the classic mold , that seemed a cop-out . Finney advised that while the consortium producing the current posters had trade-marked " Just around the corner by South Shore Line , " no problems involved use of the railroad name . Nevertheless , she gave me the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke with Hearst by phone , he offered his blessing . <p> Covered legally , I next consulted poster artist Kienitz . I felt comfortable with the art , but producing a poster involves other details . During a visit to Kienitz 's studio on Tenth Street in Michigan City , he walked me through the technical process including size choice . " You want to choose a standard size , such as 24 by 36 , or 18 by 24 , " he advised . " That way your customers can purchase ready-made frames for less money . " <p> Kienitz also discussed choice of materials , suggesting 140-pound hot press watercolor paper or one-eighth-inch tempered Masonite . He recommended brushes and pencils , even choice of ink . I accepted some suggestions , rejected others . One difference between us as artists is that Kienitz paints with watercolors ; I use acrylics . Eventually , I decided to use acrylics on illustration board for the original art . I wanted to go with what was familiar to me as an artist , not experiment with too many new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed four separate paintings , partly for color selection , partly for fun . Kienitz suggested a grayish sky that would retreat behind the central running figure rather than a bright blue . And rather than outline that figure with thick , black lines ( as I do with some of my Pop Art ) , he advised a more subdued line , perhaps brown . It seems like a trivial change , but this was perhaps his key suggestion . Once I completed the art ( oversized at 30 x 40 inches ) , Kienitz visited my studio and suggested several seemingly minor color modifications on the lettering that also helped the poster 's overall look . Having copied the lettering from the original skier poster , I agonized over its uneven look . " It 's supposed to look that way , " Finney assured me . <h> Final Proofs <p> Both Kienitz and Finney had recommended Lithotone , Inc. , an Elkhart printer , whose customers ' orders dwarf mine . " Every life preserver sold in this country comes with one of our brochures , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . " Despite my miniscule order of 1,000 posters , Auskalnis seemed to delight in working with me . <p> I traveled to Elkhart to okay the final proofs . My art had been scanned into a computer . I considered several color modifications before I finally signed off on the job . " Let the presses roll , " I told Auskalnis . It took less than an hour to print my job . The classic South Shore Line posters were 24 by 36 inches . I chose 18 x 24 inches for a practical reason . I often sell my running books at races , such as The LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon . I figured the smaller posters would fit more easily onto our table at the Expo , two days before the marathon . And the price could be lower : $20 vs. $30 . " Not everybody wants to pay several hundred dollars for a painting , " Kienitz concedes . " Posters are more affordable . " Would Toulouse-Lautrec have made a similar decision ? <p> We offered the poster " Running in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marathon Expo and at The Heart of Art Tour in LaPorte county later in the month . Of the 1,000 first printing , I numbered and signed the first 250 and sold each one within the first month . As of now , we have sold more than 800 of the first printing , and we have no plans for a second printing . We also sold all four preliminary paintings ( pictured below ) along with the original art of the poster itself . If you want a copy of this classic poster , act now .

@@102096203 @6296203/ <h> Training <h> Cross Country - Summer Training Program <p> This Cross Country Training Program is designed for high school runners to use during the summer , but also for coaches looking for a well-organized schedule that they can modify for their own purposes . It provides ten weeks of training , enough to bridge that period between the end of the school year and the beginning of the racing season . You can print a free copy of the schedule below or sign up through TrainingPeaks for an InterActive version where I send you daily e-mail messages with detailed training directions and tips . To take a look at the Interactive version , click here . <p> Like most of my training programs for road race distances from the 5-K through the marathon , this Summer Cross Country Training Program follows the hard/easy approach pioneered by legendary University of Oregon coach , Bill Bowerman . Three of the seven days in the week ( Monday , Tuesday , Thursday ) feature some form of speedwork , either fartlek , interval training or tempo runs . ( For descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these workouts is to develop leg strength and speed , but also pace awareness . One long run a week ( Saturday ) , similar to those I prescribe for marathoners , has as its purpose improving aerobic fitness and endurance . Easy runs of 30 minutes are scheduled for two of the other three days of the week ( Wednesday , Friday ) with the final day ( Sunday ) an optional day of rest or run . <p> How many miles do you need to run a week to achieve success ? That 's a difficult , if not impossible , question to answer . Some winning coaches push their runners in double workouts to 100 weekly miles , even offering T-shirts for those running 1,000 miles during the summer . But if you have n't been training at or near this level , you 'll self-destruct . Intelligent coaches usually spend two or three years gradually building runners up where they can tolerate this training load . Please do n't use this or any other program as an excuse to overtrain ! Follow this program exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 45 miles a week , enough for most high school cross country runners . If you feel you need more miles , discuss your plans with your coach before proceeding . More important than the number of miles run is the quality of those miles . <p> Here are descriptions of the various training options in my Cross Country Training Program : <p> Tempo Runs : ( Scheduled for Mondays . ) A tempo run in this program is a workout of 30 to 45 minutes , usually run on trails or in the woods so you have no reference to exactly how far or how fast you are running . Here 's how to do a tempo run . Begin at an easy pace , about as fast as you would during any warm-up on the track . After 5 or 10 minutes of gentle jogging , gradually accelerate toward peak speed midway through the workout , holding that peak for 5 or 10 minutes , then gradually decelerate , finishing with 5 minutes of gentle jogging , your cool-down . At peak speed , you should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although this recommendation may be somewhat meaningless to high school runners who rarely race beyond 5-K . I do n't want to be too precise in telling you how to run this workout . The approach should be intuitive . Run hard , but not too hard . If you do this workout correctly , you should finish refreshed rather than fatigued . <p> Interval Training : ( Scheduled for Tuesdays . ) This is a more precise form of speed training than tempo runs above , or fartlek below . You may have done interval training , or some variation on it , during the track season whether or not you recognized it by that name . Interval training consists of fast repeats ( 400 , 600 and 1,000 meters in this program ) , followed by jogging and/or walking to recover . It is the " interval " between the fast repeats that gives this workout its name . In this program , I suggest a 400-meter jog between the 400 repeats , a 200-meter jog between the 600 repeats , and 3 minutes walking and/or jogging between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or slow you walk or jog the interval , but that you be consistent with both the repeats and the interval between . For example , you do not want to run this workout and discover near the end that you are running the repeats slower than at the start , or that you need more rest during the interval between . If that happens , you picked too ambitious a time goal for the workout . Interval training is best run on a track , although it can be run on soft surfaces or on the roads , as long as you maintain consistency . Here 's more information on the three interval workouts I 've chosen for this program : <p> 10 x 400 : Run this workout in the first , fourth , seventh and tenth weeks of the program . Pick a pace in the first week that you can handle easily . I suggest the same pace that you ran 3,200 meters in track last season , assuming you raced at that distance . Pick as your end goal for the tenth week the pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those track distances before , run the reps at a pace you think you can maintain for the entire length of the workout . According to the tables on McMillan Running , a runner who can run the 3,200 in 10:40 ( 80 seconds per lap ) should be capable of running the 1,600 in about 5:00 ( 75 seconds a lap ) . Thus in ten weeks , I 'd like you to improve about 5 seconds per 400 , but be conservative ; I would rather have you run too slow a pace than too fast a one . You can run faster as you adapt to the rhythm of interval training . For the intervals , jog 400 meters at a fairly fast pace . You want to recover between repeats , but not recover too much . <p> 5 x 1,000 : Run this workout in the weeks after you run the interval 400s : the second , fifth and eighth weeks of the program . This workout is best run on trails , perhaps on sections of your home cross-country course if it is marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team in Michigan City , Indiana , we went to a nearby woods that contained a circular loop that was about 1,000 meters long . This was our " Kilo Loop . " The boys would run 5 x 1,000 fast , thus 5,000 meters , the same as their race distance . In Indiana , girls race at 4,000 meters , so they did 4 x 1,000 meters . In between , they walked 3 minutes to recover . Run each rep fast , somewhat slower than race pace the first time , with your goal to eventually to run as fast as race pace . If running on an unmeasured course , you may need to simply run intuitively , about the time it would take you to cover a kilometer in a race . I never knew exactly how long our Kilo Loop was . It did n't matter to me or the team . More important was the effort everyone put into this speed workout . <p> 6 x 600 : Run this workout during the third , sixth and ninth weeks . Run each 600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . Notice I said " about " to give you some leeway . Jog a fairly fast 200 between , then go again . Keep the pace the same in later weeks , but progress instead in number : 8 x 600 , ultimately 10 x 600 . I choose these variations mainly so that you speed train differently from week to week . Do n't get into the trap of comparing one week 's workout to the one before or the one after . Focus more on how you feel at the end of each workout , not the numbers on your watch . You should finish fatigued , but also refreshed . <p> Run correctly and in control , interval training can be invigorating . It is also the single best way to improve both your speed and your running form . Overdone , however , it can lead to injuries and fatigue , chipping away at your ability to attain peak performance . Learn to use interval training as the key to cross-country success . <p> Fartlek : ( Scheduled for Thursdays . ) Fartlek is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I devoted an entire chapter to fartlek and tempo runs in my best-selling book , Run Fast . Fartlek is a form of training developed in the 1940s by Coach Gosta Holmer and used by Gundar Hagg and Arne Andersson , the world 's fastest milers of that era . A fartlek run in this program is a workout of anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes that involves constant changes of pace at different distances . It is entirely intuitive ( similar to tempo runs ) and is best run on trails in the woods where you have no idea how far you are running . After 5 or 10 minutes of gentle jogging at the start , pick up the pace and surge for maybe 10 or 20 or more seconds , then jog or even walk for a near equal time until partly recovered , then surge again . These speed bursts could be anywhere from 100 to 400 meters , or longer . They could be up a hill or down a hill or on the flat . They could be at top speed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from this tree to that tree . Bill Dellinger , 5,000 meter bronze medalist in the 1964 Olympic Games and who succeeded Coach Bill Bowerman at the University of Oregon , said : " An athlete runs as he feels . A fartlek training session can be the hardest workout a runner does all week , or it can be the easiest . " Dellinger adds : " In order to be a good distance runner , you have to build strength and endurance , learn race pace , and practice race tactics . Fartlek training can incorporate all of these essential elements into a single workout . " Fartlek teaches you how to surge in the middle of the race to get away from opponents--or hang with them when they attempt to surge on you . <p> Long Runs : ( Scheduled for Saturdays , but you can run long on Sundays if it seems more convenient . ) Long runs are necessary to improve your aerobic fitness and endurance . You begin in the first week , running for 60 minutes and add 5 minutes each week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to prescribe time rather than distance . I also do n't care how fast or slow you run , as long as you run for the prescribed length of time at a pace that allows you to finish as fast as you start . If your pace lags and you have to walk in the last few miles , you obviously ran the early miles too fast . Run at a conversational pace . If running with your teammates ( something I recommend ) , use this workout as an excuse to talk about every silly thing that happened to you during the week . This is a workout that you can run on the roads or on trails . Mostly , have fun . <p> Rest/Easy Days : ( Scheduled for Wednesdays , Fridays and Sundays . ) These are the three days of the week when you do not run hard . And quite frankly you ca n't run hard seven days a week without risking injury or overtraining . So in between the hard workouts , run easy . Rest can be an easy run of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not run at all . You need days of comparative rest between the hard workouts , otherwise you will not be able to run those hard workouts at full speed . If you fail to do the hard workouts properly , you will not improve . Do n't train hard every day assuming that it will make you a better runner ; it may actually affect your training negatively . <p> Racing : High school runners race so frequently during the spring , often several track meets a week and several races in those meets , so that I hate to encourage them to race much during the summer . But I also concede that low-key road races can be fun , can offer a change of pace from training and can motivate you to run all summer long . For that reason , you are free to run several road races during the summer , maybe once every fourth week . You do n't need to race on the week I indicated ; you do n't even need to race at all . The program ends in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the first race of your season . <p> Extra Training : For some talented and well-trained runners , particularly seniors , 35 to 45 miles of running a week is not enough . And to a point , the more miles you run , the faster runner you can become . That is why coaches of top-ranked teams ask their runners to run twice a day up to 100 miles a week . But the best coaches do n't ask their freshmen to train at this level . They build them up over a period of several years to the point where they can accept this workout load . If you want to run extra miles and train more than once a day , I suggest you do so gradually . Start out by doing double workouts on three days a week , the days on which you have easy runs scheduled . If you can maintain this level , add an extra day of double training over a period of weeks , months or even years . Sudden increases in speed and distance usually do not lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Team : If you are part of a team , whose coach already has a planned training program in place , he or she may or may not be enamored to learn that you 've decided to train using some program you picked up on the Internet . If you feel some or all of these workouts might help you as an individual and improve your performances , be diplomatic . Go to your coach and discuss training ideas . If he only meets with the team three or four days a week , your coach might even like having you do some extra running following my pattern . But in general , if you have the opportunity to train with your teammates instead of on your own , go with your teammates and follow your coach 's workouts every time . He is the one standing by the finish line with a stopwatch in hand , not me . Whatever your situation , train hard , but also easy , and have a great cross-country season in the fall . <p> This training program also is available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering further instructions on how to train along with tips guaranteed to make you a better runner .

In my 8-week Advanced Training Program , Mondays are reserved for easy 3-milers combined with strength training . See the screens : Stretch and Strengthen . Do n't overdo it . Your Monday goal is only to recover from the long runs scheduled for Sundays . Since the program begins today , you may not have taken such a long run yesterday . But you will at the end of this week . This week 's schedule has you running 28 total miles with a long run of 6 miles on the weekend . <p> Tuesday : Today is the day of the week on which the Advanced runners do tempo runs . On successive weekends , you will progress from 30- to 50- or 60-minute tempo runs . If you do n't understand the concept behind tempo runs , go back to the screen for the Advanced Program . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an easy pace , then gradually shift gears and run 10-15 minutes accelerating to near 10-K pace , finally decelerating for the last 5-10 minutes .

Leave something in the bank , because Wednesdays are reserved for speedwork at the track . <p> Wednesday : Head to the track . That 's the best place for running the 400-meter interval workouts I 'm asking you to do on Wednesdays . Today 's workout is 6 x 400 meters run at your 1500 or mile pace . Jog and/or walk 400 between each fast repeat . Be sure to warm up by running a mile or two and doing some stretching before the hard central part of your workout , then cool down with a mile or two after . If you feel running speedwork on successive days ( Tuesday-Wednesday ) is too difficult , feel free to flip-flop the Wednesday and Thursday workouts . But for an Advanced runner , running successive " hard " workouts can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hard . <p> Thursday : Today 's workout is 4 miles . Your Thursday runs will vary from 3 to 6 miles as the program continues . As with the Monday runs , run at a comfortable pace . And make this your second strength training day of the week . The best time to do this is after the run , rather than before . <p> Friday : Today is your rest day , and Fridays will always be rest days during the build-up to your 8-K . For an Advanced runner such as you , " rest " is a relative term . Three miles at an easy pace can qualify as " rest . " Or take the day off and do no running . This puts some of the coaching burden on you to determine whether you would benefit more from a few more miles or from the extra recovery you would get by taking a full day off .

This is similar to the tempo runs with a subtle difference . In pace runs , I 'd like you to run exactly at race pace . If possible , find a course that has exactly-measured miles . You need to accustom your muscles to running the pace you will be running in the race itself . <p> Sunday : This is the key day of our program for the Shamrock Shuffle . On Sundays , we run long .

I 'll have some interesting variations to throw at you in succeeding weeks . Pace does n't matter . Run this workout at a relaxed pace , slower than you plan to run in the actual race . <p> Run Fast : Running fast does n't take special talents . You do n't need expensive equipment .

@@102096205 @6296205/ <h> Training <h> Marathon Training Guide - Intermediate 1 <p> This is my Intermediate 1 Program : The Novice and Advanced training programs in my Marathon Training Guide represent the extremes . The former programs are designed for runners running their first marathons , or experienced runners who are happy with that level of training and see no need to do more . The latter programs are designed for those very experienced runners , who have done a number of marathons , perhaps have plateaued in their times , and want to maximize their ability by training hard and incorporating speedwork into their training . <p> In between , there 's a broad area for runners just like you ! If you previously have trained using one of the Novice programs ( 1 or 2 ) , you now can increase your mileage a bit , run some workouts at a faster pace , and seek improvement . <p> The Intermediate 1 program offers a slight jump in difficulty from the Novice programs . You begin in Week 1 with a long run of 8 miles instead of 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run by Week 13 , which permits a second 20-miler in Week 15 . Midweek mileage is slightly higher , but instead of cross-training on the weekends , you get more serious about your running and do a second run of 5-8 miles , often at marathon race pace . You now do your cross-training on Mondays , instead of taking the day off . Intermediate 2 offers still another jump in difficulty , but let 's concentrate for now on Intermediate 1 . <p> Here is an explanation of the type of training you will encounter in Intermediate 1 . Additional tips and instructions are available if you sign up for the interactive version , available through TrainingPeaks . <p> Long Runs : The key to the program is the long run on weekends , which builds from 8 miles in the first week to a maximum of 20 miles . Although some experienced runners do train longer , I see no advantage in doing 23 , 26 or even 31 mile runs . ( I 've tried that myself in the past , and it just wore me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs . Consistency is most important . You can skip an occasional workout , or juggle the schedule depending on other commitments , but do not cheat on the long runs . Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer , every third week is a " stepback " week , where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward . <p> Run Slow : Normally I recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 or more seconds per mile slower than their marathon pace . This is very important . Listen to what the Coach is about to tell you ! The physiological benefits kick in around 90-120 minutes , no matter how fast you run . You 'll burn a few calories and trigger glycogen regenesis , teaching your muscles to conserve fuel . Running too fast defeats this purpose and may unnecessarily tear down your muscles , compromising not only your midweek workouts , but the following week 's long run . Save your fast running for the marathon itself . There are plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace . So simply do your long runs at a comfortable pace , one that allows you to converse with your training partners , at least during the beginning of the run . Which brings up my next point . <p> 3/1 Training : Toward the end of the run , if you 're still feeling fresh , you may want to pick up the pace and finish somewhat faster . This will convert your long run into what I call a 3/1 Run . That means you run the first three-fourths of your long run ( say the first 12 miles of a 16-miler ) at an easy pace , then do the final one-fourth ( 4 miles of a 16-miler ) at a somewhat faster pace--though still not race pace . This 3/1 strategy is advised for only the most experienced runners , and I do n't recommend you do it more than once out of every three weekends . In other words : first weekend , easy run ; second weekend , 3/1 Run ; third weekend , step back to a shorter distance . My philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long runs , than too fast . The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance ; how fast you cover it does n't matter . <p> Walking Breaks : Walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy even for intermediate runners , and it works during training runs too . While some coaches recommend walking 1 minute out of every 10 , or walking 1 minute every mile , I teach runners to walk when they come to an aid station . This serves a double function : 1 ) you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running , and 2 ) since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations , you 'll be less likely to block those behind . It 's a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well . ( In training , you may want to wear a water belt to insure proper hydration . ) You will lose less time walking than you think . I once ran a 2:29 marathon , walking through every aid station . My son Kevin ran 2:18 and qualified for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took four brief breaks ( tying a shoe on one of them ) while running 2:09 and winning the 1975 Boston Marathon . Walking gives your body a chance to rest , and you 'll be able to continue running more comfortably . It 's best to walk when you want to , not when your ( fatigued ) body forces you too . <p> Race Pace : What do I mean by " race pace ? " It 's a frequently asked question , so let me explain . Race pace is the pace you plan to run in the race you 're training for . If you 're training for a 4:00 marathon , your average pace per mile is 9:09 . So you would run that same pace when asked to run race pace ( sometimes stated simply as " pace " on the training charts ) . If you were training for a 5-K or 10-K , " race pace " would be the pace you planned to run in those races . Sometimes in prescribing speedwork , I define paces for different workouts as 5-K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to run this fast in the Intermediate 1 program . <p> Cross-Training : Mondays in the intermediate programs are devoted to cross-training . What is cross-training ? It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while training ( usually ) the day after your long run . In this program , we run long on Sundays and cross-train on Mondays . The best cross-training exercises are swimming , cycling or even walking . What about sports such as tennis or basketball ? Activities requiring sideways movements are not always a good choice . Particularly as the mileage builds up toward the end of the program , you raise your risk of injury if you choose to play a sport that requires sudden stopping and starting . One tip : You do n't have to cross-train the same each week . And you could even combine two or more exercises : walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a health club . Cross-training for 30-60 minutes will help you recover after your Sunday long runs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done mostly at a comparatively easy pace . As the weekend mileage builds , the weekday mileage also builds . Add up the numbers , and you 'll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the week as you do during long runs on the weekends . Midweek workouts on Wednesdays build from 5 to 8 miles . There are similar slight advances on Tuesdays and Thursdays . The program is built on the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start . That sounds logical , does n't it ? Believe me--as tens of thousands of marathoners using this schedule have proved--it works . <p> Rest : Despite my listing it at the end , rest is an important component of this or any training program . Scientists will tell you that it is during the rest period ( the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise ) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger . Coaches also will tell you that you ca n't run hard unless you are well rested . And it is hard running ( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're constantly fatigued , you will fail to reach your potential . This is why I designate Friday as a day of rest for Intermediate runners . It allows you to gather forces for hard running on Saturdays and Sundays . If you need to take more rest days--because of a cold or a late night at the office or a sick child--do so . And if you 're tired from the weekend , take Monday off as well--or cut the length of your cross-training . The secret to success in any training program is consistency , so as long as you are consistent with your training during the full 18 weeks of the program , you can afford--and may benefit from--extra rest . <p> Speedwork ? There is no speedwork involved in the Intermediate 1 program . If you feel you need speedwork to improve , check out the advanced training schedules , which offer hill training , interval training and tempo runs on different days of the week . Normally , however , I recommend that marathoners save their speedwork for times of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check the shorter-distance training programs elsewhere on this web site for more on that . Modifying the program : My training programs are not carved in concrete , and you can make appropriate changes based on your experience , or to suit your convenience . One frequent request made those using my forums is to modify the order of the weekend runs , particularly those who want to run long on Saturdays instead of Sundays , because that 's when their friends do their long runs . Running with friends is certainly more fun than running alone , but the pace runs are placed on Saturdays ahead of the long runs on Sundays for a purpose . The main reason is to tire you out a bit in the first workout Saturday so you are not tempted to do the second workout Sunday too fast . It is also difficult to hit race pace on Sunday the day after a draining long run . Some runners ask if they can split these two workouts , for example , running pace on Friday and long on Sunday . They can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " workouts back to back on Saturdays and Sundays . Most runners have more time for their training on the weekends . So modify the program if you want , but if you make too many modifications , you 're not following the program . <p> Interactive Training : If you would like more help with your marathon training , sign up for one of my interactive training programs , and I will send you emails daily telling you how to train along with tips on how to train , plus you can log your training and use other features .

Not with any certainty , but individuals possessing several of the following risk factors are more likely to suffer coronary heart disease . 1 . Genes : If a close relative ( parents , siblings ) suffered a heart attack before age 55 , you also are at risk . Many other risk factors are genetic . 2 . Age : Risk rises as you age . More than three times as many people over age 65 die of heart attacks each year vs. those under that age . One reason : Blood vessels become less pliable with age , restricting circulation . 3 . Genes : Males die more often , and at younger ages , than females--although after menopause , risks for females increase . 4 . Blood Pressure : High blood pressure places more stress on the heart . You want your resting systolic pressure to be under 130 , your diastolic pressure below 70 . As numbers rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : More smokers ( 130,000 ) die each year from heart attacks than from lung cancer . Nicotine reduces HDL levels and raises your blood pressure . Smoking also increases blood-clotting. 6 . Cholesterol : Too much cholesterol in your blood stream causes plaque to build up and clog your arteries . To reduce risk , keep your total cholesterol number under 200 , your LDL cholesterol level below 130 . To reduce risk further , push your LDL below 100--although drug intervention may be necessary . 7 . Body Fat : If you are more than 20 percent above normal body weight , you are considered " obese . " Obesity contributes to most of the other risk factors , including diabetes and high blood pressure . 8 . Diabetes : Eighty percent of people with diabetes die of some form of heart disease . Diabetes is a hereditary problem that affects the body 's ability to utilize insulin . Clogged arteries are one side effect . 9 . Stress : Scientists do n't exactly know why , but anxiety apparently strains both the heart and linings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , your risk increases . 10 Inactivity : Failing to exercise can put you at risk , since the " easy " stress of exercise can moderate many of the above risk factors . A fit heart pumps 25 percent more blood at rest and 50 percent more during exercise , thus is less subject to strain when demands increase . <p> Several of the above risk factors ( genes , age sex ) can not be changed . Most of the others can at least be moderated if you exercise and eat properly , the keys to preventing coronary heart disease .

@@102096207 @6296207/ <h> Training <h> Racing <p> As you improve as a skier , you may want to consider entering a cross-country ski race . Compared to running with its hundreds of marathons and thousands of 5-K and 10-K races , there are not as many races to choose from if you 're a skier . And since one essential of the sport is ample snow , you only find them in the North , only in winter and usually away from the cities where there are trails through the woods . Nevertheless , between December and March , you can become a ski racer if you do n't mind traveling to race . <p> The largest ski race in North America is the American Birkebeiner , the Nordic equivalent of running 's Boston Marathon . The " Birkie , " as it is called , attracts approximately 6,000 competitors each February to a 55-K course that winds through the woods north of Hayward , Wisconsin . In addition to the full-distance Birkie , there is also a second race called the Kortelopet that allows competitors to stop halfway after going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Birkie attracts top skiers from Scandinavia , who skate the hilly course in times faster than runners do marathons .

The Birkie is part of two major ski circuits , one national , the other international . The Worldloppet circuit features ski marathons in different parts of the world : Norway , Sweden , Finland , even Japan and Australia . The Great American Ski Chase features a half dozen ski marathons in North America , including the North American Vasa ( 50-K and 25-K ) in Traverse City , Michigan . The Vasa is preceded the previous weekend by the White Pine Stampede ( 50-K and 20-K ) , that utilizes some of the ski trails at Shanty Creek . <p> One way to locate ski races is to contact Nordic Centers or stores that sell ski equipment in snowy areas .

Maybe during those first few difficult weeks , you might have had doubts--particularly on days when the weather was , say , less than exemplary . But three more weeks ? You could do that in your sleep . This week features another bump upward in distance with Sunday 's run scheduled for 5.5 miles , 13.5 total miles for the week . <p> Tuesday : Piece of cake today . Run 2.5 miles . Remember nine weeks ago when you had to struggle to get this far , when you did n't understand the signals your body was giving you .

You learn to live with it . Running may never be easy for you , but it can be enjoyable , and think of all of the positive things it is doing for your body . <p> Wednesday : Three miles . That was your maximum distance the first week you started running--and you thought you were going to die , did n't you ? Well , you did n't . You 're still out there plugging . And now running 3 miles seems so-o-o-o easy that you 've almost begun to give serious consideration that you might one day run a marathon . Wait a minute : let 's not get crazy . Let 's postpone that thought for at least a few more weeks . Take running step by step , day by day . Like they sang in the musical Rent : " No day like today !

That 's a lot of miles for someone just starting . Consider also the fact that on those three days , you will have burned 800 calories . Theoretically , that should allow you to lose a quarter of a pound , although it 's not always wise to compare your weight from one day to the next , since external factors can cause shifts . Over the long run , running will cause numerous positive things to happen to your body . <p> Friday : On this day of rest before a weekend during which you have a run of 5.5 miles scheduled , pause and consider how far you have come since you started to run . It may be difficult to measure improvements precisely , but hopefully you feel better and look better ( because looking better is often the result of having a positive attitude toward life ) .

Running is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! <p> Saturday : Today 's walking prescription is a half hour . Thirty minutes strolling through the woods or along the beach or even around the block will provide a pleasant break from whatever you had scheduled for today .

Usually I tell people to walk at a brisk pace , but you 've done so well with your training , do n't be afraid to turn this into a stroll with time to stop and smell the flowers . <p> Sunday : Another mileage breakthrough to 5.5 miles , your longest run during this 12-week Spring Training program . Unless you 're a speed demon , you 're going to be running for a relatively long period of time , somewhere close to an hour . And maybe if the weather is warm , you may dehydrate .

Establish a goal . Do not give up until you reach that goal . Even though you do n't consider yourself a competitive runner , you might want to pick as a goal a local road race . Once you finish your first 5-K and win your first race T-shirt , you can establish additional goals . <p> How to Improve : Running a marathon may be far from your thoughts , but when you do contemplate training for a 26-mile race , the best book to buy is Hal Higdon 's Marathon : The Ultimate Training Guide .

That 's what runners , triathletes , and body builders alike repeatedly ask . They read ads for commercial recovery foods that demand a 3 to 1 ratio of carbs to protein , tout the benefits of a proprietary formula , or emphasize immediate consumption the minute you stop exercising . While these ads offer an element of truth , consumers beware : engineered recovery foods are not more effective than standard foods . The purpose of this article is to educate you , a hungry runner , about how to choose an optimal recovery diet . <p> Which runners need to worry about a recovery diet ? <p> Too many runners are obsessed with rapidly refueling the minute they stop exercising . They are afraid they will miss the one-hour " window of opportunity " when glycogen replacement is fastest . They fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slowing rate . Given a steady influx of adequate carb-based meals and snacks , muscles can refuel within 24 hours . If you have a full day to recover before your next training session or run , or if you have done an easy ( non-depleting ) workout , you need not obsess about refueling immediately afterwards . <p> Refueling as soon as tolerable is most important for serious runners doing a second bout of intense , depleting exercise within six hours of the first workout , including <p> marathoners and triathletes doing double workouts . <p> * participants in more than one event at a track meet <p> people who ski hard in the morning and again in the afternoon . <p> The sooner you consume carbs to replace depleted muscle glycogen and protein to repair damaged muscle , the sooner you 'll be able to exercise hard again . <p> Over the course of the next 24 hours , your muscles will have lots of time to replenish glycogen stores . Just be sure to repeatedly consume a foundation of carbohydrates with each meal/snack , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , chocolate milk or a fruit smoothie are excellent choices . <p> How many carbs do I need ? <p> According to the International Olympic Committees Nutrition Recommendations , adequate carbs means : <p> Amount of exercise <p> Gram carb/lb <p> Gram carb/kg <p> Moderate exercise ( 1 hour/day ) <p> 2.5 to 3 <p> 5-7 <p> Endurance exercise ( 1-3 h/day ) <p> 2.5 to 4.5 <p> 6-10 <p> Extreme exercise ( &gt;4-5 h/day ) <p> 3.5 to 5.5 <p> 8-12 <p> Example , a 150-lb runner doing endurance training should target about 400 to 700 g carb/day ( 1,600-2,800 carb-calories ) . That 's about 400 to 700 carb-calories every 4 hours during the daytime . <p> What are some good carb-protein recovery foods ? <p> Your recovery meals and snacks should include a foundation of carbohydrate-rich breads , cereals , grains , fruits , and vegetables plus a smaller amount of protein ( at least 10-20 grams per recovery snack or meal ) . Enjoy <p> fruit smoothie ( Greek yogurt + banana + berries ) <p> cereal + milk bagel + ( decaf ) lattT <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub pasta + meatballs . <p> Do NOT consume just protein , as in a protein shake or protein bar . Protein fills your stomach and helps build and repair muscles , but it does not refuel your muscles . Your muscles want three or four times more calories from carbs than from protein . If you like the convenience of protein shakes , at least add carbs to them . That is , blend in some banana , frozen berries , and graham crackers . <p> Keep in mind that recovery calories " count . " I hear many weight-conscious runners complain they are not losing weight despite hard workouts . Perhaps that 's because they gobble 300 or so " recovery calories " and then go home and enjoy a hefty dinner . By organizing your training to end at mealtime , you can avoid over-indulging in recovery-calories . <p> What about recovery electrolytes ? <p> After a long , hard run , many runners reach for a sports drink , thinking Gatorade or PowerAde is " loaded " with sodium ( an electrically charged particle ) . Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually better sources of electrolytes than most commercial sports products . These electrolytes ( also known as sodium and potassium ) help enhance fluid retention and the restoration of normal fluid balance . here 's how some common recovery fluids compare : <p> Beverage ( 8 oz ) <p> Sodium ( mg ) <p> Potassium ( mg ) <p> Protein ( g ) <p> Carbs ( g ) <p> Water <p> -- <p> -- <p> -- <p> -- <p> PowerAde <p> 55 <p> 45 <p> -- <p> 19 <p> Gatorade <p> 110 <p> 30 <p> -- <p> 14 <p> Low-fat milk <p> 100 <p> 400 <p> 8 <p> 12 <p> Chocolate milk <p> 150 <p> 425 <p> 8 <p> 26 <p> Orange juice <p> -- <p> 450 <p> 2 <p> 26 <p> As you can see , after a hard workout , recovery fluids that such as chocolate milk , orange juice , or a latte offer far more " good stuff " than you 'd get in a sports drink . Sports drinks are dilute and designed for during extended exercise . <p> To assess how much sodium you lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise , accounting for any fluid consumed . Loss of one pound equates to loss of about 700-1,000 mg sodium . If you sweat heavily and lose a significant amount of sodium , you can easily replace those losses with pretzels ( 300 mg sodium/10 twists ) , a bagel ( 500 mg ) with peanut butter ( 200 mg/2 tbsp ) , Wheaties and milk ( 300 mg ) , or a spaghetti dinner with tomato sauce ( 1000 mg/cup Ragu sauce ) . Most runners consume plenty of sodium ! <p> Recovery can start before you exercise <p> What you eat before you exercise impacts your recovery . According to research presented at the 2011 annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine , consuming protein before lifting weights enhanced recovery better than consuming a protein drink afterwards .

Rest is important for recovery after the weekend 's workouts . Friday is also a day of rest . In between , you get to do some good running , including speedwork on Wednesdays . Your toughest training occurs on the weekends . So begin this Monday with an easy 3-miler , contemplating while you run the training ahead of you . <p> Tuesday : Run 3 miles . Over the next half dozen weeks , you will progressively add a mile to your Tuesday workouts every week until you are running 6 miles in the sixth week . That 's when the racing begins . In the second 6-week cycle , you will alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is all part of a gradual build-up , but the emphasis is as much on speed as on distance . <p> Wednesday : I 've reserved this day right in the middle of the work week for some of your hardest training . For the first 6 weeks of the 12-week program , you will run hills . Then in the second 6 weeks , you will shift to the track . Select a hill about a quarter-mile long , but do n't worry about pitch or the exact distance . Run up hard , as hard as you might doing a 200 or 400 repeat . Then turn and jog back down . Since today 's workout is listed as 3 x Hill , repeat your uphill run three times . Be sure to warm up by jogging a mile or two before and cool down with the same distance after . That will give you a workout today of about 4.5 miles--but counting mileage is not important . More important is the quality of what you do , not the quantity . <p> Thursday : Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . Follow that run by doing some strength training for about 15-30 minutes . Check the screen " Stretch &amp; Strengthen " on my web site for suggestions as to which exercises to do . Put together a regular routine that you can use each Monday and Thursday . This might be a good workout to do in a health club , since you can do your 3-miler on a treadmill before heading to the weight room . <p> Friday : Friday in many training programs for different distances is a day of rest , to allow you to gather strength for a weekend of hard running . In this intermediate program , you will get two days of tough training on Saturdays and Sundays , so take today off . <p> Saturday : In this Spring Training program , Saturday workouts alternate between tempo runs and fartlek workouts . On this first Saturday , do a tempo run of 30 minutes . A tempo run is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near 10-K race pace . A tempo run of 30 minutes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes near the middle , then finish with 5-10 minutes easy . The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout and only for a few minutes . You can do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , on trails or even on a track . <p> Sunday : Today is your " long run " of 6 miles . If that does n't seem that long to you , it 's not . Sunday 's runs will vary between 6 , 7 and 8 miles . The important thing is not to do a lot of miles , but rather to run a bit further than you do during the rest of the week . Save that for when you begin to train for the marathon . Incidentally , if you would rather run long on Saturday and do your tempo runs and fartlek training on Sunday , be my guest .

He is 5 ' 6 " and weighs 108 lbs . He thinks drinking Muscle Milk will provide stronger muscles and make him a better runner . " <p> " No matter what I eat , I can not seem to gain weight . What am I doing wrong ? " <p> " How many extra calories do I need to gain weight ? " <p> If you are among the few scrawny runners who have a hard time adding some muscle , you may be feeling frustrated you ca n't do something as simple as gain a few pounds . For runners who are too skinny , the struggle to bulk up is equal to that of overfat runners who yearn to trim down . Clearly , genetics plays a powerful role in why some runners have trouble gaining weight ( and keeping it on ) . <p> Some runners are genetically fidgety ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they active with sports , but they are also active when sitting . For example , when I am counseling skinny clients , I observe them constantly tapping their fingers and shifting around in the chairactivities that burn calories . <p> The technical term for these spontaneous movements is Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis or N.E.A.T . NEAT includes fidgeting , pacing while you wait for the bus , standing ( not sitting ) while you talk with a teammate , being animated when you talk to friends , or tapping your fingers when watching TV . If you overeat , NEAT helps you dissipate excess energy by nudging you to putter around the house , choose to shoot some hoops , or ( yikes ! ) feel motivated to vacuum the house . NEAT can predict how resistant you 'll be to gaining weight ( 1 ) . <p> Historically , runners have been told that consuming an extra 500 to 1,000 calories per day will lead to gain of 1 to 2 pounds per week . Nature easily confounds this mathematical approach . For example , in a weight gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for 100 days , some people gained only 9 pounds , whereas others gained 29 pounds ( 2 ) . NEAT likely explains the difference . <p> Researchers do n't understand the source of this increased activity , but they do know that people with higher VO-2max ( a measure of athletic potential ) are genetically predisposed to spend more time being active throughout the day . Hence the natural ability to be active for long periods ( think marathon runners ) might be connected to both NEAT and leanness . In contrast , unfit people ( with a lower VO2 max ; think couch potato ) tend to do less spontaneous movement , and that can lead to weight gain ( 3 ) . <p> Five tips for boosting calories <p> Although you can not change your genetics and your tendency to fidget , you can boost your calorie intake . Here are five tips to help you bulk-up healthfully . <p> 1 . Eat consistently . Do NOT skip meals ; doing so means you 'll miss out on important calories needed to reach your goal ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a later lunch , dinner , and a bedtime meal . <p> 2 . Eat larger than normal portions . Instead of having one sandwich for lunch , have two . Enjoy a taller glass of milk , bigger bowl of cereal , and larger piece of fruit . <p> 4 . Drink lots of juice and low-fat milk . Instead of quenching your thirst with water , choose calorie-containing fluids . One high school soccer player gained 13 pounds over the summer by simply adding six glasses of cranapple juice ( 1,000 calories ) to his standard daily diet . <p> 5 . Enjoy peanut butter , nuts , avocado , and olive oil . These foods are high in ( healthy ) fats , and can be a positive addition to your sports diet by helping knock down inflammation . Their high fat content means they are calorie-dense . Add slivered almonds to cereal and salads , make that PB&amp;J with extra peanut butter , and dive into the guacamole with baked chips ( without the bad " trans and saturated fats ) . <p> 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and push-ups stimulate muscle growth so that you bulk-up instead of fatten up . Sooner or later , exercise will stimulate your appetite so you 'll want to eat . Exercise also increases thirst so you 'll want to drink extra juices and caloric fluids . <p> Weight gain supplements ? <p> What about buying weight gain drinks ? Save your money ! As you can see from the chart below , they are expensive and offer nothing you can not get via food . A hefty PB&amp;J with a tall glass of milk add about 1,000 calories for about $1.50 . Youd spend about $5.50 getting those calories from Muscle Milk that you mix yourself from powder , or $14 if you pick up ready-to-drink bottles of Muscle Milk at the convenience store . <p> To make your own weight gain drink in the morning , blend 1 quart of lowfat milk with 4 packets of Carnation Instant Breakfast and 1/2 cup powdered milk ( 1,000 calories total ) .

I immediately agreed to attend and scheduled our return home from Florida to stop ( finally ) in Lexington . <p> We stayed downtown at the Hilton , only a block away from the Rupp Arena where the University of Kentucky plays basketball to 23,000 spectators .

Grass as far as the eyes can see , punctuated by white fences , only a few horses grazing , we assume because spring had not yet turned to summer . Given that the BlueGrass Half-Marathon limits itself to 4,000 entries , the expo was small compared to the expo for the 40,000-runner Shamrock Shuffle in Chicago , my next appearance .

@@102096215 @6296215/ <p> The assignment would have provided good exposure for my book , 4:09:43 , but I did not feel enough legitimate myths existed around the bombings to justify a " Five Myths " feature . The Oscars have been around forever , but the bombings happened too recently to develop a mythology . And quite frankly , focusing only on the horror of 2013 bothered me . I suggested to the editor that he broaden our approach to include all marathons . The editor said , no , and assigned the article to another writer . <p> Fair enough , but given the opportunity to select five myths about the marathon , not merely about the bombings , here is what I might have written : <p> 1 . Pheidippides was the first marathon runner . Despite the popularity of the story of a single warrior/messenger running after the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC into Athens with news of the Greek victorythen dyingit never happened . The story only appeared in history books several hundred years after the battle . Pheidippides is part of a legend , albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 385 yards was the length of the first Olympic marathon . Greek Spiridon Loues probably ran around 24.5 miles , or 40 kilometers , in winning the first Olympic marathon in 1896 . Three Olympiads later at London in 1908 , organizers moved the starting line back to Windsor Castle so the Queens grandchildren could see the race . That odd 26.2-mile distance somehow became the accepted standard . <p> 3 . Boston is the oldest and biggest marathon race in the world . Technically , the Olympic Marathon is one year older , but is only held every fourth year and in different cities . In the fall of 1896 , New York hosted a " first " marathon , but that event failed to survive . Boston is the oldest continuously held marathon , although eight other marathons , including New York and Chicago are bigger . <p> 4 . Women will never be able to run 26. miles . A long since disproven myth , but rules once prevented women from running more than 2.5 miles . Then in 1966 , Roberta Gibb ran the full distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , women dominate many long distance races . According to Running USA , in 2013 , 61 percent of the 2 million finishers in half marathons were women . <p> 5 . The Boston Marathon bombings were a hoax , never happened . Yes , this myth seems ridiculous , a hoax , but conspiracy theories abound around many major events . The Moon landing was staged in a TV studio , right ? Within a week after the bombings , a " book " appeared on Kindle suggesting that the Boston Marathon bombings were a hoax staged by the Federal Government . <p> This is the saddest marathon myth of all . I was happy to have turned down the assignment from the newspaper editor . The marathon has enough legitimate myths without making up others linked to the bombings .

The mileage continues to increase in Week 4 , actually the fifth week of your training . You will run 23 total miles this week with a 6-miler at the end of the week . So you need this day of comparative rest . Run an easy 3-miler followed by your stretch and strengthen routine . Do n't overdo the pumping-iron , any more than you would overdo cross-training on Saturdays . There 's a subtle difference between training and overtraining .

That 's the same length as the Shamrock Shuffle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for a run this long becomes as much a problem as doing the run itself . Including last Sunday 's run and next Sunday 's run , you will be doing runs of 5-6 miles on three out of eight days--four days if you count tomorrow 's tempo run of 40 minutes , which will take at least the faster runners into that distance range . Given that level of stress , the 8-K will seem almost easy . That 's the purpose of this training . <p> Wednesday : A slight increase in today 's tempo run to 40 minutes . By now you should be getting the feel for how the tempo run works : 10-15 minutes of easy running leading up to 20-25 miles of harder running ( near 8-K race pace ) in the middle , then ease back for the last 5-10 minutes .

And do n't forget your stretching routine . Here 's a variation that you might consider for your stretching exercises . Do one or two of your stretches before starting to run . Then stop about a mile into the run for one or two additional stretches . Save the remainder of the stretches for the end of the workout , repeating some if you want . I would n't , however , recommend carrying your weights with you on the workout . You do n't need to do lifts in the middle of the run . <p> Friday : When we started this training program , and I designated Friday as a day of rest , you might have been skeptical , thinking : " I do n't need a day of rest .

Concerning time lengths : You do n't need to do these workouts precisely the length of time I suggest . If you 're a half mile from home when you hit 60 minutes , do n't jump off the bike and use your cellular phone to summon your spouse or a taxicab .

Bowerman also was the genius/designer who used his wifes waffle iron to develop with partner Phil Knight , the first Nike shoes . <p> Less recognized is Bowermans contribution to the running boom that continues today . Before there was Dr. Ken Cooper , before there was Jim Fixx , before there was Dr. George Sheehan , there was this Oregon coach teaching the " Eugene Housewives " how to jog . Beginning runners ! In collaboration with Dr. W. E. Harris , Bowerman published a 20-page booklet titled Jogging that , expanded , eventually became a best-selling book with the same name . <p> Looking back to my genius mentor , here is what Bowerman had to say in 1966 about the then new sport of jogging . <p> Jogging is a form of exercise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of physical fitness or age . At first , an individual may alternately walk for 55 yards and jog slowly for 55 yards for a short distance . The amount of exercise can be gradually increased in small amounts over a period of weeks or months according to individual ability until it is possible for most to run two and a half miles or more at a fairly good pace and walk only a small percentage of the time , or even run continuously . <p> By following a training program used successfully in training college and Olympic long distance runners , a gradually increasing stress can be placed on the body , particularly the heart and lungs . The dangers of over exercise and placing a burden on vital organs to which they are not accustomed is avoided . <p> Psychological tests have demonstrated that jogging results in an improvement in mental attitudes and a greater pride in appearance . A more optimistic frame of mind develops . The anxieties and tensions of modern living are reduced . More attention is paid to better health habits in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inexpensive , can be done at almost any time and anywhere , takes about 30 minutes or less daily and to many is a pleasant activity . <p> The most common cause of drop-outs is sore legs and backs . Leaders need to be vigilant in advising participants not to over-do it ( and ask them to ) even drop back to easier schedules if necessary . <p> The training methods used at the University of Oregon for conditioning distance runners are followed . Basic principles are the alteration of strenuous and easy days and variation in the daily workouts . <p> Shoes are the most important equipment of the jogger . They should be comfortably loose . The soles should be firm , neither too hard nor too soft . Shoes of the marathon type for distance runners are recommended and are available at most sporting goods stores . Tennis shoes are not recommended . <p> Those words were written before Bill Bowerman , impatient with the running shoes he found on the market , began to design special shoes for the Oregon team . And now we have Nike ! Enjoy what the master wrote . 
@@102096221 @6296221/ <h> Training <h> Post Marathon Training Guide - Intermediate Schedule <p> After a week of little-or-no running , your sore muscles should have begun to recover . Your glycogen stores should have begun to rebuild . Psychologically , you should be about ready to begin training again , maybe to begin contemplating another marathon , or race at some intermediate distance . <p> Notice my qualifying use of the word begin . Only you can tell when you 're ready to start training again . Take another week or two off if you feel you need it--even a month off , if necessary . <p> The following four-week , Post-Marathon Training Guide is a near mirror image of the training you did toward the end of your marathon build-up . It allows you to build your body back to the level it was at before you started your 18-week marathon training program . There is a suggested 5-K ( or 10-K ) race at the end of this short , training tunnel mainly to offer some incentive to continue training and also give you a fix on your fitness level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a runner . You just need to start running again . <p> Here is how to speed your post-marathon recovery if you are an Intermediate runner , or followed the Intermediate I or Intermediate II training schedules for the marathon . ( There is no distinction between the training for those two levels during the post-marathon period . ) Even if you are an Intermediate planning to move to become an Advanced runner , do n't  make the shift too fast . Follow this schedule below for the next four weeks . <p> Rest : Rest is an important factor in any form of training--as you probably discovered during the 18-week build-up to the marathon . As during that build-up , rest is indicated for Fridays . Take more days off if you think you need them . You 're trying to ease your way back to a steady state of fitness , not fight your way back . <p> Long Runs : Running long once a week is always a good training strategy . But you do n't  need to do those really long runs of 10-20 miles you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suggest you think minutes , rather than miles . I do n't  care how fast you run or how far you run , but just get out and do something ! I 'm prescribing a broad range of 45-90 minutes , because everyone recovers differently . Use your best judgment concerning what is right for you . And do n't  be afraid to walk at any point during the run , or even for the whole length of the workout . Be easy on yourself . You deserve it . ( Although the schedule above prescribes long runs on Sundays and tempo runs on Saturdays , you can flip-flop workout days for your convenience . ) <p> Tempo Runs : I 'd like to introduce you to tempo runs . In my 18-week marathon training schedule , only the Advanced runners did tempo runs , a useful workout where you start easy , build in the middle to near your 10-K pace , then finish easy . Tempo runs are usually refreshing , plus they 're an excellent way to improve your anaerobic threshold , which translates into faster race times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Intermediate runners , I 'm going to suggest that you build only to marathon pace during your modified tempo run . In a 30-minute workout , run the first 10 minutes at an easy pace , then during the middle 10 minutes gradually accelerate to marathon pace , then spend the final 10 minutes cooling down . That does n't  sound like too intimidating a workout , does it ? But it can be a stepping stone to a higher level of fitness as you move past the post-marathon period . For an entire chapter on tempo training , see my book , Run Fast . <p> Repeats : Oops , I 'm also suggesting a new type of training for Wednesdays : Repeats . In the 18-week marathon training schedule , only the Advanced runners did repeats . In this form of training , you run a set distance ( usually between 200 meters and 2 miles ) at a relatively fast rate of speed . Then you rest briefly , walking or jogging . For most repeat workouts , I recommend a rest of 3 to 5 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by track coaches a " rep , " as in repetition . ) For the post-marathon training period , I suggest you do a 3 x mile repeat workout--and you can do this workout on the road , rather than a track . The first week , run a mile at marathon pace , walk or jog , run another mile same pace , walk or jog , then finish with a final repeat . Marathon pace is n't that fast ; you can do it . But for the second and third weeks , I suggest you run the repeat miles at 10-K and 5-K pace . That gets tougher , but by then your body should be well on its way to recovery--plus you want to do a bit of speedwork to prepare for the 10-K or 5-K race on the final day of this training program . You 'll also find an entire chapter on repeat training in Run Fast . <p> Cross-Training : Continue the type of cross-training you did during the marathon build-up , whether swimming , biking , walking or whatever . I suggest that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build gradually to 60 minutes of cross-training . ( I 've left some leeway between 30 and 60 minutes in the schedule above to allow you to choose how much time you want to spend each Monday . ) Begin to consider whether there might be some new forms of cross-training you might want to try when you resume full training after the post-marathon period . If you ran a fall marathon and winter is approaching , you might try cross-country skiing , one of my favorite sports . Also , if you do n't  strength train , now is the time to add that to your workout routine . I recommend strength training at least two to three days a week for Intermediate runners . Overall muscle strength is good for your health and will compliment your running . <p> Maintenance : Most of the mid-week training is for maintenance : staying in shape . For general fitness , you need to run at least three to four days a week . The Tuesday and Thursday workouts in this schedule are mainly for maintenance . Ive prescribed slightly different distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to speed up or slow down on different days . Too many novice runners get in the habit of running the same distance at the same pace day after day after day . Learn to be innovative--even if it means deviating somewhat from my schedule . <p> Races : Do you need to race to consider yourself a runner ? Not really . A lot of people run a single 5-K , or single marathon , during a running career of many years and never go near another starting line . But racing can be fun--as you probably found out . More important , racing can motivate you to stay in shape , or can push your fitness to a higher level . I suggest that you do a 5-K ( or 10-K ) race at the end of the four-week post-marathon schedule for two reasons : 1. ) to motivate you to train , and 2. ) to serve as a measure of your post-marathon recovery . If you want to know how fast you should expect to run based on your marathon finishing time , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . Or , check the prediction chart in my Marathon : The Ultimate Training Guide . <p> Once you finish this four-week post-marathon training program , you are ready to consider other running possibilities : whether just maintaining your fitness level or training for another race from the 5-K to even an ultramarathon . Training schedules for many popular distances will continue to be available on my Web site . 
@@102096222 @6296222/ <h> Training <h> Half Marathon Training Guide - Intermediate 2 <p> RWith the publication of my latest book , Hal Higdon 's Half Marathon Training , I added a new intermediate schedule . Previously , there was only one , titled " Intermediate . " Now there are two : " Intermediate 1 " and " Intermediate 2 . " The difference is that Intermediate 1 is an endurance-based program ; Intermediate 2 is a speed-based program . These two intermediate schedules exist in a parallel universe , the same level of difficulty . They are part of the logical progression upward from Novice through Intermediate to Advanced . <p> Here is how to use Intermediate 2 to run your best half marathon . <p> The terms used in the training chart are somewhat obvious , but let me explain what I mean anyway . Further information is are included in my interactive training programs available through TrainingPeaks , where I send you daily emails telling you what to run and how to train . ( As I continue to update my website , not all of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intermediate 2 is the same as the old " Intermediate " if you want to use that . ) <p> Easy Runs : The runs on Tuesdays and Thursdays and sometimes Saturdays are designed to be done at a comfortable pace . Do n't worry about how fast you run these workouts . Run easy ! If training with a friend , you should be able to hold a conversation . For those wearing heart rate monitors , your target zone should be between 65 and 75 percent of your maximum pulse rate . <p> Distance : The training schedule dictates workouts at distances , from 3 to 12 miles . Do n't worry about running precisely those distances , but you should come close . Pick a course through the neighborhood , or in some scenic area where you think you might enjoy running . Or talk to other runners . They probably can point you to some accurately measured courses for your workouts . <p> Stretch &amp; Strength : It 's wise to stretch every day , particularly after you finish your run . And do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesdays . Strength training could consist of push-ups , pull-ups , use of free weights or working out with various machines at a health club . Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions , rather than pumping very heavy iron . <p> Rest : Rest is as important as the runs . You will be able to run the long runs on the weekend better--and limit your risk of injury--if you rest before , and rest after . Be realistic about your fatigue level--particularly in the closing weeks of the program--and do n't be afraid to take an extra day off now and then . <p> Long Runs : The key to getting ready to finish a half marathon is the long run , progressively increasing in distance each weekend . Over a period of 11 weeks , your longest run will increase from 5 to 12 miles . And in the final week , you get to run 13.1 miles in the race itself . The schedule below suggests doing your long runs on Sundays . You can do them Saturdays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long run the day after a pace run , than the day beforea . <p> Run Slow : Run your long runs at an easy pace . Normally I suggest 30 - 90 seconds or more slower than your race pace . Yes , I know you can run faster than race pace , at least at the shorter distances , but as the race date approaches this will become more and more difficult . To avoid overtraining , treat your long runs like a stroll in the park . <p> Walking : Walking is an excellent exercise that a lot of runners overlook . I do n't specify walking breaks , but feel free to walk during your running workouts any time you feel tired or need to shift gears . In coaching marathon runners , I usually recommend that they walk through the aid stations to allow them to drink more . <p> Racing : Most experienced runners enjoy racing , so I 've included three races during the training period : one every third week , building from 5-K to 10-K to 15-K . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races look interesting from your local area wherever they fit in your schedule . You can use races to test your fitness and predict your finishing time in the half marathon and what pace to run that race . <p> Speedwork : If you want to run fast , you need to train at a fast pace several days a week . This training schedule for Intermediate 2 runners alternates interval running with Tempo Runs . An interval workout usually consists of fast repeats separated by walking or jogging . The program begins with 5 x 400 meters in the first week and adds one more 400 every other week to reach 10 x 400 meters the week before your half marathon . Walk or jog between each repeat . The best place to run 400-meter repeats is on a track , although you can also use an accurately-measured road course . Run the 400s at about your pace for 5-K , or 10-K . For more information on speed training , see my book , Run Fast . <p> Tempo Runs : This is a continuous run with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Tempo Run of 30 to 45 minutes would begin with 10-15 minutes easy running , build to 15-20 minutes near the middle , then 5-10 minutes easy toward the end . The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout . Hold that peak only for a minute or two . The times prescribed for Tempo Runs serve mainly as rough guidelines . Feel free to improvise . Improvisation is the heart of doing a Tempo Run correctly . <p> Pace : A lot of runners look at my training schedules and ask , " What do you mean by ' pace ? ' " I mean " race pace , " the pace at which you expect to run the half marathon . Some workouts are designed as pace runs to get you used to running the pace you will run in the race . In Week 10 , for example , I ask you to do " 5 m race pace . " You might want to do a short warm-up before starting each of these pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only before the race itself , but before your speed workouts and pace runs . My usual warm-up is to jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy strides ( 100 meters at near race pace ) . And I usually cool down afterwards by doing half the warm-up . <p> Cross-Train : Mondays are for what I often identify as " dynamic rest . " In this case , cross-training . What form of cross-training works best ? Something aerobic . It could be swimming , cycling , walking , cross-country skiing , snowshoeing , or even some combination that could include strength training . Do n't  push too hard . <p> Juggling : Do n't be afraid to juggle the workouts from day to day and week to week . If you have an important business meeting on Thursday , do that workout on Wednesday instead . If your family is going to be on vacation one week when you will have more or less time to train , adjust the schedule accordingly . If this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Program in an extra day of rest to compensate , when needed . Be consistent with your training , and the overall details wo n't matter . <p> Here is your Intermediate 2 half marathon training program .

@@102096223 @6296223/ <h> Training <h> 8-K Training Guide - Intermediate Program - Week 3 <p> Monday : Last week you ran 20 total miles with a long run on the weekend ( yesterday ) of 5 miles . This week you 'll actually run less : 17 miles total and 3 on the weekend . That 's because this is a " stepback " week , a concept I also use in preparing runners for the marathon . This is a progressive program , but it goes up in steps : two weeks of progressively longer training followed by a third stepback week where you gather strength for the next upward push . A stepback week is an " easy " week . Trust me ; it works . Regardless of the plan for the full week , this is your day for a 3-miler followed by stretching and strengthening . <p> Tuesday : Despite this being a stepback week , the mileage for today 's run goes up another half mile from last week . Run 4.0 miles . Your fitness should have begun to improving in this third week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're tempted to pick up the pace toward the middle , by all means do it . <p> Wednesday : Even though this is a stepback week in terms of running mileage , I 'm bumping your tempo run up to 35 minutes , a nudge more than you did two weeks ago . Begin with 5-10 minutes of easy running followed by 15-20 minutes where you gradually accelerate to near your 8-K race pace , then cruise home during he last 5-10 minutes . Let 's see : Does that add up to 35 minutes ? Well , it 's close . A tempo run is an intuitive type of workout . Do n't get hung up on the exact time--or the exact pace for that matter . You should also finish refreshed . This type of workout is best done in the woods , although you can run tempo runs on the road or even on the track if those venues are more convenient for you . <p> Thursday : With this a stepback week , the Thursday mileage takes a slight dip back to 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rest ? Do n't be afraid to run today 's workout at a slower pace . Nobody is going to be standing by the side of the road timing you on these workouts . Experienced runners learn how to " listen to their bodies " when it comes to deciding both how fast and how far to run on any given day . Even though this is a well-structured program , there is room to vary workouts . <p> Friday : During a stepback week , you may not think you need a day off on Friday . And maybe you do n't considering the fact that I 'm not going to ask you to run that far this weekend . But a plan is a plan . Less important than what you do on any one day is what you do over the entire length of the training program . And regular rest is a regular an important part of that program . Having said that , I concede that it does n't matter that much which days you rest and which days you run , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different workout mix , be my guest in making changes--but do n't change too much or you defeat the entire purpose of this Shamrock Shuffle training program . <p> Saturday : Sixty minutes of cross-training . Even though your running mileage declined during this stepback week , your time spent cross-training remains the same . This is not without purpose . It 's easier to progress up in one area of your training while cutting back slightly or holding in the other areas . Do n't push yourself too hard on this cross-training day . <p> Sunday : Three miles for today 's " long " run . Not much , you say , having experienced the heady feeling of running 5 miles last weekend . Nevertheless , when you pass 3 miles in the 8-K race , you will be more than halfway home . Use today 's workout to mentally rehearse how you are going to run those first 3 miles . That may include programming a water break mid-way through this and other long runs . Note also the fact that 3 miles is almost the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend as an even better rehearsal for your race at 8-K five weeks from today . <p> Run Fast : One advantage of a class situation is the group support you get from others of equal ability . This certainly is true with the marathon class I teach in Chicago , but it 's also true at every level , from novice to intermediate to advanced . One reason why the Kenyans have been able to dominate the world distance running ranks recently is that they train together and push each other every day in practice . Top runners gather in cities like Eugene , Boulder , Albuquerque and Jacksonville for mutual support . Group dynamics can be very important in achieving success . If you have the opportunity to join a class , or hire a coach , or train with other runners , do so . You all will run better-and faster ! 79546 @qwx939546

No , I guess I 'm thinking of Twelfth Night . But you 're almost at the end with a lot of running behind you--or a lot more ahead if you plan to use this training schedule as a springboard to my 18-week marathon training program , or any other program designed for racing or fitness . In this ultimate week , begin with your usual Monday **30;243;TOOLONG routine and contemplate how far you 've come . I have scheduled a 10-K race at the end of the week as a final test of your progress . <p> Tuesday : Six miles today .

Accomplishing this often is as much psychological as mental . So go to the track today planning to run fast . Get some positive vibes going . What can you expect from the six hill workouts and six interval workouts you ran during the last twelve weeks ? In an article in Runner 's World , Ohio State University 's David R.

That is because you will be doing a climactic 10-K race on the weekend and probably want to do well . And I want you to do well to prove the benefits of your training under my direction . So I recommend a three-day mini-taper that begins with today . Even taking as small an element as 15 minutes of strength training out of your schedule should permit you just enough extra " rest " to allow you to perform at maximum efficiency . Remember this in the future when you prepare for other important races outside this training program . Even during your 3-miler , you might want to cheat on the pace : slowing down a bit to conserve some energy , even take a walking break or two .

My pre-race tapering routine usually includes one day when I do some easy strides of 100 meters near race pace--anywhere from four to eight strides . I prefer doing them the day before the race mainly to get my mind ready along with my body , but you need to figure out the routine that works best for you . Experiment with different approaches to achieve this end . <p> Sunday : Our 12-week Spring Training program ends today with a 10-K race--and although I generally believe in allowing runners a lot of flexibility in picking their race distances , I would prefer that you do choose 10-K rather than some shorter distance .

Your program goal nine weeks from now will be 15 total miles for the week . <p> Tuesday : Your Tuesday mileage increases by a half mile today . For the last three weeks , I 've asked you to run 1.5 miles on Tuesday . For the next four weeks , your Tuesday training dose will be 2.0 miles .

@@102096228 @6296228/ <h> Training <h> Triathlon Training - Triathlon 2 <h> An 8-week training program for sprint triathlons <p> This Triathlon 2 Training Program is designed for runners who would like to test their fitness in a triathlon by adding swimming and cycling to their workout routines . It requires a moderately high level of fitness , certainly an ability to finish 5-K or 10-K races if not marathons . <p> If you never have trained before , consider carefully before starting this program . It assumes in the first week that you have the ability to run for a half hour and bike and swim near equal amounts of time . Some of the workouts combine two or more of the three triathlon disciplines in a single workout . Also in the program is two days strength training each week . If you feel you need to start at a lower level and have the time before your chosen triathlon , select instead my much easier Triathlon 1 Training Program , which is designed mainly to get you in good shape with or without competitive goals . Like Triathlon 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined the two into a Triathlon Supreme Program , which lasts 16 weeks . It along with Triathlon 1 and Triathlon 2 are available in an InterActive Format , where I send you daily e-mail messages telling you how to train and also offering tips and advice . Click here to review my Interactive Training Programs . <p> Triathlons are fun and can offer a good break from standard training for 10-K and marathon races , if you are a runner . The combination of three endurance events also can provide you with a higher level of fitness than you might ordinarily get from only doing one sport . Consider for a moment now some of what you will need to know to train for a triathlon . <p> SWIMMING : A simple bathing suit will suffice . No flippers , but you may want to purchase a wet suit to keep you warm if the water is cold . Wet suits also provide a degree of buoyancy that will make swimming easier . Noseplugs and goggles are a necessity . If you live near a lake or the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best training venue . You can also train effectively in a lap pool , but remember that almost all triathlons are in open water . If you are not a good swimmer ( and few runners are ) , consider engaging a swim coach to teach you how to do the strokes right . I offer some tips on form in my Interactive program . Mainly , you need to swim well enough to get you through this first triathlon leg without drowning , no small feat in itself . <p> BICYCLING : Biking can be an expensive sport when it comes to equipment . If you do n't care that much about speed , you can pick up a fat-tired bike for a couple of hundred dollars that will carry you to the finish line . High-tech bicycles will get you to that line faster , but they also cost thousands of dollars more . Specially designed pedals , handlebars and wheels also can improve speed , but at a cost . As for training , I suggest you just get out and ride at whatever speed seems comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can sit up and enjoy the scenery more than the serious cyclists who ride in chains at speeds faster than 20 mph . I designed this program to prepare you for a sprint triathlon , not Ironman , so you might as well enjoy your training , not flagellate yourself . <p> RUNNING : The simplest of sports , the main equipment needed is a pair of shoes which you also can use for biking . If I am right in assuming that most individuals signing up for this Triathlon 2 Training Program are runners , you already should have your equipment in place . Plus you should know how to train . Just go out and run at whatever speed seems comfortable . You can save the speedwork for your next 10-K , or if and when you do decide to move up to the next level : an Olympic-distance triathlon . <p> TRANSITIONS : To avoid wasting time , you need to learn how to do transitions , the period between the swim and the bike and the bike and run where you change clothes and equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bike first and run second will teach you to make smooth transitions . Consider that in a sprint triathlon with short distances , it may be just as easy to bike and run while still in your swimming trunks and wear your running shoes during the bike leg . <p> The distances for Olympic triathlons , by the way , are 1,500 meters for the swim , 40-K for the bicycle ride and 10-K for the run . Sprint triathlons are those races featuring shorter distances . Many of these are " local " races designed for fun more than anything else . I recommend them to you . As for Ironman , if you have to ask the distances for this premiere event in Hawaii , you 're not ready to begin training for it . <p> This Triathlon 2 Training Program only suggests how you might train . Try different combinations to see what works best for you , More detailed instructions on how to work out each day , along with training tips , are available with the Interactive version available through TrainingPeaks . Click here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed workouts are in minutes not miles . Thus , " Bike 30 , Run 15 " means that you bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes , what triathletes call a " Brick " workout . Running even a short distance after a long swim or ride helps your legs recover for the next day . " Strength " suggests that you do weight training in a fitness center . Light weights and high reps usually work best for runners , and this is true for triathletes too . Enjoy your training .

Do n't make this a killer workout . <p> Thursday : If today is Thursday , you must be running 2 miles and adding some stretching and strength training after you finish the run . Give some thought to the when as well as the how far of this workout . Most runners run in the morning , because that 's a convenient time , particularly for those who have a 9-to-5 job . And it insures that you get your run in , since things can interfere if you plan to run at lunch or in the evening .

You might want to consider whether or not you can find time mid-day to do this and other mid-week workouts . Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to run , shower and grab a quick snack at your desk ( yogurt , a glass of juice ) in the time available . Training for a road race takes discipline , but often the discipline involves activities around the run as well as the run itself . <p> Friday : Thank God It 's Friday . ( TGIF ) There 's even a restaurant chain that uses that name . For many of us who love to run , we do n't always want a day off . Nevertheless , it 's important to program rest days so that you do n't overtrain and set yourself up for injuries . Fridays as rest days works well , because I always ask runners who train using my programs to do a bit more on the weekends when they have more time . <p> Saturday : Thirty minutes of cross-training--and it should be aerobic !

I mainly want you do something that massages your cardiovascular system while allowing you to burn a few calories . The " tough " workout of the week is tomorrow , when you run long--and I 'm going to ask you to run a half mile further than your did last week . <p> Sunday : Today is the day when you run long , and today 's long run is 2.5 miles . Think about it : Last week you ran a workout that was slightly less than half the distance of the 8-K you will run on race day . ( Remember , those of you who are metrically challenged , that 8-K is nearly 5 miles . ) Today , you will run a distance that is about 4-K , or roughly half the 8-K distance .

Then I lifted , nothing heavy because I 'm not interested in bodybuilding . Following my gym workout , I walked and jogged home . <p> Between warm-up run and lifting , I stretched . I did n't spend a lot of time stretching , only doing so for a minute or two before heading to the barbell rack . Here 's what I did . I reached overhead with my hands stretching to as high a point as possible . Then I bent forward allowing my hands to drop toward my toes , not worrying about touching those toes , just dangling loosely in that direction .

When they 're feeling tight and lazy , they just reach out with their paws and--wooooosh--loosen their body . Nobody taught a cat how to stretch . Nobody wrote a book titled Stretching For Cats . Cats ca n't read . It would be up to cat-owners to buy the book and teach their cats how to stretch . Let 's have a show of hands here among cat-owners ?

Click here ! And if you really are interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bob Anderson , available by clicking here . <p> Maybe we should take that attitude toward our own bodies . Forget the best-selling books . Forget the magazine articles in publications like Runner 's World . Forget what you find on the Internet . ( I just googled the word " stretching " and came up with 31,300,00 screens on the subject . ) You can teach yourself to stretch . I discussed the subject with Suzi Teitelman , a personal trainer at the Inn &amp; Club in Ponte Vedra Beach , where I spend winters . I asked Suzi if she could demonstrate some basic stretches that runners could use as part of their fitness routine . She came up with 18 different stretches . <p> You do n't need to do 18 stretches each time you go to the gym . Be selective . Pick several that feel like they might help get you loose . Try the stretching exercises at home . Do them over a series of days so that you feel comfortable in that position . Do those stretches the next time you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door for a run .

I confess that there are certain stretches that simply elude me when I try to practice them . That may happen to you and cause you to let them slide out of your routine . Fair enough . Why do something if it 's not fun ? Do cats do stretches that feel uncomfortable ? <p> Even though I promote natural stretching , I am the first to concede that you can learn to stretch more effectively if you enlist the help of a personal trainer like Suzi . " Even if you think you know how to stretch , " says Chuck Bytheway , director at the Ponte Vedra Inn &amp; Club , " an instructor can help refine your positions .

You can either recover faster by stretching or delay your recovery if you stretch too aggressively . " When in doubt , do less , " says Suzi . <p> Can stretching make you a faster runner ? Research proving that to be true is sketchy . Most of the exercise scientists with whom I have discussed this question , believe it to be true , but admit that proving it to be true is not easy . No question , however , that stretching can help with your recovery following an injury . If working with a physical therapist , however , you need to get precise instructions which stretches relate to your injury and how to do them .

The result has been a career that has largely been free of major injuries . I still hold the American masters ( both M40 and M45 ) records for the 3,000 meter steeplechase , those records having been on the book for more than 35 years . <p> Simply stretch whichever way feels good and seems to loosen your muscles for walking or running or lifting and doing other things to keep us in shape so we can live an extra ten years and be able to outstretch everybody at the Senior Center . <p> Really , is learning to stretch that difficult ?

@@102096231 @6296231/ <h> Training <h> Half Marathon - HM3 <p> Introduction : In my latest book , Hal Higdons Half Marathon Training ( published by Human Kinetics ) , I created several new training programs . Here is one of them : Half Marathon 3 ( HM3 ) . HM3 is designed for experienced runners , those of you who have been running for several years , who enjoy running road races between 5-K and the marathon , but who find it difficult to run more often than three times a week . Perhaps it is because of a lack of time or perhaps it is because too frequent running raises the risk of injury . If you are one of those runners , HM3 is designed for you . <p> ( Please note that because this is a new program , TrainingPeaks does not yet offer an interactive version . Stay tuned : I am working on one . ) <p> Despite offering only three days of running a week , HM3 boasts somewhat more mileage on each of those days . Here are the workouts you will be asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to train properly , rest is essential . Mondays ( and Fridays ) are rest days . This is to allow you to prepare for and recover from the tough training you do on the weekends . <p> Tuesday-Run : A day of easy running , similar to the Sorta-Long runs in my other marathon programs . You begin in Week 1 with 4 miles and peak in Week 11 ( just before starting your taper ) with 6 miles . Run at a comfortable pace , slow enough so that can hold a conversation with a training partner . Make Tuesday the fun running day of the week . <p> Wednesday-Cross : Cross-training could be any aerobic activity : cycling , swimming , walking , cross-country skiing . If you enjoy strength training , this might be a good day to pump some iron . If you want a fourth day of running , do it today . Because of the variability of various exercises , I prescribe this workout in minutes , not miles , starting with 30 minutes , peaking at 60 minutes . <p> Thursday-Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you run somewhat faster . On Thursdays , you alternate pace runs , tempo runs and regular runs . A pace run is one where you run at your half marathon race pace . A tempo run is one that starts easy and builds to a peak midway through the run before finishing easy . And every third week , you do an easy run . <p> Friday--Rest : Friday is a day of rest in all my programs . This is because runners train hardest on the weekends when they have more time . Do n't  compromise your weekend workouts by thinking you have to do something extra on Friday . <p> Saturday-Long Run : If you 're training for a marathon , long runs are obviously the most important workout of the week . The progression begins with a 6-mile run in Week 1 and jumps a mile every other week to a peak of 10 miles . Do you need to do the entire 13.1 miles in training ? Not really . Long runs should be conducted at a pace 30 to 90 seconds or more slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Running too long and too fast and too often will simply wear you out and prevent you from achieving your goals . <p> Sunday-Cross-Training : Pick your aerobic activity . Weather conditions permitting , I love to get out on Sundays for a long bike ride . Similar to Wednesdays , cross-training starts at 30 minutes and peaks at 60 minutes . Given the variety of different exercises , the prescription is in time , not distance . If you want to flipflop workouts ( cross-training on Saturdays and running on Sundays ) , that is okay too . <p> Some further explanations : <p> Strength Training : I strongly endorse strength training for runners : for general fitness as much as for making you a faster runner . If you strength train regularly , continue with your standard lifts . If new to strength training , you may want to wait until after you finish a half before starting something new . I recommend light weights and high repetitions . Tuesdays and Thursdays , after the runs those days , would be good for strength training after the run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-K into the schedule in Weeks 6 and 9 . Nothing magic about those distances and those days . Feel free to modify the program based on the local racing schedule . Use races to test your fitness alloing you to predict more accurately your half marathon pace . During race weeks , you run slightly different mileage midweek . <p> Tempo Runs : A Tempo Run begins easy , jogging pace , warm-up pace , then gradually accelerates to near 10-K pace halfway through the workout . Hold that pace for five minutes or more , then gradually slow down . I prescribe time rather than distance and suggest that you get off the roads and into the woods where you can listen to your body rather than run to the rhythm of a GPS watch . Tempo Runs should be intuitive . 
@@102096232 @6296232/ <h> Training <h> Spring Training - Advanced Schedule , Week 6 <p> Monday : While running your 3-mile easy run today , evaluate how your 5-K race went over the weekend--assuming you ran one . Did the results reach your level of expectation ? If not , do n't be discouraged . The weekend 's race was designed as more of a test of your fitness , not as a chance to qualify for the Olympic Games . Races offer an opportunity to push yourself beyond your normal training level . Too much racing can result in staleness , but occasional races can help you fine-tune your speed . If you feel fatigued following your race , feel free to take today off , shifting the strength training you might have done today to Wednesday . I 'll have another race ( 8-K ) scheduled in two weeks , so keep that in mind as you continue to move forward with your training . <p> Tuesday : Today is Tuesday , so that means you probably are going to be asked to run hills . Let me check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do it ! Run 10 x hill . After six weeks in the program , this is your final hill workout . The peak of the peaks you will ascend , so to speak . Next week on this day , you switch to the track and begin doing some interval training . Combining hill training with interval training in this manner was an approach pioneered by the New Zealand coach Arthur Lydiard , whose runners included Olympic champions Murray Halberg ( 1960 : 5,000 ) and Peter Snell ( 1960 , 64 : 800 , 1,500 ) . Jog a mile or two to warm up , then stretch , before tackling the hill . Cool down with a mile jog and do some more stretching afterwards . <p> Wednesday : Today 's workout is 3 miles followed by extra stretching . And if you used Monday as a rest day following your race , include the strength training that you skipped . I 've been running a long , long time and have finished more than 100 marathons , and I find 3 miles a comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , where I now have a second home , I run from the Lodge &amp; Club on the Atlantic Ocean shore to the Inn &amp; Club : 1.5 miles down the beach . Often I run barefoot at low tide on this perfect running beach , splashing along the water 's edge , dodging jellyfish marooned on the sand . I walk a minute or two , then run back . Usually , I find myself running faster on the return journey than going out . That should not necessarily be your goal , but you might want to do this 3-miler at a pace slightly faster than your easy 3-milers on Monday and Friday . <p> Thursday : Forty-five minutes for today 's fartlek run . Is there a best time of year , time of week , time of day for speed training ?

Weather also may dictate when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most runners probably would fare best running their fastest runs later in the day when they are not stiff following a night 's sleep , but work and family obligations dictate when to run . Do whatever works best for you , and do n't be afraid to modify my schedules to suit your own purpose . <p> Friday : Today is a day of relative rest leading to the weekend . Run 3 miles and do your strength training . Learn to breathe right when you do your lifts . The worst mistake you can make while lifting is to hold your breath , warns personal trainer Cathy Vasto . That simply tightens the muscles that you want to keep loose . Inhale while you prepare to lift the weight , then exhale while lifting it , inhaling again while lowering it . " The best way to breathe is naturally , " says Vasto , " so that you 're not even aware you 're doing it . " <p> Saturday : Thirty minutes of fartlek is the drill today . This is the second fartlek workout for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , do that . Or consider making this a fartlek run that features shorter or longer speed bursts than you ran Thursday . Here 's some background on fartlek training from my book Run Fast : " Fartlek was first used successfully by the two great Swedish milers of the 1940s , Gunnar Haag and Arne Anderson . It consists of fast , medium , and slow running over a variety of distances , depending on terrain . In a typical fartlek workout , you pick some landmark such as a tree or a bush and sprint to it , then jog until you 've recovered . Select another landmark a shorter--or longer--distance away , and run to it at a faster--or slower--pace . The distance and pace are up to you . The most important skill for this drill is listening to your body . Sometimes you may want to jog more . Add some sprints and strides , and maybe even walk , as the mood develops . " Run as you feel .

I have 10-mile workouts scheduled for the three weekends when there are not races as we move toward the end of my 12-week Spring Training program . If you use this program as a springboard to my 18-week marathon training program , you will discover that 10 miles is the distance you will run at the end of the first week . Enjoy today 's workout . If you did n't enjoy running long workouts such as this , you probably would n't be an advanced runner--right ? <p> Running Tips : In colder weather , nylon tights will keep you running without limiting your ability to move fast . They are generally more comfortable and practical than the old floppy sweat pants runners once wore when I started running long before the Lycra Age . And actually they will not slow you down that much , if any . At least one study I saw suggested that tights allowed runners to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that one , but I do know that at a certain temperature level , I will race in tights vs. shorts .

If the last , you might want to reevaluate whether you should be following this advanced schedule rather than remaining an intermediate runner . It 's not going to get easier ! A lot of people play at running , working out three or four days a week , doing a long run on the weekends , entering an occasional race , sometimes gearing up for a marathon . For a while , they 'll improve just on accumulated mileage , but after several years it becomes increasingly difficult to set Personal Records . To do that , you need to train .

If you have important business , you simply rise an hour early to run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hal tells you to run 3 miles today and afterwards do some strength training , please do it ! Not this one workout , but the accumulation of workouts over a period of a dozen weeks , should make you a better runner . <p> Tuesday : Today 's workout is to run 6 hill repeats , about the same length of time for each as it would take you to run a fast 400 on the track . In other words , if you run 400 repeats in 90 seconds , your hill repeats should take about that time too . Warm up before and cool down after . Because hills vary so greatly in their length and pitch , do n't get too fussy about the precise details of this workout . More important is the application of energy you bring to hill training during the first half dozen weeks of this program . Finding a hill to train on is not always easy , particularly if you live in the flatlands . Jacksonville , Florida , where I have my winter training base , seems flat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high and steep bridges that cross the St. Johns River downtown . They make do , and so should you . You can also do your hill training on a treadmill , if necessary . <p> Wednesday : Four miles running plus stretching . The running segment of today 's workout is a mile further than last week and the mileage on Wednesdays will build during the first four weeks of the program , peaking at 6 miles . In the fifth week , you will begin racing , at which point I 'll have you cut your Wednesday mileage back to 3 miles for the rest of the 12-week program . Do n't forget to stretch after you run ! <p> Thursday : Forty minutes for your fartlek run today . I 'll continue to ask you to alternate fartlek and tempo runs on Thursdays and Saturdays . You 'll notice one difference in the recipe for both workouts as the program continues : the time length of the workouts on Thursdays increases to a maximum of 45 minutes ; the time length of the workouts on Saturdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard runs are coupled with sorta-long runs on Sundays . If you 're not sure how to do a fartlek run , check the directions on the introductory screen .

During the length of this 12-week program , you will run 36 separate 3-mile runs . That can get boring after a while , so consider using several different courses at this distance--and for other road distances . When you have time , it 's fun to run in a scenic area frequented by other runners . Be inventive . You might as well make running as pleasant as possible . <p> Saturday : Thirty minutes for today 's tempo run . Since this workout is programmed 10-15 minutes shorter than most of the tempo and fartlek runs that you will be doing on Thursdays , this offers you an opportunity to run at a faster pace in the middle of the workout . Instead of peaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might want to peak at 10-K pace , or somewhat faster . Since in tempo running , you normally listen to your body 's signals as to how fast you should be running , maybe this extra bit of instruction is unnecessary . Tempo runs are like " swing " workouts that allow you to adjust the degree of difficulty depending on how you feel and how hard you 've run other workouts during the week . <p> Sunday : Today 's distance is 7 miles for your sorta-long run , a mile further than last week , although my goal is not to increase the mileage each week . Just cover the distance . I do n't care how fast you run . In advising people training for a marathon , I usually recommend that they run 45 to 90 seconds slower than the pace at which they plan to run a marathon . But it 's too early for you to think marathon pace--if you even plan to start training for a marathon at the end of this program .

If I had to name one single type of training capable of converting a plodder into a runner , it would be interval training . Tom Ecker , an expert on coaching techniques from Iowa , once described interval training , as " the most effective single training system ever devised . " The University of Oregon 's Bill Dellinger states : " Interval training--if it 's done properly--develops speed in a runner more quickly than any other form of training . " Carefully structured into a well-designed workout regimen , interval training may not necessarily turn you into an Olympian , but it can make you a better runner . <p> How to Improve : Hal Higdon 's How To Train offers training schedules and advice on everything from fitness walking to running the marathon .

If you have n't already done so , now is the time to evaluate your equipment beginning with your footwear . On this day of rest , consider how well you are being served by your running shoes . In fact , they may not even be " running " shoes . If you are a beginner , you may simply have grabbed any soft pair of shoes you found in the closet when you started to run . That 's not bad advice for someone who is not sure yet whether he or she wants to be a runner . You can get away with wearing tennis shoes or cross-training shoes when running occasionally , but now you 're a serious runner .

One scenario would be to run a half mile , walk 15-30 seconds , run the next half mile , walk again , and so forth . Even while you 're walking , you 're still moving forward and covering the distance . <p> Wednesday : Three miles of running today , the " tough " workout day in the middle of the week .

This is because most runners have more time on the weekends than they do during the week . And today 's walk is your longest--45 minutes--so you will need some extra time . Normally , I do n't care how fast runners run on their running days , but I prefer walkers walk at what might be called a brisk pace . What do I mean by " brisk ?

I could assure her at frequent intervals that I was still moving . <p> The weather was chilly as we began in pre-dawn darkness .

He phoned his wife and mine . He even talked to his mother-in-law ! Could I have imagined back in 1959 that I would one day run marathons talking into a cellular phone ? Late in the race I became too fatigued for polite conversation . When Rose called around 20 miles , I said : " Just tell her I 'm still alive .

We were staring down at a mammoth statue of Ramsses II : horizontal , the pharaoh lying on his back , every feature well-formed , beautifully sculpted , perfectly preserved .

Our boat was the " Misr , " that being the actual name Egyptians use for their country . " Misr " is about the size of New Mexico , 30th largest country in the world in area , but while Egypt is wide , much of its population lives in the narrow Nile valley . The rest is rock and sand . Egypt is a very rich and a very poor nation . The top source of income is tolls from the Suez Canal , textiles and hydrocarbons next .

While watching slides in Miss Vincents Art History class , I always thought of Egyptian art as being two-dimensional .

More important , Egypt had tamed the Nile to eliminate floods and famine . Instead of a single growing season , Egyptian farmers had three growing seasons , effectively tripling food production . <p> The High Dam is a miracle , but so is everything about this country , its past , the massive temples and monuments , the beauty of its art . <p> Beginning around the time of the Great Pyramid of Cheops and ending around the time of Cleopatra when the Romans arrived , Egyptians ruled the art world .

Egyptian art is the le plus ultra of everything I learned when I was a student at CarletonCollege in Miss Vincent 's Art History class . <p> Much of the greatest of the great art is centered in Luxor . The tombs in the nearby Valley of the Kings are breathtaking , the size of the temples at Karnak so huge as to make one wonder how could they have been built without the cranes of today . And the colors ! Particularly in the deep tombs , the drawings and hieroglyphics on the walls are comic book bright . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , its colors preserved so deep in the tunnels , makes the colors of the Sistine Chapel seem almost a theocratic afterthought . <p> I asked our guide how the artists could see to work deep in the tombs in an era before electricity . They could not have used torches , otherwise they would have choked on the smoke and smudged the very art they were creating . Mirrors , our guide said : Mirrors that reflected the light of the Sun deep into the darkest chambers , reflecting even past 90-degree corners . The ancient Egyptians never ceased to amaze me ! <p> Obviously from the quality of the art , the depth of modeling , particularly in the features of the face , Egyptian artists had the skillsin an era before Homerto create realistic sculpture . But Egyptian artists chose to thumb their creative noses at reality . Those artists , or most likely the masters directing those artists , made the choice that they would chose style over substance , a choice Picasso and many of his Parisian compatriots would make thousands of years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its time , but not if you compare it to the art of Egypt . Fine art builds upon fine art . <p> Our last day cruising the Nile , we sailed north to see the Temple of Dandara . What can I say about Dandara that will differentiate it , both in my mind and yours , from everything else seen during our trip to the Land of the Pharaohs ? Huge was the temple , nearly every cubic meter covered with pictures and hieroglyphics . Among the many temples and monuments we visited , Dandara was among those best preserved . That was because it was found only recently , in the last century . <p> Sadly , Dandara 's art had been badly scarred by people who , some centuries after the monuments construction , chiseled away the features of most of the figures on walls and columns to obscure the fact that they were gods or humans , or humans who were gods . People believing in a later religion wanted to obscure the memory of an earlier religion 's " false idols . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sayif he knew . <p> There should be a special level in Hades for people who deface the art that came before them . <p> Returning to Cairo and on our last day touring , we visited the EgyptianMuseum . The King Tut headpiece in that loaded-with-art museum may be the most exquisite piece of art I have seen , nudging aside the Charioteer of Delphi . We then had lunch at a public park , built on the site of a former garbage heap . Two mosques and an hour hanging around an Egyptian market Rose being chased by a little boy , trying to sell Rose bracelets : " Two dollah ! Two dollah ! " He even followed her to the bus , but she resisted his advances . <p> The alleys were crammed with people , many of them from outside Cairo , attracted to the markets during a holiday . I was reminded of the alley in Naguib Mahfouzs classic novel , Midaq Alley , a book I read to get in the mood for our visit to Egypt . I am sure this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it . We did pass , however , the cafT where Mahfouz spent many hours sipping tea and crafting his novels .

He is Egypts Fitzgerald ; he is Egypts Hemingway . Finally that night , a gala dinner and an early wake-up call . <p> Departing from our hotel our last day in Cairo we shared an elevator with several people , one a young man talking into his cell phone . When we reached the ground level , he rushed first off the elevator , leaving Rose to depart second . Had I detected a tiny cultural difference between our two countries ?

You 're two-thirds of the way toward your goal , whether to run some fast 5-K and 10-K times at the end or to improve your speed base before starting my 18-week marathon training program . Regardless of your goal , it is now in sight . Think about this today as you run . Also , check the schedule for the full week . This is a race week with a 10-K penciled in for Sunday . Your workouts change as a result of getting ready to race .

Interval training is an excellent way to improve your concentration , which becomes critical when you race . <p> Wednesday : Three miles running with stretching to follow . Continuing a discussion thread begun yesterday , how is your running form ? Usually I tell beginners not to worry about form ; just get out and run . But once runners rise to the advanced level , how they run is worth some consideration . As you run 3 miles today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back should be straight , roughly at a 90-degree angle to the ground .

Swing your arms naturally . The angle at the elbow between your upper and lower arms should be about 90 degrees . Your hands should be loosely cupped , about belly level . Let your arms swing in rhythm with your legs . The legs should control arm swing , not the other way around . <p> Friday : Three miles plus strength training . Form is important in strength training exercises , as well as when you stretch . Do n't be sloppy in anything you do connected with your running . That includes eating .

This program is somewhat different , since the goal is to improve speed more than endurance . You 'll run 32 total miles in this third week of the 12-week program and will reach a maximum of 36 miles in three separate weeks later . Very little difference . Most important is that you increase the quality rather than the quantity of your training . Quality should always be on your mind , particularly on those days when you do speedwork . <p> Tuesday : An increase of one " hill " for today 's speed workout . Well , actually it 's the same hill . You simply need to run it seven times instead of the six you did last week . Thus , today 's workout is 7 x Hill . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front and on the back , " It 's a runner 's thing .

( Watch out for cars if you 're doing this on a road . ) Jog slowly down . Walk at the bottom of the hill . Then repeat . After you are finished , jog about a mile to cool down . Hill workouts are particularly effective for strengthening the quads . Strong quads equal speed .

If you had n't been doing any hard training leading up to this 12-week program , you may have experienced some sore muscles after adding speedwork . You 're most likely to feel the effects of speedwork in your calf muscles . For this reason , it 's important to stretch those muscles .

One of the reporters asked , " Had you ever imagined something like this could happen ? " <p> Unfortunately , I had . <p> Many runners have read my novel , Marathon , about the 72 hours leading up to a major marathon . It is a work of fiction , pure fantasy , with multiple characters and multiple plot threads . One of those plot threads in an early outline involved a bomb on the course , timed to explode when the elite runners passed . That plot thread never made it into the novel for several reasons . Mostly , I did not want to inspire someone to turn fiction into fact . <p> Sadly , yesterday at the Boston Marathon , fiction did become fact . <p> Speculation already has begun as to why someone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested a possible connection with the April 19 fire in Waco , Texas that left 80 members of a religious group dead and the Oklahoma City bombing on the anniversary of that date two years later that killed 168 people . Ironically , I watched the Waco raid on TV from the course of the Boston Marathon . I was covering the race for Runners World , on the media bus just ahead of the lead runners . The bus had a TV set above the windshield , the screen filled not with runners , but with the flames of Waco , which continue to cast shadows today . <p> Did Waco signal the beginning of our vulnerability ? The loss of our innocence ? Or was it Oklahoma City ? Most likely , it was the Twin Towers in New York City on September 11 , 2001 . That woke everybody up . Security certainly has tightened since 9/11 , but marathoners operate on a 26-mile-385-yard playing field impossible to secure . You cant establish security points on every intersection between Hopkinton and Boylston Street as you can at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last mile of their race . <p> Three people dead , one of them an eight-year-old child . Ten people who lost legs . More than 150 people injured . Is it crass to say , it could have been worse ? Not when you consider the 3,000 killed in the Twin Towers . Coincidentally , only one day before the Boston bombs my wife Rose and I had attended The Impossible , a movie based on the tsunami that killed 230,000 in Southern Asia . <p> Numbers ! <p> Is one life lost , or three lives lost , a lesser tragedy than a tragedy with a larger body count ? It is not if you have a connection to that eight-year-old child , and as runners we now all possess that connection . <p> As runners , we sometimes are obsessed by numbers : mile splits ; heart rates ; PRs ( for Personal Records ) ; BQs ( for Boston Qualifying ) , the fast finish times that ( now ironically ) allows the fastest of us to qualify for the Boston Marathon . Given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recreational runners , the family and friends of all those runners , millions of us , hundreds of millions who watched the explosions played and replayed on TV , we all have been attacked . In some respects , our lives as runners will never quite be the same . <p> One of the reporters asked me , " Has this tragedy permanently changed the sport of marathon running ? " <p> In the immediate hours after the tragedy , I 'm not sure I can answer that question . I suppose we all are victims . How can the explosions not have changed the course of our sport ? Certainly , in the wake of Boston , the race directors of the major marathons , those that might be perceived as providing the greatest targets for terrorists , all will be reviewing their security options . They will be guided by the various public agencies , particularly the police departments responsible for the safety of us all . Might we be told , no more major marathons ? Too dangerous . No guarantee of your protection . What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch us and cheer us . Twenty-five thousand run Boston each April . Probably a million or more line the course as spectators . As anyone who has run Boston knows , only small gaps without spectators exist all the way from the starting line in Hopkinton to the finish line on Boylston Street . <p> The Boston bombs exploded at a time when never before has running been more popular . The major marathons sell out on the Internet within hours if not minutes of when registration opens . Could security concerns cause our sport now to go backwards in time ? The first year I ran Boston , only a hundred or so runners stood with me on the starting line . We were of a much more innocent age . I do not expect us to retreat to that point in time . <p> Whether runners were the target of the misguided bomber or bombers , it was the spectators who bore the brunt of the attack .

We hope that we , safely , are allowed to continue to do just that .

At the end of the week , I 'm going to ask you to run 5.0 miles and your total mileage for the week will be 12.5 . But first : consider the fact that if you followed my advice to run a 5-K race over the weekend , you may be suffering from some sore muscles . This is natural , mainly because the spirit of competition usually pushes us to run harder than we might in an ordinary workout . So this day of rest comes at a good time . <p> Tuesday : Following your day of rest , it 's time to get back to business , and today Tuesday 's workout takes a step upward as part of our planned gradual mileage buildup . Run 2.5 miles today . That 's only a half mile further than what you had been running on this day for the previous four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? Good , I 'm glad you agree with me . I like your attitude . <p> Wednesday : Despite yesterday 's jump in mileage , Wednesday 's workout remains the same . Run 3.0 miles . Ho hum , you say . You 're right . If you 're running 3 miles , it must be Wednesday . Pretty routine . But consider the fact that if you precisely follow the schedule , you will run 3.0 miles on 22 separate occasions . That 's 66 miles of running . That 's a lot of miles . It 's nearly the length of three marathons . So feel proud . You have a right to be . <p> Thursday : Tuesday 's workout took a slight jump to 2.5 miles . Thursday 's workout eventually will do the same--but not until next week . Stay at 2.0 miles . Probably at this point of your training you have begun to achieve a level of physical fitness . You 're probably asking yourself , why do n't I go farther than the coach says ? That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do less than you 're capable of running at this point . Doing too much can sometimes lead to injury , something I would just as soon have you avoid . <p> Friday : Rest . Friday is Date Night in the Higdon household . Rose and I usually like to go out for dinner and maybe take in a movie , or rent a video . Assuming you 're going out for dinner tonight , have you begun to modify your diet ? Frequently , when non-runners become runners , they find that they begin to eat differently . This is partly conscious and partly subconscious and reflects the fact that carbohydrates are the most efficient form of energy . People who embrace fitness routines discover this through their reading , but often it happens naturally . Runners crave carbs ; their bodies tell them that breads and grains fruits and vegetables are the best food as for fitness as for health . You 'll often find us in an Italian restaurant the night before long workouts or marathons .

This might be considered a form of rest . I do n't want you too fatigued leading up to tomorrow 's workout , since I am going to ask you to run 5.0 miles , a significant milestone in your training . <p> Sunday : Take five ! That 's the title of one of piano player Dave Brubeck 's best-selling records . I have a CD by the Dave Bruckeck Quartet with that song on it . Brubeck meant to take five minutes of rest : sit back and relax and listen to the music . I 'm asking you to run 5.0 miles today , probably further than you 've ever run before and getting closer to the peak of 6.0 miles at the end of this program .

The majority of runners run in the morning , because that guarantees that nothing will interfere with their workout that day . Also , during warm-weather months , it is cooler during the early hours . Nevertheless , a fair number of runners run during their lunch hour . During the winter up north , I usually run midday because the sun is up , and it 's usually somewhat warmer . A certain percentage prefer running late afternoon , using running to relax after a stressful business day . And a few run in the late evening after dinner . In families where both the husband and wife run , they often need to run separately , rather than together , so one of them can mind the kids .

@@102096247 @6296247/ <h> Hal Higdon <h> Art - Art and All That Jazz <h> Carleton Alumni Adventure <p> Carleton professor Steve Kelly was explaining the structure of seemingly an unstructured art form : jazz . If you look beneath what appears to be pure improvisation by musicians such as Louie Armstrong or Dizzy Gillespie , you discover jazz has carefully controlled underpinnings . " Much traditional jazz music exists in two forms , " Kelly instructed . " Either Song form , or Blues form . " <p> Several dozen of us--graduates of Carleton College , spouses and friends-had come to Chicago on a May weekend for an " Alumni Adventure " that offered to take us to art museums and jazz clubs , providing insight and education along the way . Carleton College ( my alma mater ) , located in Northfield , Minnesota is somewhat unique in this respect . On a regular basis , the College organizes activities for its alumni : visits to intriguing destinations with faculty members serving as guides and instructors . For Chicago , in addition to Kelly , who doubles as budget director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curator of the College art collection . <p> Speaking at the Hyatt Regency Hotel after breakfast on a Friday morning , Kelly continued : " Many Tin-Pan Alley songs consist of four 8-bar segments making a 32-bar chorus . The melody is stated , repeated , there 's a bridge , then back to the melody . It 's the classic AABA format . " <p> " I-got-rhy-thm ! " <p> " I-got-mus-ic ! " <h> Great Improvisors <p> Steve Kelly demonstrates jazz technique <p> George Gershwin and other song-writers from the beginnings of the jazz era did not create this format . You find it in Haydn and Mozart . In his cadenzas , Beethoven was a great improviser on the piano , just like Fats Waller , who started out as an organist for silent movies . Shifting this thought to art , you might make a similar statement about the French Impressionists , also great improvisers . They did n't discover color ; they merely used it in a different way than did Raphael or Rembrandt . Beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been considered proper art , letting their vibrant colors shimmer on the surface of the canvas , painting pictures of haystacks and people walking the streets of Paris carrying umbrellas . Bradley later that day would lead us to the Art Institute of Chicago to comment on works by Caillebotte , Cezanne , Gauguin , Monet , Seurat . I 've visited those galleries so often , but is it possible to spend too much time standing in front of Georges Seurat 's " Sunday in the Park " painting , La Grande Jatte ? <p> Definitely not , but in all honesty , though I had majored in Studio Art at Carleton , I was attracted more by jazz music . My class in Music Appreciation at Carleton had ignored jazz in favor of the classics . I could identify the sonata allegro form that most eighteenth and ninteenth century composers used for the first movements of their symphonies , but I was less knowledgeable about Songs with a capital " S. " <p> Kelly continued his explanation of jazz to include The Blues , whose underpinnings are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> Translate that into music : <p> " I-got-a-right <p> " To-sing-the-blues ! " <p> Jazz music was an important part of my being when I attended college in the early 1950 's . It was an era between the Big Band sounds of Goodman and Miller , but before Elvis and The Beatles forced later-day jazz musicians such as Charlie Parker and Miles Davis onto the back shelves of record stores . Anyone who attended Carleton at that time recalls that Saturday night dances always ended with " In My Solitude , " Duke Ellington 's great melody . <p> " In my solitude , you taunt me , <p> " With memories that never die . " <p> But sliding across the dance floor cheek-to-cheek with your best girl , it was not the best time to whisper that In My Solitude was a 32-bar , Tin-Pan Alley AABA song . Not even at Carleton ! Save that for aging alumni . <h> The Jazz Clubs <p> Karrin Allyson sings the blues <p> Jazz hearkened back to my youth . Each summer , I returned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago . To earn money , I worked nights at R.R. Donneley &amp; Sons , a printing company beside the Illinois Central tracks , near the current McCormick Place . In addition to Sears and Wards catalogs , we printed Time and Life magazines . Each Friday after we got off work at midnight , my friends and I headed for the Chicago jazz clubs , musical descendents of the Speakeasies from my parents ' era . <p> More than a half dozen jazz clubs serviced our musical tastes , the ritziest being The Blue Note in the Loop , where I once had my picture taken with Benny Goodman . More often , we favored cheaper joints such as The Beehive on the South Side , where Dixieland musicians Jack Teagarten and Muggsy Spanier sometimes appeared . As the neighborhood around 47th Street shifted racially , the music shifted with it . New headliners included saxophonists Sonny Stitt and Charlie Parker . <p> As Jazz music in the 1950s moved inexorably toward the 1960s , its fans and practitioners tried to ignore the fact that rock ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I spent Friday evenings hanging out at clubs at 450 North Clark , the 1111 Jazz Club on Broadway and a lounge on Howard Street near Evanston that frequently featured my favorite musician , soprano saxophonist Herbie Fields . Does anybody but me remember Herbie Fields ? I only learned a half century later from Steve Kelly that Fields once had attended the Juilliard School of Music . So had Miles Davis , whose first record appearance was as a sideman with Fields . Winton Marsalis was not the first jazz musician with an acquaintance of Bach . <p> " We most often relate to music we heard growing up , " Kelly claimed . For him , it was Miles ; for me , George Shearing . My first date with my wife Rose was to a Shearing concert at Mandell Hall on the campus of the University of Chicago . She wore a black , sheath dress . Several months later , I asked her to marry me . So did jazz music bracket our lives . In the early years of marriage , we hung out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on Rush Street , the tinkling rhythms of Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner underpinning our love . " Play Misty for me " means more than a Clint Eastwood movie for us . <p> But children came . We moved around the bottom of Lake Michigan to Long Beach , Indiana . Jazz drifted out of our lives . Nursing a drink in smoky clubs no longer appealed . Decades later , when I learned Carleton College planned an Alumni Adventure blending art and all that jazz , it offered an opportunity to return to the music of my youth . Checking in at the Hyatt on a Thursday , we gathered for dinner at the hotel then walked to Andy 's Jazz Club at 11 East Hubbard Street to hear the Mike Smith Quintet . Smith on tenor saxophone was backed by trumpet , piano , drums and bass player playing in a style reminiscent of Miles Davis . Interestingly , the first question at a breakfast lecture the next morning was how Smith had been able to play saxophone and chew gum without missing a beat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists performed , how a musician can grab his instrument , step on a stage and play in synch with a group of other musicians he never has met before . Kelly , who plays saxophone in a jazz band , explained : " The first 32 bars , performed ensemble , is called the ' Head . ' Sometimes , the band repeats the Head . Then each musician plays a solo , lasting 32 bars . The audience rewards each solo with applause . Sometimes two soloists get into ' trading . ' One plays 8 bars ; the other 8 bars ; then the first , then the other . Finally , the ensemble returns to the head , 32 more bars , and the song is ended . Usually the bass player keeps the beat , serving like the conductor . All a new musician needs do is count to 32 to know when to begin and end his solo . Most do this by instinct .

Some paintings , we discovered , had been acquired by collectors such as Potter Palmer in the nineteenth century , not too long after their creation . When his widow Bertha died in 1915 , the Art Institute acquired the bulk of the Palmer collection . Collector Frederick Clay Bartlett offered Seurat 's Grand Jatte to the Art Institute in 1925 . In the 1930s , Martin Ryerson donated 227 European and American paintings to the museum . Other paintings had come into the museum 's collection within the last few years , often out of funds contributed by a number of donors . In today 's market where works by Van Gogh and Picasso attract prices around $100 million in auction , curators must draw on many donors when seeking new works . <p> After lunch Friday , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural boat tour of the Chicago River . Pulling my slouch hat down over my eyes so as not to be recognized , I walked across the street to attend a Friday afternoon concert of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra . The program included two favorite works : First Symphonies by Sergei Prokofiev ( " Classical " ) and Gustav Mahler . As a " Student " a half century before , I often attended matinee concerts paying $1 for a seat in the upper balcony . Bargains still exist . Now classified as a " Senior , " I acquired a last-minute seat on the main floor for only $22 . I could n't help noting that the Prokofiev 's third movement , a gavotte , used the AABA form Kelly identified as typical of jazz music . Analyzing Mahler proved more difficult , but who could not be stirred at the end of the final movement when all eight horn players rise from their chairs and blow the roof off Orchestra Hall ? <p> And who could not be stirred later that evening by songstress Karrin Allyson performing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private party at the home of Chicago Reader publisher Bob Roth , a Carleton graduate , and ate before the performance at Maggiano 's Little Italy Restaurant at 516 North Clark Street . Only a half block away from the jazz club , this entitled us to a discount plus reserved table . <p> Kelly brought his saxophone to breakfast for a demonstration . When an instrumentalist backs a singer like Allyson , he is said to " comp " ( as in compliment ) her . Another term added to our musical vocabularies . After brushing our teeth , we met Bradley at the Museum of Contemporary Art , east of the Water Tower on Chicago Avenue , whose main exhibition featured work by Lee Bontecou . Critics considered Bontecou very avant garde when she lived in New York in the 1960s . Using cast-off parachutes , Bontecou worked as a scavenger artist , occupying a space between two-dimensional art meant to be hung on a wall and sculpture meant to stand on the floor . " Then she moved to a farm in Pennsylvania and vanished from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't stopped creating art . She simply was creating it out of sight of the art establishment . Thankfully , Lee Bontecou has been rediscovered . " <p> That afternoon Bradley shepherded us around the Loop , pointing to buildings that defined urban architecture in the period following the 1871 Chicago Fire , when architects such as John Wellborn Root , Daniel Burnham , Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright were handed blank slates to create structures touching the sky . On a Saturday afternoon , many of the skyscrapers that emerged from their drawing boards were closed , but a knock on a glass door usually alerted a guard happy to allow us entry . Most impressive : gold-gilded decorations by Wright for The Rookery at 209 South LaSalle . So does a three-dimensional art work also have a two-dimensional expression . After circling the Loop , we boarded an elevated train to head south to the Illinois Institute of Technology campus , famous for its buildings designed by Mies van der Rohe , but we were more interested in Rem Koolhaas 's recently completed McCormick Tribune Cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available land . A stainless steel tube circling the tracks dampened the sound of trains passing overhead . <p> We wanted no tube to dampen the sound of music flowing from the Green Dolphin Street Jazz Club at 200 North Ashland Avenue that evening . Vince Seneri 's Band held the stage with flutist David Valentin the featured performer . Knowing I would encounter music to suit my taste at Green Dolphin , I was pleasantly surprised how tasty a meal I encountered too . The night was long . Most of our group left following the first show . Rose and I lingered well past midnight . I was drawn back to another evening on the campus of the University of Chicago and a girl in a black , sheath dress . We had been separated too long from the music of our youth . I suspect that another four decades will not pass before our next visit to a Chicago jazz club .

Their common belief is " the lighter I am , the better I 'll perform . " Not true , if the cost of attaining the perfect body is poorly fueled muscles , overuse injuries , and a dysfunctional relationship with food . <h> If you are an runner who struggles with losing those last few pounds , take note . Weight issues may have little to do with body fat and more to do with " I 'm not good enough . " Have n't we all , as runners , had that thought ? And certainly , some runners struggle with the " I 'm not good enough " belief far more than others . They are the ones who can easily cross the line into having an eating disorder . <h> An eating disorder distracts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough . " After all , if you are always thinking about whether or not eat , and how much to exercise , you are not thinking about feeling imperfect or inadequate . Unfortunately , using food to distract from those feelings can end up hurting your performance . <h> The following information , presented at a conference in Boston organized by the Multiservice Eating Disorders Association ( MEDA ) , offers food for thought for all athletes who struggle with finding the right balance of food , weight , and exercise . For additional information , check out MEDAs website , www . MEDAinc.org . It 's filled with helpful resources for teammates , friends and family members , as well as for runners with anorexia , bulimia , and food obsessions . <h> Food for thought <h> Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness . Whether death is from heart arrhythmias or suicide , we need to pay attention when runners struggle with food . <h> Just as runners with anorexia lose arm and leg muscle that helps them be strong athletes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not respond to stress . The resulting arrhythmias can be a cause of death . <h> The purging associated with bulimia takes its toll in terms of not only electrolyte imbalance associated with vomiting , but also gray teeth ( due to erosion of tooth enamel on the inside of the mouth ) , and dental caries . The person may also suffer from acid reflux , difficulty swallowing , and chronic constipation ( if purging includes laxative abuse ) . <h> Thankfully , many medical issues are reversible but two " biggies " can remain problematic : 1 ) cognitive dysfunction due to the brain shrinking and 2 ) bone health . The bones ( particularly in the spine , hip , and wrist ) lose density . This increases the risk of stress fractures today and osteoporosis in later years . A shocking one-fourth of young women ( &lt;20 years ) who suffer from anorexia have early osteoporosis . Some end up in severe pain for their lifetime , others in wheelchairs . Teens need to be fully aware they are not only losing bone density but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenage years . Surprisingly , men with anorexia end up with worse osteoporosis than women . <h> Any female runner with amenorrhea ( loss of her menstrual period for more than 3 months ) should get her bone density measured for a baseline . Should she also take a birth control pill to force the return of menses ? Current research suggests not . The pill offers a false sense of recovery , plus it does not enhance bone density . The better path is to eat enough food to restore the body to an appropriate weight . <h> Beware that eating a very high fiber can interfere with calcium absorption . No need for more than 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day ! <h> Runners with eating disorders commonly have high cholesterol levels . The solution is not to limit red meat and eggs ; rather , the runners need to normalize their entire diet . <h> Medical symptoms that raise red flags include : heart rate less than 40 beats per minute , body temperature less than 95F ( 35C ) , blood pressure less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between meals . These numbers are sometimes seen in highly trained runners ; hence to identify those with eating disorders can be tricky . Other red flags include noticeable " fur " on arms and face ( lanugo hair , for warmth ) , brittle fingernails , blue fingertips , itchy dry skin , and a yellow skin tone due to overindulging in carrots and orange vegetables . <h> Runners with anorexia may complain about " feeling full " despite a small food intake , and food that just " sits in the stomach . " The solution is to force themselves to gradually increase their intake . Even though they may not feel hungry , their body is starving and needs fuel . <h> Do people recover ? <h> Yes , usually with help from a therapist , registered dietitian ( RD ) , and medical team . Some runners get tired of the eating disorder and learn to accept their perceived body flaws . Others get scared when they vomit blood . Some find hope in a new personal relationship Maybe I am good enough to be loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant . <h> One pathway for recovery is to see the eating disorder as being just one part of you . It is the part that tries to protect your other parts that do n't like feeling lonely , rejected , or imperfect . For example , perhaps you had traumatic experiences in middle school . Your eating disordered part can distract and numb feelings of pain , shame , and fear . It keeps you feeling more in control of life . <h> Try talking to your eating disorder and ask , " Please tell me why you are here ? What are you trying to do for me ? " The ED part might answer " I 'm trying to distract you and protect you from painful feelingsyou know , the shame you felt as a kid in middle school ... " Yet , we all know that starving ones body does not solve any problems . Hence , a probing question is , " How effective on a scale of 1 to 10 ( with 10 being 100% effective ) is the eating disorder in making you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders are miserable . <h> Using a model of recovery such as Internal Family Systems ( www.selfleadership.org ) , runners can discover their core that is centered , competent , secure , self-assured , relaxed , and able to both listen to and respond to feedback . These core values can displace the eating disordered voices and lead to a happier , healthier life and improved performance .

" Todays runners routinely enjoy nuts and berries and are now looking for ways to notch up their diets with more seeds ( such as flax and chia ) and whole grains ( such as quinoa ) . This trend can enhance the health of both our bodies and the planet . That is , by choosing more plant foods , well end up eating less meat and animal protein . If each of us were to eat just one less pound of beef per week , greenhouse gas emissions would drop significantly . <p> While seeds and grains are health-enhancing choices to include in your sports diet , their nutritional value can sometimes get exaggerated .

Sprinkle some slivered almonds , chopped walnuts , pistachios , sunflower and sesame seeds into your yogurt , cereal , salad , and smoothie . Nuts and seeds offer protein , healthy fats , fiber , vitamin E , magnesium , and many other nutrients . The fact that a plant grows from a nut or seed indicates it is life sustaining . <p> Many nuts and seeds offer alpha linoleic acid , aslod known as ALA , a type of health-protective omega-3 polyunsaturated fat . While ALA from plants is not as potent as the type of omega-3s found in fish , any omega-3 fat is better than none . But dieters beware ! When you nonchalantly toss a few spoonfuls of nuts and seeds into your smoothies and salads to pump up their nutritional value , you can also easily toss in 100 to 400 calories .

The slimy consistency of soaked chia seeds can be tough to enjoy for some athletes . If you fall into the " no thank you camp , " worry not . You have many other options for enjoyably consuming similar nutrients in other seeds and nuts . <p> Sunflower seeds have a mild , pleasing taste when added to salads , trail mix , or cold cereals . For people with peanut allergies , sunflower butter is a popular alternative to peanut butter . <p> Pumpkin seeds , also known as pepitas , are slower to eat when you buy them in the shell . This can save unwanted calories . <p> Hemp seeds are touted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protein-boost to vegan diets , but at a high price .

@@102096253 @6296253/ <h> Training <h> Spring Training - Intermediate Schedule , Week 7 <p> Monday : Assuming you ran a 5-K race yesterday , you may want to take a day off . Never be afraid to program in an extra day of rest if you feel your body needs it . Do n't be a slave to any training schedule , this one or any other . Having said that , if you take too many days off you will compromise your training program . Balance is essential in any program for success . You do n't want to do too much , and you do n't want to do too little . Today 's scheduled workout is to run an easy 3 miles followed by strength training . With six weeks behind you , you now have completed half of this 12-week Spring Training program . Six more weeks to go ! <p> Tuesday : Today 's run is 4 miles , a mile less than your peak Tuesday runs of 5 miles . Why pick this particular distance ? Does it really matter that much whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Probably not . One reason I schedule changes in distance is for variety , so you wo n't be running the same distances day after day after week after week . Since experienced runners such as you often have set courses for different distances , this may even force you to select another route for your run : Park A vs . Park B. It 's a mind thing . The difference between doing 4 and 5 miles may also result in an almost imperceptible pace change , which is also good . Final Tuesday instruction : Smile at everybody you see on the jogging path today . Give them a cheery " Good morning " or " Good afternoon . " If someone offers you a similar greeting , it may be because they 're following my training program too . : - ) <p> Wednesday : With a base of six weeks of hill training behind you , head for the track today . Finding a track on which to run is not always easy , since many school tracks are closed to outside runners , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a track when it is being used by teams and , when it is not , the gate to the track often is locked . ) When I 'm in what I call my " winter training quarters " in Florida , I often train Wednesday evenings with the group from the Jacksonville Track Club that uses the Bolles High School track . Summers , I often run at the Elston Junior High track in Michigan City , Indiana . In between those seasons , I sometimes have to scramble if I want to train on a track . Today 's track workout is 8 x 200 meters , jogging and/or walking 200 between . Run the 200s at about the pace you would run in an 800-meter race . In other words : very fast ! When you run this fast , you need a very thorough warm-up to prevent injury . Jog a mile or two , stretch , then run 3-4 strides at close to the pace you plan to run your repeats . Do n't forget to take a few minutes to cool down afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since yesterday was your first day at the track , you may experience some unanticipated muscle soreness . This is natural , and it 's also why I schedule an easy workout for you the day after a hard day . Tomorrow being a day of complete rest , you 'll have even more time to recover from Wednesday 's hard workout before facing the weekend . While doing your strength training routine and moving from exercise to exercise , do n't  rush and do n't  waste time chitchatting with friends . Stay focused on your workout by stretching in between . " Its very important while strength training to have a stretching routine , " warns personal trainer Cathy Vasto . " You do n't  want to lose your flexibility , which can happen if you forget to stretch . Eccentric contractions ( which occur when lowering the weights ) actually can tighten the muscles . " Stretching while strength training provides a double dose of conditioning in a minimum of time . <p> Friday : Rest day . Rest is always an important component of any training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the track , it will provide just that extra dose of recovery necessary for you to have a good weekend of workouts . Remember , the focus on this training program is quality more than quantity . You ca n't achieve quality in your workouts unless you come into the days you run hard well rested . You 'll be able to accomplish tomorrow 's fartlek workout much more successfully if you are rested and ready to rip ! This means getting a good night 's sleep tonight too . Social considerations aside , you probably do n't want to hang out all night at the bars , then be forced to get up the next morning and train hard . What 's important in life to you ? Make that decision and follow up on it . <p> Saturday : Today 's fartlek run is 40 minutes . There are two ways to do fartlek . One is to have a pre-planned course and routine where you speed up and slow down at the same places every time you run fartlek . This is okay , since establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , when I run fartlek , I prefer to run by instinct . I usually pick different landmarks for pace changes . When I run on Ponte Vedra Beach in Florida , I often select dry or wet spots as start and end points for my fartlek sprints . Since the beach changes continuously as the tide ebbs and flows , that guarantees that I never do one fartlek workout the same as the one before . <p> Sunday : Run 7 miles today . One reason for accumulating a certain total of miles is calorie burn . It will help you maintain or lose weight . Let 's consider briefly the subject of calorie burn : You burn the same number of calories ( about 100 ) walking a mile as you do running a mile . That seems unfair , but calorie burn is related to foot-pounds : how many pounds you push over so many feet . Since you lose 1 pound for every 3,600 calories burned , you should be able to lose a pound every second or third week following this program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose weight faster by combining diet and exercise , which is the best way to lose weight as well as keep it off . <p> Running Tips : No matter how fit you may be from other physical activities , when you run faster than usual or shift to a different form of training , you 're probably going to experience sore muscles . Even after running becomes easy , you 're still going to experience sore muscles from time to time--particularly the day after a hard race or hard workout . People get sore muscles for three reasons : 1 . ) They are not used to exercising ; 2 . ) They are used to a different exercise ; 3 . ) They push their regular exercise too hard . To relieve the pain of sore muscles , first use ice to reduce swelling . Heat , once pain has peaked , helps speed recovery by improving circulation . Massage and pain-relieving rubs may help .

Another year , my wife Rose and I participated in RAGBRAI , the ( Des Moines ) Register 's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa : 450 miles in 7 days .

@@102096256 @6296256/ <h> Training <h> Spring Training - Advanced Schedule <p> A Tightly Tuned 12-Week Schedule for Advanced Runners <p> THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED FOR PEAK PERFORMANCE ! Would you like to get in really great shape ? Improve your speed ? Better past performances ? Learn how to compete more effectively ? Maybe you 'd like to run in The LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon later this fall , or another marathon , with an aim to improving your P.R. , perhaps qualifying for Boston . <p> If so , here is a tightly tuned 12-week training program for you . It was designed originally for Chicago Area runners to fill the 12-week gap between The LaSalle Bank Shamrock Shuffle in March and the start of the Chicago Area Runners Association ( CARA ) Marathon Training Class in June . That highly popular class uses my 18-week program to get runners ready to run the marathon in October . <p> But you do n't need to live in Chicago to take advantage of this Spring Training program , which can become an " Off-Season Program " other times of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base and work on your speed . This will permit you later to train for a marathon peak performance with less stress and more success . Indeed , the best time to do speed training is during the spring , when the weather is warming and you can get to the track or into the woods . Speed training also works best at a time of year when you 're not trying to build your mileage for a marathon . And you can use it almost any time of the year , not only in the spring . <h> Less stress , more success <p> The following schedule is for Advanced runners : individuals who compete regularly in races up to 10-K or beyond and who want to improve their performances . You should be capable of running 30 to 60 minutes a day , five to seven days a week and have a basic understanding of how to do speedwork . If that sounds like too much training , you might be more comfortable using one of my programs designed for Novice or Intermediate runners . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I send you daily e-mails telling you what to run and offering tips on training . Click on the link logo to the right for more information . <p> At the end of the 12-week Spring Training program , you can shift into my 18-week marathon training program--or choose another schedule to prepare for a different distance . Following are explanations of the terms used in the training chart below . Further information and explanations along with training tips are included in the weekly schedules that continue from this screen . <p> Easy Runs : The runs of 3-6 miles on Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays are designed to be done at a comfortable pace . If you ca n't carry on a conversation with your training partner , you 're running too fast . For those who use heart monitors to measure their level of exertion , you would be running between 65 to 75 percent of maximum . In other words , run easy . If you want to run with others , be cautious that they do n't push you to run faster than planned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I usually suggest that you couple it with strength training and/or stretching . <p> Rest : Rest is an important part of your training , a very important part . Except for immediately before races , you wo n't find the word " rest " in this schedule . Nevertheless , feel free to substitute rest for the 3-mile workouts on Mondays or Fridays if you feel you need more recovery time , particularly before or after the hard-workout days . And if you feel extra fatigued or catch a cold or some other illness , rest rather than plunge ahead with your running . The object of this training program is to get you in top shape , not push you over the edge . <p> Hill Training : Hill training is scheduled for the first six weeks of this program on Tuesday . The speed benefits of hill training are similar to those for interval training on the track ( below ) , but in the early spring it may be easier doing this workout on the road than doing repeat 200s or 400s at the track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry about pitch or the exact distance . Run up hard , as hard as you might during a 200 or 400 repeat . Then turn and jog back down , repeating the uphill sprints until finished . Be sure to warm up by jogging a mile or two before and cool down with the same distance after . <p> Interval Training : Beginning with the seventh week of the program , move from your hill course to the track and begin doing interval training : 200s one week , 400s the next . Warm up before and cool down afterwards--and do n't forget to stretch . Run the 200s at about the pace you would run in an 800-meter race ; run the 400s at about the pace you would run in a 1,500-meter or mile race . Jog 200 to 400 meters between each repeat . If you do n't have access to a track , you can do these workouts on a golf course fairway or similar straight-away . <p> Tempo Runs : A tempo run is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near " race pace . You do n't want to go faster than your 5-K or 10-K race pace . ) In this program , tempo runs are scheduled for Wednesdays or Saturdays , alternating with fartlek runs . A tempo run of 30 to 40 minutes would begin with 10-15 minutes easy running , next accelerate during the 10-20-minute middle , then decelerate gradually and finish with 5-10 minutes easy running . Important : The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout and only for a few minutes . You can do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , on trails or even on a track . In this program , tempo runs alternate with fartlek on Saturdays . <p> Fartlek : Fartlek was developed in Sweden ; the word means " speedplay . " Fartlek is similar to tempo training in that it features a continuous run that starts and ends slow with fast running in the middle . The difference is that fartlek includes multiple changes of pace over varied ( mostly short ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pick out a tree and run hard to it . Ease back into a jog until rested , then pick out another landmark for your next sprint . Hard , easy , hard , easy . You define the tempo by how you feel . It 's an enjoyable form of training that can either be your toughest or easiest workout of the week . ( There 's an entire chapter on fartlek in my book , Run Fast . ) Warm-Up : Warming up is vital , not only before races , but before speed workouts . My usual warm-up is to jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy strides ( 100 meters at near race pace ) . And I usually cool down afterwards by doing half of the warm-up . <p> Stretch &amp; Strengthen : Stretching is an important part of the warm-up on days when you plan to run fast ( Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays ) . Strength training is important too , but is best done on days when you do n't plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pull-ups , use of free weights or working out with various machines at a health club can help build the kind of strength that will improve your speed . Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions , rather than pumping very heavy iron . See the screens on this Web site for : Stretch &amp; Strengthen . <p> Cross-Training : Not everybody can tolerate running seven days a week . Run more than three or four days , and they get injured . If this is you , consider substituting cross-training for some of your easier running . Although I have not included cross-training as a regular part of this schedule , good days to cross-train would be Mondays , Wednesdays or Fridays when you otherwise might do a 3-mile run . Bike , swim , walk--whatever works best for you . Warning : Do n't train too hard on cross-training days . Train only as hard as you would during a running workout for that particular day . <p> Long Runs : As an Advanced runner , you probably already do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training program , depending on level , I begin with long runs of 6-10 miles and finish a dozen weeks later with one or more long runs of 20 miles . No similar progression is planned for this schedule . Just get out on the weekends and run between 6 to 10 miles , depending on what the schedule dictates . And run at an easy pace . If you run too far and too fast , it will compromise the other parts of the program . You ca n't do effective speedwork if you are fatigued from too much mileage . Mileages are kept relatively low in this program for this purpose . <p> Races : In most of my training programs , I do not prescribe races . But a certain amount of racing is good , because it forces you to run at peak speed and provides feedback related to your fitness level . Racing works best away from the marathon mileage buildup , however , which is one reason I have scheduled five races in the second half of this program . I chose 5-K , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three races two weeks apart , but feel free to adjust your racing schedule depending on the dates and distances in your local area . In the last two weeks of the program , I suggest going for peak 5-K and 10-K performances . More rest is prescribed those weeks . An extra day of rest before the race may help you perform better ; do n't be afraid to rest the day after as well . <p> Training to race is not easy . It 's hard work . It takes discipline . But it 's also a lot of fun .

An entirely new entrance had been constructed : a new toll both , a winding road that wove almost to the beach then 180ed into the road leading to Wilson Shelter , the favorite taking-off point for most runners , including members of the Calumet Region Striders , who do club runs on Sunday mornings . <p> Members of the Dunes Running Club from the eastern reaches of Da Region used to skip the extra 5-minute drive and enter the park through a hole in the fence on Kemil Road , the Parks eastern border .

Sadly so , because I loved the Park . Still do . I was reminded of this love affair as Rose and I pulled into the Wilson Shelter parking lot . We chose to run Trail 2 , the trail off the back of the parking lot , flat , starting on a trail that seemed like it had been cleared of debris recently ( those Park Rangers do deserve our thanks ) , then across a marsh on a boardwalk that Rose thought was longer than she remembered .

And these are two important weeks , since I 'm going to send you to the starting line--twice ! At the end of this week , I 'd like you to run a 5-K . At the end of next week , I 'd like you to run a 10-K . I want you to run them hard . I want you to take them seriously ! Begin the week with your usual 3-mile run followed by strength training . " There is little doubt that some form of resistance training is beneficial to all runners , increasing in importance with the speed of the race , " says exercise physiologist and Olympic champion Peter Snell , Ph.D . " Runners are able to incorporate hill training in their workouts to provide resistance in a highly specific form . Weight training is not likely to produce further increases in maximum oxygen uptake in runners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the track today , run 16 x 200 meters at a pace near to your 800-meter race pace . You should hit times close to those you hit for this workout previously , but do n't get too hung up on the numbers . Jog or walk 200 between each rep . Remember to warm up by jogging a couple of miles , stretching , and doing some strides . Cool down afterwards as well . This Tuesday interval workout is key to your improvement . Hopefully you have already begun to feel faster . This is the last time in this program when I 'm going to ask you to run 200s on the track . If you pace yourself correctly through this workout , the last one should be a burner . Three weeks before the 1984 Olympic Games , I watched Seb Coe run 20 x 200 in 27-28 seconds with about 30 seconds of jogging between on the York High School track in Elmhurst , Illinois . Seb ran the last one under 23 seconds and went on to capture the gold medal in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think of Seb while you 're running these reps , and , whether or not you match his times , try to achieve the same level of effort . <p> Wednesday : Three miles for today 's run . By now , this should be a workout that you run with your hands tied behind your back , humming a happy tune and cheerfully greeting everybody you meet on the jogging path . Do n't push the pace too hard today , because you have a tempo run scheduled tomorrow with a race on the weekend . Consider today as prelude to all that--and do a good job stretching . <p> Thursday : The tempo run for today is 30 minutes : short and sweet . What is the ideal length of time for a tempo run ? I sometimes prescribe tempo runs as long as an hour for marathoners . The Kenyans achieve success by doing hard tempo runs for even more than that length of time , but most runners would break down if faced with this level of stress . At the other end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes or more to warm up and about as much time to cool down , that does n't leave much time for the hard running if you do much less than 30 . On balance , 45 minutes seems to me the optimum distance . Run much longer than 45 minutes ( 5 or 6 miles of running for most runners ) and the quality of the workout begins to suffer because of the sheer quantity of the miles run . Since quality is of prime consideration in this training program , I 'd rather not see you push beyond 45 minutes . Today 's tempo run is set at 30 minutes , because you have an important 5-K race scheduled this weekend and I do n't want you going into it overly fatigued . <p> Friday : Today is a day of relative rest . Jog 3 miles or take the day off entirely . If tonight is " Date Night " and you go out for dinner , as I often do with my wife Rose at the end of the week , pick from the menu well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of calories from carbohydrates , 30 percent from fats and 15 percent from proteins . Complex carbohydrates found in pasta , rice and fruit are the best . It 's one reason why runners often wind up in Italian restaurants on Friday nights . <p> Saturday : If you took yesterday off , you might want to take a light workout today . That 's a routine I prefer . I want to make sure I 'm race-ready by resting a day or two before an important competition , but I find that I can calm my pre-race jitters by doing some running the day before , often the afternoon before . My pre-race-day workout usually is to jog a mile or so to some grassy area . This is easy when I 'm at home , since I live only a half mile from a golf course . Then I do some stretching followed by 3-4 100-meter strides . In case , you 've forgotten what a " stride " is , it 's a sprint over a short distance done at race pace ( which for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I 'll do some more stretching before I jog home . Less important than what works for me is what works for you ! Use this Spring Training program to figure out all your racing systems , including pre-race activities . <p> Sunday : Race day . Find a fast 5-K and race it hard . No 5-K in your immediate area this weekend ? Maybe you need to jump in a car and find one . I 've chosen 5-K and 10-K races for the end of this Spring Training program , because 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters are standard and popular distances . They run them in the Olympics . In fact , you might even consider running these races in track meets , although not everybody enjoys running 12.5 or 25 laps around a 400-meter track in competition . I 've found that if you want to succeed at anything at the top level , you have to take things seriously . While this may not be the peak 5-K for your career , for this year , or even for this season , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual job of reading your body : Any extra fatigue ? Did the race go well--or do you feel like you could run even harder ? It 's usually a good idea to not push yourself too hard in workouts , but when it comes time to racing , " faint heart never won fair lady . " I believe it was Willie Shakespeare who said that first , and the advice rings true today . But do n't relax too much after today 's 5-K race . I have a 10-K scheduled for you at the end of next weekend . <p> Running Tips : To improve , vary your routine . Work a little harder one day , then make the next an easy day . Program in occasional rest days when you do no walking and jogging , or cross-training days when you do some other exercise . Test yourself occasionally to see how you 're improving .

@@102096260 @6296260/ <h> Training <h> 8-K Training Guide - Advanced Program - Week 3 <p> Monday : Last week you ran 32 total miles with a long run on the weekend ( yesterday ) of 7 miles . This week you 'll actually run less : 26 miles total and 4 on the weekend . That 's because this is a " stepback " week , a concept I also use in preparing runners for the marathon . This is a progressive program , but it goes up in steps : two weeks of progressively harder training followed by a third stepback week where you gather strength for the next upward push . A stepback week is an " easy " week . Trust me ; it works . Regardless of the plan for the full week , this is your day for a 3-miler followed by stretching and strengthening . <p> Tuesday : In keeping with the stepback theme for this week , we drop today 's tempo run back to 30 minutes : 5-10 minutes for the easy , warm-up phase ; 10-15 minutes at a faster pace ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive type of workout . Do n't get hung up on the exact time--or the exact pace for that matter . You should also finish refreshed . This type of workout is best done in the woods , although you can run tempo runs on the road or even on the track if those venues are more convenient for you . Do n't press the pace too much ; remember that this is supposed to be an easy week . <p> Wednesday : Today 's interval workout takes a step backward too : 5 x 400 meters with the fast reps at 1500/mile pace , the interval 400 laps between jogging and/or walking . The way I often do this is to walk for about 100 meters after finishing the rep , then jog 200 along the backstretch , then walk 100 before beginning the next rep . How are your workouts going ? For many people who lead " Normal Lives " and work during the week , the toughest thing about this type of training is finding time to do it . <p> Thursday : Keeping with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nudge : 3 miles coupled with stretching and strengthening . Need more rest ? Do n't be afraid to run today 's workout at a slower pace . Nobody is going to be standing by the side of the road timing you on these workouts . Experienced runners learn how to " listen to their bodies " when it comes to deciding both how fast to run on any given day . Even though this is a well-structured program , there is room to vary workouts . <p> Friday : During a stepback week , you may not think you need a day off on Friday . And maybe you do n't considering the fact that I 'm not going to ask you to run that far this weekend . But a plan is a plan . Less important than what you do on any one day is what you do over the entire 8- or 10-week period of the training program . And regular rest is an important part of that program . Having said that , I concede that it does n't matter that much which days you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If your family or business schedule dictates a different workout mix , be my guest in making changes--but do n't change too much or you defeat the entire purpose of this Shamrock Shuffle training program . The training schedule suggests that you either rest or run 3 miles today . <p> Saturday : Even in a stepback week , some workouts continue an upward progression . This is true with today 's pace run , which bumps to 5 miles with two of those miles done at race pace . <p> Sunday : Four miles for today 's " long " run . Not much , you say , having experienced the heady feeling of running 7 miles last weekend . Nevertheless , when you get this far in the race , you will be almost home . Use today 's workout to mentally rehearse how you are going to run those first 4 miles . That may include programming a water break mid-way through this and other long runs . Consider also the fact that 4 miles is somewhat further than 5 kilometers .

This certainly is true with the marathon class I teach in Chicago , but it 's also true at every level , from novice to intermediate to advanced . One reason why the Kenyans have been able to dominate the world distance running ranks recently is that they train together and push each other every day in practice . Top runners gather in cities like Eugene , Boulder , Albuquerque and Jacksonville for mutual support . Group dynamics can be very important in achieving success . If you have the opportunity to join a class , or hire a coach , or train with other runners , do so . You all will run better-and faster ! 79546 @qwx939546 
@@102096261 @6296261/ <h> Training <h> Spring Training - Advanced Schedule , Week 1 <p> Monday : This Spring Training schedule is for advanced runners seeking to fine-tune their training by focusing on speedwork during a time period outside my 18-week marathon training program . If you can improve your speed at distances from 5-K to 10-K , it should make you a faster marathoner too . Once you achieve a speed base during one period of training , then you can shift to increased mileage during another period of training . This is known as " periodization " --and it works ! During the next 12 weeks , Monday workouts are always the same . Use Monday as a day of comparative rest by running an easy 3 miles , then adjourning to the gym for 15-30 minutes of strength training and stretching . ( This might be a good workout to do in a health club , since you can do your 3-miler on a treadmill before heading to the weight room . ) Wednesday and Friday workouts will be about the same--but , unlike the schedules for novice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do " no running . " I will suggest that you take a day off from time to time , particularly if there is a race scheduled on the weekend , but otherwise , this program features seven days of running a week . It 's a no-holds-barred program , so get ready to run ! Are you up to the challenge ? Only a small percentage of runners can benefit from a program this demanding , but let 's give it a try . <p> Tuesday : I 've reserved this day toward the beginning of the week for some of your hardest training . The " hard " days of the week will be Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays with long runs on Sundays that are what 1984 Olympic marathoner and coach Julie Isphording from Cincinnati describes as " sorta long . " In between will be easy days . For the first 6 weeks of the 12-week program , you will run hills on Tuesdays . Then in the second 6 weeks , you will shift to the track . Select a hill about a quarter-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact distance . Run up hard , as hard as you might doing a 200 or 400 repeat . Then turn and jog back down . Since today 's workout is listed as 5 x Hill , repeat your uphill run five times . Be sure to warm up by jogging a mile or two before and cool down with the same distance after . That will give you a workout today of about 5 miles--but counting mileage is not important . More important is the quality of what you do , not the quantity . <p> Wednesday : Tuesday and Thursday workouts form a tough one-two punch in this advanced schedule--but that 's what it takes to make you a faster runner . In between , you get to run easy . Jog an easy 3 miles today , then do some stretching , spending more time on this than you normally might do because speedwork ( like you did yesterday ) has a tendency to tighten your muscles . You can also do some lifting today , but you 'll notice that on the 12-week chart the directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strength " on Mondays and Fridays . This shows where the emphasis should be . Check the screen " Stretch &amp; Strengthen " on my web site for suggestions as to which exercises to do . Put together a regular routine that you can use each Monday , Wednesday or Friday . <p> Thursday : In this Spring Training program , Thursdays and Saturdays feature tempo runs and fartlek workouts , alternating between each from week to week . I do this mainly to provide some variety to the program . On this first Thursday , do a tempo run of 40 minutes . A tempo run is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near 10-K race pace . A tempo run of 40 minutes would begin with 10-15 minutes easy running , build to 15-20 minutes near the middle , then finish with 5-10 minutes easy . The pace buildup should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout and only for a few minutes . You can do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Friday in many of my training programs for different distances is a day of rest , to allow you to gather strength for a weekend of hard running . However , I expect more running from advanced runners such as yourself . In this program , Friday is a day of " relative rest . " That means you run an easy 3-miler like you did on Monday and Wednesday , then follow it up with some strength training and stretching . Consider Friday your " swing day . " If you feel extra fatigued from workouts done earlier in the week , feel free to take a total day of rest . Total rest is always an option if you feel too tired . I would prefer to leave you somewhat undertrained than overtrained . <p> Saturday : Each Saturday you will do either a tempo run or a fartlek workout , alternating those same workouts on Thursdays . Since you did a tempo run two days ago , you run fartlek today . Fartlek is similar to tempo training in that it features a continuous run that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The difference is that fartlek includes multiple changes of pace over varied ( mostly short ) distances . Run as you feel . Be creative . Pick out a tree and run hard to it . Ease back into a jog until rested , then pick out another landmark for your next sprint . Hard , easy , hard , easy . You define the tempo by how you feel . It 's an enjoyable form of training that can either be your toughest or easiest workout of the week . <p> Sunday : Today is your " sorta long " run of 6 miles . If 6 does n't seem that long to you , it shouldn't--otherwise you should be signed up for something other than the advanced program . Sunday runs will vary between 6 to 10 miles , and you 'll also be doing some racing on five weekends . The important thing is not to do a lot of miles on these Sundays , but rather to run just a bit further than you do during the rest of the week . Save the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train for the marathon . Incidentally , if you would rather run long on Saturday and do your tempo runs and fartlek training ( or racing ) on Sunday , be my guest . It 's usually a bit easier , however , to go from fast to slow on successive days than slow to fast . Running Tips : People often start to run with their eyes on the marathon , the classic 26-mile 385-yard distance . There are hundreds of marathons in the United States and hundreds of thousands of runners who successfully complete them each year .

Author of the best-selling Nancy Clark 's Sports Nutrition Guidebook , she continues to offer a sensible approach within a field that , unfortunately is rife with quackery . Nancy 's following column does much to chip away at the belief that low-carbs offer an alternate route for runners . Believe in Nancy when she says high-carb diets are the best . --HH <p> Have you been hearing stories that fats are better than carbs for fuel for endurance runners and triathletes ? Maybe you have wondered if scientific research supports those stories ? <p> To find the latest science , I attended the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) . ACSM is an organization with more than 26,000 exercise physiologists , sports nutrition researchers , and sports medicine professionals . I was able to verify that carbohydrates are indeed , the preferred fuel for all athletes . The following information highlights some of the recent research on the High-Carb Approach vs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head of Sports Nutrition at the Australian Institute of Sport , verified that carbs are indeed an essential fuel for athletes who train hard and at high intensity . That is , if you want to go faster , harder , and longer , you 'll do better to periodise your eating around these hard training sessions with carb-based meals ( pasta , rice ) rather than with high-protein meat . Carbohydrates ( grains , vegetables , fruits , sugars , starches ) get stored as glycogen in muscles and are essential fuel for high-intensity exercise . Athletes with depleted muscle glycogen experience needless fatigue , sluggishness , poor workouts , and reduced athletic performance . ( These complaints are common among the many runners who mistakenly limit carbs , believing they are fattening . Not the case . Excess calories of any type are fattening ! ) <p> Clearly , the amount of carbohydrate needed by a runner or triathlete varies according to length and intensity of exercise . Joggers who do low or moderate intensity runs need fewer carbs to replace muscle glycogen stores than do elite marathoners who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you will find the closing miles in your long runs and in the races to be painful indeed . <p> A study with Cross-Fit athletes who reduced their carb intake ( think Paleo Diet ) simultaneously reduced their ability to perform as well during their high-intensity workouts . ( Runners , think track workouts , sprints , hills ) Those who ate less than 40% of their calories from carbs ( =3 g carbs/pound body weight/day or &lt;6 g carb/kg ) were out-performed by the higher carb group . Eat more sweet potatoes and bananas , if not bagels and brown rice ! <p> Some avid carb-avoiding runners endure a very low ( &lt;20-50 g/day ) carb ketogenic diet . They " fat-adapt , " burn more fat , and hope to perform better , partiularly in ultra races . Yet , most studies with athletes in ketosis do not show performance benefits . Plus , is the diet sustainable ? Who really wants to live in ketosis ? No pasta , no potato , no birthday cake , no fun . <p> British exercise physiologist Ron Maughan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn more fat than carbs during exercise ? " He explained that fat , as compared to carbohydrate , requires more oxygen to produce energy . Burning more fat means that you have to work at a higher fraction of your maximum oxygen uptake . " Isnt that the opposite of what you want to happen ? " <p> Some long-distance runners claim a key benefit of being fat-adapted is to reduce the need to consume food during exerciseand thereby reduce the threat of intestinal distress . Hence , fat-adapting seems like a logical plan for numerous marathoners who fear sour stomachs and " fecal urgency . " The problem is , if they want to sprint faster , surge on a hill , or go harder or longer , they will lack the glycogen required for those high intensity bursts . Hence , their better bet would be to train their body to accept food during exercise . By experimenting during training and seeking help from a sports dietitian , a runner can figure out which fluids and foods will settle well . Perhaps a different brand of sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could offer the needed fuel without creating distress ? Again , highg-carb should become a must strategy for those planning to run " ultras , " races longer than the traditional 26.2 distance . <p> Concerns about carbs causing inflammation have prompted some runners to avoid wheat and other grains . Yes , if you have celiac disease ( an inflammatory condition with telltale signs of constipation , diarrhea , bloating , stomach discomfort , and/or persistent anemia ) , you certainly should avoid gluten . But only 1% of the population has celiac disease and up to 10% may have other wheat-related issues . Research by Canadian sports nutritionist Dana Lis RD suggests that gluten does NOT cause inflammation in athletes who do not have celiac disease or a medical reason to avoid gluten . Those who claim to feel better when eating a Paleo-type or gluten-free diet may have become more nutrition-conscious . They feel better because they are eating better on their whole-foods diet ( as opposed to their previous " junk food " diet ) . <p> Carbohydrates from colorful vegetables and fruits are particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

For master athletes , tart cherry juice can help calm the inflammation/pain associated with osteoarthritis . <p> The bottom line : <p> 1 ) Enjoy a foundation of quality carbs at each meal to fuel muscles . <p> 2 ) Include a portion of protein-rich foods in each meal to build and repair muscles ( for example , scrambled eggs + bagel ; turkey in a sandwich ; grilled chicken with brown rice and veggies ) . <p> 3 ) Observe if you perform better . <p> Each runner is an experiment of one , and we are just beginning to understand genetic differences that impact fuel use , weight , and performance .

They already were assembling more bombs , unquestionably planning other atrocities , assuming that they would not get caught . But as I posted to my Facebook pages , the brothers seemed to have a Plan A ( kill ) , but no Plan B ( escape ) . <p> I was reminded of two other killers from an earlier era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loeb in my book , The Crime of the Century . In 1924 , the pair randomly selected a 14-year-old boy walking down the street in the usually peaceful Chicago neighborhood , Kenwood , where President Obama now has a home . They kidnapped and killed the boy without compassion , figuring they were too smart to get caught . <p> They were wrong . <p> So were the Boston bombers wrong . They panicked ! And when I turned on TV early Friday morning , I learned that the first killer had been killed himself in a nighttime shootout with Police . After a car chase , the other killer escaped on foot , even though wounded . Before that shootout , the killers claimed a fourth victim : an MIT security guard . By being in the wrong place at the wrong time , his name was added to the names of three who died in the bombing beside our cherished marathon course . <p> The remainder of Friday can be described as more than amazing : chaotic , surreal , resembling what I described on Facebook as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my Facebook friends commented , correctly , that the remark was redundant . ) <p> Incredibly , the Police shut down the entire city of Boston for a day while they searched for the remaining killer . There was a lot of bad , or maybe I should more charitably say " incorrect , " reporting as various TV commentators tried to fill the air with rumors and theories . At first , they announced that the pair attempted to rob a 7/11 Store . That proved incorrect . There was a green , or maybe grey , Honda that might be in Connecticut , and we even had the license plate number ! The same grasping for straws to offer to a curious public was exactly like the media frenzy in the Leopold and Loeb case . Like a vacuum cleaner that sucks up anything in its path , commentators grabbed anybody willing to stand in front of a microphone and offer an opinion . That included an Uncle living in Maryland , who denounced the other branch of his family and his nephews . That included one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel first on the telephone then invited to come to downtown Boston to appear live . The friend had little more to say other than the killer was like any teenager . ( Thanks a lot . ) I kept waiting for the reporter to ask the obvious question , " When you saw the killers image on TV , why did you and your friends not immediately call the FBI ? " A college friend apparently did call , as certainly did many others . <p> For most of the day , the Police combed Watertown , searching houses , garages and sheds without luck . The Governor and Mayor finally and reluctantly told Bostonians to resume their regular lives--but keep your heads down . <p> And that was when the killer was caught . A resident of Watertown came out of his house for the first time , looked in the driveway where his boat was parked and spotted blood on a covering tarpaulin . He lifted the tarpaulin to look inside and saw the bloody killer , apparently shot in the earlier confrontation with Police . Luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list of victims . He dialed 9-1-1 . The sound of one more firefight soon would fill the air . <p> Rose and I learned all this while listening to PBS during the 20 minutes it takes us to drive from our home in Long Beach , Indiana to Three Oaks , across the border in Michigan . This was around 6:00 PM , Central Time . While having dinner , I would check Google News on my iPhone now and then for any developments in the apparent stand-off between Killer and Police . We walked from the restaurant to the Vickers Theatre to see a German film , Barbara . Our favorite seats are at a table in a balcony overhanging the hundred or so seats below . A few minutes before the obligatory shut-down of cell phones , I made one final check of the news and saw a headline saying that the killer was in police custody . I went downstairs to offer that information to co-owner Bill Lundberg , who usually offers a brief introduction before each film . ( The Vickers is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , whom I had talked to briefly while purchasing my ticket . They would want to know . So , I figured , would everybody , even if they had not followed developments as closely as had Rose and I. Bill briefly informed the audience that the second " suspect " was now in police custody . I do n't  remember much cheering similar to that in the streets of Watertown . <p> After the movie we went home and checked TV before going to bed , but there was not more for the experts and interviewers to say . We went to sleep planning to catch up in the morning . That was my Friday . It was the end of a chaotic week for those of us who love and respect the Boston Marathon and the runners and spectators who focus their attention each Patriots Day on the 26 miles 385 yards between Hopkinton and Boylston Street in Back Bay Boston .

Heart of America Marathon <h> The Far Side of Marathoning <p> THE LOBBY OF THE CAMPUS INN IN COLUMBIA , MISSOURI was jammed to capacity on Sunday of Labor Day weekend : maybe a dozen runners picking up packets for Monday 's Heart of America Marathon . Race director Joe Duncan suggested that with 175 pre-registered , there might be a record entry . Duncan would n't know for sure until the gun sounded at 6:00 a.m. the next day . Walk up at that time with $20 and you still could start . <p> A runner appeared wearing a propeller cap and a smile-face racing uniform . He had run the Tupelo ( Mississippi ) Marathon earlier that day , then had driven to Columbia en route to running 100 marathons in his first two years of running . This was definitely the Far Side of marathoning . <p> Earlier in the weekend , I had visited Virginia Beach for the Rock ' n ' Roll Half-Marathon , which attracted 15,000 in its first year . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 37,500 expected . Heart of America is America 's fourth oldest marathon ( behind Boston , Yonkers and Western Hemisphere ) , yet attracts only a handful of crazies . I was n't wearing a propeller , but since I was running 7 marathons in 7 months to celebrate my 70th birthday and help raise $700,000 for 7 separate charities , I was definitely Far Side . <h> Roll ' n ' Roll Course <p> Heart of America remains small in the midst of a running boom partly because of a Roll ' n ' Roll course with six significant hills , but also because of guaranteed hot weather . The race began in 1960 as a challenge between local runners and boxers , but only the runners appeared . Joe Schroeder , a Missouri University track athlete , put tape over his spikes because he did n't own flats and won in around 4 hours . Somehow Heart of America has persevered , if not prospered .

But 34 years later , cresting Easley Hill at 13 miles , I looked at my watch and noted that I was already slower than my earlier time and was only halfway home ! <p> Easley is one reason why Heart of America mostly attracts Far-Siders . Coming after a flat stretch beside the Missouri River , Easley climbs 240 feet in less than a mile . In comparison , the Boston Marathon course rises 187 feet through Newton over 5 miles culminating in Heartbreak Hill . You know a hill is tough when it has a name on it . <p> It was less Easley 's vertical profile that caused me to slow and more a road with little shade and a glowering sun in a cloudless sky .

Looking like a guardian angel , she held a " Go Hal Higdon " sign in one hand , a bottle of frozen water in the other . Earlier that week , my daughter had sent me a prayer : " I believe that friends are quiet angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly . " I began to run again . <p> Near 22 miles , I overheard a woman in a car tell a course official , " He 's the last runner .

By then , Holly Campbell who was using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marathon appeared to walk me in the final mile . <p> My time in 126th place was 6:22:05 , a Personal Worst by nearly an hour . Given time in the sun , believe me : it 's tougher to run 6-hours-plus than 2-hours-plus . Joe Duncan said afterwards that the race had fallen short of its record entry , but there 's always next year . As my 7-7-70 quest continued , I had five weeks to prepare for Chicago and the anonymity of a larger pack . Despite my visit to the Far Side , I would not be wearing a propeller .

I arrived on the Northfield campus in the fall of 1949 with some talents , but they had not yet been honed . <p> Certainly this was true with my running . Although I had competed as a track athlete in high school , I had not yet run very fast in my main event , the mile . The marathon was not yet even a gleam in my eye , but I won Midwest Conference championships and served as team captain . I am most proud of having led both the cross-country and track teams to conference championships in 1953 , my senior year .

In my marathon training program , I ask runners to spend the last three weeks of an 18-week program tapering and regaining strength so they can run the race . In an eight-week 8-K program it seems appropriate to taper the final week . If yesterday 's 8-miler seemed difficult to you , that 's because it came at the end of a hard week of training . The Shamrock Shuffle will come at the end of this easy week of training , and I think you 'll find being rested will allow you to both finish and enjoy what is a truly great race . Today is the day you stretch and strengthen after a 3-mile run . But do n't pump iron too hard ; you should taper your strength training too . <p> Tuesday : In keeping with the tapering theme of this week , today 's tempo run is only 30 minutes . Your mid-workout pace should still be about as fast as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Today 's interval workout takes a drop down : 5 x 400 meters with a 400/walk/jog between . Usually in any taper , I tell runners to maintain the quality ( i.e. , pace ) of their workouts , while cutting the quantity ( i.e. , distance ) . <p> Thursday : The 3 miles run today is a cutback from the 6-miler you did last week . Do n't get frisky and try to pick up the pace . Keep this one gentle . Also , skip the weights today . Rest might be more appropriate if your race is Saturday . <p> Friday : Depending on how you feel , you can either rest for Sunday 's race or run anywhere from 1 to 3 miles . Frequently I will rest two days before the race , then on the day before do 3-4 easy strides in the middle of a run that length . In other words , jog a mile or so . Stop . Stretch . Run 100 meters ( walking between ) 3-4 times at race pace . Stretch some more . Finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advanced runner , you already have settled on a pre-race tapering routine that works best for you . <p> Saturday : Rest today . Pick as food choice for dinner something that will be easily digested . Tonight is probably not the night for prime ribs or chili and beans . Get a good night 's sleep , but do n't worry if you have a hard time getting to sleep because of nervous anticipation . That 's natural .

If so , be sure to check my Marathon Training Guide for an 18-week program to prepare you for that popular race . Others may want to drop down in distance to a 5-K .

Soccer Moms often convert to Running Moms if there is a 5-K or a race with a children 's component on the weekend . Soccer is a sport that features near continuous running , so it is easy to shift from that sport to pure running . While soccer programs sometimes drain participants away from track and cross-country at the high school level , experts agree that kids chasing after a ball , or after each other , promote health habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say that about mainstream sports such as football or baseball . <h> Positive conditioning vs. negative punishment <p> Coaches in mainstream sports , as well as physical education teachers , also finally have begun to recognize the benefits of running as a form of positive conditioning as opposed to negative punishment . In the past , team athletes who missed a tackle or a free throw often would be told to " run two laps . " That has faded somewhat with at least the more progressive coaches preaching the positive benefits of aerobic exercises , but unfortunately not all physicians give running their active endorsement . <p> For example , the American Academy of Pediatrics worried about the dangers of children running long distances in a policy statement , published in 1990 and reaffirmed in 1994 . The Academy warned against " epiphyseal plate injuries , stress fractures , patellofemoral syndrome and chronic tendonitis " and suggested the incidence of such injuries relates to the volume of training . Children apparently are less efficient at regulating their temperature while running , which can be a problem if running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cold day . <p> The AAP also worried about psychic damage when children ( or their parents ) set unrealistic goals and fail to meet them . Admittedly , not every child has the potential to become the Olympic marathon champion , but not every student basketball or football player has the talent to succeed in the NBA. or NFL . And while incidence of injuries ( shin splints , sore knees , turned ankles ) may be higher among runners than athletes in other sports ( girl cross-country runners are near the top of the " most injured " list ) , those injuries inevitably are significantly less than those suffered by a running back nailed by a linebacker or a batter hit by a pitched ball . Concussions cause more long-term damage than shin splints . <p> Unfortunately , the American Academy of Pediatrics , while alerting doctors of the " dangers " of high-volume training , failed to set any limit on miles run either in training or in racing . The Academy also seemed to have an unrealistic idea as to how many miles children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy began its Policy Statement with the comment : " It is not unusual for an aspiring prepubescent athlete to run 10 to 15 miles daily and to participate in distance races , including marathons . " But despite what the Academy believes , it is very unusual for boys or girls age 14 or less to run anywhere near that much . A few high school cross-country teams run at that level , but very few . And while young children sometimes do 5-K races , they rarely run marathons these days . <p> " The number of ( prepubescent ) youngsters in marathons is tiny , " states Honikman of the USATF Road Running Information Center . Honikman recalls meeting a 12-year-old at the Carlsbad 5-K this year who had completed the City of Los Angeles Marathon the month before , but adds : " That kind of long distance participation is very isolated to just a few events and a few regions . " Many major marathons refuse to accept entries from athletes of high school age . Boston sets its limit at age 18 ; Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure among responsible running parents to break those barriers . As for whether or not young runners train 10 to 15 miles daily , if that was the case , running kids would be seen everywhere , and they are not . <h> Young marathon phenoms <p> Kids running marathons was more a phenomenon at the beginning of the first running boom , rather than today . Beginning in the early 1970s , there was a rash of youngsters setting age-group records that slowed , if not stopped , soon after publications such as Runner 's World stopped publicizing such efforts . Wesley Paul ran his first marathon with his father at age seven and ran 2:38 in 1977 at age 14 . Mary Etta Boitano ran in her first marathon at age five 1968 , failing to finish , but did 3:01 at age 10 . Neither ever made an Olympic team , but a quarter century later both Paul and Boitano ( now Blanchard ) still enjoy running and hope to inspire their children to follow their footsteps . So much for psychic damage ! <p> " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 minutes a day , " says Paul of his training . " When race day came along , I just got caught in the flow . I do n't compete now , but it 's hard for me to imagine my life without my daily running regimen . " Blanchard scoffs at the idea that running high mileage might set children up for later-life injuries or stunt their growth . " If you 're talking ' injuries , ' what about heart disease , because you 're overweight or fail to exercise ? " she asks . " As for growth , I 'm 5 feet 5 inches tall . My brother Mike probably trained harder than me and is 6 feet 3 inches . " Wesley Paul is 6 feet 2 inches , six inches taller than his father and the same size as his brother who does n't run . <p> Yet children--like adults--differ in their ability to absorb training . Some genetically gifted youngsters seem to have the ability to float across the ground and run forever . Others may need closer parental supervision . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ) says this is particularly true at puberty : between 8 and 12 for girls and 10 and 14 for boys . " There is some risk that excessive running can damage the growth plates , " he admits . " As to what is ' excessive , ' there 's no research that would provide us with an exact number . I 'm comfortable with children running distances up to 5-K and 10-K , if they 're properly trained . I 'm not a believer in kids under 18 running marathons , and those under 14 should probably stay on the down side of 13 miles . " <h> Positives outweigh negatives <p> Nevertheless , Dr. Metzl agrees that the positive aspects of running so outweigh the negative risks that running parents should do everything possible to inspire their children to take up running and other forms of exercise . The link between obesity and other illnesses is strong ; cardiovascular disease has been diagnosed even in teenagers .

Yet , despite my background as a runner , the truth remained : I had coronary heart disease ! Maybe we all do to a point , but mine now had been properly diagnosed . Kenneth H. Cooper , M.D. made the initial assessment at his Aerobics Clinic in Dallas , Texas . Using an ultrafast CT scan , he detected calcification around my main coronary artery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago confirmed Dr. Cooper 's diagnosis and revealed a calcium score of 480 and a homocystene level of 16 , putting me in the 95th percentile of high risk . Later , I had a surgical catheterization under the supervision of Franklin Wefald , MD , a cardiologist at Elkhart General Hospital in Indiana . Dr. Wefald said that I " passed , " that my blood circulation remained good , but he prescribed medication to arrest , if not reduce , the buildup of plaque that had reached 40 percent in one of my arteries . <p> How could this happen to a well-conditioned athlete ? Is n't running supposed to prevent heart disease ? I 've run continuously since high school . I never smoked . I follow a low-fat diet . Until recent tests , my cholesterol count consistently had been 180 or lower . I have a low-stress job , one I enjoy . Every second or third year I visit Dr. Cooper for a physical examination and have always been placed in the 95th percentile of low risk . To shift suddenly from low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet dare I deny the evidence ? The calcification of my arteries did not happen overnight . The plaque must have been building up for years , if not decades . Most likely it was genetic , inherited from my parents who died of heart attacks . My high level of fitness may even have disguised the problem . The increasing availability of highly sophisticated machines , however , now makes diagnosis easier and more precise . My experience should motivate all of us to look in the mirror . Nobody is immune . But you do n't have to wait to be diagnosed with coronary heart disease to modify your lifestyle . Even young people can change habits so as to modify their risk factors . It 's never too early and never too late . Here 's how to keep your heart healthy : <h> The Case for Exercise <p> The case for exercise as a means of preventing coronary heart disease is overwhelming , insists Paul D. Thompson , MD , director of preventive cardiology for Hartford Hospital in Connecticut . " There are a multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active in occupations and at leisure , " states Dr. Thompson . " In all those studies , the more active you are , the less likely you will suffer from a heart attack . " <p> Research into cause-and-effect goes back to 1802 and to a physician named William Heberden who first described angina , the chest discomfort that is symptomatic of inadequate blood flow to the heart . In his Commentaires on the History and Cure of Diseases , Dr. Heberden admitted that he was n't certain how to treat angina , but described a patient who " set himself the task of sawing wood for half an hour every day and was nearly cured . " <p> But few people saw wood any more . It 's easier to drive to the Garden Center in your S.U.V. and pick up a cord for your fireplace . Twentieth Century Man ( and Woman ) sit in front of computers rather than labor in the fields . If you want to prevent heart disease , you need to program time for exercise . Physical Exercise--and specifically running--can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight : Exercise more and weigh less . Run or walk a mile , and you burn 100 calories . Burn 3,600 calories and you lose 1 pound . Overweight people are more likely to have heart disease . " Body weight is not a major risk factor , " admits Larry Gibbons , MD , medical director of the Cooper Clinic , " but it contributes to many of the other risk factors , particularly diabetes . " <p> * Diabetes : Control your weight and you 're less likely to get adult-onset diabetes . One complication of diabetes is heart disease . Exercise not only burns excess glucose in the blood stream , but apparently improves insulin function . Many diabetics who exercise can decrease their insulin shots . " Fewer people who exercise develop diabetes as they age , " says Dr. Thompson . " <p> * Blood Lipids : The most significant risk factor is cholesterol , since this compound causes plaque to block arteries . Exercise somewhat lowers the bad LDL cholesterol , but more important : it raises the level of the good HDL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> * Blood Pressure and Stress : Exercise not only lowers systolic and diastolic pressure , but it prevents the development of high blood pressure . Another related risk factor is stress , including anger , hostility and depression . " Exercise is a proven stress eliminator , " says Dr. Gibbons . <p> * Smoking : It 's difficult to smoke while you exercise . Many individuals discover that by embracing a positive addiction like running , they can more easily eliminate their negative addiction of cigarettes . <p> All of the benefits of exercise on the cardiovascular system are not entirely understood by heart scientists . Dr. Thompson speculates that exercise helps to relax the coronary arteries so they open up . Exercise also increases the amount of blood pumped with each heartbeat . This lowers the workload , so the heart muscle uses less oxygen . Increased blood flow also promotes the development of collateral routes : bypasses around semi-blocked arteries that can help you survive a heart attack if one occurs . <p> How far do you need to run ? There 's no easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more you run , the more protection you get . While a 1-mile walk is good ; 3 miles jogging seems to be better . At higher mileages , you reach a point of diminishing returns , but the exact mileage is hard to pinpoint , and it certainly varies with individuals . " Research at the Cooper Clinic , however , suggests that most benefits occur by 3 miles , but you need to be regular--at least five days a week ( thus , 15 miles a week ) . Running some of those 3-mile workouts at a faster pace ( 85% of maximum heart rate ) seems to offer more benefits , but may create additional risk for those with arteries already partially blocked . <p> " The major risk is for people who have hidden heart disease , or who develop symptoms and ignore them , " cautions Dr. Thompson . Exercise , however , is not a panacea . As I discovered when tested at the Cooper Clinic , all the running I did failed to immunize me from coronary heart disease . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy diet : <h> The Case for Diet <p> While exercise is essential if you want to prevent coronary heart disease , diet and nutrition rank equal in importance . It 's the other edge of the preventive sword . Why place so much emphasis on diet ? In Eat Your Way to a Healthy Heart , Liz Applegate , Ph.D . explains : " More than half the deaths that occur every year in the U.S. are a direct result of clogged arteries that cause heart attacks and strokes . Twice as many people die of heart and other vascular diseases than cancer . Food is your best weapon against heart disease . " <p> The first rule of managing heart health with nutrition is getting the fat content of your meals into the 20 to 30 percent range . For most people , this means lowering fat content , but some individuals already on very low-fat diets may actually need to increase fat intake . The best fats are the monounsaturated fats found in olive oil , canola oil and nuts . Also ranking high among nutritionists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in flaxseed meal and oil . The worst are the saturated fats found in animal products and processed foods , which also contain artery-clogging hydrogenated fats , or trans-fats . <p> " You need to know your blood lipid profile to make effective food choices , " explains Joanne Milkereit , R.D. at the Medical University of South Carolina . " Individuals who choose low-fat diets may have low levels of LDL cholesterol , but , surprisingly , they sometimes have high triglycerides and not enough of the ( good ) HDL cholesterol . " Milkereit cites a National Institutes of Health recommendation that cholesterol should be measured in all adults 20 years of age and over at least once every five years . HDL cholesterol can be measured at the same time . Consult a physician to determine whether you should change your diet to improve your lipid profile ; consult a dietitian for advice on how to do it . <p> Heart strategy is also important . It 's not only what you eat , but when you eat it , claims Nancy Clark , RD , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of Nancy Clark 's Sports Nutrition Guidebook . Clark identifies breakfast as the key meal of the day . " Fortify yourself for a high-energy day by eating a hearty breakfast featuring a fiber-rich cereal covered with lots of fruit , and you wo n't get as hungry later in the day , " she says . " Add a good lunch , and you 'll be less likely to snack on fatty foods that are bad for your heart . " <p> Current research identifies fiber as important for heart health . Dr. Applegate recommends that in addition to choosing that high-fiber cereal ( she prefers oats ) , keep peels on fruits and select whole versions of other grain products . She also likes beans , particularly kidney beans and lentils . " The amount of fiber in beans is staggering , " says Dr. Applegate . " Everybody should be eating beans four or five times a week . " While you are getting the fat out , get into your diet the vitamins that research suggest promote a healthy heart . These would include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although many cardiologists prescribe supplemental vitamins such as B6 , B12 and Folic Acid to help keep homocysteine levels low , nutritionists such as Milkereit , Applegate and Clark prefer that individuals first seek those vitamins in the refrigerator rather than in the medicine cabinet . <p> Here are some heart-healthy foods they suggest you add to your table : <p> * Oil and Nuts : Researchers suspect that the olive oil present in the diets of people living in Mediterranean countries is one reason people from those countries have a lower rate of heart attacks than Northern Europeans . Choose an olive oil-based salad dressing instead of the creamy kind . Almonds and peanuts ( including peanut butter ) also are good sources of monounsaturated fats . And do n't add monounsaturated fats without subtracting saturated fats . " If you are already getting 30 percent of your calories from fats , adding olive oil and nuts will be too much , " warns Milkereit . <p> * Fish : Eskimos traditionally followed diets containing as much as 50 percent fats , yet rarely died of heart attacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omega-3 fats found in cold-water fish . ( This is a liquid form of fat different from the hard fat found in butter and diary products . ) Rather than clog arteries , Omega-3 fats lower blood cholesterol and triglycerides and decrease the likelihood of blood clots by making platelets in the blood less " sticky , " thus less likely to stick to artery walls . Salmon , a fish found in the waters around Alaska , but also in the Great Lakes , is a particularly good menu choice . " If you do n't eat fish at least once a week , " suggests Dr. Applegate , " you are n't taking advantage of a heart-healthy diet . " Tuna , as well as salmon , is a particularly good source of Vitamin B12 . <p> * Veggies : " Go for the ( carotene-rich ) dark green stuff , such as broccoli and spinach " advises Clark . Spinach is a good source of Folic Acid , often prescribed for heart patients . Clark recommends any vegetables with deep color such as tomatoes and carrots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some are just nutritionally better than others . " Milkereit 's favorite vegetable is the sweet potato , which she would rather see on the plates of carbo-loading runners than pasta . " Pasta attracts a lot of attention , but it 's made from processed grain , " she says . Beans are good heart protectors , particularly soybeans . <p> * Soy : Regardless of how it comes--tofu , miso , natto , tempeh , soymilk , soyu flour , soybeans , soynuts , soy sauce--soy has leaped to the top of the charts among nutritionists seeking to prevent heart disease . Soy contains phytochemicals that prevent blood clots from forming . Dr. Applegate recommends that runners get at least one serving of soy into their diets each day . " When soy protein is substituted in the diet for other proteins such as milk or beef , cholesterol levels fall off the chart , " she says . <p> While I always followed what I considered a well-balanced diet , because I ate a wide variety of lightly processed foods and got sufficient carbohydrate to fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took indicated that I still had room for improvement . Fortunately , I have begun to take steps to assure that I will continue to run into the millennium . I now watch my diet even more closely and have begun to take supplements , including Folic Acid , Niacin , Norvasc and baby aspirin under Dr. Wefald 's supervision . <p> When Dr. Wefald called with the results of my most recent blood test , he said all the numbers looked good . My triglycerides were at 122 , and my total cholesterol had dropped from 212 to 184 . My ( bad ) LDL cholesterol fell from 144 to 105 ; my ( good ) HDL went from 50 to 54 , resulting in an impressive LDL/HDL ratio of 1.94 . My homocysteines were now TK . I plan to make some additional dietary changes to improve even those numbers <p> According to Pamela Douglas , MD of Harvard Medical School : " The most powerful thing you can do to prevent heart disease is to exercise and eat well .

For several years , David belonged to ASJA , although he currently works in management for ATP ( Association of Tennis Professionals ) in Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida where we now have a second home . <p> Her oldest brother Kevin is the only family member who stayed straight and avoided a media career . Kevin serves as Vice President of Finance for Elkhart ( Indiana ) General Hospital . Several months after Kevin was born in 1959 , I decided to quit my job as Assistant Editor for The Kiwanis Magazine and become a freelance writer .

Parents Magazine had accepted a humor article I wrote about " natural childbirth " featuring Kevin . " We Had Our Child--Naturally , " was its title . They paid $250 , big money in those days . I walked into my first SMW/ASJA meeting proud as if I had a book on the best-seller list . <p> Despite its distance from New York , the epicenter of the magazine world at that time , the Chicago chapter had some heavy hitters : Bernie Asbell , Bill Furlong , Bill Surface .

Best-selling authors Vance Packard , Betty Friedan and Al Toffler were simply people who stuck out their hands to say hello . I learned professionalism from these pros . They became my mentors . <p> Bernie Asbell , now departed , remained a dear friend , even after he moved East . During a craft meeting in Chicago , Bernie described his system for organizing magazine articles . After doing the research and interviews , he would put all the facts and quotes on separate 3 by 5 cards , then make an outline . Next , Bernie would organize the cards according to the outline . Finally , he would write . I have never experienced writer 's block , thanks to Bernie Asbell .

I had forgotten the incident , but it made a profound impression on her . <p> Thus do we mentor others . The woman is now an established member of the Society of American Travel Writers , although she 's not in the Baseball Hall of Fame either . <h> My Most Memorable Magazine Assignment <p> Bernie Asbell taught me to always end with a good anecdote .

After completing the research , I was invited to fly first class to Washington to discuss my progress . ( Ann Landers was my seat companion on the plane , but that 's another story . ) After arriving at Geographic headquarters , I was marched upstairs to a penthouse lunch . The finest china ; the best wines . I sat down at one end of a long table with editors on all sides and the top editor at one end . Here I was seated in a chair that probably had felt the buns of Admiral Bird , Sir Edmund Hillary , John Glenn , every great explorer in history .

The sterile males mated with fertile females , thus no offspring . The screwworm migration toward Texas was blunted , but the factory that required a sterile suit for entry was the foulest and worse-smelling place I ever had visited . <p> I looked out over the Geographic editors and realized I never would be invited back to lunch again-and I was n't .

Also , to recognize that the sport has experienced another major change in the half dozen years since the third edition . <p> First , more and more women are running , outnumbering men in more and more marathons . Should women train differently than men ? That is a question I might have answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less sure of myself now . <p> Marathons have both become more expensive and more difficult to enter , the Boston Marathon filling its field in 8 hours and 3 minutes after opening for registration . While Big City marathons with their 40,000-runner fields often are " more fun " than smaller races , not everybody enjoys being slowed by crowdsparticularly when it comes time to achieve an illusive Boston Qualifier ( BQ ) . Charities continue to attract large numbers to the sport , but running lately has suffered some stress faults , which may need to be mended . <p> We also have more gadgets , everything from GPS watches to heart monitors to map-tracking devices . I recently recorded an " app " for a training program of mine that you can download onto your iPhone . <p> Speaking of half marathons , these 13.1-mile events are growing even faster than marathons . More and more new runners ( thankfully ) now use half marathons as stepping stones to their first marathons . And more and more experienced runners now welcome the surge in half marathons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without always going the full 26.2-mile distance . At events such as Disney World ( Orlando ) and Grandma 's ( Duluth ) , the accompanying half marathon sells out more quickly than the full . <p> All this has happened since the publication of the third edition of Marathon : The Ultimate Training Guide in 2005 . I am happy to offer you this fourth edition as reflecting the sport as it exists today . I want to show you the way to a comfortable finish if you are running your first marathon , or to an improved performance if that is your goal in a latter marathon . Please join me on the starting line .

This is your eighth week of training in my 12-week Spring Training program , and you have reached what will be the peak in total weekly mileage : 30 . You 'll also run 29-30 miles in Weeks 10 and 11 with the mileage slightly down in Weeks 9 and 12 , because those are race weeks . But as I 've emphasized time and time again , high mileage is not the high priority in this program . It 's what you do with those miles that count . Quality . Quality . Quality ! I 'm going to ask you to push a bit on a couple of days this week , so that makes this day of relative rest particularly important in the scheme of things . <p> Tuesday : Following your day of rest , it 's time to get back to business ; five miles is scheduled for today 's workout . As with our previous Tuesday workouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday 's 3-miler . The fact that you 're going two more miles raises the stress anyway , but move at a slightly faster pace . That does n't mean you ca n't hold a conversation with a partner while running , but allow yourself the luxury of getting slightly out of breath . Important to success in any sport is a distance base , and that is one of the purposes for running a bit longer today . Melvin H. Williams , Ph.D. , an exercise physiologist at Old Dominion University and a top-ranked masters athlete , was never a distance runner in high school , but he ran to get in shape for other sports . " All of that background running helped to lay a groundwork of base training that I took advantage of immediately when I got serious about being a runner , " says Dr. Williams . <p> Wednesday : Last week I had you run an interval workout that consisted of repeat 200s . This week the workout recipe is : 6 x 400 , jogging and/or walking 200-400 between . Run these 400s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mile race . Mike Barnow , a coach from Irvington , New York , usually recommends that runners carefully pace themselves during their speed workouts with their goal being to run the later repeats somewhat faster than the earlier ones and also run faster at the end of each rep than at the start . " Do n't beat yourself up at the beginning of your speed workouts on the track , " advises Barnow . " I would rather have an athlete run a few seconds slower during the early portion of a repeat , but be able to finish strong . The goal is to maintain good form , rather than become so fatigued that you break down . <p> Thursday : Today 's recovery workout after yesterday 's hard track workout is 3 miles plus strength training . Do n't be tempted to run further . Stay at 3 miles . The same with your strength training : Go slow and remain in control . " You 're not trying to see how fast you can get in and out of the weight room , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your race on the road . " At this point of your training you have begun to achieve a higher level of fitness . You 're probably asking yourself , why do n't I go farther or do more than the coach says ? That 's not always a good idea . I 'd rather have you do less than you 're capable of running at this point . Doing too much can sometimes lead to injury , something I would just as soon have you avoid . <p> Friday : Rest . Friday is Date Night in the Higdon household . Rose and I usually like to go out for dinner and maybe take in a movie , or rent a video . Assuming you 're going out for dinner tonight , do you pay attention to your diet ? Frequently , when people become runners , they find that they begin to eat differently . This is partly conscious and partly subconscious and reflects the fact that carbohydrates are the most efficient form of energy . People who embrace fitness routines discover this through their reading , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies tell them that breads and grains and fruits and vegetables are the best foods for fitness and for good health . You 'll often find us in an Italian restaurant the night before long workouts or marathons . I 'm lucky in that I do n't have to eat out to get spaghetti ; Rose is of Italian-American descent . <p> Saturday : Tempo run today : 40 minutes . Begin at an easy pace , then 10-15 minutes into the workout gradually pick up the pace so that about 25-30 minutes into the workout you are cruising along near 10-K pace , then gradually decelerate to the finish . Concentrate on how you 're running--particularly during the fast part of the run . Associating ( paying attention to what you 're doing ) can help you run faster than dissociating ( letting your mind wander ) . In research at the University of Cape Town in South Africa , Hein Helgo Schomer , Ph.D . had coaches accompany a group of mid-pack runners during workouts , pedaling beside them on a bicycle . " The coaches reinforced associative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runners and reminding them to monitor body signals . " Before coaching , the runners used association only 45 percent of the time . By the fifth week , they were associating 70 percent of the time , and their average training intensity also rose . Runners later commented that the mental-strategy training program inspired them to run harder workouts . <p> Sunday : Eight miles today , finishing a fairly intensive week , one of your toughest so far . Running with friends can aid with your training , both in helping you maintain the pace and in helping to break some of the monotony of what , admittedly , is a repetitive exercise . I usually enjoy Sunday-morning runs at Indiana Dunes State Park with fellow members of the Dunes Running Club . Usually I train alone , and this is one of the few days of the week when I have company . But friends can get you in trouble , particularly if they force you to run faster or slower than you want .

The majority of runners run in the morning , because that guarantees that nothing will interfere with their workout that day . Also , during warm-weather months , it is cooler during the early hours . Nevertheless , a fair number of runners run during their lunch hour . During the winter up north , I usually run midday because the sun is up , and it 's usually somewhat warmer . A certain percentage prefer running late afternoon , using running to relax after a stressful business day . And a few run in the late evening after dinner . In families where both the husband and wife run , they often need to run separately , rather than together , so one of them can mind the kids .

If you are unable to exercise due to broken bones , knee surgery , stress fracture , or tendonitis , you may wonder : What can I eat to heal quickly ? How can I avoid getting fat while I 'm unable to run ? Should I be taking supplements ? This article will address those concerns , plus more . <p> Do n't  treat good nutrition like a fire engine <p> To start , I offer this motherly reminder : Rather than shaping up your diet when you get injured , strive to maintain a high quality food intake every day . That way , you 'll have a hefty bank account of vitamins and minerals stored in your liver , ready and waiting to be put into action . For example , a well-nourished runner has enough vitamin C ( important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about six weeks . The junk food junkie who gets a serious sports injury ( think bike crash , ACL repair , or even car accident ) and ends up in the hospital has a big disadvantage . Eat smart every day ! <h> Do n't  diet <p> A big barrier to optimal fueling for injured runners is fear of getting fat . Please remember : even injured runners need to eat ! I 've had a marathoner hobble into my office on crutches saying , " I have n't eaten in three days because I ca n't run . " He seemed to think he only deserved to eat if he could burn off calories with purposeful exercise . Wrong ! Another athlete lost her appetite after having foot surgery . While part of her brain thought " what a great way to lose weight , " her healthier self realized that good nutrition would enhance recovery . <p> Despite popular belief , your organs ( brain , liver , lungs , kidneys , heart , etc. ) not exercising musclesburn the majority of the calories you eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About two-thirds of the calories consumed by the average ( lightly active ) person support the resting metabolic rate ( the energy needed to simply exist ) . On top of that , your body can require 10% to 20% more calories with trauma or minor surgery ; major surgery requires much more . Yes , you may need fewer total calories because you are not training hard , but you definitely need more than your sedentary baseline . Your body is your best calorie counter , so respond appropriately to your hunger cues . Eat when hungry and stop when your stomach feels content . <p> Here are two other weight myths , debunked : <p> Muscle turns into fat . Wrong . If you are unable to exercise , your muscles will shrink , but they will not turn into fat . Wayne , a skier who broke his leg , was shocked to see how scrawny his leg muscles looked when the doctor removed the cast six weeks later . Once he started exercising , he rebuilt the muscles to their original size . <p> Lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you overeat while you are injured ( as can easily happen if you are bored or depressed ) , you can indeed easily get fat . Joseph , a frustrated football player with a bad concussion , quickly gained 15 pounds post-injury because he continued to eat lumberjack portions . But if you eat mindfully , your body can regulate a proper intake . Before diving into meals and snacks , ask yourself , " How much of this fuel does my body actually need ? " <p> When injured , some underweight runners gain to their genetic weight . For example , Jessica , a 15-year-old high school runner , perceived her body was " getting fat " while she recuperated from a knee injury . She was simply catching up and attaining the physique appropriate for her age and genetics . <h> Do eat " clean " <p> To enhance healing , you want to choose a variety of quality foods that supply the plethora of nutrients your body needs to function and heal . Do n't eliminate food groups ; they all work together synergistically ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vegetables . By having carbs for fuel , the protein you eat can be used to heal and repair muscles . If you eat too few carbsand too few calories , your body will burn protein for fuel . That hinders healing . <p> Protein from lean meats , legumes , nuts and lowfat dairy . Protein digests into the amino acids needed to repair damaged muscles ; your body needs a steady stream of amino acids to promote healing ( especially after physical therapy ) . You need extra protein post-injury or surgery , so be sure to include 20 to 30 grams of protein at each meal and snack . A portion with 20 to 30 grams of protein equates to one of these : 3 eggs , 1 cup cottage cheese , 3 to 4 ounces of meat , poultry , or fish , two-thirds of a 14-ounce cake of firm tofu , or 1.25 cups of hummus . While you might see ads for amino acid supplements including arginine , ornithine , and glutamine , you can get those amino acids via food . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canola oils , peanut butter , nuts and other nut butters , ground flaxseeds , flax oil , and avocado have an anti-inflammatory effect . So do omega-3 fish oils . Eat at least two or three fish meals per week , preferably the oilier fish such as Pacific salmon , barramundi , and albacore tuna . Reduce your intake of the omega-6 fats in packaged foods with " partially hydrogenated oils " listed among the ingredients , and in processed foods containing corn , sunflower , safflower , cottonseed , and soy oils . Too much of these might contribute to inflammation . <p> Vitamins . By consuming a strong intake of colorful fruits and vegetables , you 'll get more nutrition than in a vitamin pill . Fruits and veggies have powerful anti-oxidants that knock down inflammation . Do n't  underestimate the healing powers of blueberries , strawberries , carrots , broccoli , and pineapple .

You 'd get off to a good start with the first movement , the Allegro , as majestic an opening to a concerto as can be found in the artistic repertoire . <p> But then you collide with the second movement , marked Andante , a word that tells the orchestra to play it slowly .

Mozart knew how to blend fast and slow movements just as Bowerman knew how to blend fast and slow workouts . <h> Learning from the classics <p> Thus , the opening movement of Mozart 's 21st piano concerto , the Allegro , might be compared to a tempo run in which the runner pushes to the edge of his ability the goal being to improve lactate threshold .

Maybe it is enough merely to enjoy a performance by a great orchestra led by a charismatic conductor . Then the next morning be inspired to do your long run in three-quarter time , a waltz .

But as we turned up the canal toward Skagway , the clouds parted and we found ourselves flying in clear sky above blue water rimmed with snow-tipped mountains . <p> I had come to Alaska to run the 17th annual Klondike Road Relay , a 110-mile running race that follows one of the routes taken by miners during the Gold Rush of 1898 . The event begins in downtown Skagway on a Friday evening in mid-September and continues through the night across the White Pass , finishing Saturday morning beside the Yukon River in Whitehorse , Canada . Each relay team has ten members , running miscellaneous distances from about 6 to 16 miles . I was scheduled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history intrigued me . In 1896 , gold was discovered in The Yukon , a Canadian province . Within the next several years , 100,000 prospective gold miners would rush through Alaska into Canada seeking their fortunes .

The Royal Canadian Mounties refused to let the Gold Rushers enter Canada unless they had a years worth of supplies . Only a few returned wealthy . Nevertheless , the Gold Rush Days offered an exciting era memorialized in novels by Jack London and in poetry by Robert W. Service . <h> Secret Tales <p> Ah , Robert W. Service . It was Service who symbolized Alaska for me . As a youth , I sometimes was required to memorize poetry . In our school , the girls , sweet things , usually chose : Yeats , Milton , Frost .

I had visited all 50 states except it and North Dakota . When an opportunity arose to join a team in the Klondike Road Relay , I quickly said yes . <p> Alaska can not be conquered--or even visited--by the faint-hearted . Several years ago , my son Kevin took ten days to drive to Alaska with his family in a rented Recreational Vehicle . Cruises up the West Coast from ports in Washington and British Columbia take a week . We did n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mouth of one of Alaskas many canals ( actually fjords ) .

Craig , sporting a grizzled beard , looked like he had just stepped out of a Robert W. Service poem . He would run the first 8.8-mile stage : flat at first , then tilting perilously upward as the road left Skagway and began its ascent through White Pass . Although the Relay allows for ten-person teams , we only had eight--meaning two of us would need to run double stages ! Fortunately , that was not I. Coming off a hamstring injury , I managed to swap my planned 16-mile stage for the 12.3-mile stage originally assigned to Scott Douglas of Bethesda , Maryland , former editor for Running Times . Scott would also run a second stage . The extra mileage seemed to appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at The White House , a pleasantly appointed ( Teddy bears in the room ) bed and breakfast , originally built in 1902 and restored recently after a fire . Friday morning offered several touring options . Several in the group chose to hike on the Chilkoot Trail , actually the preferred route of most Gold Rushers from 1898 . Though the Chilkoot climbed higher than White Pass , it was shorter . Protecting my hamstring , I decided to ride the scenic White Pass &amp; Yukon Railroad that parallels the relay route . The train chugs up the mountains to an elevation near 3,000 feet before returning tourists to their cruise ships . <p> Hanging off an outside platform , I beheld a scary sight . It was not merely that our narrow-gauge train threatened to tip off the side of the mountain , but that I could gaze across a valley and see how steep the road for the relay climbed . Tom Weede , a muscular editor from Mens Fitness , had been assigned the second stage . At 5.8 miles , it was shortest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom had been assigned double duty . He also would run our final stage . <h> Bears on the Road <p> At 6:00 PM , As Good As It Gets assembled in downtown Skagway for the start . Fifteen other teams would begin with us . The remaining relay teams would follow in half-hour intervals , culminating with the fastest group at midnight . We were in the first seed because of a slow predicted finish . ( Dawn estimated our finish time at 17 hours when she filed our entry , guaranteeing us an early start . ) I suspected that several in our group had been unduly pessimistic in estimating their abilities . This proved true , since Craig quickly moved to the front . He was in second place as he tagged Tom , who took the lead before yielding at the summit of White Pass ( the border between Alaska and British Columbia ) to Ginny Fay , a local runner from Juneau . Ginnys stage of 7.6 miles was the easiest : not only short , but also downhill . <p> Not that Ginny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange zone near a Canadian customs shack , one of the customs officers told us about a bear having been sighted further down the course . Ginny had told us to drive ahead , but now reconsidered : " Uhhh , maybe you better stay close . " <p> No bears appeared and Ginny passed to Rick Ladzinski , a guide from Bozeman , Montana . Rick had flown into Skagway packing a fishing pole along with his running shoes . I liked his attitude . More hiker and skier than runner , he was n't going to be intimidated by running 13.3 miles . By now the sun had set . To illuminate his way , Rick wore a battery-powered light . Rick did n't  seem to be concerned when the team that had been dogging us , " Vroom Vroom , " pushed us back again to second . Nor did it concern any of us in the RV either . We knew that faster teams would start still later and drop us deeper into the standings . We were still in second at Tutshi Lake as Rick passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New York City . <p> Organizers had chosen the second weekend in September for their race date , despite the fact that had they waited two weekends , runners could utilize a full moon . In some previous years , the Aurora Borealis had lit the sky . But with that light spectacular a no-show , we ran in almost total darkness . Returning to Skagway in daylight two days later , I realized that this was the most scenic stretch of the road . Stefani , unfortunately , would miss the scenery . She pranced along the side of the road , the headlights of our RV barely piercing the darkness . Craig pulled the RV up beside her so Justin Bonneau , a photographer hired by Dawn to record our journey , could take pictures . With Justins flash popping continuously in her eyes , I wondered how soon Stefani would tell him to stop , but she seemed to revel in the attention . She would prove the best of our team , actually winning an award for being fastest among the female runners who ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite Stefanis heroic efforts , we remained second to Vroom Vroom as she tagged off to Scott at the border between British Columbia and The Yukon . Off in the distance , we spotted the van lighting the way for the Vroom Vroom runner . Running like a deer through the forest , Scott nibbled away at the lead , catching the other runner midway through the stage . The pair ran together for several miles , chatting , until Scott decided to move . The Vroom Vroom runner briefly tried to stay close , then drifted off to the rear . By the time Scott reached the town of Carcross and tagged Amy Coseo , Vroom Vroom was Doomed Doomed . <p> Alas , that 's when we discovered someone had left Scotts warm-up gear lying on the road in the exchange zone . Amy , who works for Blue magazine in New York , was more skydiver , in-line skater and soccer player than runner--and in fact had never run a road race before . Given that she had predicted it would take 90 minutes to run her 8.8-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retrieve Scotts gear and connect later with Amy . Since I was the next runner , I was less confident , but it was 3:00 in the morning and nobody was thinking too clearly . We turned around leaving a secondary van to light her way . Hindsight suggests I should have shifted to that van . <p> Until then , we had no contact with other teams in the Klondike Road Relay , but as we traced Scotts 16-mile stage backwards , we finally saw our competition . Runners crowded the road , as did their accompanying vehicles . After retrieving Scotts gear , we encountered a traffic jam that lasted until we reached Carcross again . Then traffic , both runner an vans , thinned . Only a handful of teams seemed to have a chance of beating us to Whitehorse . <p> Unfortunately , Amy proved most pessimistic in her prediction , finishing 20 minutes faster than expected . She was standing anxiously beside a group of officials when we appeared . I jumped out of the RV , but we were so far ahead that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't get an official time , " an official warned . I shrugged and set off into the night . <h> A Surreal Experience <p> Our team RV lit the road before me , an almost surreal experience . The asphalt road , besieged by wind and snow each winter , was rough , undulating , often canted to one side . The headlights cast dark mini-shadows , ugly gashes on the grayish asphalt . Even the slightest dip looked like a Moon crater into which I might disappear . The Jack Nicholson of As Good As It Gets , I knew , would not fare well on this highway . <p> Still , I liked it . On occasions when the road turned--meaning that for at least several seconds the headlights of the RV continued straight while I veered into semi-darkness--I felt abandoned . I had asked Rose to hand me fluids every two miles , and as we passed that distance , she leaned out the window and did so . She provided the comfort blanket linking me to reality . And also a vital check as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky lightened . A motorcycle policeman appeared and asked me to move from the right to left side of the road . With darkness turning to dawn , I could see now , but I missed the contact with our RV . One advantage of running in the dark , I now discovered , was that you could n't see the hills . Now in the cold light of dawn and with about two miles to go in my stage , I looked forward and discovered a hill that seemed near vertical . <p> As my pace lagged , I feared being caught by Vroom Vroom . Glancing backwards , I saw no one in sight . This was a bad tactical error , since I suddenly lost all desire to run . I did more walking than running in the final two miles , yet ( I learned later ) still stretched our lead over our pursuers . <p> Scott and Tom completed our journey with stages of 11.1 and 11.9 miles . We stopped beside the Yukon River in Whitehorse with race officials still organizing the finishing area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several hours . Though first to Whitehorse , As Good As It Gets lost to later starters , actually finishing 26th overall , sixth in our class . Vroom Vrooms overall finish was 82nd , nearly two hours behind us . The time for the winning Pacific Roadrunners Wolfpack team was 10:18:58 . <p> We paused for breakfast at the Loose Moose Cafe , then drove 35 miles to The Inn On The Lake , where we would stay overnight . Grabbing a beer , I headed for the outdoor hot tub and sat soaking and staring across Marsh Lake at mountains crossed by Gold Rushers a century before . I was exhausted not merely from my run , but from a night without sleep . Semi-conscious , lines from Robert W. Services famous poem buzzed in my ears : <p> The Northern Lights have seen queer sights , <p> But the queerest they ever did see <p> Queerer sights have been seen and stranger things done in the Midnight Sun than running the Klondike Road Relay .

En route , my wife and I stopped in New York City for a couple of days sightseeing before the long trip across the Atlantic . On a lark I entered a race in Central Park , little more than a fun run , 5 miles on a double-loop course . <p> I remember hitting my stride on the flat portions of the course , flying on the downhill stretches . I do n't  recall any uphills , but that could not be true . It was a loop course starting and finishing on the same line . <p> When you are in truly good shape , you do n't  notice minor inconveniences like hills . They do n't  compute . They do n't  exist . Climbing on the plane for Sweden the next day , I knew I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I proved it a week later by winning the M45 3000 meter steeplechase at the Worlds , beating Spanish Olympian Manuel Alonso with a last-lap kick , setting what then was a masters world record of 9:39.0 , what remained an American record for 36 years until broken recently by Brad Barton , running in an open meet in Salem , Oregon . Barton ran 9:22.0 , and I 'm going to suggest that his record should not last 36 years . He may be only getting started on his record-breaking , particularly if he runs the Worlds in Porto Allegre , Brazil this October . <p> My main advice to Barton does not involve improving his aerobic and anaerobic fitness or learning to clear the barriers and water jumps cleaner . It is this : Write everything down , so you can remember your achievement 36 years from now . <p> Because the truth of the matter is that at age 81 , I recall little of what should have been a memorable victory . Perhaps it was because two years earlier I also had won the chase at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of dTja vu : " Okay , Ive done this before . " <p> My memory from 1977 is not totally a wash . I have near instant replay for what happened on the backstretch of the final lap . Certainly , Alonso and I must have dueled during the seven laps leading up to that point . In steeplechases , I liked to either hang far back and kick at the end , or lead from the start , the advantage being that if you 're out front you get a clear look at barriers as you approach them , rather than seeing them over an opponents shoulder and risking a misstep . <p> As Alonso and I came off the turn into the backstretch , I began moving wide so I could pass him before we reached the final water jump on the last turn . I had a fairly good kick , but I worried Alonso might have had a better one . <p> Gradually , I pulled near even , but I must have been paying my rival too much attention , because suddenly I realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water jump , and I was out of step . I hurdle well with either feet , but I was somewhere in the middle . My choices were to stutter-step and take the barrier with one foot , or stretch my stride and take it with the other . In either case , I would lose ground to my rival . <p> Instantly , without conscious thought , I decided to step the hurdle , just like I might the water jump barrier coming up next . I went up over the barrier just behind Alonso and came off the barrier just ahead of him . I still do n't  know why . Perhaps the Spaniard was conscious of me passing as we approached the barrier and lost his concentration . <p> Stop frame ! <p> Because that 's all of this record-setting race I remember ! I know I cleared the final water barrier cleanly , because someone took a photo of me doing so , Alonso just behind . I know I cleared the final barrier on the main straightaway , because they handed me a gold medal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book for Brad Barton to beat . <p> My advice to Brad Barton , the lesson I learned in Goteborg , was not to improve your barrier-clearing abilities , but to write down what you did , so you can remember your next victory or record set when you reach the age of 81 . <p> Meanwhile , my American record in the M40 3000 meter steeplechase ( 9:18.6 ) remains on the books , 38 years now . I believe it to be the oldest existing masters record in the books . There are too many talented steeplechasers in their 30s , who ran much faster times than I did while younger . <p> One of them needs to erase my name from the record books . <p> Hal Higdon is a contributing writer for Runners World magazine .

If you followed that advice , you may feel fatigued from what might have seemed like a low-mileage run a month ago . But you 're now in post-marathon mode . Make today an easy day , a very easy day . Monday was always a day of cross-training during your marathon buildup , so it is the same during the post-marathon period . Spend a half hour biking , swimming , walking or doing whatever non-running activity you did before . During the following four weeks , I 'm going to tell you how to build back to a steady state of training . <p> Tuesday : As was the case during the 18-week marathon training program , Tuesday is a day when we do an easy workout .

@@102096292 @6296292/ <h> Training <h> Equipment <p> To participate in the sport of cross-country skiing , you need to either purchase or rent equipment . Nordic equipment is not cheap , but it is a lot less expensive than that used for downhill skiing . You can outfit yourself for skiing for less than $200 , the price of some " starter " packages offered in sporting good stores . " If you expect to stay with the sport , however , you should spend more and obtain better gear , " says J. V. Peacock , owner of The Outpost in Mishawaka , Indiana . Getting top-of-the-line equipment could double your cost , admits Peacock . Here 's what you need : <p> Skis : Cross-country skis are skinnier than their downhill counterparts and considerably lighter . And also less expensive ; a downhill skier would spend $500 for the starter package mentioned above . They also come in a variety of designs depending on the type of skiing you plan to do : in-track ( classic ) skiing or skating . ( See : The Two Techniques . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their sideways strides . Classic skiers use cambered skis , bowed in the middle , so that when you weight one ski it grabs the snow , allowing you to push off into the next stride . Veteran skiers wax their skis to get more grip and push , but as a beginning skier , you 're probably better off choosing " waxless " skis , grooved on the bottoms in various patterns to achieve the same effect as wax . <p> Boots : Cross-country boots serve two important functions . One , they keep your feet dry and warm . Two , they provide a system that connects the boot to the ski . Ski boot designers have made tremendous improvements in their models in recent years . Most better boots have inner linings that will keep your feet snug on even the coldest days . And the best ones fit as comfortably as running shoes . Cross-country ski boots connect to the skis only at the toes , which allows the heel to rise off the ski so you can extend your glide . Grooves on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit better control in curves . To insure that you will enjoy this sport , be willing to spend a bit more money on a good pair of boots . <p> Poles : Downhill skiers use poles for balance , but cross-country skiers also use poles to propel themselves down the trails . If you want to become a complete skier , you need to use your upper body muscles as well as your legs . Aluminum poles are cheapest , but various fiberglass poles are lighter , although they 're also more expensive . If you 're skiing in a 55-K race like the Birkebeiner , you 'll need light poles to avoid end-of-the-race fatigue . For the average beginner , a few extra ounces of weight probably makes little difference . <p> Do n't rush to the sporting good store and outfit yourself in equipment before taking your first glide on snow . You will be able to make more intelligent equipment choices after skiing a few times in rental equipment and seeing what other skiers use . Most Nordic Centers provide rental equipment . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cross-country skiers from an earlier generation wore knickers and long socks plus wool sweaters . You 're more liable to see skiers today clad in various synthetic materials that wick moisture away from their bodies . Skiers layer their clothing , adding or shedding layers as temperatures drop or rise . In this respect , they function like runners in winter , except runners copied the skier 's attire . Most important on cold days are a knit cap to prevent heat from escaping the body and mittens , rather than fingered gloves , to keep your hands warm .

In the meantime , enjoy this excerpt from 4:09:43 : Boston 2013 Through the Eyes of the Runners . --Hal Higdon <p> NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED Kara Thelen for the crowd support she encountered in Newton , particularly after rounding the corner at the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton hills . She could almost sense the increase in the crescendo of their cheers . <p> Rows of spectators five-deep cheered so loudly that it took Karas breath away . How long have they been cheering like this ? she wondered . How long could they keep this up ? " Go , Michigan ! " they shouted at a runner just ahead of her wearing a University of Michigan hat . Since she also lived in Michigan , Thelen gratefully embraced the cheers as belonging to her , too . " Go girl with the green shirt and brown ponytail ! " That was her . Then after she passed , " Go Kara ! " She had written her name with a black Sharpie on the back of a bright yellow pair of Mizuno racing flats , along with the names of her husband , Jim , and children . Also on the shoes was her mantra prayer : Fast ! Strong ! Grateful ! Blessed ! <p> " What an emotional wallop , " Thelen would blog later . " The cheers were so enthusiastic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears soon followed . I prayed for all the people standing there along the course . And I offered thanks . I was overcome with gratitude for them and their jubilant support . This positive-energy exchange we had struck up was so intimate . For the few moments of my passing , we no longer were total strangers . " <p> Long after her participation in the 117th running of the Boston Athletic Association Marathon , Kara Thelen would still be able to picture many of their faces . " Spectators are a special breed , " she remembers . " These spectators were even more special that day . " <p> Shalane Flanagan had experienced the same level of crowd support when she had passed through Newton earlier . Having competed in the World Championships and Olympic Games , Flanagan was used to running on tracks in 80,000-capacity stadiums , but nothing , simply nothing , had prepared her for the sensual experience of running the Boston Marathon , where the crowds , despite the best efforts of the police to control them , formed a narrowing corridor threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced to slow their running , even stop . Or so it seemed sometimes . <p> Yet the experiences of Flanagan and the other elites was far from being unique among those running Boston this day . In so many ways , Shalane was " just one of the girls , " one of the many noise-pampered female runnersand males , toostrung out for miles and miles behind her . The crowds would not discriminate between a 2:26 marathon runner and one on the other side of three hours or four hours or more . <p> Flanagan discussed crowd noise with David Willey of Runners World . " My ears were ringing , " said Flanagan . " I almost wanted to say , Okay , this is a bit much . We can tone it down. The hairs on my arms were standing up . It was almost too loud for me to concentrate , particularly through the Newton hills leading to BostonCollege . The crowds were on top of you on both sides . " <p> Here was the section of the Boston Marathon course that builds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ! A few miles past WellesleyCollege , the course of the Boston Marathon descends from 164 feet above sea level at Mile 15 to 53 feet above sea level at Mile 16 : a 111-foot drop , a muscle-pounding descent . One big ouch for those who failed to prepare for Boston by adding a few downhill repeats to their training . NewtonLowerFalls serves as the lowest part of the course thus far run . After that , the climb back to higher numbers begins . All Boston marathoners know about the four Newton hills . They eye the profile maps handed them at the Expo with fear and loathing . They understand that once they turn at the Newton Fire Station after 17.5 miles of relatively comfort-free running , the climb begins , their agonies not ceasing until they crest iconic Heartbreak Hill , it of legends . But before that with runners still within the municipal borders of Wellesley , there is what the late Boston coach Bob Campbell called a " secret hill , " a tricky hill , a fifth hill , one that seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between Mile 16 and Mile 17 , the course does climb 49 feet , not a major bump , but enough of one so that runners encountering it for the first time wonder : What is this hill doing here ? Why did n't  they warn me ? <p> Bob Campbells hill serves the function of weakening marathoners before their true test . One might compare it to the horsemen sent into the ring to stick banderillas into the neck of the bull to both weaken the animal and make him angry before the arrival of the matador who , red cloak swirling , will claim all the glory : two ears and a tail for behavior most bravado . <p> After passing Wellesleys town center , Mark Findaro noticed that his father , Joe , subtly but noticeably , had begun to pick up the pace , forcing him and his girlfriend , Ana , out of their comfort zone . Mark politely suggested , " Ummm , Dad , why do n't  you go ahead ? " Joe Findaro nodded in agreement , wished the pair good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not theirs . Over the next several miles as they crossed over the border between Wellesley and Newton , the gap between Joe and the two others gradually grew . " I felt confident , " Joe Findaro says , " that without my socializing , I could run the second half faster than the first . " <p> Ah , Joe , such arrogance ! Achieving what runners call " negative splits " is no easy task , because Bostons first half is downhill ; the second half , more uphill than downhill . After the turn at the fire station , runners climb , climb , climb , climb to 228 feet above sea level by the 21-mile mark . True : Kenyas Cosmas Ndeti ran negative splits in 1993 , the first of his three consecutive victories . That year , the Kenyan strolled the first half of the course in 1:05:23 , his boyhood friend and training partner , Benson Masya , by his side holding him back . Tom Derderian in his book Boston Marathon describes Ndeti wanting to run with the leaders . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stay back . Stay back . " <p> Ndeti obeyed , but eventually left Masya and covered the second half in 1:04:10 ( the final 10-K in 29 minutes ) , closing faster than anyone before at Boston . With a mile to go , he caught the leader , Lucketz Swartbooi of Namibia and passed almost effortlessly . " He coasted the last half-mile in case anyone wanted to sprint , " writes Derderian . Nobody did . Cosmas Ndeti finished in 2:09:33 . <p> But Joe Findaro had not been born at mile-high altitude in Kenyas Great Rift Valley . He had not , as a boy , run barefoot on dirt roads five miles to school in the morning and five miles back home in the afternoon . With the Newton hills ahead , the challenge for matching Ndetis negative-splits achievement seemed formidable indeed . <p> When Heather Lee-Callaghan passed the Newton Fire Station , she spotted her husband , Matt , standing beside the road . " I managed to barrel through several runners to hop up and kiss him , say love you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Matt started cheering . One shouted : " Kiss and run ! " <p> In retrospect , Lee-Callaghan would decide that the first Newton hill was the hardest of the four . It was partly mental . She feared the hills and worried that she might not get through them without being forced to walk . Many runners using Jeff Galloway as their coach train to walk in set increments : Run 10 , Walk 1 . Planned walking breaks makes running a marathon easyso Galloway claims . Unplanned walks , those caused by fatigue , are more a problem . If forced to walk , it may be difficult to resume running . To do so takes discipline , something in short supply in the closing miles of marathons . Nevertheless , Lee-Callaghan resisted the urge to walk , not even a step or two . " I kept chipping away at the hills , relaxing at the top of each hill as the grade started to plateau . " One hill , two hills , three hills , four hills until finally she saw the arch stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee-Callaghan remembered wiping tears off her cheeks when she saw that sign : " The course had chewed up my quads during the first half of the race , then destroyed my hamstrings during the climbs , and I still had that bloody toe . " <p> On the other hand , Jen Marr actually found running uphill easier than running downhill , or on the flat stretches . Reason : Less pressure on her IT band . Once over Heartbreak Hill , the course passes BostonCollege . Both sides of the road were jammed with BostonCollege students cheering runners , high-fiving runners , offering beer to runners . " Fun at 21 , " Marr would remember . <p> Lee-Callaghan would claim later that she probably hit 50 hands on the downside of Heartbreak Hill . She heard someone shout , " Youre beautiful ! " but was not sure if the compliment was directed at her . She heard someone else shout , " Nice tits ! " She knew that was not directed at her . <p> On the hills leading up to Heartbreak , Amy Zebala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire her to achieving athletic immortality . " The crowds were amazing , " she recalls . " They were at their most supportive when the course was most challenging . " Unfortunately , her stomach still churning , Zebala had been forced to take a second bathroom break .

He did not see her , so she passed him , then came back and tapped him on the shoulder so she could " give him some sass for not paying attention more closely . " <p> Kate Johnson took Boston one timing mat at a time , knowing that friends and family were tracking her progress . The first Newton hill , being a half-mile long , she found the hardest . A sign at the top saying " 9.2 Miles To Beer " cheered her up . She remembered her mantra : The faster you run , the sooner you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mats , feeling the cheering continuing at home among those tracking her by computer . <p> Carissa von Koch also played mind games that involved " miles-to-go .

He had been traveling for a week with her mother-in-law , thus von Koch definitely was feeling Lukas-deprived . Seven more miles until I see my boy .

Blanda waited for the muscles around the hernia to relax , then pushed it back in . " I felt a blister on my left foot . My right big toenail was coming off . Every step at that point felt like a hammer pounding my upper hamstrings . " <p> Still , she thought , " all things considered , it could be worse . " <p> She pushed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Younger and faster runners had finished several hours earlier , but the local media wanted only me . My time ? Five hours plus ; hardly an impressive performance even among Old Slow Folk Down Under . <p> Thus the conundrum of international athletics : The media at all levels of competition is less interested in performance than it is in " stories . " Up close and personal . Marion Jones ' time in hundredths of a second for the 100 meters ranks lower on their interest charts than the fact that she just divorced her husband . <p> My story ? In Brisbane , I was running the second of my 7 marathons in 7 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 separate charities . That story proved infinitely more interesting to Brisbane 's local media than the fact that some Australian bloke had run 2:30 to finish first overall . The TV crew stumbled onto the story by accident . They were nosing around the finish line looking for up-close-and-personals and spotted the Mail photographer waiting with my wife Rose and friend Walt McConnell for me to finish . <p> The Mail photographer was only there because Rebecca Hill , who handles publicity for The Alzheimer 's Association , had pitched 7-7-70 to his newspaper . ( Alzheimer 's is the charity I ran for in Brisbane . ) Alzheimer 's Disease is a problem that affects older people . It is a progressive , degenerative disease of the brain , and the most common form of dementia . Approximately 4 million Americans have Alzheimer 's Disease . In a national survey , 19 million Americans said they had a family member with Alzheimer 's Disease , and 37 million said they knew someone with that disease . ( If you want more information , or would like to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . ) <p> Rose and Walt looked concerned , because on a warm day on a hilly course I was taking longer than predicted . " Here he comes ! " announced Walt , but it was someone else instead . The TV crew ably documented the disappointment on their faces . Then I appeared in my U.S.A. uniform smiling and shamelessly waving my cap as I crossed the line . TV audiences love disaster turned into triumph . My 7-7-70 bite made the 6:00 news . The TV crew also stayed long enough to capture the final finisher : a 70-year-old woman from India , who took more than 8 hours to finish . Sorry fans of fast runners ; up-close-and-personal wins again . <h> Championships in Brisbane <p> This was my thirteenth trip to the World Veterans Championships . One focus of my life during the last quarter century has been this athletics meeting for older runners , held every other year in different parts of the world . Organized by the World Veterans Athletics Association ( WAVA ) , the " World Vets " attracts approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . Male competitors must be over the age of 40 ; female competitors , over 35 . <p> That there exists a world track &amp; field championships for older runners is due to the vision of David H. R. Pain , who was an attorney in San Diego when he started jogging in his mid-40s . Missing the competition he once found in handball , Pain convinced a local promoter to add a " master 's mile " for runners his age in an open track meet . Eventually he founded a unique track meet for older runners . In 1972 , Pain took a group of masters runners to a series of meets in Europe , which laid the groundwork for the first World Veterans Athletics Championships in Toronto , Canada in 1975 . ( I described Pain 's efforts in an article for The Kiwanis Magazine titled " They 're not runners ; they 're too old , " which eventually was reprinted in my book , Fitness After Forty , now out of print . ) <p> I ran in that first World Vets in Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the American masters record . But fast times such as that do n't always interest reporters . Other than my 7-7-70 Quest , the story that grabbed the media 's attention most in Brisbane was that of Australian Leslie Amey , age 101 , who ran the 1,500 meters in 19:59.54 . No surprise that he won his age group . Amey is the first documented centurion to compete at the World Vets . Photographers also loved Mexican Rosari Iglesias Rocha , age 90 , who donned a sombrero after running the 800 meters in 6:59.18 . <p> How do those performances compare with high-schooler Allan Webb 's 3:53 time for the mile this spring ? Age-group charts do permit comparisons , but the media does n't want to hear about it . <h> Fast Performances <p> For those of you who do care , one of the best achievements at Brisbane was Chantal Dallenbach of France , age 38 , who won the 5000 in 16:25.55 , 10,000 in 34:39.50 , 2000 steeplechase in 6:51.97 and the 8K cross-country . Dallenbach won gold medals not gold as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest Old Folk traveled Down Under . Dallenbach might not have won that many gold medals had same-age American Regina Jacobs decided to show in Brisbane .

Play-for-pay runners like Jacobs and Gray are rarely attracted to pay-their-way competition . Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus do n't compete in Senior golf events without compensation either . <p> The media might be pardoned its lack of interest in pure performance by Old Slow Folks , but sadly it often extends to all levels of the track &amp; field sport . At a meeting of the World Association of Veteran Athletes held midway through the championships , WAVA sought to improve its marketability by voting a name change to World Masters Athletics ( WMA ) .

It was part of the furniture , like my mother 's rocking chair , or the table my father used for his cigarettes and ale . <p> The painting was " The East Bound Freight " by Dale Nichols . ( See above . ) It showed a farmer , pitchfork in hand , standing beside his barn on a wintry day watching a train passing in the distance . As you gazed at the painting and fields covered with snow , you could almost feel the cold penetrate your bones . <p> I still own that painting ( shown above and in detail below ) , although it is badly damaged . Presently , I am having it restored so I can donate it to Carleton College in Northfield , Minnesota , the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructing a new art museum . Curator Laurel Bradley has agreed to welcome " The East Bound Freight " into the Carleton collection . Bradley also offered the names of several restorers in the Chicago area . I eventually selected Faye Wrubel , Paintings Conservator at the Art Institute of Chicago , who has a studio west of the Loop . Wrubel has agreed to restore " The East Bound Freight " to near how it looked when my father first acquired the painting from his friend Dale Nichols around 1938 . " Ninety-five percent , " she promises . <h> An American Regionalist <p> Dale Nichols was born 1904 in David City , Nebraska . He moved to Chicago in the 1920s , working as an illustrator , but also practicing what might be described as Fine Art . As an artist , Nichols fits into the school of Regional American Landscape artists , whose more famous practitioners included Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton . " These artists , " according to a biography of Wood on Artcult.com , " represented rural life in the U.S. in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings reproduced on greeting cards , and even playing cards , featured red barns . <p> An article in the September 18 , 1939 issue of Time included this reference to Nichols : " Subjects he prefers are the prairie landscapes of his youth , usually snowed under . These famed smooth snow effects Artist Nichols gets by laying on his oils in a thin film with watercolor brushes . " <p> One painting by Nichols titled " John Comes Home for Christmas " was used on a post card by the U.S. Postal Service as recently as 1995 . A Web site describing the card says ( somewhat ungrammatically ) : " A leader in the American Regionalist movement of the 1930s , Nichols ' paintings depict rural scenes in a realistic fashion , defining objects with clean-edged precision . " Three paintings by Nichols are listed in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum . The Museum of Nebraska Art in Kearney has four of his large oil paintings , along with four lithographs and four sketches . Wrubel said she thought the Union League Club in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richter denied that was true , but said the Dayton Art Institute , where she previously worked , had one Nichols in its collection . One recent listing of five paintings by Dale Nichols sold on auction on Artfact.com shows prices between $6,725 and $33,460 . <p> In addition to " The East Bound Freight , " my own collection of Dale Nichols art includes another large painting ( see below ) , a snowy landscape titled " The Trail to the Valley , " minus any red barn . I also own several prints and watercolors . One gouache painting shows a horseman wearing a red cape , given to my wife Rose and I as a wedding present in 1958 . Alas , by that date , Regionalist painting had become unfashionable , causing even Grant Wood to change his style and use a different name for some of his late art . Abstract Expressionism was the style favored by instructors Alfred Hyslop and Dean Warnholtz when I attended Carleton . Dale Nichols also abandoned the Regionalist style , moving to the Southwest and Central America , becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the collection of the Museum of Nebraska Art is a metagraph ( a rubbing of Mayan ruins on fabric ) done while he was living in Guatamala .

In the letter , now in the collection of the Chicago Historical Society , Nichols comments , " I am , at long last , making a living in fine art . This , from an artist whose paintings a decade after his death in 1995 now sells in the tens of thousands . Most valuable are the wintry landscape paintings he produced during the Depression . What fame Dale Nichols still possesses is because of red barns . <h> Hig 's Artist <p> My father knew Dale Nichols--and Elmer Jacobs .

Any artist who had a regular paying job as an illustrator during the Depression certainly would have been grateful to his benefactor . Nichols continued drawing covers and inside illustrations for the Flame into the 1940s until , possibly , his fame became too great for my father 's little magazine . My father then employed Jacobs as an illustrator , although Nichols would resume working for my father in the late 1950s .

In 1964 , my wife and I moved from Chicago to Long Beach , Indiana , an hour 's drive around the bottom of Lake Michigan . We proudly hung " The East-Bound Freight " in our living room with its view of the lake . Alas , for that decision . Some years later , a storm swept across the lake , pummeling our house with sheets of rain . A massive leak developed in the roof over the living room , drenching the painting . <p> As curator Bradley or restorer Wrubel could tell you , moisture can be the death of an oil painting , shrinking the canvas , forming blisters in the paint , eventually causing the paint to peel . Helpless to stem the deterioration , I stored the painting in the attic , where it remained forgotten for too many years . At one point , I contacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some guidance to having the painting restored . I hoped maybe the Art Institute might acquire " The East Bound Freight " for its collection . The Institute never bothered to reply . ( To the best of my knowledge , the Art Institute possesses no art by Dale Nichols . ) A few years ago when squirrels invaded our attic , I discovered acorns crammed in the space between the back of the canvas and the frame ! I felt guilty about allowing the painting to remain unrestored , unseen . <p> The day when " The East Bound Freight " can receive what actually may be its first public showing since 1938 is near at hand . My wife and I became friends with Laurel Bradley while attending an Alumni Adventure featuring Art &amp; Jazz in Chicago sponsored by Carleton College in the spring of 2004 .

" Although Dale Nichols painted his Midwest landscapes from his memories growing up in rural Nebraska , that freight train he painted certainly was headed toward Minnesota . It soon may get there .

It gets its name because of the two counties it straddles . Passing the park I 've often thought , there must be some trails within worth running , but otherwise my car has stayed on cruise control . <p> Then a Chicago friend mentioned visiting Northwestern Indiana to view migrating sandhill cranes . " Where ? " I asked . Jasper/Pulaski Fish and Wildlife Area , I was told . I decided that my next trip to Indianapolis would not be non-stop . <p> That opportunity came last weekend . Presently I am occupied running 7 marathons in 7 months to celebrate my 70th birthday . The fifth marathon on that list was Indianapolis . En route I could stop to see the sandhill cranes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Michigan City at noon on a Friday , arriving at Jasper-Pulaski an hour later . The observation platform overlooking the wetlands where migrating cranes pause in their flights south is off the main road . Heading south on 421 , you ignore signs for a tree nursery , then turn right on country road 143 , bypassing the first entry to the wildlife area used by hunters and fishermen . The crane-viewing area is about a quarter mile further west . <p> From the parking lot , we walked along a tree-lined path sprinkled with signs every few feet posing different questions about the eastern population of the greater sandhill cranes : How tall are they ? In mating , how many offspring do they produce ? Are they an endangered species ? <p> The answers appear on an information board next to the observation platform : Three-and-a-half feet . Two , but only one usually survives . Cranes no longer are endangered , having increased in numbers from less than 1,000 several decades ago to 20,000 today .

Blue-gray birds , they can be identified by red patches on their foreheads--if you get close enough . Cranes try to stay distant from humans . <p> It being mid-day , most of the cranes were off in nearby fields feeding so they would have the energy to fly south . A dozen or so cranes more than a hundred yards away were visible from the observation platform . Only a few other people were present . Prime viewing time is sunrise or sunset .

After picking up my race number ( 70 ) , we checked into the nearby Sheraton Four Points Hotel and awaited a call from Scott Hala , a computer programmer who works at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton , Ohio .

When he and Lori bought their house , they sold part of his comic book collection for the down payment . Rather than comic books , I collect the original art and own several pages by John Romita , Jr. , an artist whose wife has friends in Michigan City . A double-page spread from The Uncanny X-Men by Romita , Jr . graces the wall of my office . Scott and I agreed that we liked the recent movie rendition of that comic .

Worst offenders were walkers wearing lime-green T-shirts bearing the name " Pavement Pounders . " <p> Once past the walkers , I focused on my goal of finishing faster than my time in Chicago ( 5:29:13 ) two weeks earlier . I fell into a steady rhythm , comparing mile splits with a woman running nearby at the same pace . We would run together only to part going up a hill , or while taking water , then found ourselves running nearby again . She helped anchor my pace , and I hers .

Unfortunately , the sun had risen high in a cloudless sky . The temperature was climbing toward an ultimate 70 . Two weeks between marathons obviously was too little time for recovery . My pace slowed and I began alternating walking and running miles as a survival tactic , hoping no Pavement Pounders would catch me .

She had begun to worry when I did not finish in my planned time . In several previous marathons , I had carried a cellular phone , but not this time . We remained long enough for a few pictures . Scott Hala , slowed by blisters , finished his third marathon an hour later . <p> By then , we were en route home , stopping again at Klein Brot Haus and Jasper/Pulaski .

Do n't  be the fool who comments , " My training program is good , but my eating is bad . " Performance starts with fueling , not training ! This article provides nutrition tips for ultra-endurance runnersas well as ordinary runners who want ultra-energy . <p> Tip #1 . Acknowledge the power of being well fueled . I counsel many already-lean runners who are convinced they will perform better if they lose just a few more pounds . They fail to realize they will perform better by eating , not dieting , and by being properly fueled . Despite popular belief , the lightest runner may not be the best runner . The best runner tends to be well fueled , well trained , and genetically gifted . <p> If your hours of exercise have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to what your training buddies and loved ones are saying about your body . If they agree you have fat to lose , perhaps you do . But if your mother or spouse complains you are too thin , listen up ! Its time to stop dieting and focus more on fueling better to perform better . <p> Tip #2 . Optimize your daily training diet . Your goals are to constantly be fueling-up before workouts and then re-fueling afterwards by eating on a regular schedule carbohydrate-based meals and snacks ( that also include some protein ) . By feeding your body evenly throughout the day ( as opposed to skimping on wholesome breakfasts and lunches , then overindulging in " junk " at night ) , you 'll have steady energy all day with no lags . The trick is to make your breakfast and morning snacks bigger and your evening food intake smaller . <p> When I counsel athletes , I sketch out sample meals that fulfill their energy needs . One ultrarunner needed at least 4,000 calories a day to fuel his 15-mile daily runs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first bucket ( 6:00-10:00 a.m. ) was to fuel-up and refuel from his morning run ; the second bucket ( 10:00-2:00 pm ) was for an early hearty lunch ; the third bucket ( 2:00-6:00 pm ) was for a second smaller lunch plus an energy bar and sports drinks to energize his 5:00 pm workout ; and the fourth bucket ( 6:00-10:00 pm ) refueled his muscles after the second workout of the day . Knowing his calorie goals for each 4-hour block of time helped him maintain high energy so he could train hard yet still enjoy the training sessions . <p> As a hungry endurance athlete , you need to develop a similar eating strategy to fit your training schedule . One triathlete devised this routine : he drank 16 ounces of juice ( i.e. , carbs ) before his morning swim , refueled afterwards while driving to work with breakfast ( big bagel with peanut butter , a banana , milk in a travel mug ) . He ate a hot dinner-type meal at lunchtime ( from the worksite cafeteria ) . He also bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( granola and raisins , stocked in his desk drawer ) and his evening meal ( turkey sub , chocolate milk ) . He kept those items in the office refrigerator . This program ensured healthful food would be conveniently waiting for him and prevented him from overeating fatty take-out food at night . <p> Tip #3 . Create a feeding plan for during long runs . Knowing your hourly calorie targets can help you maintain high energy during exercise . A sports nutritionist can help you estimate your energy needs per hour . You should try to replace at least one-third or more of the calories burned during the ultra-distance event . A good target is about 240 to 360 calories of carbohydrate per hour ( 60-90 g carb/h ) . For example , during an extended 4-hour run , you could stay well fueled by consuming 1 quart sports drink ( 200 cals/50 g carb ) + 3 fig newtons ( 165 cals/33 g carb ) per hour , or a Clif Bar ( 240 cals ; 45 g carb ) + a gel ( 100 cals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain a normal blood glucose ; if you feel dizzy or lightheaded , you are failing to consume enough calories ! <p> Tip #4 . Practice your event-day fueling . An essential part of your training is to train your intestinal tract so you can minimize undesired pit stops . During long training sessions , you want to determine which food and fluids you prefer for fuel during exercise . That is , you need to know which settles better : Gatorade or PowerAde ? energy bars or gels ? liquids or solids ? By developing a list of several tried-and-true foods , you need not worry about making the wrong food choice on race day . <p> Also think about " taste-bud burn-out . " That is , how many gels per hour can you endure in a triathlon ? When training , how many days in a row will you enjoy oatmeal for breakfast ? Will you get " sugared-out " on sports drink during the marathon ? Plan to have a variety of options available . <p> Tip #5 . Good nutrition starts in the grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juggling work , family , friends , sleep plus training , endurance runners have little time left to plan , shop for , and prepare balanced sports meals . By having the right foods ready and waiting for you , you 'll eat better . <p> Tip #6 . Plan rest days . Because ultra-distance runners commonly feel overwhelmed by their impending task , they tend to fill every possible minute with exercise . Bad idea . Rest days are essential to reduce the risk of injury and provide muscles with time to refuel . ( Remember : The bad things happen when you train ; the good things happen when you rest . ) Rest days also allow time for you totah dahfood shop ! ! ! <p> Tip #7 . Drink enough fluids . Ideally , you should learn your sweat rate by weighing yourself naked before and after an hour of race-pace exercise with no fluid intake . One pound lost = 16 ounces of sweat . You can then target the right amount to drink/hour so you do n't  get into a hole . <p> On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voiding a light-colored urine every 2 to 4 hours . Morning urine that is dark and smelly signals dehydration . Drink more ! <p> Tip #8 . Be flexible . Although you will have a well-planned fueling program that ensures adequate calorie and fluid intake , you also need to be flexible . Tastes change during extended exercise ! Your initial approach to consume " healthy foods " may deteriorate into gummy bears and Pepsi . Worry more about survival than good nutrition during events .

And even though women are less likely to suffer a heart attack than men--at least until menopause--they are more likely to die from that attack . According to the American Heart Association , 44 percent of women die within a year after their first heart attack , compared to 27 percent of men . Four years after their first attack , 20 percent of women will suffer a second , compared to 16 percent of men . They are twice as likely to die during heart bypass surgery . They get fatal strokes more often . " The perception that women do n't die of heart disease is a myth , " says Pamela S. Douglas , M.D. of Harvard Medical School .

" Others believe they have stopped menstruating because they are exercising too much or have too little body fat . Not the case . Many very lean runners who train hard have regular menses . <p> Absence of periods ( called amenorrhea ) can be linked to serious health problems , including loss of calcium from the bones , almost a three times higher incidence of stress fractures today and long-term problems with osteoporosis in the not-too-distant future . If you should want to start a family , amenorrhea interferes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to future problems with infertility ( even though normal menses may have returned ) . <p> Amenorrhea is not sport-specific . Sports that emphasize lightness ( running , ballet ) have the highest prevalence . Up to 44% of these athletes may experience amenorrhea ( as compared to 2% to 5% of women in the general population ) . The question arises : among a team of female runners , why do some of the women experience menstrual problems and others do n't ? The answer may relate to nutrition . Woman with amenorrhea commonly under-eat . Their bodies have inadequate fuel to support the menstrual process , to say nothing of nurture a baby . Under famine-like conditions , menstruation can stop to conserve energy . <p> If you are among the estimated 20% of active women who have missed three or more consecutive menstrual periods and are experiencing amenorrhea , please stop rejoicing and go see your gynecologist . Amenorrhea is abnormal . It can be a red flag for body image problems ( i.e. , claiming to feel fat even when emaciated ) , an intense fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amenorrhea is part of The Female Athlete Triad , along with low bone mineral density/stress fractures , and restrictive eating patterns/eating disorders . Amenorrhea can create undesired health issues . <p> Resolving the problem <p> If you no longer get regular menstrual periods and feel as though you are struggling to balance food and exercise , please get a nutrition check-up with a sports dietitian as well as a medical check-up with your doctor or gynecologist . To find a sports dietitian in your area , use the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics referral networks at www.SCANdpg.org or www.eatright.org . <p> The most important change required to resume menses includes matching your energy intake with your energy output , so you eat enough to support both running and normal body functions . Historically , doctors gave the birth control pill to women with amenorrhea ; this forced menstrual bleeding . But taking the birth control pill is a " Band-Aid approach " and does not resolve the underlying problem . <p> You are likely eating too few calories if you are hungry all the time and think about food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little less ( add a rest day ) and by eating a little more ( add a healthy snack or two ) . Your goal is to consume about 15 calories per pound of body weight that you do not burn off with exercise . That means , if you weigh 100 pounds , you my need to eat 1,500 calories to maintain your weight PLUS another 500 to 800 calories to replace the fuel you burned while training . That totals 2,000-2,300 calories for the entire day , a scary amount of food for some women . <p> Tips for resolving the issue <p> If eating this much sounds overwhelming to you , the following tips may help you get " back on the healthy track . " <p> 1 . Take a vacation from dieting . <p> If you can not let go of your compulsion to lose weight , at least be less restrictive . Cut back on your eating by only 100 to 200 calories at the end of the day , not by 500 to 1,000 calories during the active part of your day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are far more sustainable than the food chaos that accompanies starving-stuffing patterns . <p> 2 . Throw away the bathroom scale . <p> Rather than striving for a certain number on the scale , let your body achieve a natural weight that is in keeping with your genetics . <p> 3 . Eat adequate protein . <p> When you under-eat , your body burns protein for energy . Some of the protein comes from your diet ; for example , the protein in your omelet gets used for fuel instead of building and repairing muscle . Some of the protein comes from your muscles , hence , you experience muscle wasting and can lead to weaker bones and stress fractures . A 120-pound athlete should target 60 to 90 g protein per day . If you think your diet might be low in protein , track your food intake at **25;490;TOOLONG . <p> 4 . Eat a calcium-rich food at each meal to help maintain bone density . <p> Exercise alone is not enough to keep bones strong . Enjoy milk on cereal , low fat cheese on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a yogurt after dinner . <p> 5 . Get adequate vitamin D , to help with calcium absorption and bone health . <p> Sunlight on the skin helps make vitamin D. If you are an " indoor athlete " ( gym rat , ballet dancer , figure skater ) who gets little sunshine , be sure to choose foods fortified with D ( milk , some breakfast cereals ) , fatty fish like salmon , eggs , and mushrooms . In the winter months , you may need to take a vitamin supplement . <p> 6 . Eat at least 20% of your calories from ( healthful ) fat . <p> While excess calories from fat are easily fattening , a little fat at each meal ( 15 to 20 g fat per meal , or 45 to 60 g fat per day ) is an important part of a sports diet . You wo n't " get fat " by eating fat . Your body uses fat to absorb vitamins A , D , E , and K ; these vitamins are important for good health .

@@102096303 @6296303/ <h> Training <h> That Very First Time 79545 @qwx939545 <p> Regardless of whether you are a beginning runner or walker , here are the key items to consider when approaching your first running race , whether a 5-K or marathon . <p> Friendliness : Fellow competitors will respect and admire you . They remember their " first races " and how nervous they were . Expect a welcome reception from all others in your first race from elite athletes to newcomers like you . <p> What to wear : Dress for comfort . A visit to your local specialty running store will provide you with everything you need for race day from comfortable shoes to your race uniform . Although a favorite pair of shorts and the race T-shirt will do the trick , some of the wicking fabrics work better on hot days . <p> Extra gear : Water bottles are great for rehydration while training , but there should be more enough fluids on the course . Also , leave your radio at home so as not to miss the sights and sounds of a great race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to protect your eyes from the sun . A billed cap also is advised . <p> Course check : Examine the course map to determine where mile markers are along with aid stations , portable toilets and medical support . You may not need the latter , but it 's good information to know . Do n't worry about the weather ; it 's something you ca n't control . Drink up : Taking fluids at regular intervals during the event is important , particularly if it is a hot day or a long race . You can skip an occasional aid station if it is crowded , but do n't miss too many . Walk when you drink , so you do n't spill the water or gulp it down . Sports drinks will help restore energy . Eat cautiously : Unless you feel really hungry , eating food probably is n't necessary in most races . A meal high in carbohydrates ( such as pasta ) the night before should get you through . Practice good nutrition while training . Forget those fad diets . A proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 percent protein is best for fitness and for good health . <p> Stretching : To loosen up , do some easy stretches before the race , but stretching is best practiced during training after you run ( after your muscles have warmed up ) . While entire books have been written about the art of stretching , you can learn to stretch simply by using common sense and observing what other runners do . Training : Walkers and runners train in a similar fashion : mixing " hard " days with " easy " days with rest . Pick a good training program that allows you to gradually increase the number of miles you walk or run--then stick with it ! Consistency is very important if you want to meet your goals . Rest : Rest is essential , because only when you rest do your tired muscles recuperate and actually build strength . If you overtrain by doing too much , you not only risk injury , but you also will be unable to train successfully because of accumulated fatigue . Injury prevention : If you train intelligently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid getting injured . Wearing proper shoes also helps . Most running injuries are not life threatening and can be cured rapidly with an extra day or two of rest . If your injury fails to respond to rest , seek the advice of a sports medicine professional , such as an orthopedist or a podiatrist . Treatment : Most running injuries respond to RICE : Rest , Ice , Compression and Elevation . Icing the injury along with anti-inflammatory medicine such as Ibuprofen can help reduce swelling . A good massage therapist ( or physical therapist ) may be able to assist you with your treatment . <p> Pacing : Even pace usually works best , but it 's better to start slow and finish fast . If you are a walker or do n't know how fast you might run , line up in back at the start . If you start with faster runners , they may pull you out faster than you want to go . Better to pass people at the end than have them pass you . Cross-Training : Running day after day can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( participation in other sports ) not only for variety , but to build fitness . Other aerobic sports such as biking and swimming work best . Beware of sports such as basketball or volleyball , which feature sudden changes of direction . <p> Strength training : Lifting weights and other muscle-building exercises are good for overall fitness and long-range good health . If you have n't strength trained before , however , you do n't want to start now . Experienced lifters also may want to cut back on their routines as the miles build near the race . Training log : Keeping a diary of your workouts can be an important motivational tool . It proves that you have followed your training program and can help you build confidence . There are some sophisticated training programs online , but for simplicity record the number of miles you do each day on a wall calendar . Heart rate : Purchasing a heart rate monitor that records your pulse rate while running can also keep you in the training zone and motivate you as well . Most successful training is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although determining that " max " can be tricky . Follow the instructions that come with the device . Mind games : Completing a long distance race requires mental as well as physical strength . Setting specific goals ( interim as well as final ) will help you with your training and in the race . Running &amp; walking : If you are a fitness walker , you may be able to finish faster if you include some jogging . Runners also can benefit from occasional walking breaks , particularly while passing through aid stations . But plan well in advance how much walking you plan to combine with your running , and vice versa . Overtraining : This happens when you train too hard or too often in a mistaken belief that " more is better . " Often , it is not . Signs of overtraining include chronically sore muscles , general fatigue , inability to sleep or eat properly and an elevated resting pulse . Program regular rest days to avoid overtraining . <p> Warming up : Many elite athletes warm up for 60-90 minutes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast right from the start . For most recreational athletes , some easy jogging , walking and stretching is probably enough . Determine a warm-up that works for you during your training . The same with cooling down after workouts and the race . Supplements : Magic does n't come in a bottle . Most vitamins , minerals and other nutrients promoted to improve your performance will help little and cost much . Eating intelligently is the best plan . Consider seeking the advice of a Registered Dietitian to find out how to do just that . Sleep : Proper sleep is necessary for success , but do n't be surprised if nervousness causes you to stay awake the night before the Big Event . Get plenty of sleep the night before the night before to combat that problem . Adequate rest all during your training program is even more important . Do it right : Preparing for your first race by following all of the advice offered above will guarantee your success . There is no substitute for intelligent training and arriving at the starting line with the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to give it my best shot . Success will then be guaranteed .

Simultaneously , James Yunker , an airline pilot from St. Croix Falls , Wisconsin , offered his Twin Cities Marathon number on eBay . Numbers to other popular marathons such as St. George , Marine Corps and New York City certainly also were changing hands with no one the wiser . <p> Selling race numbers seems a " victimless crime . " To enter the most popular marathons , runners increasingly must pay early for races that an injury or unexpected invitation to a cousin 's wedding may force them to miss . Several races allow you to defer your entry a year , but you still need to pay extra . Refunds are rarely allowed .

Yunker 's airline probably will not refund your non-refundable ticket unless you can come up with a very good reason for not using it . Many race directors fix budgets expecting 10 percent shrinkage . Refunding fees would cost more staff time and might result in increased fees for those who do show .

I edged past Wilson in the last mile of the race , only to learn I placed " second " to an individual whose son ran with his number ! Wilson managed only fourth behind another number-switcher . Eventually , we received our trophies and the perpetrators received meaningless suspensions from next year 's Mini , but USATF does not want to waste its time policing mass marathons . Worrying about performance-enhancing drugs already occupies time best spent obtaining sponsors to improve the money base of at least the elite level of our sport . Meanwhile , would you like to qualify for Boston ? Just pay someone to run a qualifying time in your name . How about buying your way into the Olympic Trials , even the Olympics ?

I ran the 2000 Chicago Marathon this way . " <p> As marathons increase in popularity , this numbers game will occur more frequently . Yet despite Yunker 's claim , most race directors are not " greedy . " They are professionals , whose main goal is to make the Racing Experience enjoyable for all of us--otherwise we wo n't be back .

The paved lot and surrounding grassy areas at the Northwestern Indiana high school were crammed with cars , signaling a large attendance at what arguably is the world 's best high school cross-country meet . <p> Locating a space near a corn field , I remarked to a volunteer : " Is this parking for the Notre Dame football game ? " <p> " Might as well be , " he replied . " Biggest crowd I 've ever seen . " <p> Race director Doug Snyder later estimated that 3,000 spectators paid $2 admission .

Portage High School in Michigan has 3,500 runners in its invitational , but includes junior high teams . Niles West High School in suburban Chicago has promoted its meet as being the largest held on high school grounds with 69 girls teams and 73 boys teams , 2,400 total , but New Prairie now beats that . Largest according to Marc Bloom , editor of The Harrier , is Mount SAC in California : 12,000 runners , but colleges included and lasting two days . Manhattan High School in New York hosts 11,000 runners on a single day at Van Cortlandt Park . Not on high school grounds , if you 're looking for qualified bragging rights . <p> Apart from numbers , how do you define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World ? If New Prairie deserves those titles , it would be because its course works both for runners and spectators , something not easy to achieve . <p> Group 1 : Runners . New Prairie offers a wide starting area at the far end of a long field . That does n't eliminate bumping , but minimizes it . More to the point , the course ducks into the woods : three times for boys running 5,000 meters , twice for girls running 4,000 . There 's a zigzag down to a dry creek bed , then a steep hill named The Agony . If you 're looking for elements that typify the cross-country experience , New Prairie has them all . <p> Group 2 : Spectators . When not off in the woods , runners return to a central area within view of spectators , mostly friends and relatives . Smartest among them climb to the top row of the football stadium for a panoramic view . Without moving , you can watch runners pass four separate times . Add to that the beauty of New Prairie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Runner/Spectators . Do n't want to stand in one location waiting for runners to return ? Chase them ! Many runner/spectators hustle back and forth to see the athletes two or three more times . Teammates position themselves throughout the woods . Even when you ca n't see the race , you can tell where the runners are by the distant cheers . <p> Like New Prairie , most high school cross-country events are organized by dedicated coaches , many of them runners themselves , who love the sport and want to pass on their love to others . New Prairie features nine separate races , the final two for Reserves , allowing everybody a chance to run . Particularly for those who run only marathons , if you never have been to a high school cross-country meet , treat yourself to such an experience some day . <p> Football fans can have their Super Bowls .

" <p> She finally realized that Nick was wondering about Grandma 's Marathon in Duluth , Minnesota . The event actually gets its name from a restaurant near the finish line : Grandma 's Saloon &amp; Deli , an early sponsor . Wells Fargo Bank and Target now provide more sponsor money , but the name remains part of the mystique of this marathon along Lake Superior 's North Shore . With more than 9,000 runners , Grandma 's is the 11th largest marathon in the United States , the only one that large not in a major urban center . ( Duluth 's population is 85,000 . ) <p> Rose confessed to Nick that the race was not named after her , nor was she running it .

That proved too difficult to repeat , but 7 in 7 months seemed doable . And as long as I was running a total of 183.4 miles , why not do so for a cause ? Get people to pledge money per mile . Thus , the idea of running 7 marathons in 7 months to celebrate my 70th birthday and helping to raise $700,000 in funds for 7 separate charities was born . <p> Grandma 's Marathon was the first stop on my 7-7-70 journey .

When I was a boy on the south side of Chicago , my father used his two-week vacation each year to go fishing at Camp Idlewild north of Grand Rapids , Minnesota . To reach that pinnacle of fishing pleasure in the North Woods , we passed through Duluth . I still remember drives north through Wisconsin that seemed to last forever in the era before expressways .

The marathon begins near Two Harbors on Lake Superior and follows a rolling and winding road along North Shore Drive before emerging on that same Superior Street . Crowds line the sidewalks cheering the runners en route to Canal Park , that contains hotels , a convention center , an ore boat museum , an IMAX theatre and the popular Grandma 's Saloon &amp; Deli that gave the marathon its name . <p> Even if you 're not running a marathon , Canal Park is worth a visit .

Somewhat undertrained , I decided to forget about fast times in my seven marathons and simply try to run each one faster than the one before . With 9,000 runners in front of me on a narrow road , it took seven minutes after the gun sounded before I crossed the line . The train remained so its occupants could watch all the runners .

@@102096308 @6296308/ <h> Training <h> 15-K Training Guide - Intermediate Program <p> Introduction : The above schedule is for intermediate runners : individuals who want to improve their performances in either a 15-K or a 10-mile race . What defines an Intermediate runner ? You should be running five to six times a week , averaging 15-25 miles weekly training . You probably also should have run one or more races at distances between the 10-K and the Half-Marathon . With that as background , you now need a somewhat more sophisticated schedule so as to improve . If that does n't sound like you , you might be more comfortable using one of my programs designed for novice or advanced runners . Following are explanations of the terms used in the training chart below . <p> 10-Mile Training : The difference between 15-K ( 9.3 miles ) and 10 miles is minimal . You can use these same programs to train for a 10-mile race . All of my programs are available from TrainingPeaks in interactive versions , where I send you an email daily telling you what to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The runs of 3-6 miles on Mondays , Tuesdays and Thursdays are designed to be done at a comfortable pace . If you ca n't carry on a conversation with your training partner , you 're running too fast . For those who use heart monitors to measure their level of exertion , you would be running between 65 to 75 percent of maximum . In other words , run easy . <p> Rest : Rest is an important part of your training . Friday is always a day of rest in the Intermediate program . Be realistic about your fatigue level and do n't feel guilty if you decide to take an additional day off . Specifically consider scheduling at least one extra rest day during those weeks when you choose to race . <p> Tempo Runs : A tempo run is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near 15-K race pace . In this program , tempo runs are scheduled for every other Wednesday , alternating with interval training on the track . A tempo run of 30 to 40 minutes would begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster running near the middle , then 5-10 minutes easy toward the end . The pace build-up should be gradual , not sudden , with peak speed ( near 15-K pace ) coming about two-thirds into the workout . ( You do n't maintain peak speed for the entire middle of this workout , since that would involve too much stress . ) You can do tempo runs almost anywhere : on the road , on trails or even on a track . <p> Speedwork : If you want to race at a fast pace , you need to train at a fast pace . Interval training where you alternate fast running with jogging or walking is a very effective form of speedwork . The training schedule includes interval training featuring 800-meter reps ( repeats ) every other week , alternating with the tempo runs discussed above .

For more information on speed training , see my book , Run Fast . <p> Warm-up : Warming up is important , not only before the race itself , but before your speed workouts and pace workouts . Most novice runners do not warm up , except in the race itself . This is okay , because they 're more interested in finishing rather than finishing fast . As an Intermediate runner , you have a slightly different goal , otherwise you would n't be using this program , so warm up before you run fast . My usual warm-up is to jog a mile or two , sit down and stretch for 5-10 minutes , then run some easy strides ( 100 meters at near race pace ) . And I usually cool down afterwards by doing half the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important as part of the warm-up is stretching . Do n't overlook it--particularly on days when you plan to run fast . Strength training is important too : push-ups , pull-ups , use of free weights or working out with various machines at a Fitness Club . Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions , rather than pumping very heavy iron . Mondays and Thursdays would be good days to combine stretching and strengthening with your easy run , however , you can schedule Stretch &amp; Strengthen on any day that is convenient for your business and personal schedule . <p> Cross-Training : On the schedule , this is identified simply as " cross .

It could be swimming , or cycling , walking , other forms of aerobic training or some combination that could include strength training .

I suggest a 5-K in Week 4 and a 10-K in Week 7 , but there is nothing magic about those distances or distances . Check your local race calendar for some suitable races , and do n't take them too seriously . Your main focus should be on the 15-K at the end of the program . <p> Runs : As an experienced runner , you probably already do a long run on the weekends anyway .

Only 540 entered the Boston Marathon that year , including ( unofficially ) the first woman , but the seeds of running 's success already had firmly been planted . <p> Once a top-ranked runner , I was working as a freelance writer , not an easy profession , but I had begun to crack the major markets from Good Housekeeping to Playboy to the New York Times Magazine . Only rarely could I sell an article about running , because none of the best-paying markets cared about our sport . To a certain extent , that 's true today . <p> In 1966 I received a letter from a high school runner in Overland Park , Kansas . He had begun a magazine about running and sought my help . I pulled from my files an article I had written for Sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He published it in the second issue of Distance Running News . <p> The high school runner , Bob Anderson , had uncovered an unexploited niche . Another publication , Long Distance Log , edited by Olympian Browning Ross , had attracted maybe a thousand readers , but Ross only published race results . Anderson chose to publish articles about running and , most important , articles telling readers how to train . Soon , Anderson 's magazine had surged past Ross 's in circulation . Its popularity forced Anderson to drop out of college . He changed the name of his growing magazine to Runner 's World . <h> Discovering Dr. Sheehan <p> Baby-boomers began to embrace running and with it Runner 's World . Realizing he needed help , Anderson sought to hire Joe Henderson , an editorial assistant at Track &amp; Field News , based in California . Henderson refused to move East , so Anderson moved west , locating in Mountain View . <p> At the 1968 Olympic Games , I had introduced Henderson to a doctor friend of mine , George Sheehan . Security was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Henderson and Sheehan into the Athlete 's Village . <p> Henderson later recruited Dr. Sheehan to write for Runner 's World . I continued to contribute articles and columns , pro bono at first because of my love of my sport . Then as circulation soared past 100,000 , writing for the magazine became as profitable as writing for more mainstream magazines . It proved profitable too for Anderson , a millionaire before the age of thirty . <h> Shake-up in the magazine ranks <p> Success , however , bred discontent . Anderson and I clashed , a disagreement that seems trivial now . I abandoned Runner 's World to join The Runner , a New York-based publication . Henderson left to edit a Nike-sponsored publication in Oregon . Anderson sold Runner 's World in 1985 to Rodale Press , which also acquired The Runner , merging the two leading running magazines under one title . I returned as contributor as did Henderson , but not Anderson . At a 25th anniversary gala in New York , the publication 's founder neither was invited nor mentioned during ceremonies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Anderson has crafted a successful second career as a photographer and chief executive of Ujena , a swimsuit company . He frequently wins his ( 55-59 ) age group in California races . <p> The magazine certainly has grown and changed during my 40-year association with it . In 1966 , there was a single woman running at Boston ; in 2006 , women have begun to dominate the sport . At a recent Running USA Conference , Chicago Fleet Feet store owner David Zimmer identified women as buying 54 percent of running footwear , 60 percent of apparel and controlling 80 percent of household purchases . Rodale vice president MaryAnn Bekkedahl cited Runner 's World 's circulation ( 615,000 ) and advertising revenue as being at all-time highs .

It had been founded in 1897 by BAA members inspired by the long distance race at the 1896 Olympic Games commemorating the legendary run in 490 BC by Pheidippides from the plains of Marathon into Athens with news of a Greek victory over the Persians . <p> Pheidippides reportedly shouted " Rejoice we conquer " and fell dead . Almost certainly , this incident never happened , because it was reported only by later-day historians . Nevertheless , we accept the Pheidpiddes legend as the origin of our sport . Today , we run an established 26-mile-385-yard " marathon " to prove that we can cross the finish line vertically , not horizontally . <p> I ran that 100th Boston Marathon in 1996 . It was warm at the start in Hopkinton , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , we found ourselves confronted by a chilling headwind off the ocean . I picked up a silvery Mylar blanket from the gutter for warmth and ran with it in the closing miles , eventually discarding the blanket before crossing the line , but I was handed another after exiting the chute . <p> And for nearly ten years I kept that Mylar blanket , packing it carefully before leaving Boston and tacking it to a cork wall in the basement of my home in Long Beach , Indiana . At some point , I tired of seeing the blanket covering the cork wall , which I previously had been used mostly for posters . Or maybe I sensed that the blanket , which because of its silvery finish changed shades when struck by light at different angles , could be an integral point of a work of art . <p> I decided to do a collage . <h> An Amalgamation of objects <p> A collage is an amalgamation of objects you attach to a canvas or other vertical space to create a work of art .

Red , white and blue , it had " Boston " on the front and " A Century of Running " on the back to promote the book by that name I had written for Rodale Press in 1995 on the history of that race . About the same time , I had acquired a vanity license saying " BOST MAR .

As I attached these items to a horizontal canvas sized 4 by 5 feet , I also included a finisher 's medal and ribbon given to everyone who crossed the line . I knew Boston medals were cherished by those who possessed them ; many certainly hung in frames and were attached to walls in homes and offices . <p> I did n't need to give up my finisher 's medal to create the collage , because I was offered one by Jack Fleming , the media director for the Boston Athletic Association . Jack was a good friend , who had cooperated with me when I wrote Boston : A Century of Running , providing reams of research material from the 100 years of the race . In this case , he provided additional items including , in addition to the finisher 's medal , two race numbers one of them 1996 , the other a more anonymous number in the 29,000 range . <h> Unattended art <p> And so I began work on my collage .

We would be leaving for Florida soon , and it was time to fish or cut bait . Inspiration returned . Over a period of several weeks I completed work on what I titled " Boston Marathon 1996 .

Nowhere is this better demonstrated than at the New Prairie Invitational , a high school race in Northwestern Indiana . More than 2,000 runners appear on a Saturday morning in September for this event each year . As many as 3,000 appear to watch , claims New Prairie coach Doug Snyder .

Throughout most of the morning , competing runners can be found resting inside and around the tents , or jogging nearby while waiting their time to head to the starting line . Many of these young runners wear T-shirts listing titles won and bearing messages exhorting themselves to success : " Slow and steady wins the race--except in cross-country .

The young runners are clad in bright , primary colors : reds , purples , blues , greens , yellows , oranges . The names of their schools are emblazoned on their singlets to which are attached identifying numbers .

" Run out ! " he announces . At the command , each team sprints forward in a group then stops at their coach to clasp hands in a circle for a final pre-race cheer . This moment is called the Run-Out , but traditionalists know it as " The Shag . " As far as I can determine after having quizzed numerous coaches , The Shag may be unique to Northwest Indiana .

I asked her if the band had In My Solitude in its repertoire . " I 'll talk to Tom , " Fran replied . <p> Though the tour was being organized by Wal-Mart Vacations , the Costa Mediterranea proved to be anything but Wal-Mart in its dTcor . The ten-deck ship glittered with glass and marble and stainless steel . Fine art hung from the walls in corridors with deeply cushioned carpets . A midship atrium rose from the second to the tenth deck . To get to our room on an upper deck , we wound our way past slot machines and roulette tables . Lounges abounded everywhere where you could order a drink ( using your Costa card ) and listen to music . Three banks of elevators provided vertical transport for the thousand or more passengers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an electronic voice in the elevator announced in Italian , " Ponte Sette . Deck Seven . " In addition to couch and king-size bed , our room featured not merely a porthole , but a full glass wall and verandah overlooking the ocean . The Costa Mediterranea functioned like a Las Vegas hotel afloat , more than suitable lodging for Sir Harry and Dame Rose on their first cruise of the Caribbean . <h> Mustering in Life Preservers <p> At 4:00 just before departing , we mustered for an obligatory drill showing us how to board lifeboats in an emergency . " They 'll be showing the movie Titanic in the ship 's theater this evening , " I quipped to Rose just before a photographer snapped our picture wearing orange life preservers . It seemed that everywhere we went , a photographer wanted to take our picture and collect $19.95 , payable by Costa card , of course . Rose relaxes on her verandah <p> Those on the Tom Milo Big Band Tour gathered later in the theater to meet the band . Tom Milo confessed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repertoire . Given the number of passengers aboard , the title hardly seemed appropriate anyway . <p> Rose and I moved to the top deck as the ship sailed onto the ocean at sunset . Other cruise ships , before and aft , similarly emerged from the port steaming toward Caribbean destinations . By then , it was time for the first seating of dinner . We had arranged to sit with John and Madeleine Hayes , and other friends from our home in Northwestern Indiana . <p> Once out of the harbor , the ship began to roll in waves created by the tail end of storms that had brought mudslides to California and deep snow to Long Island . Our gourmet five-course meal was punctuated by the noise of dishes clattering to the deck . Green-faced passengers passed , heading toward their staterooms . " Switch in the movie schedule , " I told Rose . " We 'll be seeing The Perfect Storm . " We learned later from a couple that had been on two dozen cruises , that this was the roughest weather they ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , the seas grew progressively calmer as we sailed south . We spent all day at sea Monday , relaxing and reading . I got a truly great haircut from an Italian stylist . We walked the upper deck , each lap a third of a mile , I estimated . We cased the half dozen buffet tables topside near the pools . We established a calorie-burning strategy of using stairways instead of elevators . Unlike the concrete stairways found in most skyscrapers , the Mediterranea 's stairways featured carpeted steps and mirrored walls . We burned additional calories dancing to the music of the Tom Milo Big Band later that evening . Still no In My Solitude , but they played a snappy arrangement of another Ellington favorite , Satin Doll . <p> We landed in Puerto Rico Tuesday afternoon and wandered through Old San Juan . A nighttime kayak tour that interested us had been canceled , so we signed up for a tour promising Latin music . The strongly strummed music of guitar player Juan Carlos enraptured us , but every second number he yielded front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As much as I love--uhhh--dancing , " I told Rose . " I like Flamenco guitar even better . " Classmates Cliff and Sir Harry <p> We sailed overnight to Saint Thomas in the Virgin Islands , but took a ferry immediately after landing Wednesday morning to nearby St. John . Waiting for us at the dock was Cliff Stiles and his wife Carol . Cliff is a retired physician from Foley , Minnesota , a classmate of mine from Carleton College . President of the Young Republicans Club , he helped organize a campaign stop by Dwight Eisenhower our senior year . I carefully refrained from discussing politics with him . <p> Cliff and I climbed into the back of a 4x4 truck , Carol driving with Rose beside her as we roller-coastered along the island 's steep and narrow roads , stopping occasionally for panoramic views of blue water . At one jewelry shop , Carol asked the owner about a specific type of necklace . " I 'll make you one for next season , " the owner promised . Rose bought earrings for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage clinging to a hillside , high over a bay and beach , where Cliff can nude sunbathe without being disturbed . Rose and I chose to wear swimsuits for our romp in the surf . Carol made sandwiches for lunch . " No more than 500 calories , " I warned her . Like Joanne Leahy , she failed to meet that limit . <h> Strip Show <p> Thursday , our ship moored near Catalina , an island off the Dominican Republic . Tenders took passengers ashore to swim at a private beach . We chose instead an Eco-Tour of the main island . This involved taking a tender to shore , boarding a bus for a ride to another beach , where we got into a speedboat that whisked us along the shoreline at 40 mph to a mangrove swamp where we boarded dugout canoes powered by electric motors to view nests of frigate birds . " Eco stands for ecology , " I reminded Rose . Frigate birds <p> En route back , we stopped at a sandbar along with a half dozen other tour boats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking Rum and Coca-Colas and searching for starfish on the bottom . Rose and I hesitated . The tour instructions had said to bring bathing suits , not to wear them . Shamelessly , we changed in the back of the boat hoping nobody had us on video . <p> Our next port of call on Saturday , after a full day sailing , was Nassau in The Bahamas , where Rose and I had honeymooned . Not much remained from our first visit , including our honeymoon hotel , an abandoned shell when we visited Nassau on our twenty-fifth anniversary , now a shopping center . <p> We strolled Bay Street looking for gifts , February being a big birthday month in the Higdon family . A store named Del Sol featured T-shirts , Frisbees and nail polish that changed color when exposed to sunlight . That took care of the grandkids . We bought a shirt for our son Kevin displaying the name Kevinston , a rugby team . Rose priced one tanzanite ring , but passed when she discovered it cost $2,500 . Even Sir Harry lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costa cards . <p> Our last night on board featured a toga party . After returning from shopping , we discovered two fresh sheets at the end of our bed to be wrapped around our suntanned bodies to look like proper Romans . Not everybody on board accepted this sartorial challenge , but all at our table did . " I have come to bury Costa , not to praise him , " I offered as a toast before one final , and sumptuous five-course meal . <p> Sunday morning we landed in Port Everglades , to be collected by Dennis and Joanne Leahy . Before heading north , we regaled them with tales of our first cruise . We fled north before Joanne could offer us lunch . <p> We had not seen a bathroom scale all week , that not being a standard piece of stateroom furniture for cruises . But on our return to Ponte Vedra Beach , Rose and I discovered that while the average cruise passenger allegedly gains one pound for every day at sea , we had not gained a single pound . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its job . <p> We already have begun to consider destinations for our next cruise , including Alaska , the Greek Islands and Antarctica , where kayaking between ice flows might help us maintain proper body weight .

So did a dozen of my classmates and a handful of alumni from other years plus the president of the college , Rob Oden . The race , which traced a twisting course through the college 's Arboretum , attracted eighty-nine runners . A small college . A small town . A small race . <p> The run and walk was billed as " Saturday in the Arb with Rob and Hal . " Having majored in art at Carleton , I designed the race T-shirt that featured a variation of the famous Georges Seurat painting , " A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte .

You ca n't get lost ! " <h> An edge in fitness <p> The two of us posed for photos , then the race began . Those 16 miles obviously gave Rob an edge in fitness . He rushed ahead . So did my sophomore-year roommate and cross-country teammate , Lou McMurray . Another Carleton alumnus entered was Dale Kramer , a 4:01 miler and former NCAA champion , celebrating his 25th reunion . I was celebrating my 50th and had pushed my classmates to join me , walking if not running . Eleven ( including spouses ) accepted the challenge , remarkable when you consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the field composed of people over the age of 70 ? <p> The 5-K started and finished in front of Northfield 's Middle School . After four or five blocks through residential streets , we ducked into the woods : a narrow trail , uneven , rolling , reminiscent of many happy cross-country runs a half century ago . Every so often I caught a glimpse ahead of Lou , my roommate . Throughout our years in college together , I was the better runner , but during a workout on the track two days earlier , Lou seemed now to have the edge . Nevertheless , in the second mile of the race I found myself narrowing the gap between us . Crossing a grassy field , I pulled even , then ahead , but finally decided it would be more fun to finish together . We crossed the line holding hands overhead , barely ahead of a classmate 's wife , who was a power walker ! <p> Behind were other classmates walking , some of them in their first organized " race .

At that speed , our trip would take just over two hours . We had left Key West earlier that morning , headed westward toward the Dry Tortugas , a collection of seven , tiny coral islands so named in 1513 by Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon because of their large turtle ( las tortugas ) population and lack of any drinkable water . <p> But turtles had not drawn me to the Dry Tortugas . Motivating my visit was a mass of masonry , which first appeared on the horizon as a thin , brick red line , then began to dominate it as we drew nearer . This was Fort Jefferson , the largest coastal fortress in the Western Hemisphere , constructed beginning in 1846 to control traffic in the Florida Straits separating Key West and Cuba . After the Louisiana Purchase , the growing United States needed to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fort Jefferson , occupying 12 of the 16 acres on Garden Key , boasted 16 million bricks . Its gun ports could accommodate 450 straight-bore cannons capable of hurling iron balls three miles into the surrounding waters--or into the hull of an enemy ship . Merchant boats and vessels of war could moor beneath this protective umbrella confident that they could not be attacked . <p> Or so thought the fort 's designers . <p> Alas , within a decade Fort Jefferson had become obsolete , a victim of improved technology . Warships with newly developed rifled cannons could sit safely outside the three-mile umbrella and fire projectiles that could pierce the Fort 's walls and reduce it to rubble as had been true during the siege of Fort Pulaski in 1862 . A two-day bombardment with 5,300 shells reduced that fort at the mouth of the Savannah River to rubble . Although Union troops occupied Fort Jefferson at the beginning of the Civil War to prevent its falling into the hands of the Confederate Army , " the Fort 's cannons never were fired in anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee Fleet , which brought us from Key West . <h> The Union vs . Dr. Mudd <p> I first had seen Fort Jefferson four decades ago , although only from the air . In 1962 , I was an aspiring , young writer researching my first book , The Union vs . Dr. Mudd , its protagonist Dr. Samuel A. Mudd of Maryland , who in 1865 had set the broken leg of actor John Wilkes Booth after Booth had assassinated President Abraham Lincoln . For his part in the so-called Lincoln Conspiracy , Dr. Mudd was tried by a military tribunal and sentenced to life imprisonment . Four suspected conspirators were hanged ; four others ( including Dr. Mudd ) were sent to Fort Jefferson , because of its inaccessibility to the Mainland . Authorities feared Confederate sympathizers might try to free them . <p> Construction ceased in 1870 , partly because of the fort 's obsolescence , partly because Yellow Fever , endemic to the area , made living there dangerous . For most of the next century , Fort Jefferson remained largely inaccessible to tourists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildlife , both sea and air . The Dry Tortugas were designated a wildlife refuge in 1908 to protect a sooty tern rookery from egg collectors , and Fort Jefferson became a National Monument in 1935 , but only a few government caretakers managed its vacant hulk . Boats took considerably longer to span the 70 miles between Key West and the Dry Tortugas than swift catamarans like the Yankee Fleet do today . Unable to conveniently reach the fort in 1962 , I chartered an airplane so I at least could see it . I flew to the Fort , circled twice , then headed home to complete my book , which sold a modest 5,000 copies in its first printing . <p> In 1992 , Fort Jefferson was granted status as a National Park . Meanwhile , Dr. Mudd 's heirs lobbied Congress to declare him innocent of complicity in the Lincoln assassination . ( Dr. Mudd had served only four years of a life sentence , pardoned because of his humanitarian efforts during a Yellow Fever outbreak . ) The Mudd heirs ' efforts proved only partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that last year , 100,000 tourists visited . Some came mainly to snorkel or fish , but others came to see what truly was an architectural , as well as historical , wonder . <p> Visiting Fort Jefferson remained an unfulfilled desire for me for four decades , but somehow I never summoned the effort . Then my wife Rose and I purchased a second home near Jacksonville , Florida . Next I received an invitation to the Half Shell Half Marathon , a 13-mile running race in Key West . Thursday before the race , we drove south down I-95 , arriving six hours later at the Breakwater Hotel in the heart of Miami Beach 's Art Deco district . Built in 1939 , the hotel occupies a position midway between Decoratively Retro and Seedy , but you ca n't beat the location right on the beach , plus the price : $159 for a corner , ocean-view room . <p> The next morning , we continued our drive to Key West , connecting with US 1 , which in its southernmost miles hops from island to island across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico . The highway both parallels and overlaps the over-water railroad built by Henry Flagler a century ago . Traffic was relatively light , so we cruised along at a comfortable speed , stopping at Marathon Key for lunch . Mid-afternoon , we arrived in Key West at the Southernmost Hotel , advertised as the " southernmost hotel in the United States , " although it is southernmost only in the continental United States ( Hawaii being further south ) . A pylon a few blocks from the hotel identified the southernmost point . A dozen or so businesses nearby also identify themselves with the " southernmost " label . Across 90 miles of water lies Cuba . <p> For several days , we combined touring with race activities and eating in some colorful restaurants , beginning with the Half Shell Raw Bar , sponsor of the half marathon . Our favorite breakfast spot became a cafT a few blocks from our hotel named " Camille 's " that featured French toast . Given all the race T-shirts I accumulate , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " Camille 's " T-shirt as a birthday present for our daughter-in-law of that name . <p> We ran out of time before seeing the Harry S. Truman Little White House Museum . Truman had been a frequent visitor to Key West during his presidency . A Shipwreck Historeum Museum near Mallory Square ( good for shopping ) memorialized an era when residents of Key West ( sometimes called " conchs " ) would wait for ships to go aground on nearby reefs . " Wreck ashore ! " they would shout before clambering into boats to salvage cargo worth millions of dollars . We took a Sunset Cruise on the Schooner America , a replica of the boat that in 1851 defeated all challengers in the " 100 Guinea Cup Race " in England . The cup was brought back to the United States and renamed the " America 's Cup , " still coveted by sailors today . <p> Most memorable to me was The Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum , the house occupied by Hemingway and his second wife Pauline during the 1930s . Hemingway was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool in his back yard costing $20,000 , a prodigious sum of money in that post-Depression period . Angered at the cost , Hemingway flipped a penny at Pauline saying , " Here , you might as well have my last cent ! " <p> Pauline had the penny imbedded in the stonework beside the pool , where it remains today . Hemingway soon moved on , during the 1940s , to a third wife in Cuba and wrote my favorite book , The Old Man and The Sea . Not favorite Hemingway book , favorite book ! While stationed in Germany during the 1950s , I picked The Old Man and The Sea off a shelf in a base library and began reading . After a dozen pages , I sat down and continued reading . I finished the book before I left the library that night . More than any other author , Ernest Hemingway ( because of his simplicity of style ) has influenced every word I 've written . I suspect I 'm not the only writer who could make that statement . <h> Different-colored bricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first book , The Union vs . Dr. Mudd , as well as the several dozen that followed . It seemed time finally after four decades as an author to set foot on Garden Key and roam the vaulted chambers of Fort Jefferson once trod by Dr. Mudd . In Jack Hackett , we had more than an able guide . A whimsical man with a slouch hat , ruffled beard and eyes that I know twinkled behind his sun glasses , he walked us through the fort relating its history from Ponce de Leon 's discovery of the Dry Tortugas in 1513 to Congress 's declaring Fort Jefferson a National Park in 1992 . He pointed out that the lower bricks were light red in color , the upper bricks a darker red . " That 's because the bricks first used were acquired from Southern States , " explained Hackett . " Once , the Civil War began , construction continued with bricks brought down from Danbury , Connecticut . " <p> We climbed a circular stairway to a parapet overlooking a parade ground that could have swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The parapet itself was six-tenths of a mile around , about a kilometer . Several of the Rangers I met who knew my name because of my work for Runner 's World boasted that they ran for recreation atop the parapet ; five laps being the same distance as you would cover in a 5-K race . Well , what better could you do for recreation when you 're 70 miles from the nearest video store ? <p> After a brief tour of the fort , we paused for a picnic lunch . Many from the tour boat then headed for the beach or to cross the short sand bridge to Bush Key to do some birding . Among the birds seen regularly at Fort Jefferson are : black-bellied plovers , cormorants , sooty terns ( which nest there in spring ) , brown noddays , frigate birds and buttonwoods . I had another mission . Ranger Erin Kendrick had promised me a tour of Dr. Mudd 's cell , that end of the island being temporarily off limits to most park visitors because of efforts to remove two fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interior areas of the fort reminded me of Rome 's Coliseum , because of the vaulted ceilings . Kendrick indicated one chamber , where they suspected Mudd might have been held early during his stay , then brought us to another identified by sign as " Dr. Mudd 's cell . " <p> " The evidence is clearer here , " Kendrick explained , pointing to a bowl-like depression carved out of the concrete floor . " In his letters home , Dr. Mudd describes digging such a bowl to collect rain water for drinking . " <h> Yellow fever <p> I had read those same letters , collected by his daughter , Nettie Mudd , in a privately published book : The Life of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd . Writing home , Dr. Mudd described the Yellow Fever epidemic that hit the fort in 1867 , causing 350 men ( prisoners and jailers ) to fall i 'll .

Eliminate the mosquitoes , and you eliminate Yellow Fever , though to this day no cure exists for the disease . <p> Dr. Mudd 's family used his humanitarian efforts during the Yellow Fever epidemic as reason to petition President Andrew Johnson for mercy . Coming from Tennessee , however , President Johnson feared appearing overly sympathetic to the defeated Confederacy . He narrowly avoided impeachment by members in Congress who suspected him of complicity in the Lincoln Assassination . President Johnson pardoned Dr. Samuel A. Mudd as one of his last acts in office on February 8 , 1869 . Vaulted elegance . <p> Dr. Mudd returned home to Maryland . He would die in 1883 at age 49 , never having quite overcome the suspicion that he knew John Wilkes Booth better than he wanted to admit .

There is a chicken hawk , but it is a different chicken hawk , and it was a different chicken hawk the year before that and the year before that and maybe all the way back to the time of the Pharaohs . All this time , a chicken hawk has hovered above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a chicken hawk , and whether that single bird circling in the cloudless sky on a hot summer morning looking for prey beneath is the same bird year after year does not matter . <p> And so it goes with Egyptian art . <p> According to the most frequently cited organizational chart , that of Manetho as mentioned once before , there were three kingdoms , each with intermediate periods between them , and 31 dynasties and a couple of hundred pharaohs , or kings if you prefer that term , and they are all the same and they are all different . Unless you are an Egyptologist studying for a degree , which will allow you to work for some great museum or university , it does not make any difference . You simply need to relax and enjoy the art , such as the vultures on the ceiling at whatever temple it was we saw yesterday and to note that they are coloredred and bluenot the black and white as pictured in books or on the screen in Miss Vincent 's Art History class at Carleton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheops and ending around the time of Liz Taylor 's Cleopatra , when the Romans arrived and spoiled the local art scene , it took the Egyptians about 2,500 years to perfect their art . Twenty-five hundred years of chicken hawks halfway around the world in the skies over South Dakota , and that many years of artisans banging away with chisels on blocks of stone that took Herculean efforts to quarry and move , a task performed by tens of thousands , or maybe hundreds of thousands , of workers , who were not slaves , by the way , but ordinary Egyptians who wanted to play with the pre-historic version of Lego blocks and maybe contribute to their immortality and the immortality of their masters , but more important the legacy of Misr , Egypt , and they got it right . <p> Consider the fact that in the Renaissance there was only one Leonardo da Vinci , who produced a single Mona Lisa , and one Michelangelo who produced a single David , and one Brunelleschi , who produced a single Duomo , but Egypt has thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look the same are equally as good , right up there with the Renaissance , maybe higher than art of that era , and all this is good and all that is the reason I am on a cruise ship contributing much needed currency to an economy that is stressed following the Revolution . Egyptian art is the le plus ultra of everything I learned in Miss Vincent 's class , even if Rob and I try to connect it to a chicken hawk flying above a ridge in South Dakota . <p> Luxor <p> A <p> s we approached the dam and lock at Endu for the second time , now returning north but in daylight , the rowboats surged toward us . Three or four rowboats , two men in each boat , one rowing , the other standing in the bow waving towels and various other items for sale . As we closed on the lock , which would lower us to the river level past the dam , I worried that the boats and men in them might be crushed , but obviously these vendors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began hurling items in plastic bags onto the top deck , and members in our party , not wishing to buy , began hurling them back . That did n't discourage the vendors , who continued to propel sale items at us . I could n't help thinking that there was an opening for a quarterback in Indianapolis . <p> And soon it got worse as we entered the lock and became prey for dozens of more vendors standing atop the lock 's concrete walls on each side . Items rained upon us , particularly as the water level dropped and the sellers were on the same level with the boats top deck . But we eventually passed through the lock and some within our group did buy towels , and scarves and sheath dresses and various items . <p> Vendors ; they are the scourge of tourists visiting the monuments of Egypt . Paparazzi . Yet one has to feel sorry for them , since the tourist industry is downway down ! Many who might otherwise visit Egypt have postponed trips because of fears following the January 25 Revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only 2 million came . I 've heard various numbers of dubious accuracy , but all one has to do is look around during walkups to the most popular attractions to know it is true . The tourist drought has continued into 2012 , and you can not store tourists behind a High Dam , releasing them when needed to fill the coffers of the vendors . In many waysand I almost hate to admit thisthe tourist drought has proved good for us , because there are no long lines outside monuments or crowds of shoulder-to-shoulder people delaying our entry into museums . But it is bad for the vendors , very bad , because their business has to be way down too , and they have to survive , and we feel sorry for them , and sometimes purchase their wares , going through the obligatory ritual of bargaining , even though we almost would prefer to pay much more , and I once stood by idle as Rose overpaid a vendor for several scarves , but as we move through their selling fields , they buzz around us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times having to fend off people pushing items in our faces and saying , " One dollah ! One dollah ! " It even irritates the usually imperturbable Michael , our guide , particularly when he is trying to provide information about temples visited . The vendors , in fact , normally would be prohibited from the areas immediately around the tombs , but security in Egypt is lax these days , the police being somewhat absent or at least backed-off following the Revolution when for a time they had been the bad guys . Sometimes , Michael would accept items from several of the vendors and offer a sales pitch , almost like a TV commercial . His bargain with the vendors was that they would leave us alone until we were walking back to the bus . Sometimes they would ; sometimes they would not . <p> We are in Luxor , or rather on the river off Luxor , our boat the Misr being our hotel . Without question , Luxor has more fine art than any other city in the world , and I am including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Valley of the Kings are breathtaking , the size of the temples at Karnak so huge as to make one wonder how could they have been built without the cranes of today . And the colors ! Particularly in the deep tombs , the drawings and hieroglyphics on the walls are comic book bright . Did an ancestor of Roy Lichtenstein once inhabit Egypt ? <p> I asked Michael how the artists could see to work deep in the tunnels in an era before electricity . They could not have used torches , otherwise they would have choked on the smoke and smudged the very art they were creating . Mirrors , Michael said : Mirrors that reflected the light of the Sun deep into the darkest chambers , reflecting even past 90-degree corners even . The ancient Egyptians never cease to amaze me ! <p> We have only one more day on the river , then we return to Cairo for a wrap-up of our tour . <p> Back in Cairo <p> W <p> e are back in Cairo , having flown from Luxor this morning . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hotel took almost that long . Cairo traffic is as bad as in any city I have seen . We drove past an Olympic complex with a stadium that contained a track . In all honesty , I can not recall a single Egyptian track athlete , much less a distance runner , who has been able to contest for an OIympic medal . Not one individual . Not male , and certainly not female . Nobody at the top level , nobody comparable in ability to the North Africans to the West or the Africans East and South . It must be a cultural thing more than genetics . <p> The Egyptians centuries ago certainly must have been strong , given the size of the huge blocks of limestone and granite they hauled and heaved and lifted , some of the stone blocksMichael tells usweighed five times as much as the 45-passenger buses carrying us from site to site !

What can I say about Dandara that will differentiate it , both in my mind and yours , from everything else seen during this Alumni Adventure to end all Adventures ? Huge was the temple , nearly every cubic meter covered with pictures and hieroglyphics . Among the many temples and monuments we visited , Dandara was among those best preserved . That was because it was found only recently , in the last century . Dandara had been covered by sand until the French located it , then they rewarded themselves by stealing part of the roof , saying they planned to " restore " it . But they returned only the copy and kept the original block for their own use , just like they did the obelisk at Paris 's Place de la Concorde . Michael sometimes has not nice things to say about some of the countries who controlled his country over the centuries , and who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been badly scarred by people who , some centuries after the monuments construction , chiseled away the features of most of the figures on walls and columns to obscure the fact that they were gods or humans , or humans who were gods . A later religion that wanted to obscure the memory of an earlier religion 's " false idols . " Who those people might be , Michael did not want to sayif he knew . <p> There should be a special level in Hades for people who deface the art that came before them . <p> The Last Days <p> O <p> ur bags are packed and in the hall outside our room in the Cairo Marriott , awaiting our transfer to the airport . What an astounding yesterday . The EgyptianMuseum . The King Tut headpiece may be the most exquisite piece of art I have seen , nudging aside the Charioteer of Delphi .

When we reached the ground level , he rushed first off the elevator , leaving Rose to depart second . Had I detected a tiny cultural difference between our two countries ? In the United States , an American would probably defer to the woman , politely allowing her first exit . <p> But does this make any difference in a nation where the main question is , will the military continue to control Egypt even after the demise of Hosni Mubarak , or can the people continue to maintain the momentum of the events that flowed like the waters of the Nile from January 25 ? <p> Consider this : one final fact in a fact-filled blog .

But toward the end of that talk , one of our fellow tour members asked a pointed and political question .

This online , instructional introduction to the sport of cross-country skiing was done in a format patterned after my popular Beginning Runner 's Guide available both online and as a booklet , now into its third printing . The online version appeared during the winter of 2000-2001 , which appropriately featured plenty of snow for skiing , at least in the Midwest . I added cross-country skiing to my winter training routine a quarter century ago . I love the sport , because it changes your attitude towards winter , particularly if you are a runner . When snow narrows their regular running routes , runners can grab their skis and head into the woods . Better to do that than complain all winter long . <p> This website is visited most often by runners looking for training programs , particularly for the marathon . As a result , this Guide has been designed with my key audience in mind . I want to motivate runners and other non-skiers who appreciate the values of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Partly for this reason , I have not included advice at this point on how to skate , that " other " technique discussed in the Two Techniques . You may disagree , but it 's my opinion that most beginners can gain easiest access to the sport using the classic technique . And as a cross-training exercise for runners , in-track skiing comes closer to developing and/or using the muscles used in running . I may add some skating advice at a later point . Go ahead , you skaters , yell at me ! ( This Guide has been up nearly a year , and so far none have . ) <p> I eventually plan to publish Beginning Skier 's Guide as a booklet . Whether or not this happens this winter depends upon my finding time in my busy schedule . If you work at a nordic center or sports store that features cross-country ski equipment , you might want to offer this booklet for sale to help your customers gain access to the sport . It would be a fine giveaway to people purchasing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those retailers ordering in quantity , we will offer discount prices : one low price if you come in before the first print order ( since that will give us an idea of how many copies to print ) , another low price if you order after we have booklets in hand .

You are about to begin your fourth week of Spring Training , which means you have three weeks behind you and nine ahead . It 's always a good idea at the beginning of each workout week to take a few minutes to both evaluate running past and contemplate running future . You can do that while floating through a 3-miler today ( assuming you run alone and do n't have someone to converse with ) . This week your total running mileage will be about 25 miles , only a mile or so further than you did last week . The main difference is that last Sunday you ran a 6-miler ; this Sunday , you 'll run a 7-miler . Otherwise , this week 's training schedule is the mirror image of last week 's schedule . You will benefit from the cumulative effect of this training . <p> Tuesday : Four miles for today 's workout . In my instructions leading to the weekly schedules , I suggest that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a conversational pace . Nevertheless , you might want to do your Tuesday runs somewhat faster than your Monday and Thursday runs , which are geared more to recovery . Speaking in terms of target heart rate , I normally suggested doing easy runs at a pace that would raise your pulse to between 65 to 75 percent of maximum . Thus , the Monday and Thursday runs could be done closer to 65 percent with Tuesday runs closer to 75 percent . In stopwatch times , it might be the difference between 8:00 pace and 7:30 pace . Do n't agonize over hitting those numbers exactly if you 're wearing a heart monitor or looking at your watch . Look to your own body for pace cues . <p> Wednesday : Run 4 hill repeats , being sure to warm up before and cool down afterwards . Olympian Marty Liquori lived and trained in Gainesville in a state that is flat as an alligator 's profile . To do " hill " training , Liquori would run up the stadium steps at the University of Florida . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ( same as our plan ) . " When you run a lot of distance , your stride shortens , " says Liquori . " Your leg muscles are not extending , so they become fairly weak . You go to a hill phase to make a transition , to force you to open up your stride by bounding up hills . You exaggerate knee lift and arm swing , push off with the toes and the calves . This strengthens your quadriceps and buttocks muscles before going back onto the track . " <p> Thursday : Run 3 miles with strength training afterwards . If you 're training for speed , you do n't want to bulk up . Extra weight will slow you down . To avoid putting on body fat pounds , keep the poundage low . Personal trainer Cathy Vasto recommends lifting 50 to 60 percent of the maximum weight you can lift in a set of 12 repetitions . Two sets of 12 work well for most lifts . The reason for doing your strength training after you run , is that lifting can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harder time running after lifting than before . To retain flexibility , do your stretching exercises between lifts . <p> Friday : Friday , like Monday , is another day when the workout never changes . It 's " rest . " Take the day off .

You 'll do tomorrow fartlek run at a higher quality level if you are well rested . Quality is the key to success , one reason I emphasize it in this Spring Training program . Rest is important to maintain quality . <p> Saturday : Today 's fartlek run is 35 minutes , a slight increase from two weeks ago . In all honesty , does it really matter whether or not you run 35 rather than 30 minutes ? At the risk of giving my secrets away , no . Most important is to have a plan . Balancing hard and easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you complete this 12-week Spring Training program and hopefully move to other training programs--perhaps one for the marathon--you 'll begin to understand the overall wisdom of the hard-easy approach .

Regardless of the distance , you should be able to maintain about the same pace used for your previous workouts at 6 and 7 miles . Remember : the pace should be " conversational , " meaning that if you are running with a friend , the two of you should be able to talk without undue strain . If you are wearing a heart monitor , your pulse rate should fall in the zone of 65 to 75 percent of your maximum heart rate . At the end of your workout , listen to your body . How did it feel ?

Truth be told , bias revealed , my wife Rose and I know the author , since Eric served as lecturer on an Alumni Adventure to Antarctica several years ago . It was two glorious weeks of perusing the penguins , scrambling over snow , ogling the orcas , savoring sunsets that colored 360 degrees of horizon , our best ever travel trip . But Antarctica was also Goulds world , his habitat , the Carleton geologist and president having made seven trips to the southernmost continent during his long life .

Also , Larry Gould was a man that I barely knew as a student and never saw as an alumnus . He was a larger-than-life figure , who had served as second-in-command during Admiral Richard E. Byrds ground-breaking ( or rather , ice-breaking ) expedition to the South Pole in 1928-1930 . Goulds yearly lectures describing that expedition to students were attended with great excitement . Once a year , my classmates and I donned red ties ( or red outfits ) to honor the man , who himself , against all fashion , wore ties of that bright color . Unfortunately , my only personal contact with Larry Gould came because of a misadventure that caused me to be hauled into his office for a ( deserved ) tongue-lashing .

Gould was born in 1896 in a small village near South Haven , Michigan , less than an hour or so up the Lake Michigan shoreline from where I live in Long Beach , Indiana . To earn money for tuition before enrolling at the University of Michigan , this soon-to-be college president taught in a one-room school in Boca Raton , Florida . Boca then was little more than a tiny farm village ; today , it is one of Floridas richest communities , where a round of golf at the local country club costs more than $500 . <p> Before he could finish his education , World War I erupted in Europe , the U.S. eventually being sucked into the conflict . Gould , patriotically , served in the Ambulance Corps in Northern Italy , as did Ernest Hemingway , who used that setting for the novel , Farewell to Arms . No evidence exists that the two ever met . <p> Gould earned a doctorate at Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rung of the collegiate ladder , he participated in two expeditions to Greenland and the Arctic organized by G.

When in 1932 , Earhart departed New Jersey by plane , seeking to be the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean , Larry Gould and his wife Peg were among the few people in the send-off party . By the time , Earhart landed in Ireland before a much larger crowd , she had become " the most famous , most celebrated woman in the world . " <p> It was Putnam , who had recommended Gould to Admiral Byrd . This was during the so-called " Heroic Era of Antarctic Exploration . " Norwegian Roald Amundsen had been first to reach the South Pole in 1911 . Byrd had been first to fly over the North Pole in 1926 and wanted to add the South Pole to his adventurers resume during a year-and-a-half long expedition to Antarctica in 1928-30 .

Gould collected rocks that proved that the icy continent once had supported lush vegetation and hinted at a then unproven theory of continental drift , at one time all the continents being joined together . After his return , Gould wrote a fascinating and very readable book titled Cold about the expedition and trek , including one misadventure where he slipped into a crevasse and almost never came out . In the Gould biography , Eric Hillemann does an effective job in recycling Cold , while adding information from other sources . Hillemann pictures Admiral Byrd as almost a paranoid egomaniac , jealous of any who stepped into his spotlight . For several years after their return from Antarctica , the relationship between Byrd and Gould was more than frosty , their personal feud causing ripples within the tightly knit scientific community , particularly among those who had participated in the Antarctic expedition . Eventually both men forgave each other for imagined slights and mended fences . <p> In 1932 , Carleton College recruited Gould as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other professor on campus .

He expected to stay at the small liberal arts college for a year or two , burnish his image while upgrading his teaching credentials , then return to the grandeur of the University of Michigan . He never did , falling in love with the small school . A frequently quoted statement by Gould , still echoes on campus : " You will become part of Carleton , and Carleton will become part of you . " <p> In 1945 , the long-time president of Carleton , Donald J. Cowling , retired . Gould became one of the leading candidates to replace him . The Board of Trustees , including chairman Laird Bell , resisted , not wishing to promote one of their own professors , despite Goulds popularity with the students . He also was relatively young , still in his 40s . Hillemann opens the book intriguingly with the story of the political infighting .

I may be biased when I say that Carleton is not the Harvard of the Midwest ; rather , Harvard is the Carleton of the East Coast . <p> Goulds activities in the early 1950s , as reported by Hillemann , were most fascinating to me , because that was when I attended Carleton , graduating in 1953 . I knew and even had classes with many of the professors mentioned . As to the one time I was invited into the Presidents office , it was not for being the top runner on the track and cross-country teams , but because of my criticism of one of his fellow presidents in the Midwest Athletic Conference : Nathan M.

Pusey was behind a move to drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bent the rules to recruit a top basketball team , one that ( perhaps unwisely ) had obliterated the second-place team in the Conference by a score of something like 150 to 50 . Puseys roll in banishing Beloit struck me and the editor of The Carletonian , the school paper , as unjust . Woe to us . We struck in print ! Gould forced us to apologize to Pusey , who would leave in one year to become president of Harvard . <p> My most vivid memory of the trip to the presidential office was the stuffed emperor penguin with a bullet hole in its chest , the bird having been killed by the Great White Hunter and brought home as a trophy . I could identify with the shot penguin . The stuffed penguin remains preserved in a display case in the Laurence McKinley Gould Library on the Carleton campus . <p> Admirably , Eric Hilleman did not come to his reconstruction of Larry Goulds life only to praise him . He shows the warts , the blemishes , one being that Gould had a well-sculpted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the students ( including me ) , all of us happy to walk in his shadow . We loved his annual Antarctic Expedition lecture . We wore red ties on Larry Gould Day . All hail the King ! <p> We were nanve , as undergraduates , in not knowing the main job of a college president , and it was not showing up once a year to give an Antarctic lecture wearing a red tie . It was all about money . Asking for money , large sums of money . No , not asking for money : begging for money . Gould spent less time on campus than many of us realized . He served on committees and attended conferences , chairing this and organizing that , rubbing shoulders with millionaires and directors of foundations , whose monetary assets were not merely in the millions , but in the billions . The Ford Foundation , on whose Board he served for nearly a dozen years , had $4.4 billion in assets back in the 1960s when that was a lot more money than it is today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kept the college running . There 's a lot of talk about money in the Gould biography . I found Hillemanns description of Larry Gould humbling himself in order to meet a pre-retirement goal of $12 million painful to read , particular in his relationship with The Olin Foundation , whose chairman was downright nasty , once shoving a check across the desk and onto the floor , forcing our favorite president to bend over and pick it up . The check was only for $10,000 ! Yes , only ! Over the years , Gould continued to accept a series of small checks from The Olin Foundation , chronicled through several chapters by Eric Hillemann to the point where I wanted to shout , " Stop ! Stop ! Eric , I do n't  want to hear any more about the humbling of our hero . " Yet toward the end of Goulds tenure , The Olin Foundation , like a penguin returning to the nest stuffed with krill from the sea , regurgitated $150,000 for the science building that still bears its name . <p> Fascinating also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He started as a staunch Republican . My senior year , soon-to-be-president Dwight Eisenhower made Northfield , Minnesota one of his first campaign stops . Gould liked Ike ( as did 77% of the student body ) , but he thought little of Ikes running partner , Richard M. Nixon . <p> At one point , Carletons president campaigned vigorously against Federal aid to education , fearing that it might result in Federal " control " of education . Yet in the 1960s Gould felt no shame in accepting $800,000 in Federal aid , which allowed him to build two new dormitories . Most admirably , Gould refused to yield to pressure from the followers of Senator Joseph McCarthy to remove from the faculty Kenneth May , a mathematics professor , a former member of the Communist Party . Gould defended May as a top teacher who in 1942 had renounced communism . Politics might be one thing , but do n't  mess with my college ! <p> Though Republican , Gould was a centrist , distrusting the arch-conservative wing , represented by Robert Taft , Ikes primary opponent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political pole swung left , partly because of a friendship with Minnesotas Senator Hubert H. Humphrey . The leaders of the Republican Party on several occasions tried to recruit him to run for Governor , or Senator . Gould resisted . He was happy with his job as college president . He would rather beg for foundation grants than for votes . Many years later , Gould would consider Ronald Reagan , along with Richard Nixon , among the two worst U.S. Presidents . <p> One possible quibble : Hillemann suggests that when Ike and his wife Mamie came to Carleton in 1952 in a special 18-car train , Gould met the campaigners at the train station , presented Mamie with a flower bouquet and escorted the party in a bright red convertible to Laird Stadium , jammed with 11,000 cheering people . <p> Classmate Cliff Stiles , president of the Young Republican Club , helped organize the Eisenhower visit to Carleton . Stiles claims that Ike actually refused to let Gould ride with him in the convertible . Gould was disappointed , even angry , until Ike later confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Wisconsin , and he did not want to establish a precedent that would allow Joe McCarthy into the car with him . Stiles also told how Mamie was distraught during the drive of several blocks from the train station because of streets devoid of people--until they turned the corner and saw the packed stadium . She later would claim that the Carleton visit was the most memorable event of the entire campaign . Stiles still has a large campaign poster signed by Ike , framed and hanging in his study . <p> Incredibly , when Larry Gould retired from Carleton at age 66 , he had completed only two-thirds of his life . He would live to just before his 99th birthday . With his wife Peg , he moved to Tucson , teaching part-time at the University of Arizona in geology , occupying an office offered to him because the president of Arizona appreciated his Star Quality , particularly in the area of geoscience . In total , Gould would travel seven times to Antarctica , serving as a chairman for the Antarctic Committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , publishers tried to persuade Gould into writing an autobiography . Unfortunately , he never did . His lectures , particularly on the subject of education , probably deserved being collected between covers . Eric Hillemann mines this vein well . <p> The Goulds did not have children . His wife Peg seemed a troubled woman , suffering sometimes from depression , estranged from her sister for nearly a quarter century because of some real or imagined slight , the two siblings reconnecting only a month before Pegs death . Larry and Peg spent long periods away from each other . He had his scientific ventures and memberships on boards and committees ; what she had remains unclear . Before his retirement and move to Arizona , Peg Gould would escape to that state for most of the winter . No worshiper of ice and snow she , but it must have been difficult for a woman living in a shadow so largely cast . Biographer Eric Hillemann seems puzzled by Peg Gould and , as a result , so are we . Perhaps it is best that we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level well above the level occupied by those of us who attended Carleton College , we who sat spellbound during his Antarctic lectures and who on one day a year mimicked his wearing of red ties . Too bad we did not get a chance to know him better . At least in A Beacon So Bright , Eric Hillemann provides us with a belated introduction to a remarkable man . <p> <p> * G. P.

Or is it a health food , dieter 's weight loss aid , and effective recovery food for tired , hungry athletes ? <p> I vote for the later ! Personally and professionally , I like to think of chocolate ( in moderation , of course ) as one of life 's pleasures . Here is some research that might be of interest to active people who love chocolate . <p> Chocolate Cakefor Breakfast ? <p> Chocolate cake for breakfast enhances weight loss . Really ? Yes , according to researcher Prof. Daniela Jacubowicz ( 1 ) . The subjects were 193 obese , non-diabetic adults who ate either a 300-calorie low carbohydrate breakfast or a 600-calorie breakfast that included protein plus chocolate cake ( or another sweet dessert ) . Both groups were instructed to eat the same amount of total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . In the first 16 weeks , both groups lost an average of 33 pounds per person . But in the second half of the study , the no-cake group had poor compliance and regained an average of 22 pounds per person while the cake-eaters continued to lose another 15 pounds each . By 32-weeks , the cake eaters had lost about 40 pounds more than their peers . <p> Prof. Jacubowicz noticed that those who had cake for breakfast had fewer cravings for carbohydrates and sweets later in the day . By frontloading their calories , they were less hungry and less likely to stray from their food plans . They had curbed their cravings for sweets and treats , in comparison to the group that ate the smaller breakfast . <p> So what does this research mean for you , a hungry runner ? <p> 1 ) Eat a satisfying breakfast that leaves you content . Do not stop eating breakfast just because you think you should . <p> 2 ) If you want a treat , such as chocolate cake , enjoy it earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are tired , too hungry , and lack the mental energy needed to stop yourself from overeating . Think of it as having dessert after breakfast instead of after dinner . <p> 3 ) Even on a weight reduction diet , you should eat what you truly want to eat , without deprivation of your favorite foods . Otherwise , you 'll end up doing " last chance " eating . ( You know , " I just blew my diet by eating cake , so I might as well keep eating it because this is my last chance before my diet starts again " ) <p> Its not a secret : a candy bar contains primarily nutrient-poor calories from sugar and fat . For example , a Hershey 's Bar ( 43 g ) contains 210 caloriesof which 46% are from sugar , 55% from fat . Hence , you want to enjoy milk chocolate in moderation , not in binges .... <p> However , less-processed dark chocolate can be considered a healthier choice . Chocolate is made from cocoa , a plant that is a rich source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vegetables , and whole grains ) . Two tablespoons natural cocoa power ( the kind used in baking ) offers the antioxidant power of 3/4 cup blueberries or 1.5 glasses red wine . Unfortunately , dark chocolate has a slightly bitter taste and most people prefer the sweeter milk chocolate , a poorer source of phytochemicals . ( We need to raise our children on dark chocolate , so they will they learn to prefer it ! ) <p> Dark chocolate also contains flavonoids , health-protective compounds found in many plant foods including tea , apples , and onions . Epidemiological surveys of large groups of people indicate those who regularly enjoy chocolate consume more of these health-protective flavonoids than non-chocolate eaters . This reduces their risk of heart disease . For example , in the Netherlands , elderly men who routinely ate chocolate-containing products reduced their risk of heart disease by 50% and their risk of dying from other causes by 47% ( 3 ) . Maybe a daily ( preferably dark ) chocolate fix can be a good idea ? <p> Chocolate Milkfor Recovery ? <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuel and repair your muscles , boost your blood sugar , and replace sweat lossesas well as reward yourself with a tasty treatreach for some low fat chocolate milk ! Research indicates refueling with chocolate ( or any flavored ) milk enhances recovery of both fluids and muscles better than the standard carb-only , sugar-based sports drink ( 4 ) . <p> Anyone responsible for stocking the recovery food table for tired , thirsty runners who want to rapidly refuel after a hard workout will tell you chocolate milk is an all-time favorite . Weight-conscious female runners , in particular , let themselves enjoy this treat " guilt-free " and meanwhile boost their intake of nutrient commonly missing in their diet , such as high quality protein , riboflavin , calcium , and vitamin D. What a positive change from their embattled relationship with chocolate ! This is good . <p> But should n't we be staying away from sugary foods ? The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 10% of calories from refined sugar per day ; that 's about 200 to 300 sugar-calories for most athletes . Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks . Milk 's high quality protein , calcium , vitamin D , riboflavin and a host of other important nutrients is far better than sugar water with a dash of salt ! <p> For those of you who happen to read the Boston Globe ( 3/13/12 ) , you might have caught my answer to a healthwriter 's criticism of USA Swimming for choosing chocolate milk as a sponsor . My response : " Kudos to USA Swimming for choosing to be sponsored by a whole food as opposed to an engineered sports food . To have role-model athletes touting low fat chocolate milk is preferable to the alternative of them touting sports drinks . I only wish more " real food " companies would do the research needed to counter the influential engineered sports food industry . " <p> The bottom line <p> By no means is chocolate the key to a healthy sports diet , nor is eating lots of dark chocolate preferable to snacking on apples and bananas .

" Warhol believed the Media could convert anyone to a paparazzi target , at least briefly . But some of us are blessed--or cursed--with more than the normal allotment of fame , as I learned last week . <p> I realized this after I received an email message from a college classmate , who claimed I was the answer in a New York Times crossword puzzle : " Wrote running book , nine letters .

@@102096329 @6296329/ <h> Training <h> The Two Techniques <p> Most Nordic centers that groom their trails do so to accommodate two types of cross-country skiers : those that ski in tracks and those that skate . In-track skiing is also referred to as " classic " skiing , because that 's the way the sport began . Initially , skiers skied with their skis pointing straight forward , leaving two parallel tracks behind . Then in the early 1980s American Olympian Bill Koch popularized a style of skiing that featured sideways movements , like an ice-skater or roller-blader . Koch won a World Cup title using this swifter style , and the racing world changed techniques almost overnight . But classic skiing remains popular among purists , and unless you ice skated as a child , it is probably easier to begin as a classic skier . <p> Here is what you need to know about the two techniques : <p> Classic : Skiers move straight down the trail . If you are skiing at a Nordic Center with groomed tracks , there usually will be a set of tracks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sometimes tracks will be on both sides . ) If skiing where there is no grooming , other skiers may have preceded you establishing similar , parallel tracks . If the snow is fresh , you will need to set your own tracks , which is hard work , but also enjoyable . In classic skiing , as one ski moves forward , the pole on that side moves backwards . The opposite ski and pole meanwhile move in reverse . It 's a basic , one-two movement , just like running where your arms counterbalance your legs . Learning to ski using this traditional style is relatively easy , particularly if you have a ski instructor who can show you how . <p> Skating : Skaters move down the trail in the same direction , but take up more room , sliding from side to side . Seemingly their side movements should waste energy , but actually skaters move much faster than classic skiers , one reason why racers quickly mimicked Bill Koch and switched styles . ( At the Olympic and World Cup level , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to skate efficiently , you need a well packed surface . When skating first became popular , classic skiers became irritated when skaters obliterated their tracks , but trails now are groomed so that skaters use the middle and classic skiers use one or both sides . The two types of skiers get along more amicably now . <p> The equipment used for the two techniques is somewhat different . Classic skiers use skis that have more camber ( bend ) in the middle . When they weight one ski , it grips the snow allowing them to push off onto the opposite ( forward sliding ) ski . They either use kick wax on their skis or use waxless skis with patterned bottoms to assist that kick . Skaters , however , push off more from the sides of their skis and do n't need kick wax . They use skis that are flatter and wax their skis only for glide , not kick . Skating poles are somewhat longer allowing skaters to push themselves down the trail in a movement that is more like double-poling than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tried skating but found that it required muscles and movements significantly different from those used in running . Since one of the reasons I took up skiing during the winter was to stay in shape for running in the summer , I switched back to classic skiing . However , I occasionally will throw in a skating stride , to pick up speed going downhill or around a turn , and also because it 's fun . 
@@102096330 @6296330/ <h> Training <p> As a grade school sand lot baseball player , I used to dream of playing in the World Series . By my junior year in college , however , my athletic dreams had turned to thoughts of running in the NCAA track and field championships . Even this seemed presumptuous . Although , in that Olympic year of 1952 , I had won two conference championships , I was then strictly a minor league runner--about the equivalent of a Class B baseball player . Carleton College , where I attended school , was one of the big fish athletic powers of the small pond Midwest Conference . Its large size ( about 850 students then ) gave it a decided advantage over the real minnows like Coe , Monmouth , and Ripon . <p> But despite its apparent little league status , Carleton paid its NCAA dues along with Kansas , Villanova , and Southern California . And in those days , all a member school athlete needed for entry in the NCAA championships was to talk his track coach into scratching up the two-dollar entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the big event was to be held at the University of California ) I approached Wally Hass , my coach and the athletic director , with the request that I be allowed to hitchhike out and represent our school . " What event do you want to enter ? " he asked . <p> " What choice do I have ? " I replied . Since it was an Olympic year I had quite a choice . Back in the fifties , college runners rarely raced further than two miles , but the NCAA championships that spring contained a veritable horn-of-plenty for distance runners : the 10,000 meters , the 5,000 meters , and something called the 3,000 meter steeplechase . This last event , practically unknown in America back then , featured four hurdles and a two-and-a-half- foot deep water jump on each of its seven-plus laps . I had once unsuccessfully been a hurdler in high school . It sounded like fun . <p> " I think I 'll try the steeplechase , " I said , but then envisioned myself drowning in that water jump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the 800 and 5,000 meters too ? " <p> Wally frowned . He may have thought me worth a two-dollar entry fee , but he did n't know about increasing the ante to six . <h> Sand-Lotters <p> The Carleton team arrived in California three strong . After all , I had n't been the only sand-lotter to dream of myself next to Joe DiMaggio in the World Series , With me came Bobby Johnson of Bismarck , North Dakota , who that year had tied for fourth in our conference 100 yard dash . Bruce Turner of Cedar Falls , Iowa , had been fifth in the broad jump . Bruce had the most impressive credentials of all : a 1940 Mercury coupe that had provided our transportation to the West Coast . We planned to compete in the NCAA championships in Berkeley , then drive south for the National AAU championships the following weekend in Long Beach . If we placed in either of these first two meets , we would qualify for the final Olympic trials to be held on the third weekend in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials from the stands . <p> But at Berkeley we could observe from the infield grass . Clutching our programs while sitting near the pole vault pit , we pointed , oohed , aahed , and chattered like old ladies at a Broadway matinee as our heroes paraded past warming up for their events in Friday 's trials . The finals would be held on Saturday . <p> " Look , there 's Jim Golliday , " Bruce exclaimed , pointing at the man who was then the world ' s fastest human . The Northwestern runner was already being touted as the Olympic 100 meter dash champion . We also easily spotted Parry O'Brien , Walt Davis , George Rhoden , Ollie Matson , Wes Santee , and others whose names have since been forgotten but who then were great heroes to us and other-track fans . <p> One such hero was F.

" Yet despite our lowly athletic talents , Buzz treated us like normal human beings . We looked up to him as some sort of god . <p> I went over and gazed down into the water jump for the steeplechase . It was the first time I had even seen one . Our school did n't even have hurdles that adjusted to the three-foot height of the normal steeplechase barriers . I had practiced over high school hurdles three inches higher . I rationalized this would make me tougher , sort of like wearing weighted boots . The water had n't been put in the pit yet , and it looked deep and deadly . The three-foot solid barrier before the pit had greenery and bushes attached to it as though some fiendish grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You run this event ?

" <p> " Oh , I run the mile in the 4:20 's , " I said , half ducking his question . Actually my best time was 4:29.9 at that point , which was rounding things off a bit . However , four-minute miles were n't in vogue back in 1952 and this seemed to satisfy him . <h> Maize and Blue <p> " The first broad jump contestant will be Robert Johnson of Carleton College , " crackled the stadium loudspeaker . The field events would begin before the running events . The eyes of the few early arrivals swung to focus on a bright yellow uniform at the end of the broad jump runway .

Bob Johnson once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no mean accomplishment in those days , but being short he had to take eight instead of seven steps between hurdles . He was one of Carleton 's highest ranking pre-med students , but the program forgot to mention that .

( This was back in the days before all-weather tracks , remember . ) Then his stride faltered as he realized he had miscalculated his steps . Bobby 's takeoff leg hit a good foot from the board and he only half-stepped , half-leaped into the pit .

" 1 caught you in 1:58 , " shouted a familiar voice from the stands . It was Frank McBride , a 4:14 miler from South Dakota State , not eligible for the NCAA because of being in his fourth year of competition . I knew he was wrong . I had run a 55-second first quarter , but had faded badly . Judging from my distance behind as I staggered across the line I knew I must have run 2:08 . He simply had misread his 10-second sweep stopwatch . Not wishing to disillusion him , I did n't correct the error . <p> Bobby Johnson was painlessly eliminated in the 100 meter heats in which Jim Golliday had the fastest time of 10.4 seconds . Then we settled down to watch the only final race of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only distance event I had n't entered . I sadly noted that only seven runners started the race and one of those dropped out after a mile and a half . The sixth place medal went to a runner from the University of Michigan who practically walked across the line in a time even I could have matched . " I guess I 'm in the wrong event , " I sadly noted . <p> " I guess we 're in the wrong meet , " corrected Bobby Johnson . <p> I was the only one of our triumvirate to make the finals on Saturday , and then only because they did n't run trials in the steeplechase . Bob and Bruce had tied for 17th in the broad jump with identical leaps of 20 feet , 6 5/8 inches . They had n't finished last , however . That honor went to an athlete from Fresno State , who at least had n't come from halfway across the nation to do it . Buzz Taylor narrowly lost to George Brown of U.C.L.A. , but then Brown had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buzz might make the Olympic team and we inwardly rejoiced at having met him . In the 100 meters Jim Golliday burst out of the starting blocks as though hit by a lightning bolt . In fifth place , far behind Golliday 's winning 10.4 , was a then little known runner named Lindy Remigino , who almost had been eliminated in the heats . <h> Casual Action <p> The starter called us to the line for the 3,000 meter steeplechase . I tried to appear casual , not realizing at the time that half the other runners had never run the race before either . At the first water jump I encountered a steeplechase tradition . All of the photographers and curiosity seekers crowded around the water jump , presumably in hopes that someone would trip on the barrier and drown , Laughter rippled through the crowd as we splashed through the water on the first lap . " Hey , did you bring your water wings ? " some jokester yelled . I vowed that even if I finished far arrears I would at least maintain my dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth place . I missed qualifying for the Olympic trials by only four seconds . This at least was a small victory . The winner was Bob McMullen of San Jose State . I read later in the papers that he had constructed his own water barrier to practice for the event . Maybe if I had done the same , I rationalized , I could at least have made the trials . An hour later , I ran in the 5,000 meters and finished last . My name was ranked in front of the defending NCAA champion Don McEwan , who had n't finished . <p> Normally you would figure that few people would have paid much notice to our little three-man track team . Logic at that time told me that the fans in the stands cared only for the winner ( which in the 5,000 was Wes Santee ) rather than for the stragglers . Such , I learned , is not so . Everyone loves a winner , but everyone also loves a loser-provided he is a real loser . A decade later the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finisher in a long distance race receives considerable attention . Because he finishes far behind , looking alone and quite helpless , it is easy to identify with him . The fan in the stands can believe himself superior ( as I had while watching the last 10,000 finisher ) . That 's the way it was with the Mets . Most New York fans figured they could play baseball at least as well as Marvelous Marv Thronesberry . Thus they cheer the classy loser vigorously , not realizing that perhaps he had no business in the race in the first place . <p> Many fans and athletes who were at Berkeley in 1952 probably still remember the three boys from Carleton who were n't in every event , but only seemed to be . Many years later I competed on club teams with Golliday and Wheeler , and got to know both of them quite well . Ted still remembered us . " Every time I looked up , " he said , " there was one of you cats in the yellow shirts finishing last . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid awake nights wondering if that itch on their left calf ( actually a mosquito bite ) was the start of a muscle pull , we took off for Yosemite National Park . The weather was hot and the radiator of Bruce 's Mercury was no match for the steep roads leading into the park . The engine knocked , wheezed , coughed , and as the radiator erupted , we chugged to a halt halfway up a hill . " That 's the way I felt in the 5,000 meters , " I said . <h> Cool Breezes <p> At Santa Barbara a few days later we encountered cool ocean breezes and John Hass , a local attorney and brother of our coach . John , like Wally , had been an athletic hero at the University of Minnesota several dozen years before . He ran the 100 yard dash in 9.6 seconds back when that time was nearly world class . " I suppose you fellows would like to work out , " he said knowledgeably . <p> " All right , " we answered . Actually we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck . The track was near the beach . When we finally arrived at the track , we found it already inhabited by two other people with the unlikely sounding names of Nick Carter and Otey Scruggs . Nick Carter , far from being a detective , worked as a track coach . Otey Scruggs was a Harvard graduate student with Olympic aspirations in the decathlon . <p> " What 's your best time for 100 meters ? " queried Coach Carter when he discovered Bobby Johnson 's sprinter status . When Bobby gave a time over eleven seconds , I thought we might get kicked off the track , but Carter seemed overjoyed . As it turned out , Scruggs was n't brilliant in any one decathlon event , but he was passably good in all ten . " If you were any faster , Otey could n't stay with you , " admitted Carter . <p> The next day Carter planned to have Otey Scruggs run through the first five decathlon events . Several high schoolers appeared as officials . Four dashmen-Bobby , Bruce , Otey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of the straightaway Nick Carter stood , stopwatch in hand , looking quite pleased and waving for the starter to fire the gun . At its report I dug out of my blocks pumping my shoulders and driving with my knees , my picture of how a successful sprinter should look . I finished as far behind Bobby Johnson as he had finished behind Jim Golliday the weekend before , but Bobby managed to hold off Otey , recording a wind-assisted time of 11.1 seconds . It was the only victory of our tour . <p> This did n't seem to discourage the local journalists , however , who had been alerted to our presence by John Hass . A reporter from the Santa Barbara News-Press stopped by to see us one day during our brief stay in town . He looked as though he would have been more comfortable covering the Los Angeles Dodgers , if the Los Angeles Dodgers back at that time had n't been the Brooklyn Dodgers . " What have you been doing since you arrived in town ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Mission , " Bobby said . <p> " Then we toured the local lemon factory , " Bruce added . <p> " How are your chances for making the Olympic team ? " asked the reporter . <p> Suddenly we ran out of smart answers . <p> " The headlines today and tomorrow , " the reporter later wrote , " will go to such stars as Wes Santee , George Rhoden , Andy Stanfield , et al. , but there will be at least three athletes running for the pure love of the sport . Which is what the whole thing is supposed to be about anyway . " <h> Handicapping the Field <p> The National AAU meet was being held that year near Los Angeles on a track belonging to Long Beach City College . Driving down from Santa Barbara on Friday morning , we checked in at a motel near the track ( and also near the beach ) . I was entered that night in the 10,000 meters . As is often the case at national championships , one of the local sportswriters handicapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> According to his prognosis sheet , Curt Stone had " eyed this night for four years . " Horace Ashenfelter was " ready to stretch out from 5,000 . " Browning Ross was a " router who could surprise . " My name did n't rate mention otherwise the comment might have been : " Even Eddie Arcaro could n't bring him home in front . " <p> One of the disadvantages of being a contestant is , if you are interested in your own performance , you never get to see other races . I was resting in the dressing room during the semifinal heats in the 100 meter dash . I heard the starter 's gun , then the roar of the crowd building to a crescendo before dying . A few minutes later a group of coaches , officials , and reporters burst into the dressing room . One of the coaches supported a muscled black athlete , his face contorted in agony . " What 's wrong ? " I asked . <p> " Golliday pulled a muscle , " answered an official . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , already had qualified for the Olympic trials the following weekend-if he could run in them . That evening Lindy Remigino of Manhattan failed even to qualify for the AAU finals . <p> Unlike at Berkeley , where barely a half dozen starters appeared , some 40 or 50 runners stood milling around the starting line for the AAU 10,000 . Of course , it was the qualifying event for the Olympic team . The top three finishers would go to the Olympic Games later that summer in Helsinki , Finland . But even so , the longer races always seem more popular with out-of-college athletes . Presumably once a man receives his B.A. degree , he is intelligent enough to realize that if he ca n't run faster than his opponent , maybe he can at least run farther than him . <p> " Only 15 runners will be permitted to finish , " the starter informed us . " As soon as you are lapped you must drop out until 15 are left on the track . Those who survive may continue after being- lapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized the word " survive ' ' I also decided that under those ground rules there was no sense in pacing myself . I would run as hard as I could to try to hold onto that last finishing position . <p> Everyone else apparently entertained the same idea . The gun sounded and a jumble of runners collided in the mad dash for 15th place . I found myself locked somewhere near the middle of the pack , but after a few turns the runners began to stretch out in a long , thin line of colored shirts . <p> " Get moving , " Bruce hollered at me . " You 're in 24th place ! " <p> At two miles I heard one of the officials counting : " Ten-oh-three ... ten-oh-four ... ten-oh-five . ... " I was running within seconds of my best-ever time for that distance . In 19th place now , I was still fighting for survival . Others , however , apparently had used equal imprudence in pacing themselves . One by one the runners in front of me began to stagger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere after the third mile . Within half a lap the trio of Curt Stone , Fred Wilt , and Horace Ashenfelter swept past me on their way to Helsinki . <h> Backstretch Battle <p> Having now earned my right to finish , I began to greedily eye 14th place , then occupied by a stocky runner wearing the royal blue shirt of the Los Angeles Athletic Club . I plotted my move carefully . Following him closely for several laps , I waited until we came into the straightaway during the fourth mile , then unleashed a blazing kick , hoping to suck from him the will to go on . The crowd cheered . I clutched my narrow lead around the turn only to see him come past me in the back stretch . <p> Again the crowd responded with a roar . Once more I passed him on the home stretch . And he passed me on the back stretch . Each move on our part was accompanied by applause from the spectators . " Go get him Higdon ! " shouted someone on my home stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Two factions soon developed among the spectators : the crowd on one side of the field cheered for me , while the other side rooted for him . At least , so it seemed . If an alert vender had come prepared , he could have sold at least two dozen pennants with my name on them . For more than a mile we operated like yo-yos , sprinting the straightaways and jogging the turns , until finally in front of my partisan group I failed to respond to the challenge . As I slowly lost ground my crowd gave an audible sigh of disappointment and returned to the struggle for first place-or went out for hot dogs . Curt Stone crossed the finish line in first to a wave of applause . I crossed last to an equally enthusiastic hand . The crowd only cheers the winners and the losers . I wondered if I would ever be good enough some day to slip into the relative anonymity of the middle ground . <p> The following day I ran the 3,000 meter steeplechase again . Warming up near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I encountered another entrant who was wearing a bathing suit instead of normal track shorts . " They should restrict the entries , " I snorted to a third runner . <h> Road to Helsinki <p> Bob McMullen won the AAU race as he had the NCAA . " A triumph for hard work and dedication , " trumpeted the papers . Tired from my previous night 's exertions , I failed to approach my NCAA time . Thus imagine my surprise the next morning when I picked up a copy of the Sunday Los Angeles Examiner . The sports section featured a full page of AAU meet pictures under the title : " Road to Helsinki . " There , surrounded by Wes Santee , Walt Davis , and hop-step-jumper Walter Ashbaugh , was Hal Higdon of Carleton College striding purposefully out of the water jump , looking as though the Russians had better beware . The runner behind me had fallen on his nose in the water , and the photographic buzzards who hover around water jumps had gotten what they wanted . <p> " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . <p> " What 's that ? " asked Bruce . <p> " Make sure the runner behind you trips . " <p> It was our last race of the season , since none of us had managed to qualify for the Olympic trials the following weekend . " Let 's go out and really bust loose from training , " I announced . That night we visited Knott 's Berry Farm and the three of us devoured an entire boysenberry pie single-handed . <p> The following weekend , three small pond athletes paid their way into the Los Angeles Coliseum along with several thousand other track fans . " Gee , " Bruce said , " at least you can see the races better from up here . " We sat mesmerized for two days while the American Olympic team was picked in a series of races that brought both heartbreak and joy . In the semifinals of the 100 meters , Jim Golliday pulled up lame in his first stride out of the blocks . He did n't quit , though . Instead he limped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took more courage than it had taken me to finish 10,000 meters , but it was one of the most pathetic sights in track I 've ever witnessed . Later another injury kept Jim off the 1956 Olympic team , too . With luck he could have earned three or four Olympic gold medals . Eventually he would suffer several nervous breakdowns . Lindy Remigino , hopelessly outclassed the previous two weekends , spriest even himself by qualifying for the team in second place . Then he surprised everyone even more in Helsinki by winning the Olympic 100 meters championships . <p> In the steeplechase , the Ashenfelter brothers , Bill and Horace , led all the way , trailed closely by Bob McMullen . They sprinted away from the San Jose runner on the last straightaway . McMullen lost third and his trip to Helsinki to Browning Ross . Otey Scruggs , a week later , placed fifth in the decathlon trials won by Bob Mathias . Wes Santee made the Olympic team at 5,000 meters , but his best event was the mile . Before the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money under the table . <p> In the broad jump , Buzz Taylor soared far in the air on an early jump to land solidly in second place . Then on the sixth and final round , two others outjumped him . He was fourth by two inches . We were n't the only also-rans . " Now what , Buzz ? " we overheard someone ask him . <p> " I guess I 'll go out and get drunk , " he replied . <p> Then the last event ended : all of the athletes , some in street clothes , some still in sweats , paraded into the center of the huge arena . Behind them flapped a row of flags representing the countries they would compete against in Helsinki . Somebody recited something appropriate into the public address system , then dozens of pigeons exploded into the air , gathered in formation , circled once , twice , and finally came to roost at the scoreboard end of the stadium where the Olympic torch that had once lit the 1932 Games was now aflame . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college meet for small pond athletes . In order to compete in the National AAU championships , an athlete must qualify by having attained standards which would have set records back in 1952 .

The following article answers some of the questions runners commonly ask about protein in a sports diet . The information was presented by prominent protein researchers at the American College of Sports Medicines Annual Convention ( May , 2012 ) . The session was sponsored by P.I.N.E.S , a global network of Professionals In Nutrition for Exercise &amp; Sport ( www.PINESNutrition.org ) . <h> Do some athletes need more protein than others ? <h> Just as children have high protein needs during growth periods ( 0.6 g Pro/lb ; 1.3 g pro/kg ) , athletes also have requirements higher than the RDA ( 0.4 g pro/lb ; 0.8 g pro/kg ) when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance athletes ( such as runners ) and 0.75 g/lb ( 1.7 g/kg ) for strength athletes . These protein recommendations assume the athlete is consuming adequate energy from carbohydrate and fat . Runners who restrict their food intake end up using some protein for fuel , thus they need a higher protein intake . In general , most athletes consume 0.7 g Pro/lb ( 1.6 g/kg/day ) , so they easily meet the protein recommendationswithout supplements . <h> The biggest way to stimulate muscular growth is to lift weights or do other forms of resistance exercise . To support muscular development after hard lifting , runners need to consume high quality protein ( with all the essential amino acids ) in close proximity to their training . High quality proteins include milk products , poultry , eggs , fish , lean beef , all meats , and soy protein . <h> How should I spread my protein intake over the day ? Is it better to have a large steak for dinner or smaller protein doses every few hours ? <h> Many runners eat very little protein for breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Current research suggests the trick to optimizing muscular development is to spread the protein intake evenly throughout the day . For example , if you were having a carbohydrate-based breakfast ( such as oatmeal or a bagel ) and a salad for lunch , you would be wise to include more protein in those meals . The goal is to consume at least 20 grams of protein every 3 to 4 hours . For example , a 150 lb ( 68 kg ) runner who chooses at least 20 grams of protein per meal and snack will easily consume the recommended 82+ grams of high quality protein : 3 eggs for breakfast ( 21 g protein ) ; 2 cheese sticks for a morning snack ( 14 g pro ) ; 4 oz. deli meat in a lunchtime sandwich ( 28 g pro ) ; an afternoon snack with 6 oz . Greek yogurt ( 18 ) ; a medium ( 5 oz ) . chicken breast for dinner ( 35 g pro ) ; and 4 oz. cottage cheese ( 12 g pro ) before bed easily does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Different types of proteins are comprised of differing amounts of essential amino acids ( EAA ) and have different rates of digestion . For example , whey is more rapidly absorbed than casein . Soy protein contains fewer EAA 's than whey or casein . The EAA leucine is a key " trigger " for building muscle , so leucine-rich foods with rapid digestive properties are best for recovery from resistance exercise . Animal proteinsincluding plain or chocolate milk , lean beef , and tunaare leucine-rich . Plant proteins contain leucine , but in lower amounts . <h> Because casein is slowly absorbed , consuming casein-rich foods before bedtime ( such as cottage cheese ) can help support muscle-building processes throughout the night . This may be particularly important for athletes seeking to maximize muscular growth during building seasons , such as during a pre-season training program . <h> Do other nutrients consumed at the same time as protein affect muscle recovery ? <h> Yes . You want to enjoy carbohydrates in combination with protein . Carbs are important to refuel muscles , while protein 's job is to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low fat or whole chocolate milk vs. fat free chocolate milk , also seems to increase protein uptake . Researchers are unsure why a little fat enhances protein uptake , so stay tuned ! <h> Studies suggest no improvement in either endurance or speed ( time trial performance ) . The benefits of having protein in a sports drink relate more to recovery . Protein contributes to slightly higher muscle protein synthesis and glycogen replenishment . <h> Should I eat protein before exercise to promote post-exercise recovery ? <h> Wont hurt , but may not help . Eating 20 grams of protein 45 minutes before exercise increases amino acid uptake by the muscles to an equal extent as eating protein immediately after exercise . Take note : 20 grams of protein per recovery-dose is plenty . Runners who consume higher amounts of protein either burn it for fuel or store it as fat . <h> When runners lose weight , they also lose muscle . Is there a way to prevent that loss ? <h> About 25 to 30 percent of weight loss relates to muscle loss . To abate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) create just a small calorie deficit ( as opposed to starving themselves with a crash diet ) , 2 ) consistently choose protein-rich meals and snacks , and 3 ) include resistance exercise twice weekly in their training . <h> Vegan runners can successfully meet their protein needs by eating a variety of plant foods . Most grains ( wheat , rice , quinoa , corn , barley , rye ) contain all 9 essential amino acids , just in lower amounts than an equivalent serving of animal foods . Hence , vegans need to consume generous portions of plant protein to compensate for both the lower density of the protein as well as the fact that plant proteins are less bioavailable ( due to their fiber content ) . <h> The wisest way for a vegetarian to optimize protein intake is to consume adequate food . If the vegan is undereating , the energy deficit will easily lead to a muscle loss . Vegans who want to lose fat ( not muscsle ) will want to focus their limited food intake on protein-rich plant foods .

Looking historically at Boston , each of the years , seven told , when Clarence DeMar secured a victory remains memorable . Similarly 1936 , the year when Tarzan Brown broke John A. Kelleys heart on the fourth of the Newton hills , when Heartbreak Hill earned its name , possesses a gravitas above many marathons before and many marathons after . <p> Then in the 1960s , as change was sweeping the country , Boston changed too : 197 entered in 1960 ; 1,342 in 1969 . The focus , subtly shifted from those up front to those midpack . Roberta Gibb in 1966 and Kathrine Switzer in 1967 seized their space on the course when they had no right to be on itat least by the archaic rules of the era . Yes , at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade with four wins . Yes , at the beginning of the 1980s , the classic duel between Alberto Salazar and Dick Beardsley arguably became Bostons most dramatic race . But the years 1983 and 1985 also marked the beginning of The Embarrassment . Those years became reference points for failure : the last years an American man ( Greg Meyer ) or American woman ( Lisa Larsen-Weidenbach ) could claim victory . Who could ignore the fact that the Africans and Eastern Europeans were best in the world , but could n't now and then someone finish in front who could wrap himself in an American flag ? For stories , reporters found themselves increasingly looking behind the winners , behind even the midpack to the back of Bostons pack . It did n't  matter whether you finished in two hours or three hours or four hours or five hours or even longer : " Tell us why running this iconic event means so much to you and all of your friends back home tracking you on the Internet ? " That was the question as the 1980s merged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least some solace for lovers of the Boston Marathon . The historic race had to be special , and it was . The B.A.A. widened its arms and added a lottery . Those without qualifying times and those raising money for charity were made welcome . They could secure their space on the starting grid behind if not beside the worlds best runners . The record number of entrants before then had been 9,629 in 1992 , a number that seems almost paltry now , the B.A.A. for so long a time comfortable with a four-figure limit to its field . But for the 100th running , the B.A.A. accepted 38,708 entrants with 35,868 of them finishing , more than any other marathon at that time . How could anything be better than that ? <p> And how could anything be worse than what happened in 2013 ? <p> We knew we would do better in 2014 . We had to do better . The running world expected no less of us . And in those final weeks in April , when all those who had trained hard through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entered the tapering phase of their training and packed shorts and singlet and shoes ( carried in separate carry-on bags ) and boarded planes headed for Logan and checked into hotels filled with our own kind and picked up bibs at an Expo that lasted three marvelous days and wandered the streets and sidewalks already divided by barricades determining where you could go and where you could not go and ate pasta meals as much ritualistic as for loading muscles with glycogen and slept nervously eyes open and focused on the ceiling and dressed and boarded yellow school buses headed to Hopkinton returning through eight separate communities to those last 385 yards on Boylston Street , we finally had one more Boston Marathon that we could look back on with pride , not shame . Topping the list of glories in Boston 2014 , one of our heroes finallythat word needs to be repeated again , finallywrapped himself in an American flag and bowed his head to have a laurel wreath signifying victory placed atop it . Meb ! Shout the name for all to hear ! Meb owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them too , because Meb shared them with us . He had reclaimed for every runner around the world those sacred yards on Boylston Street , those holy yards , no longer profane , no longer marred by some innocents blood . <p> Boston strong ! The streets reverberated to the shouts of the runners and the shouts of the spectators cheering the runners , as it always was and always will be . <p> Boston 2014 boasted 31,931 finishers , almost as many women ( 14,356 ) as men ( 17,575 ) , Bostons biggest field with the exception of the 100th running in 1996 . And each of those who came to Boston this past April had a story to tell : <p> Ryan Kershaw , 33 , of Calgary , Alberta , decided to run 2014 after watching the bombs go off on TV in 2013 . " Not my fastest marathon , not my best marathon , " he would say afterwards , " but by far the most rewarding .

Turning onto Bolyston , I felt tears well up in my eyes , I felt chills crawl up my arms , then I felt a smile creep across my face . This was a new race . I had a new PR , I had closure , I had Boston . <p> Caitlin Stokes , 28 , of Groveland , Massachusetts last year found herself caught between the explosions . This year , she ran the marathon despite hip pain that surfaced at 15 miles . She says : " The day was not about the physical pain . It was about never being alone on the course . After I turned left on Boylston and looked directly at the spot where I had been standing in 2013 , Boylston was finally mine again . " <p> This was a daya very special day--when people all over the world shifted their attention away from the NBA and the NFL and NASCAR to focus on an event that had taken on an importance beyond that normally present on a Patriots Day in New England . Marathon finishes almost always provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could this not be so ? You have trained for months for this special moment . You have anticipated for all those same months that moment when after 26 miles of running , you finally reach the point where , Citgo sign in your rear view mirror , you can look ahead and see the overhead clock above the finish line ratcheting numbers , each click adding to your time on that day , making your time slower , but also bringing you closer to that glorious instant when you step across a yellow line painted on the street and raise your arms in victory , or try to raise your arms , or at least think about raising those arms . <p> Last year , 5,633 runners were deprived that priceless moment . <p> In the immediate aftermath of Boston 2013 , while the attention of the world remained riveted on Boylston Street , while Anderson Cooper wearing a black T-shirt and jacket was anchoring his nightly show from as near to the site of the twin explosions as the Police would allow , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a target for terrorists : " It is not quite an iconic event , " opined the Talking Head .

Interestingly , a large number of responders defending Bostons iconic credentials came from outside the United States : Scotland , Germany , Australia , South Africa , Poland . Many of us who stir to the Star Spangled Banner often do not offer Boston its full respect , do not realize its worldwide impact .

How could it not be . <p> There was a lot of talk after 2013 and before 2014 about " taking back the streets .

At that time , the marathon had been moved to October seeking cooler weather . In recent years , the marathon has been returned to its original Labor Day date , hot weather be damned ! Hal Higdon ran Heart of America this year as the third of seven marathons in his 7-7-70 Quest , raising funds for the American Heart Association . <p> On Labor Day , 1968 , my wife and I , accompanied by our three children , stopped in Columbia , Missouri at the Daniel Boone Hotel . We were en route home to Indiana after a month-long trip west , during which I had competed in the Olympic marathon trials in Alamosa , Colorado . Up with the leaders at ten miles , I had quit at 20 from a combination of heat , altitude , and insufficient training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hiked the Grand Canyon , explored Carlsbad Caverns , and gone floatboat fishing in Arkansas . Finally , we stopped in Columbia , more as an afterthought on the final leg of our journey , so I could run the Heart of America Marathon . <p> Heart of America , one of only five marathons held in the United States that year long before the running boom , was unusual because of its early starting time . Boston began at high noon . The National A.A.U. marathon in Yonkers , New York also went mid-day . But Heart of America started before dawn , 6:00 a.m. , to compensate for its inevitably hot and humid weather . <p> Years later , I relished retelling the story of how I began slowly , permitting many of the 42 other entrants to rush ahead into darkness . Several miles into the race , I began a gradual acceleration and started to pass people . Soon , the pre-dawn sky turned gray , then gold . I looked ahead and counted six or eight runners strung out before me over the winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began reeling them in until , just before halfway , I passed the last one , hesitating a moment because I did n't want to run the final 13 miles alone in first . <p> At that point I passed a race official , who told me , " You 're in seventh place ! " <p> In the dark , a half dozen runners had gotten so far ahead that by the time the sun rose they were out of my sight . Nevertheless , I caught them , passing the actual leader , Carl Owczarzak of Kansas City , at 24 miles . Otherwise I would n't have returned to Columbia this fall for the 25th running of the Heart of America Marathon . <p> For the race 's silver anniversary , Columbia Track Club president Joe Duncan had invited all past champions back . These included Joe Schroeder , winner of the first race in 1960 in 3:57:00 , and Dennis Hinkamp , holder of the course record , 2:29:15 in 1977 . My winning time had been 2:41:45 , 20 minutes slower than my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimpressive , consider that Heart of America contains five brutal , major hills , not to mention numerous other inclines to nibble at leg strength . Add to that four miles of gravel which , depending upon weather conditions , causes runners either to choke with dust or sink in mud . " It 's a race with character , " says Joe Duncan . <p> The course also crosses a railroad track where , one year , after the first three runners passed , a slow freight train crossed , forcing the next ten runners to wait up to four minutes . The race seemed designed by the devil to discourage the undisciplined . Several years ago , local doctors convinced the Columbia Track Club to move its marathon into mid-October to ameliorate the dangers of heat and humidity . Joe Duncan agreed to the change hesitatingly : " I hate to turn this into a race for the faint-hearted . " <p> Little wonder the running boom bypassed Columbia , Missouri . While 18,000 runners from all over the world flocked to the 1984 New York City Marathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose Heart of America , most from the immediate environs . While Steve Jones , winner of the Chicago Marathon earned nearly $100,000 , the winner in Columbia would take home only a plastic trophy and a smattering of applause . There would be no balloons , no helicopters , no bands , no TV cameras , no aluminum blankets at the finish line ; it 's just a down-home country race . <p> That 's what attracted me back to Heart of America , since I was suffering what might be called either marathon malaise or runner 's low . Having run Boston a dozen times , Honolulu a half dozen , New York , Grandma 's , marathons in Europe , Africa , and Down Under , I had no burning ambition to run any more races of 26 miles 385 yards . In fact , I was tired of the whole racing scene and runners in general . My malaise peaked last summer when I attended Jim Fixx 's funeral and noticed a dozen people I knew dressed in coat and tie-and running flats . Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who would wear purple nylon shoes to a funeral ? <p> Maybe a trip back to running 's grass roots would revive my desire . Flying into Columbia late on a Saturday morning , my wife Rose and I were greeted by Joe Duncan . Rose squeezed into the back seat of Joe 's car , already jammed with course markers and water containers . Joe had first run in the marathon in 1966 ( " on two-and-a-half weeks training " ) , but after 1975 had confined himself to organizing the event for the sponsoring Columbia Track Club . " This year I told the club to get another race director , " said Joe . " I 'm running . " He was aiming for a time under 3:20 . <p> My plan , I told Joe , was to run only 13 miles , " just to see part of the course again , " then drop out . Joe said I should have no trouble obtaining a ride back to the finish . <p> I had hoped to pace Alex Ratelle , a 60-year-old Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marathons , winning masters titles in each . Alas , when I saw Alex later that afternoon , he confessed to having entered the 8-kilometer event to be held concurrently with the marathon . The 8K had attracted over 300 entrants , but held little appeal for me . <h> Boxer 's rebellion <p> That evening we attended the pre-race banquet , spaghetti the main course , as it is at every race in America . I do n't recall what I ate in 1968 , probably steak . Runners in that era had not yet realized that complex carbohydrates offered a nutritional boost to endurance activities . After dinner , Heart of America founder Bill Clark , currently a scout for the Cincinnati Reds , described the race 's beginning in 1960 as a challenge between the town 's runners and a group of boxers who did regular road work . To see who was better , they decided to race from Columbia to Fulton , Missouri . <p> Race morning , however , no boxers showed . " I went around banging on doors , " said Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . " <p> Only six runners appeared , one of them Joe Schroeder , a cross-country runner from the University of Missouri , who had never raced longer than four miles , and whose longest training run that summer had been six . <p> Schroeder did n't even own running flats , so he taped over the spikes of his track shoes for the paved start on Columbia 's main street . Once outside the city , he removed the tape and shifted to the dirt shoulder . Schroeder ran with Morris " Red Dog " Patterson , a teammate from Missouri . They ran their first half dozen miles at faster than 6:00 pace , but soon were reduced to a slow , survival stride . If one stopped for water or had to walk , the other would wait . Eventually , Schroeder crossed the finish line 20 minutes ahead of Patterson . Nobody else finished the distance . <p> " I had alerted the Associated Press about our marathon , " recalled Clark , " so I called and gave them the names of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the course . ' " <p> Within a few years , Heart of America began attracting talented runners . There were so few places to compete in this pre-boom era . Among the list of early winners , Bill Silverberg , Barry Rose , and Tom Hoffman were all nationally prominent . Ron Daws , a 1968 Olympic marathoner , won twice . Recent victors included Tony Rodiez and Steve Fisher , both qualifiers for the 1984 Olympic trials . Although my winning time from 1968 of 2:41:45 seems puny by today 's standards , it would have been good enough to win all but two of the first 15 races . All the times since 1975 have been faster , but that year the organizers modified the course to remove one hill and shifted the race date into cooler October . <p> Enough hills remained , however , to allow Clark and Duncan to boast that their race was tougher the toughest non-mountain marathon in America . One year ultramarathoner Aldo Scandurra from New York appeared , planning to run the course not once , but twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations open . " explained Duncan . " Aldo was going to complete the regular race , then turn around , and run the course in reverse . " <p> As Scandurra crossed the finish line , Joe began to direct him back onto the course , but the ultramarathoner groaned and held up his hands : " Once is enough ! " " <h> " I 'm never coming back " <p> That 's undoubtedly one reason Heart of America , despite its longevity , has never attracted many competitors . People run it once and give up . The race 's biggest entry came in 1978 when 209 started , 178 finished . Bill Clark insists that after my 1968 victory , I had sat on the curb near the finish line , chugging one soft drink after another , and groaning , " This course is too tough . I 'm never coming back . " <p> " I never would have said that , " I pleaded to Clark . <p> " You did ! " <p> " But I am back . " <p> Nagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back only to run half the distance and at a pace designed to cause minimal distress . <p> When I arrived at the starting line a half hour early on Sunday morning , the street seemed so deserted I worried that I had come to the wrong place . Soon , however , people began to emerge from doorways and parked cars , and when the gun fired we all started running . With Heart of America now in mid-October , the starting time had been moved up an hour to 7:00 . The sky was gray , only beginning to turn light in the east . <p> I settled into an easy , middle-of-the-field pace . Near me was Joe Schroeder , Heart of America 's first winner . At the pre-race banquet , Schroeder said that he had hoped to lose 100 pounds to get in shape to run the 25th anniversary marathon . Only losing 40 , he decided to wait until next year . Schroeder began the race with us , stopping at two miles . <p> That far into the race , we passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin the 8K event scheduled for 7:30 . They cheered as we passed . We turned on Providence Road , at this point a four-lane highway . Leaving town , we encountered our first hill , a long descent , followed by an equally long ascent just past three miles . It offered merely a taste of what would come . <p> The road soon narrowed to two lanes , becoming Route K , which we had to share with the few motorists who were up that early on a Sunday morning . In most major running events today , police block traffic from race routes , sometimes raising the ire of non-running motorists , who can become peeved at having to cool their wheels as runners pass . A freight train would clear an intersection quicker than runners do at the tail end of a marathon . <p> I had my own police escort , however . Striking up a conversation with another runner , I learned he was a Missouri state trooper . " If we come to any busy corners , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uniform , " he replied . " But where we 're heading , you 'll see more cows than cars . " <p> The trooper asked how fast I expected to run . I admitted that , being undertrained , I planned to drop out around 14 miles . <p> " At the bottom of Easley Hill , eh ? " he said , knowingly . <p> " Well , maybe I 'll stop at the top . " <h> A race , not a party <p> As often happens in a marathon , the state trooper and I drifted apart . Approaching nine miles , just before a turn from Route K onto Old Plank Road , I found myself catching a woman , her hair in a pigtail . A man ran with her . Suddenly , the pigtailed woman began swearing angrily . " Where 's the ( bleeping ) water ? " she screamed . We had passed our last water station back around six miles and would n't encounter another until around 12 . Several volunteers stood ahead , ready to direct us through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul language as we passed . <p> Well , maybe there was insufficient water on the course , compared to the Big City marathons that , every mile or two , offer multi-choices of liquids , from water to ERG to de-fizzed Coke . In 1968 , I solved the water problem by having my wife travel the route by car . She , or one of our three children , passed me water bottles every two miles . Even with Heart of America 's small field , having a " second " is -probably impractical today , but it irritated me that the woman would use such language to abuse volunteers . <p> " Quit complaining , " I grumbled at her in passing . " This is a race , not a party . " I accelerated so as not to have to run in her company . <p> This proved to be a mistake , because it suddenly felt more comfortable running at a 7:00 pace than the 7:30 pace which I had maintained until then . Although theoretically you waste more energy running faster , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run at what for you is an artificially slow pace . Or so I rationalized , figuring I was only going halfway and could quit anywhere if I got tired . <p> With the pigtailed woman behind me , I began to enjoy the race more . I was now on one of the prettiest parts of the course , which moved from Old Plank to Smith Feed Mill Road . How can you not enjoy running on roads so named ? I forgot I was in a race and swiveled my head constantly to gaze over a broad panorama of rolling woods and farmland . Some fields were green , others freshly plowed following the harvest . The trees had just begun to turn , mostly green but speckles of red and yellow . I passed chicken farms and pig farms , malodorous but somehow inoffensive . The paved road ended , becoming gravel . I found myself running in company with several other runners , each of us weaving back and forth , trying to pick narrow lanes in the road where passing cars had shoved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to me that in 1968 we encountered more gravel , that it had begun as soon as we had turned off the main highway . I commented on this to another runner : " They must have paved some of this road . " <p> " Sure , and they bulldozed the tops off all the hills , " he countered . <p> " You noticed that too ? " Things were always tougher in the old days . <p> Passing one farm house , I encountered four dogs , two of them Dobermans , the runner 's public enemy number one . Years ago , when runners were scarce " we feared dogs more ; they had us outnumbered . Today 's dogs are more used to people running past their property . They also realize there 's not enough meat on a runner 's bones to make a good meal . They might as well take a bite out of a bicycle wheel . As a result , I have n't been bitten by a dog in more than a dozen years . Running past these dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give me a real feeling for running the way it used to be , but the dogs seemed more interested in frolicking with each other than menacing us . <p> Rounding a turn , I saw the Missouri River ahead through the trees . The road began to descend into the river valley . Parallel to the river was a single set of railroad tracks . As I crossed them , I thought I heard a rumbling in the distance . Sure enough , a freight train approached , three diesel engines tugging a long string of cars . Checking my watch , I monitored its passage : two minutes forty seconds . Allowing for the fact that I was running with the train , I figured it delayed those behind me by two minutes , opening a gap between me and anyone who might dare to catch me , including the pigtailed woman . I cackled gleefully at the thought of her screaming obscenities at the passing train . <p> It reminded me of what happened years ago to Kurt Steiner , now an official with the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , Kurt had come to a bridge just as it swung open to halt him . Kurt began to shout at the bridge tender , saying he should have delayed the bridge 's opening . <p> The bridge tender looked down from his tower at Steiner and said , " You should have run faster . " <p> The road in the low land near the river was wet . I dodged around most puddles , but ahead was one mammoth puddle entirely blocking the road . To avoid muddying my white racing shoes , I detoured into a farm field , but sank almost to my ankles . I emerged on the other side of the puddle , my shoes covered with mud . I laughed again . This was the way running was supposed to be . <h> Designed by the devil <p> The race seemed designed by the devil to discourage the undisciplined . Little wonder the running boom bypassed Columbia , Missouri . Several years ago I had included Easley in an article about the ten toughest hills in road racing . It gets its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a last-chance aid station . Within seven-tenths of a mile , the course climbs 246 feet . " Most runners go into what we call the Easley Hill Shuffle , " Joe Duncan had claimed , " somewhat , but not much , faster than a slow walk . " <p> Nevertheless , Easley is not the most difficult hill in an American road race . That honor probably goes to Pike 's Peak or Mount Washington , both of which have races ascending to their summits . Before the latter race one year , Jock Semple made the famous comment : " Easy race today , boys . Only one hill . " <p> I started upward , passing two runners halfway whose shuffle more than resembled a walk . At the top I looked around for someone with a car who might take me to the finish . In the last few miles at Boston along Commonwealth Avenue , you can board a street car . In New York , you can take the subway . In the country outside Columbia , my only option would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I finally admitted to myself what I had probably known all along . Underconditioned or not , I would finish . I could have walked away from a flat course . But to abandon Heart of America was to defile my running roots . I even picked up my pace , pushing down into the low-6:00 range . Several miles later , I rounded a corner . I could see the road ahead of me bend , then head straight up as though in an attempt to launch the marathoners into space . " All right , " I shouted . " Do it to us ! " <p> Fortunately nobody heard me , although there was a scattering of spectators : people who had positioned chairs on the front lawns of their farm houses to witness our rites of passage . Not like the throngs along First Avenue in New York , just occasional farm folk sitting in a lawn chair , glancing up from reading the Sunday paper in time to wave or offer a word of encouragement . <p> Reality had begun to set in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had shifted gears , picking up the pace , passing people , but nobody in front was near enough to offer a target . Nobody behind seemed capable of challenging for whatever place I held . I moved as though in a vacuum , muscles tightening , strength eroding . With five miles to go , I was back to the same slow pace at which I had started . Just like all marathons , I thought , the last miles are never easy . <p> Coming into the stadium , I crossed a rock-strewn parking lot , a final insult , and one that no longer provoked laughter . I ran the final lap around the track , through the chute , and headed for the refreshment table almost without breaking stride . I felt no sense of triumph , no feeling that I had accomplished anything great , not even much fatigue . I had simply spent several hours touring some of the countryside around Columbia , Missouri . <p> Later , after showering , I returned for the awards ceremony , where I accepted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America Marathon . " Of the 108 finishers , 100 would get such plaques . I have no idea what happened to the trophy I must have won for placing first in 1968. 1 rarely keep awards , usually recycling them in local races sponsored by our club . I still display the trophy I earned with a fifth-place finish in Boston , another for winning a national championship , but not much more . Yet somehow as I walked away from the awards table to the proper smattering of applause , I knew that this plaque from Heart of America was going up on my wall to remind me of what it 's like to run a down-home country race . 
@@102096337 @6296337/ <h> Training <h> Roger and Me <h> On the Trail of the One Hundred " Great Movies " 79545 @qwx939545 <p> Film critics almost universally acclaim Citizen Kane as one of the world 's greatest movies , most often the greatest . When top-ten and top-hundred lists appear , the Orson Welles movie from 1941 invariably ranks as number one . Everyone has their own favorite--or favorites . In my mind , Casablanca , released a year later , tops Kane . <p> But make up your own mind . Those two great films and ninety-eight others are re-reviewed in a recent book by film critic ( and Michiana resident ) Roger Ebert titled , The Great Movies . My sister-in-law Marion , herself a film buff , presented me with a copy for my birthday this summer . Ebert 's book offers individual essays on one hundred " great " films , and although he does not rank them in order of preference ( preferring an alphabetical distribution ) , I suspect Roger might line up with his fellow critics and put Citizen Kane in the top spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle than Humphrey Bogart , Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid ? Roger himself admits " no better cast of supporting actors could have been assembled on the Warner ( Brothers ) lot than Peter Lorre , Sydney Greenstreet , Claude Rains and Dooley Wilson . " The combination of love , action and humor in an exotic locale touches all the keys on the keyboard . And speaking of that keyboard : How can anyone who has seen Casablanca forget Wilson ( as Sam ) playing , " You must remember this , a kiss is still a kiss . " Young people whose grandparents saw the picture when it first appeared in theaters can quote all the best lines , including , " Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world , she ( Bergman ) walks into mine . " I vote Casablanca the best film of all time--although I might change my mind when I see Citizen Kane again in another year or so . <h> Viewing one hundred films <p> And that is what my wife Rose and I have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sides , we are viewing the one hundred films appearing in Roger Ebert 's book . Our early viewing has been mostly of videos borrowed from the Michigan City public library , including All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard . Others were borrowed from Rose 's sister 's collection , including The Apartment and Some Like It Hot . We found Chinatown recently on the shelf at East Coast Video in New Buffalo . On one occasion so far , we saw one of the films in a theater . The General , starring Buster Keaton , was featured at the Sounds of Silent Film Festival at the Vickers Theatre in Three Oaks , Michigan this summer . <p> Do we expect to agree with Roger ? We have n't entirely agreed so far . While Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour demonstrated why she was one of the world 's most beautiful women , Rose considered the film confusing . She also dissed The Big Sleep for the same reason . I probably would not include Nashville on my hundred-best list , and I felt My Darling Clementine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Sister-in-law Marion 's all-time favorites . And while Rose and I agree that Mr. Hulot 's Holiday is the funniest movie ever made , where was another of my all-time comic favorites , What 's Up Doc ? starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neil ? The Hustler . The Train . The Last Picture Show . Where are they , Roger ? Will Roger Ebert be offended that we fail to agree with all his choices ? I suspect not . He probably would be pleased that someone would take the effort not merely to read the one hundred essays in his book , but try to see each film . <p> That may be difficult , because the library has gaps in its collection . We 're moving through Roger 's list somewhat alphabetically , but I have not yet spotted The Apu Trilogy on the library shelves . ( After this article appeared in print , a film buff phoned to tell a video store that had it . ) Sometimes when I fail to find a film , it reappears later after another viewer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of videos in its collection . " It became too difficult to keep up with new films we acquired and old ones that disappeared , " one librarian explained to me . <h> Searching for Mr. Goodfilm <p> I have not yet begun to systematically scour the shelves of local video stores either in my regular home in Indiana or in Florida , our winter home . The Blockbuster store in Ponte Vedra Beach has a wide-ranging assortment , including many hard-to-find foreign films , but I notice their collection of DVD films has begun to outstrip that for VCR . We served notice on our family that acquiring a DVD player stands atop of our Christmas wish list . I 'm waiting for its installation , whether packaged in pretty paper and ribbons or not , before we watch several movies that earn their greatness for visual elements , most notably 2001 : A Space Odyssey and Lawrence of Arabia . <p> That raises an important point in our quest to see all one hundred of Roger Ebert 's Great Movies . The former is one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a wide-screen version of the latter at a Chicago theater a dozen years ago . I estimate that I 've seen close to three-fourths of the films in Roger 's book , some of them when I was still a teenager . But that does n't count . All of the films need to be seen again before we check them off our list . One has to have standards . <p> Two exceptions : Just before obtaining the book , I saw two of the hundred films . One was Apocalypse Now , the Francis Ford Coppola dissection of the Vietnam War , which he re-released recently in a " director 's cut " version retitled Apocalypse Now Redux . I felt Coppola merely made the movie longer , not better , and Roger has mixed emotions on the new footage too . Apocalypse Now <p> The other film recently viewed was Star Wars , John Lucas 's epic space series that strangely began with Part IV , followed by Parts V and VI , then back to the future for Parts I and II . When that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to watch all five existing parts in numerical order , not in the order they were released . The original Part IV from 1977 remains the most successful despite its more limited budget for special effects , while Part I makes no sense at all if you failed to see the films that both preceded and followed it . Although is there any regular filmgoer out there who has failed to see at least one Star Wars movie , even if only out of curiosity ? <p> ( The Michigan City public library also has in its video collection the twelve-part Buck Rogers serial starring Buster Crabbe that I first viewed back in the 1940s as a grade-school student . Watch the introduction to each serialized chapter roll , and it becomes obvious where Lucas got the idea for the rolling Star Wars introductions . ) <h> Obsessive behavior <p> If I seem obsessive in wanting to view every film designated as " Great " by Roger Ebert , that may simply be my personality . At various stages in my running career , I have run six marathons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marathons in seven months to celebrate my seventieth birthday . After writing a magazine article for Runner 's World on John Romita , Jr .

That introduced me to his work on Daredevil , so I acquired every issue of that comic book too . Each hunt occupied me several years . I have no idea what impulse pushed me to this collective excess , since I already have begun to consider offering both collections for sale on eBay . <p> In another example of bizarre behavior not entirely unrelated to my current film-viewing scheme , I participated in a 1996 study on sleep patterns at the University of Georgia . The study required that I go twenty-eight hours without sleep in a tiny room with only a bed and TV screen . I could watch videos , but not TV , since that would provide unwanted clues as to time of day . On a whim , I asked my colleague to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fred and Ginger made ten films together ; he found five . I can tell you unequivocally that the best is Top Hat , although Roger favors Swing Time . <p> I have no desire to possess video copies of the one hundred Great Films ; I want to collect them visually rather than actually . While viewing them , I have been jotting comments in the book 's margin , in effect reviewing Roger 's review . ( See sidebar : " Reviewing Roger Ebert " ) <h> Legendary rabble-rousing power <p> As I write this article , Rose and I have viewed twenty of the hundred , most recently Battleship Potemkin . This silent film from 1925 by Sergei Eisenstein possesses the distinction of having been banned at various times both in the United States and in the Soviet Union for its revolutionary message . ( Once Stalin was in power , he did n't always like the idea that regimes might be overthrown . ) The video available at the Michigan City library has a musical score by Dimitri Shostakovich , but neither the video box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music for a sound version of the film , or whether those re-releasing the film adapted the music from Shostakovich 's symphonic work . When Roger viewed Battleship Potemkin at the Sound of Silents Film Festival at the Vickers Theatre , a rock group ( Concrete ) provided background music . " Under the stars on a balmy sunny night , far from film festivals and cinematheques " writes Roger , " Eisenstein 's 1925 revolutionary call generated some of its legendary rabble-rousing power . " <p> How you view a film certainly effects your enjoyment of it . Because of its sweeping desert landscapes , Lawrence of Arabia does need to be seen wide-screen . But for a movie like The Apartment featuring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine , watching at home with a bowl of popcorn between you and your wife works just as well , maybe even better . The film succeeds because of a funny yet poignant script and the interaction between two stars rather than because of cinematography . Yet the print of The Bicycle Thief available from the library in Michigan City was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first films we viewed was Beauty and the Beast , not the Disney animated version from 1991 , but the Jean Cocteau black-and-white version from 1946 .

" Most recently a re-mastered version of the Cocteau classic appeared in theaters , earning obligatory four-star ratings from all the critics . I 'm hopeful Jon Vickers books the film into his theatre later this fall . <p> With my movie-viewing odyssey only begun , Casablanca , remains my all-time favorite . Can Citizen Kane displace it ? Maybe I 'll make the Orson Welles movie the one hundredth of the one hundred Great Films I watch before deciding which film deserves being ranked at the top of my list .

@@102096346 @6296346/ <h> Training <h> THE TIRELESS CANDIDATE : Lar ( America First ) Daly <p> Before there was a Ron Paul , there was a Lar ( America First ) Daly . This article was published first in the February 1964 issue of Chicago Scene , a magazine then edited by John D. Callaway , later to become a TV broadcast legend on the PBS station , WTTW . " The Tireless Candidate " has just been reprinted as a chapter in the Kindle book , Bobby Kennedy and the Politics of the Sixties , by Hal Higdon . <p> If I am elected , " Lar ( America First ) Daly once promised his fellow citizens , while running for Governor of Illinois in 1956 , " my first act in office will be to paint the Governors mansion red , white and bluewith my own money ! Moreover , the official Governors portrait will be me dressed in my Uncle Sam suit . What could be more fitting and patriotic to display on the walls of government office buildings throughout the state ? " <p> Lar ( America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor has he gained office or rarely even come close in any campaign before or since . Lar ( America First ) Daly has run for Governor . He has run for Senator . He has run for Mayor.He has run ( twice ) for President of the United States . He has run for buses , trains and airplanesand missed them too . " Actually , I do not know how many times I have run , " says the Perennial Candidate , who claims to have gained practical experience in the art of human nature while working as a fruit and vegetable peddler . " I guess I 've attempted to gain public office somewhere between 17 and 20 times , but you would have to check the records . " <p> Despite his seeming availability to the voter , People remember Lar Daly more for the uniform he wears than for the principles he espouses . " Mr. Daly , I would like to know where your supporters are located , " challenged a man in the audience when Lar appeared on Jack Paars program during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Illinois , and we 've never heard of you . " " Well , sir , " replied Daly , " you apparently do n't  read newspapers , watch television , listen to the radio , or attend meetings , because in every Illinois campaign in which I engage , I am known as the tireless candidate . " <p> Paar picked up the cue : " And now I have to do a commercial for our tireless candidate . " <p> It is hard to imagine how anyone living in Illinois and teaching social studies could have failed to hear of Lar Daly , who has not missed an election campaign since 1950 . In that year , he campaigned for senator from Illinois under the slogan : War Now With Red Russia . " I want to be on the first plane sent to atom bomb Moscow , " he wrote President Truman . No once can say Lar Daly has avoided controversial issues . In fact , he thrives on taking way-out stands . Lar Daly has railed against public housing . He has decried public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He despises internationalists . He hates communists even more . His principal platform while running ( as ever , unsuccessfully ) for Everett Dirksens senate seat in 1962 was : Invade Cuba Now . He favors high tariffs . He thinks other weaker countries should surrender their sovereignty to the United States . He would like to legalize gambling . Politically , he can best be described as a conservative with radical ideasor maybe as a war-mongering isolationist . Lar ( America First ) Daly began life as a Democrat , switched to the Republicans . Both parties would rather see him on the others ballotsor better still , not running at all . Lar Daly is really an Independent Party-Switcher , the best-known Political Nobody in the country . <p> Even Lar Daly does not always seem to plug for Lar Daly . " REPUBLICANSDONT vote for LAR DALY for Mayor , " he once advertised in the newspapers . " DALYS opponent , Robert E. Merriam , supported Adlai Stevenson against Eisenhower in 1952 , and he still likes Adlai . Republicansvote for Merriam and destroy your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands for Americas interests first . Do n't  vote at all . Stay home and sulk . Let Merriam and his Internationalists take over the Republican party . Farewell , Abe Lincoln . Signed LAR ( America First ) DALY . " Republicans not only forgot to vote for Lar Daly in the primary ; they also forgot to vote for Merriam in the regular election for Mayor two days later . Merriams opponent , Richard J. Daley was swept into office . <p> Lar Daly not only campaigns forcefully against both Republican and Democratic opponents , he also jousts quixotically from time to time with a mythical character with gaunt face , wild hair and thick glasses , who he has dubbed Dr. Cyclops , and who represents ( in his mind ) all the goofy crackpot elements who oppose Christian moral principles and want to destroy our traditional American way of life . " People of Chicago , " cries Daly , " which do you choose ? Dr. Cyclops or America First ? " Yet during his 1959 campaign for Mayor of Chicago , the Perennial Candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He faced in the Democratic primary incumbent Richard J. Daley . After Mayor Daley had appeared on several television newscast and interview shows , Lar demanded equal time under Section 315 of the Federal Communications Act . Mindful of his normal low percentage of votes , the Chicago TV stations refused to grant it . The FCC , however , backed Lars claim in what is now referred to as the Lar Daly decision . " This places severe restrictions on our right to judge what is news and what is not , " moaned the television industry to Congress . Also , prods Lar , since the television industry only returns 15 per cent profit a year on its investment , giving away all that free time might prove a financial strain . <p> Among those caught was Chicago newscaster Norman Ross , who after having Mayor Daley on his Sunday interview show was now obligated to accommodate Candidate Lar Daly . Ross disliked the idea of interviewing this man in the Uncle Sam suit . He also found it distasteful that Lar , as he had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If Lar Daly tries to beg for money , " Ross told reporters , " I 'll white him right off the screen . " <p> On reading this , Lar Daly became enraged . He called Sterling Quinlan , Station WBKB-TV chief . " Just tell your employee , " boomed Lar , " that because of his shooting off his mouth , I 'm not going to let him appear on my program . And tell him not to show up or I 'll embarrass him ! " <p> Ross did n't  show upand neither did Lar for the first eight minutes . After visiting a hospitalized friend in suburban Evanston , the Perennial Candidate found himself ensnared in heavy Sunday traffic on the Ouyer Drive . It took a police escort to extricate him . Meanwhile , the WBKB people did n't  miss Lar Daly . They simply ran an old movie . <p> Not content with merely claiming his own equal time , Lar hinted to the rival Republican camp that they too might claim equal time against Democratic incumbent , Richard J. Daley . " We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican primary candidate , immediately asked for and obtained his equal time . Lar Daly entered in both Democratic and Republican primaries , then filed a claim for equal time to answer his Republican opponent . He lost that decision . This and similar maneuvers by the Perennial Candidate often bewilder Chicago citizens . But as one attorney told me : " We survived prohibition . I guess well survive Lar Daly . " <p> Despite such demoniac political tactics , Lar ( America First ) Daly is less than the devil incarnate when met face to face , say in the basement of his house on the south side of Chicago . He is not a rich man . He lives in a simple , brick one-story home with an American eagle on the front mailbox and a red , white and blue garage . He drives an aging ( also red , white and blue ) Ford station wagon whose color scheme comes in handy when he pickets the Federal Building , Chicagos old Post Office . Policemen mistake Lars auto parked in a no parking zone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Lar Daly has fathered six children and sells barstools for a living under the one-man corporate title of the American Stool and Chair Company . He carries his 182 pounds well on a six-foot frame . Lar is a ruggedly handsome 52-year-old man who has a square dome , a typical Irishmans red face , and silver-russet hair rapidly receding beneath his Uncle Sam hat . He looks as though with proper padding , he could play Santa Caus with the same reckless abandon that he plays Uncle Sam . Yet Lars eyes could stare through concrete , ; his voice could cut copper . When I sat with him over a can of beer in his basement one night last year he thrust a paper under my nose . " Sign this ! " he said . It was a standard loyalty oath . Never having belonged to any organization more subversive than the Boy Scouts , I signed . <p> " Thats standard for anyone who wants an interviews , " he exclaimed . <p> " What if I had refused ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at least I would have known on what grounds you stood . " <p> Perennial Candidate Daly has not always been known as Lar . His wife and friends call him Larry . " Lar " is the old Irish nickname for Lawrence ; his father and his grand-uncle used it in the Old Country . Lawrence Joseph Sarsfield Daly was born January 22 , 1912 . At the time , his father worked as both policeman and fireman in Gary , Indiana . Whwen Lar was only five , his mother died . He and his brother John spent a year in an orphanage then moved to Chicago with their father . While only in the second grade , Lar helped a street peddler sell fruits and vegetables . He made $2.00 a day . By fourth grade he owned his own route . Lar the shrewd businessman emerged . " I was n't the only kid working " he explained to me . " A lot of kids peddled . But I was the only one who ever rented a horse and wagon . " He soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today prides himself as much for having once bought 5,000 bunches of carrots for half a penny a bunch as for his equal time victories . <p> In working the alleys , Lar gained the confidence of the neighborhood housewives , a fact not lost on the local precinct captain . During the 1928 presidential campaign , young , red-headed Lar Daly distributed picture posters of Al Smith in the predominantly Irish Catholic and working-class neighborhood . " Hoover had been a good president , " says Lar today . " But a man should have the chance to drink a glass of beer . " Three years later , Lar used his reputation as the housewifes friend to help a heretofore political unknown , John F. Healy , ascend to the aldermans chair in the sixth ward . <p> Impressed with his own political ability , the 20-year-old eyed the job of Democratic ward committeeman . Lars estimate of his political abilities was good ; his underestimate of his opponent , James M. Whalen , was not . At that time Whalen was one of the most powerful men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file for an election you need a certain number of signatures . " I went out and got all the signatures of the neighbors from my old fruit and vegetable route , " Lar told me . " I needed 700 names and I filed 1200 . " Soon , however , he receive a notice from the Chicago Election Board that his petitions had been objected toby one of Whalens lieutenants . " I knew my petitions are good , " Lar said in defense . " I got all the signatures myself . " Nevertheless , the Board threw him off the ballot , and presumably out of Whalens hair . <p> Lar would not admit that you ca n't fight City Hall . He hired a lawyer from the University of Chicago for $10.00 and filed a petition for declaratory judgment in Cook County Superior Court . Selected to hear Lars case was William J. Lindsay , by coincidence a judge Whalen had appointed to the bench . The Judge listened to Lars arguments and those of the Chicago Election Board , then intoned : " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April the 11th . " <p> " But your honor , " said Lars lawyer , " the primaries for ward committeeman are April the 10th . " <p> " I will announce my decision on April the 11th . " <p> Still not beaten , Lar conducted a write-in campaign which gained him an impressive 700 votes , but not the election . The following day he appeared with his lawyer in court . When the bailiff called the case , Judge Lindsay looked up as though surprised to see them . " Petition granted , " he said , meaning Lar had won . By that time , it was moot and academic . <p> The experience would have soured anybody on politics . Lar Daly turned temporarily to furniture-moving , calling himself Daly Brothers , even though his steelworker brother had no connection with the business . <p> In 1938 , despite never haven gotten past first year high school , Lar filed for Cook County Superintendent of Schools . The job paid $17,000 a year with the duty of issuing certificates to teachers in county town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into third-floor apartments . Lars campaign consisted of passing out handbills at church on Sundays saying he favored teaching the Christian religion in public schools . " Eh ? Vots dot ? " asked the voters of Jake Arveys predominantly Jewish 24th ward . Unimpressed by Lars chutzpah , they gave him hardly a single vote . Lawrence J. Daly ( as he was listed on the ballot ) did attract approximately 300,000 voters in other wards , largely on strength of his Irish name . It was not enough to gain the election . To this day it remains Lars best showing . His victorious opponent , Noble J. Puffer , after 17 to 20 unsuccessful Lar Daly campaigns , still signs Cook County teacher certificates . <p> Daly abandoned furniture moving in October of 1940 in favor of barstools . Charlie Regan , a friend from the old Healy alderman campaign , had invented a seat cover you could slip over barstools . Next to the atom bomb , it was the greatest invention of the half-century , but Charlie stuttered so badly he could n't give rice away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could sell milk shakes to Eskimos . He became Charlies voice . Not content with selling covers only to bars and cocktail lounges , Lar eyed the proliferating bookie trade . In Chicago bookie joints , the sheet writers , cashiers and stick men sat on stools rather than chairs . You do n't  find bookie joints in the yellow pages , but Lar knew where to look . He went to police stations . " I want the name of every bookie in your district , " he would tell the Captain . " For every stool cover I sell , you get half a buck . " With such a proposition , Lar learned more about the Chicago underworld in a month than Elliot Ness had in 10 tears . " We never kept much money though , " he admits . " We would get the money from one bookie joint and go spend it in the next . " After Charlie Regan died , Daly diversified his business to include schools and churches . <p> But the Dr. Jeckylll of Lar the Successful Businessman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Perennial Candidateto the detriment of his bank account . At first he seemed less interested in his own fortunes than those of General Douglas MacArthur , a man Lar considers our number one American . As early as 1936 , Lar began filing MacArthurs name for president in the Illinois primariesbut his hero always withdrew . In 1952 others beside Lar Daly began to consider MacArthur . " That year I filed MacArthurs name again , " he says . " It was the closest he ever came to leaving it on the Illinois ballot . But after an exchange of telegrams he finally withdrew . He thought it unwise at that time . " <p> Lar Daly still determined to get Douglas MacArthurs name on some ballot by hook or by crook . He chose hook . Election laws vary from state to state . In Illinois , you file a persons name , and he has 10 days in which to withdraw it . In Wisconsin ( MacArthurs home state ) , you file a slate of electors pledged to a candidatebut you must have that candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electors through ads in various Wisconsin newspapers , now he still had to obtain MacArthurs name to go on top of them . He turned in desperation to the Chicago phone book . He found no Douglas MacArthur , who might legally substitute his name for that of the war hero , but he did find a McArthurand lo and behold , his first name was General . Lar called General McArthur from Madison . A man with a deep southern accent answered the phone . " How do you stand on General Douglas MacArthur ? " asked Lar . <p> " He s a great hero , " said McArthur , " and one of mah favorite men . " <p> " Listen , General , I 'd like to put MacArthurs name on the ballot , but cant get his signature . Can I use yours ? " <p> Mister General McArthur gave his consent . Lar drove from Madison to Chicago in four hours , shook hands with McArthur , shook hands with McArthur , greeted his wife , patted his eight or nine children on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison . The Secretary of State laughed when he looked at the name . " Its all right with me , " he said , " but I doubt if it will be certified . " <p> Lar Daly , describing to me what happened , leaned back in his chair as if recalling the incident with relish : " In the meantime , the Chicago Sun-Times carries an editorial about the dirty , underhanded means used by Lar Daly . Two days later the Attorney General says our man can not be certified . Not enough electors . We could have gone to the Wisconsin Supreme Court , but we did not have the money . " Much to Lars disappointment , Dwight D. Eisenhower obtained the nomination that summer at the Republican National Convention . General Douglas MacArthur and Mister General McArthur both slowly faded away . <p> When he ran for Senator in 1950 , Daly first shortened Lawrencde J. to Lar . Four years later , he took the political middle name of " America First " and adopted the uniform that wouold later be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lacked organization . Your only hope of making any possible dent in the vote is to seize on a certain one policyAmericas interests first in politicsand to attract attention to yourself . So I chose the sartorial emblem of our country , the Uncle Sam suit , complete with goatee , beard and everything . " <p> Lar did attract attention , but for every vote garnered by advertising his Americanism , he probably lost two more because the voters thought him to be some kind of a nut . As head of an almost non-existent America First Party , Lar tried to place others in the race for public office . " He had simply a wild state of people , " one lawyer told me . " There was some uncouth guy I met who looked as though he had just come from a binge on the bowery . He informed me he was the Daly Candidate for Superintendent of Public Instruction . " <p> In his attempt to get on the ballot in 1954 , Lar Daly espoused 100 per cent approval of Joe McCarthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood . Joe McCarthy , however , espoused no Lar Daly , explaining tersely : " I never endorse primary candidates . " <p> Unsuccessful in the spring primary , Lar circulated petitions to get on the fall general election , a titanic task for an independent candidate in Illinois . Lar obtained the necessary 33,000 signatures , but driving down to Springfield ( as he always does ) on the last possible day for filing , he had a flat . Naturally , his spare had no air . It is always Lar ( America First ) Dalys fate , when running for office , to falter like a high hurdler who tries to cut the hurdles too tight . But whereas an Olympic-class hurler trips on the 10th hurdle , Lar usually has his starting blocks slip . Delayed for three hours , Lar finally sprinted into the State Capitol with ( what he claims was ) three minutes to spare . To his horror , the Chief Index Clarks office had already closed . <p> " You be my witmess then , " said Lar . Wrapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass door . The noise attracted a state police lieutenant who bounded up the stairs fumbling for his pistol . <p> " Stop ! " the Lieutenant is reported by Lar to have said . <p> And as the State Capitol bells chimed the hour of 5:00 , Lar Dalys red , white and blue automobile did not change into a pumpkin , but Index Clerk Butler did step out of another office . " You 're late again , Lar , " he announced . <p> Don Butler , of course , denies this story . He says Lar did n't  arrive with his petitions until 5:01 , which would disqualify him from the race under the unbending rules of the State of Illinois . A law suit hung on this time differential and Lar Daly lost . " Daly always files at the last possible minute , " another Springfield official told me , " because he hopes coming in late we wo n't check the signatures too closely . " Lar has a long record of rejected petitions . In 1948 he presented 13 names ( including Dewey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary , most backed by one-signature petitions . They were thrown out . He had planned to make a test case of Illinois election laws , but somehow never got around to it . In the 1960 New Hampshire presidential primary , the state rejected his petitions because of false and non-existent addresses . Desperate for the necessary signatures , he had advertised at the last moment to pay for help . The bums and vagrants who flocked to his call did a less than exemplary job . In 1962 he collected enough signatures to become an independent candidate for Senator against Dirksen and Yates , but all signatures came from Cook County . Illinois election laws specify you must canvas 50 counties , a fact of which Daly , a knowledgeable student of election laws , was well aware . <p> So numerous have been Lar Dalys transportation woes , he could keep a Travelers Aid office in business almost single-handed . One filing time he hopped aboard an evening bus bound from Chicago to Springfield . The bus stopped for a 20-minute rest in Pontiac , Illinois at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed two women who had sat across the aisle from him back onto his busso he thought . The two women , however , had switched buses . Lar suddenly awoke to find himself going in the wrong direction . He asked the driver to return him to Pontiac refused , so Lar climbed out in the middle of a snowstorm and walked the nine miles back to town . Only one vehicle passed him : a truck owned by the State of Illinois . In an act that now seems almost symbolic , it did not stop . Lar successfully filed his petitions the next day , but in another 11th-hour dash several years later became engulfed in traffic near Midway Airport and missed his plane . " If Lar Daly ever was elected President , " says his attorney , Howard Newcomb Morse , " He would probably be late for the inauguration . " <p> In 1956 students a the University of Indiana invited Lar Daly to address their mock convention , Driving to Bloomington in an old Chevy , Lar suffered his inevitable flat tire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the convention hall doors swung open and in strode the man in the Uncle Sam suit . Lawrence Olivier could not made a more dramatic entrance . A cheer went up from the students . <p> " I believe Lar Daly is here , " said the presiding officer . <p> Senator Homer Capehart , Ikes stand-in , moved to the microphone . " My candidate has no objection to letting his only opponent speak to the convention . " Following a 15-minute oration , Lar ( America First ) Daly received 76 + votes , a distant second to Eisenhower , but ahead of other vote-getters : William Knowland , Joe McCarthy and the then deceased Robert Taft . <p> At about that time , Lar Daly stood engaged in the first of his many battles for equal time based on Section 315 of the Federal Communications Act . On February 29 , 1956 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower appeared on nation-wide television to announce his return to health following his heart attack and his aim to seek re-election . " When he uttered those words , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entitled to equal time . I picked up the Chicago paper the following day . Paul Butler , the Democratic chairman , had asked for equal time for his party . A spokesman for the FCC answered him : This is a primary fight of one political party and is strictly a family affair . So far as I know , only certified legally qualified candidates of his own party can demand and receive equal time. Beautiful , says I. Twenty-one days previously , three candidates were simultaneously certified as legally qualified candidates for the April primary in Illinois : Dwight D. Eisenhower , Senator William F. Knowland and the nobodyLar ( America First ) Daly " <p> Daly mailed the FCC a foot-thick package containing pictures of all his campaign activities . It cost him $8.00 in postage . He might as well have saved the stamps . " Ridiculous , " said Ike at a press conference when informed of Lars demands . His views prevailed . Section 315 to the contrary , Lar Daly never did receive equal time . Nor did this upstart candidate receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though he had entered three primaries : Indiana , Illinois and Montana . The Republican National Committee tried looking the other way , then grudgingly granted Lar hotel spaced for his campaign headquartersat the Shaw , two miles uptown . It was like trying tp play shortstop from the bleache4rs in Candlestick Park . Lar retaliated by donning his Uncle Sam suit . He paraded through the Fairmont and Mark Hopkins , and at the airport when Eisenhower arrived , carrying a sign : " I Never Did Like Ike . " A compatriot dressed as Abe Lincoln accompanied him . " You could feel the 105 degree below zero chill , " says Lar . " Its just that the Republicans happened to be a fine class of people . They were all from the suburbs , but if they had been rank and file working stiffs , they probably would have set on us physically . " <p> Lar wanted his name placed in nomination . " There was a current of dissatisfaction with Ike , " he says . " but nobody wanted to put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America First ) Daly . " He also sought to regain his 10 lost Montana votes . Lar Daly had filed unopposed in the Montana primary , which would have guaranteed him 10 first-ballot votes at the convention . Montana Republicans recoiled in horror at the thought of being forced to nominate Lar . At the last moment , Secretary of State Stephen C. Arnold announced his candidacy , promising his votes to Ike . Straw candidates are illegal in Montana , a fact Lar Daly failed to discover until the statute of limitations ran out . <p> In a last-ditch effort to get theears of the Montana delegation , Lar appealed to Hugh Scott , then chairman of the grievance committee . It was 3:00 , the night before balloting would begin . Daly burst into Scotts hotel suite . " After I saw him walk in with that Uncle Sam costume , " Scott later told me , " I would n't have been surprised to see the Statue of Liberty come walking out of the Ladies Room . " Scott , now a Senator from Pennsylvania , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several people from bed in an attempt to at least get the Perennial Candidate a hearing . <p> " Are you putting us on , Hugh ? " they would say before slamming the phone receiver down . Though listed in the directory as a candidate , Lar couldnt even obtain credentials . He watched the nomination on television . <p> " The one thing that hurt us was people thought it was just a joke , " said Lars friend , who had dressed as Abe Lincoln . " Again , it was the Uncle Sam suit . They apparently did n't  want trouble . " In reality , of course , he was no threat to Dwight Eisenhower . But they were afraid he might get emotional or start a little ruckus . It probably would have been a good thing . It was a pretty dead convention . " <p> Back battling for the White House in 1960 , Lar ( America First ) Daly made a one-night , non-repeat , unpaid appearance on the Jack Paar program . It was , depending on your point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his career . In a burst of civic pride and open-handed generosity , Paar had invited the various presidential aspirants ( excluding , of course , the Perennial Candidate ) to visit his late-night variety program . On June 17 , 1960 , Candidate John F. Kennedy appeared for 52 minutes . The following day , Lar Daly wired NBC for equal time . Request not granted , NBC replied , citing legislation passed by Congress the previous year . Newscasts , documentaries , panel shows , interview programs and on-the-spot interviews were exempt from the equalk time provisions of Section 315 for the 1960 presidential campaign . But Lar pressed on . He phoned Ben Fitzgerald , a Washington lawyer : " Check with the FCC on the status of the Jack Paar program . " <p> " What does it say ? " <p> " This is a variety show " <p> " Fine ! That 's all I want to hear . " <p> Lar had , he later chortled , that smarty-pants Jack Paar right by the brass buttons . Quoting the Tonight programs variety show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules in his favor five to one . <p> Never one to tamper with tradition , Lar chose an airline flight that arrived at Newark Airport an hour late . As he scrambled into his Uncle Sam suit at the studio , Paar lieutenants brought him coffee , told him to relax and quizzed him about his background . " I was amazed to see he did n't  go right on the program , " said Ben Fitzgerald . Paar later would ask him to leave early , and Lar never would receive his full equal time . <p> Lar ( America First ) Daly finally stepped out into the spotlight to be greeted by disbelief and laughter , in that order . " I knew wearing the Uncle Sam suit would hurt me , " says Lar . " But I figured as long as I had worn it on street corners and in meeting halls all over the country I 'd wear it in my first national TV appearance . " Daly also hung a sign around his neck appealing for campaign contributions . He figured that as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might as well plug his own product . Lar eventually did receive more than 600 letters as a result of his appearance , including $151.17 in contributions , a phony check , and three threats on his life . <p> On the program that night , Paar ASKED Lar Daly if he had enough experience in government to be president . The following exchange took place . <p> Daly : ( calmly ) ) You do not necessarily have to have administrative experience in government to be President of the United States . We have a man who has been the President of the United States for the past seven and a half years who knew nothing but Army life , and I do n't  think he was in any way qualified to be the chief executive of the United States of America . " <p> Paar : ( reaching for a boffo line ) He may not have been , but he was a heck of a good president , I think . <p> Applause . <p> Daly : ( unbowed ) Well , Jack , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're entitled to your opinion and I 'm entitled to mine , and I will say that I believe Dwight D. Eisenhower is the poorest excuse for a president this United States of America has ever had . <p> Groans , hoots , boos . <p> Paar : ( stumbling and flustered ) Well , the London papers have been calling my office all day . They are fascinated by you , and I am too . But the point is , do n't  you think there is enough clowning around now in both parties . What can you accomplish with this ? <p> Daly : ( antimatedly ) I take exception to your use of the descriptibve term , clowning . Of course , naturally <p> Several commercials and insults later , Lar Daly stood up to leave . " Thank you , Jack , its been nice meeting you , and God bless the FCC . " He changed from his Uncle Sam suit with the laughter and boos still ringing in his ears . On the air the Paar cast chipped the last epitaph onto his gravestone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds that he s asking for were sent dir3ectly to the theatrical costumers , " cackled Alexander King . Referring to the three-point platform Daly had expressed earlier , Hugh Downs quoted a questioner in the audience : " If we looked under Dalys Uncle Sam hat , we 'd probably find a fourth point . " <p> Sitting down in Hurleys several hours later , Lar watched the actual telecast ( in what he refers to as civilian clothes ) and brooded his fate . " There was already another guy at the bar , myself , and two others . They had the same reaction that the four million viewers must have got . The guy nearest the TV set says , Holy smoke , what the hell is this ? Then Paar sas something about trick or treat . This fellow says , Boy , this is something this clown. Well , then the fellow sitting next to me on my left said , Yeah , but listen to what the hell he s saying. I was starting to bang out the three points now . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nutty , hed be worth listening to. " <p> In one sense , Lars Paar appearance was the low point in his careernot just because he had set himself up to ridicule , but because he had missed an opportunity to establish sympathy with a sizable portion of the American public . <p> Lar Daly believes in equal time . So do a good many US Congressmen , who for eight years have been wrestling in committee unsuccessfully with the question of how to give the small guy candidate a break , recognizing at the same time that this is basically a two-party country . Face to face , Lar Daly is a likable person , but one of the major flaws in his character is that when he gets in front of a microphone , he begins to shout and threaten in an attempt to intimidate the audience . With Lar Daly as his own best friend , he does n't  need any enemies . <p> Recently , I sat in the well-aportioned Chicago skyscraper offices of Secretary of State Charles Carpentier and spoke with Assistant Secretary Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Carpentiers coattils . Cronson had a low opinion of Lar ( America First ) Daly : " I think the most sincere comment I can make on Lar Daly is you shouldnt do a story on him . I feel the functioning of government is serious business . I do n't  think frivolity has any place in it . Lar Dalys system consists only of getting his picture taken on filing day . You never see Daly campaign . He has no organization . He has no platform . All he s interested in is attracting attention , which he commands by running around in his Uncle Sam suit and shouting some irresponsible platform . " <p> F. Raymond Marks , Jr. , a former counsel for the Illinois division of the American Civil Liberties Union thinks he at least understands Lar Daly , He once represented him in an election dispute . " I do n't  really give a hoot what motivates Daly , " he told me . " He still serves a certain function . One of the major difficulties of election laws is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , you have practically no recourse to legal action . The courts do n't  like to listen to moot points . Once an election takes place , your complaint is not a real controversy . In a sense Daly either underscores the strength or weakness of the two-party system . He certainly underscores its presence . " <p> Lars former attorney of record was Howard Newcomb Morse , a former university law professor and scholar whose mother years ago used to buy fruits and vegetables from red-haired , freckle-faced Larry Daly . " Everybody hates Lar except the people , " he told me . " Big politicians dismiss him with a snicker . Some attach the crackpot label . But what other candidate is as candid , or has as much guts for calling a spade a spade ? Lar does not equivocate . He does not straddle the fence . He does n't  evade a thing . In coming out on various issues , however , he does occasionally put the other candidates on the spot . " <p> Lar ( America First ) Daly meanwhile moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several years ago , a thief plucked Lars Uncle Sam suit from the back seat of his parked car . Lar placd a personal ad in the Chicago Tribune asking for the suits return , no questions asked . A few days later , the phone rang . <p> " I know where your suit is , " said a sinister voice on the phone . <p> " Have you got it ? " <p> " I know where it is . " <p> " Are you familiar with Grant Park ? " said the Perennial Candidate . <p> " Yes . " <p> " South of Buckingham Fountain is a bench . Tomorrow night you leave the suit under the bench . Come there any time after five past midnight . You 'll find a $50 bill taped under the bench . <p> Lar got his suit back stuffed in an old paper bag . " Who else but Lar Daly , " says Morse throwing his hands up in mock despair , " would set up a midnight appointment in Grant Park in the cold of winter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in his life he was ever on time . " <p> But the recovery of his suit proved to be only temporary . Lar explained to me : " A year and a half ago , as the Associated Press correspondent in Springfield said , economic circumstances forced Lar to sell it . I had to sell it to eat . " Now Lar ( America First ) Daly campaigns only in an Uncle Sam hat , probably an improvement in his style . Eestes Kefauver ran for President wearing a coonskin hat and nobody labeled him a crackpot . <p> Financial problems constantly beset Lar Daly . Even though he usually runs pretty much of a do-it-yourself campaign , printing costs for campaign literature , travel expenses , and the occasional out-of-pocket dole to his one or two campaign workers does take an occasional dollar . Even more money is required to finance Lars many law suits . Last September he called me and asked for a loan to help him continue appealing a suit against the state of Illinois dating back to the 1960 election . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off the ballot . ) Lar wanted $300 ; I gave him $50 . When you press Lar about finances , he speaks about some " wealthy benefactor " on the North Shore . He wo n't give you the benefactors name , because his patron does n't  want publicity . But at the same time Lar was telling me about this benefactor during an interview in his home , I noticed that his tape recorder , there on a previous visit , was missing . Lar had hocked it to help finance his campaign . If the truth were known , Lar probably finances most of his campaigning out of his own pocket . <p> Two summers ago , I visited the working class neighborhood of West Pullman on Chicagos South Side . In an old frame building , formerly a cocktail lounge , Lar ( America First ) Daly , Independent Candidate for U.S. Senator , maintained campaign headquarters . The building also housed the American Stool and Chair Company , and I occupied one of the chairs on the sidewalk . It was 2:30 . Lar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less than half an hour to speak to the workers as they changed shifts . Suddenly on the horizon , I saw a blur of red , white and blue . Into view roared Lar Daly , last of the do-it-yourself politicians . <p> " I 'll be late for my own embalming table , " he shouted , grinding to a stop on the wrong side of the street . He did not stop long , but instead rattled off to pick up a trailer for his campaign signs . I helped two of his friends tape Lar Daly posters on the sides of their cars . A man smoking a pipe and swinging a cane walked by . " Hell tell them all off , " said the man . " Yessir . Hell cut into the Democrats . They ought to hand him 10 or 20 thousand dollars and tell him to stay off the ticket . " <p> Lar Daly had indeed cut into the votes of the Democratic candidate Sidney R. Yates in the primary . Yates beat him three to one , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paltry ratio in the home of the machine . " Analysts figure that half of Dalys votes were cast by people who mistook Candidate Lar Daly for Mayor Richard J. Daley . The other half came in the form of a protest vote by the same people who helped reject , in that same election , a Richard Daley-sponsored bond issue . <p> Ten minutes after Lar Dalys first frantic appearance , I crouched in the back of his fastly moving station wagon amidst a tangle of sound equipment and paper Uncle Sam hats . Behind us clanged the trailer with a large sign : UP THE BOMBERS AND KEEP THEM UP . Arriving at U.S. Steel , Daly experienced difficulty setting up his equipment . The loudspeakers at first would not loudspeak . It made little difference . We had arrived too late for the change of shifts , and only a trickle of men drifted out the gate . From the middle of the street , Lar tore into his six-point platform , the first point being , Invade Cuba Now , and the last point being Legalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move his microphone to let it pass . Lar ( America First ) Daly , the man without a party , was late again . A month later the election board refused to certify Lar for Senator . <p> In 1963 , the following year , a Lar Daly Primary campaign against both Benjamin Adamowski and Richard J. Daley for Mayor barely got off the ground . The last time I saw Lar was October in front of the Blackstone . Lar was picketing the pickets who were picketing Madame Nhu , the First Lady of Vietnam . Even then , he was on the losing side . <p> For many reasons Lar Daly well deserves the crackpot label attached to him . In the two-ring circus of American politics , it has been his role to flit around the outskirts of the Big Top playing the clown . Because of this , many of the tightrope walkers and animal trainers in the center spotlight have perhaps righteously looked down and sneered . A lot of the audience thinks he s nuts too . But in all high comedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a razor-sharp mind . He knows the election laws as well as any other man in the country . He is affable and makes friends effortlessly . The tragedy of Lawrence Joseph Sarsfield Daly is that early in his political career , he got nudged off the ladder leading to political success , and he has since been scrambling up drainpipes . What makes Lar run ? Perhaps he seeks publicity . Perhaps he honestly believes he has something to offer the voters . Perhaps he is still running after that ward committeeman job the Election Board hustled him out of three decades ago . <p> " Lar Daly is n't a comedian at heart , " I was told by a former close friend of the Perennial Candidate . " I think people got the wrong impression because he worse that Uncle Sam suit . I was always against it . It would n't inspire patriotism . Patriotism died around 1776 in the United States . Maybe if he did n't  wear the Uncle Sam suit ; maybe if he toned down some of those ideas ; maybe if he cow-towedwent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some political office . " <p> The friend stared a minute in space and then shook his head as if in despair . " But then I guess he would n't be Lar Daly . <p> " The Tireless Candidate " was published first in the February 1964 issue of Chicago Scene . It now has been included as a chapter in the Kindle book , Bobby Kennedy and the Politics of the Sixties , by Hal Higdon. 
@@102096347 @6296347/ <h> Training <h> Hal Higdon 's 7-7-70 Quest - " They 're not runners . They 're too old " 79545 @qwx939545 <p> Portions of this article originally appeared in The Kiwanis Magazine and Runner 's World during the early 1970s . The Masters Movement was in its infancy at that time . The first World Veterans Championships was held in Toronto , Canada in 1975 . As a 44-year-old runner , Hal Higdon won the M40 3000 meter steeplechase in Toronto with a time of 9:18.6 that remains an American record to this day . The 14th World Veterans Championships is scheduled for Brisbane , Australia this summer . Hal Higdon plans to run the second of the seven marathons in his 7-7-70 Quest in that meet . The following version appeared as a chapter in the book , Fitness After Forty , published in 1977 and currently out of print . <p> In 1972 , I visited England along with several hundred other Americans , Canadians and Australians to compete in the International Veteran 's Athletics Meeting , a track and field meet for athletes 40 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master runners and would be followed three years later by a world championships in Toronto . <p> We stayed in a hotel in downtown London . During the nearly one week spent in that city , I watched each day as workmen demolished a building across the street from our hotel . I was fascinated by the precision with which they worked . They pecked at the masonry with picks and sledges . Bit by bit , pieces of the old structure came unstuck to crash below . <p> I could not help comparing that building to the human body . The body takes time to construct , decays gradually . Eventually , along come the wreckers to dismantle it brick by brick . <p> One of the attractions , however , of veterans ' athletics ( what in the United States is called " Masters track " ) is that you can beat that schedule . By conditioning yourself--and even competing as in youth--you can become younger physically and spiritually while aging chronologically . It is almost as though , after the workmen had finished their day 's demolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the building higher than the day before . But this only postpones the inevitable . Sooner or later , the building tumbles to the ground . <p> I thought of that as , day after day , I observed the workers pecking away at the building . Eventually , it would be gone . Yet as I watched from the window of my London hotel , I could not help thinking , again , that back in the United States a tractor crane would have swung its iron ball , and the building would have fallen in hours instead of weeks . <h> Something I always wanted to do <p> Our group of Master athletes , every one of us over 40 , formed an interesting group . There was Roland Anspach , for example , who worked for General Motors in Dayton , Ohio . When he turned 40 he began to run even though he never had competed in track before . <p> " It was something I always had wanted to do , " Roland explained to me one day . " At first , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors would n't think me crazy- " <p> After six months ' preparation , Roland entered his first race , a Masters mile at Ohio University , and wheezed across the line in 5:50 . Four years later , he ran on a 24-hour relay team , averaging 5:27 for 25 separate miles . He no longer delivered newspapers . <p> " The neighbors are used to me now , " he said . <p> There was Thane Baker who competed in the Olympic Games in 1952 and 1956 , winning silver medals in the 200 meters and a gold medal in the 400-meter relay . He retired following his second Olympic appearance but came out of retirement after turning 40 to run 100 yards in 9.8 seconds . A lot had changed during his retirement , including tracks , once all cinder , now mostly hard , all-weather combinations . <p> Flying across the Atlantic , Baker commented to me , " You know , I 've never run on an all-weather track before . I do n't even own a pair of shoes with short spikes yet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first priorities was finding a sporting goods store to buy some . <p> Rudy Friberg of San Diego competed in the pole vault . Several decades earlier , he had vaulted for Fresno State , clearing 13 ' 6 " and earning All-American status . That was back in the bamboo pole era . He was competing now on a fiberglass pole and wondering if this might offer him the opportunity to better even his collegiate personal best . He fell several feet short of his goal , but Roger Ruth of Victoria , British Columbia , soared well above 15 feet , which had he accomplished it in his youth would have earned him an Olympic medal . <p> There was Jim O'Neil of Sacramento , Calif. , who had attended the University of Miami in Florida where he became number three man on a cross-country team that ran only one race a year . He was racing faster at age 47 than he did in college . <p> " There always have been opportunities for older distance runners , " O'Neil commented to me one afternoon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives the sprinters and jumpers a chance to compete again . " <h> Mooning the stands <p> One well-known individual the sport attracted was Alan Cranston , who ran on the track team at Stanford University in the late 1930s and three decades later became a US Senator from California . This lofty position failed to dampen his enthusiasm for sports competition , however . Most politicians seem content to sit in the stands and watch others perform . They throw out the first ball at major league baseball games and such . But Senator Cranston appeared one winter to run the 50-yard dash at a San Francisco indoor track meet in a special race for men over 50 . At the starting line , he removed his sweat pants--and his shorts along with them . The exposure did not seem to harm his next reelection campaign . <p> Cranston ran on one of our sprint relay teams in London . After the race he came up to me in the stands and asked , " How did I look ? " <p> " You looked great ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how did I look against the other runners on my leg ? " <p> While I had watched Alan high-stepping down the back straight-away , I could not recall the other runners around him . But I had a bit of the politician in me as well . " You ate them up ! " I announced . <p> A broad smile crossed the face of the senior senator from California . <p> Alphonse Juilland , head of Stanford 's linguistics department , also traveled with us to Europe . As a boy , he competed in the sprints in his native France , but World War II halted a promising athletic career . He began jogging again at Stanford , got to know members of the track team and attended the West Coast Relays to watch Bill Toomey perform . <p> The program featured a 100-yard dash for senior runners , and several of Alphonse 's students pulled him out of the stands , demanding he compete . Wearing a borrowed pair of shoes , he placed second , pulling a leg muscle while doing so . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at running 11.0 for 100 yards , and while 50 years old he ran that distance in 10.5 seconds . <h> The dangers faced by older athletes <p> While traveling by boat from Helsinki to Stockholm , one evening I questioned Juilland about the dangers that older athletes faced by taking part in an explosive event like the 100 yard dash . Older men traditionally have raced in long-distance events . Clarence DeMar won the Boston Marathon seven times and continued running that event until age 65 . But no sane man would attempt a marathon--or even a mile--without training . Because 100 yards is so short , there remained the danger that once-fast athletes might jump into such a race with inadequate preparation and injure , or even kill , themselves . <p> " I 'll admit some danger , " Alphonse replied . " But older sprinters must prepare for competition by becoming long-distance runners first--then working down to shorter distances at faster speeds . They probably should obtain a thorough medical checkup before starting--not just a regular electrocardiogram , but a dynamic electrocardiogram in which a trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hard enough to find a doctor with time enough to take your temperature these days much less give you a thorough exam , " I commented . <p> " True , " Alphonse admitted . " But I think maybe we harbor too many fears about what men past 40 can accomplish . We age ourselves prematurely by thinking old . Take Adolfo Consolini . At age 47 , he still held the Italian record in the discus and continued to throw . He was the best thrower in his country and one of the best in the world . But according to Italy 's athletic rules , nobody past the age of 45 could compete . So Adolfo had to join a Swiss club and compete in his home country as a foreigner . " <p> I understood what Alphonse meant . The average citizen does not expect people in their 40s , 50s , 60s and even beyond to compete in such a demanding sport as track and field . But then Masters athletes were not average citizens-or if they began as such , they soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember a conversation I overheard while in Victoria Station one afternoon during our trip . Because of traffic , it was easier to get to the Crystal Palace Sports Centre , where we were competing , by train than by taxi . While buying tickets , we stood in line dressed in our uniforms : red-white-and-blue sweat suits with " US Masters " on the back , striped running shoes , tote bags for our spikes , some of us carrying javelins and poles . <p> Behind me in line , a woman asked her husband , " Who are all these people in the athletic uniforms ? " <p> Her husband shrugged , " They ca n't be runners . They 're too old . " <h> They were not too old <p> But , of course , we were not too old . That was the lesson taught us by David H. R. Pain . If Kenneth H. Cooper , MD , is the Messiah of older athletes , Pain is their Moses . He led them out of the desert and into the green pastures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre de Coubertin , the Frenchman who in 1896 almost single-handedly instituted the modern Olympic movement . David Pain , in similar fashion , was the singular force responsible for the outburst of athletic activity for oldsters , not only in Masters track and field but also ( through the example set in that sport ) in many other athletic areas . <p> But then David H. R. Pain is a singular individual . Lawyer , promoter , jogger , the man who brought the Batmobile to San Diego , he embodies the characteristics of Buddha and Daddy Warbucks . It is not merely that , with head as bald as a torpedo , he bears a superficial resemblance to both . It is more his philosophy of life . <p> First , in his quest for physical fitness , he seems to follow the principles of Buddhism , namely , that right living , correct thinking , and self-denial will enable the soul to reach a divine state of release from earthly sorrow and bodily pain . Second , as Daddy Warbucks might , he not only assumes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of my program " ) , but he also does not hesitate to use force ( a karate chop here , a lawsuit there ) to bring the fruits of a better life to everybody . <p> " People who are nice never accomplish anything , " states David Pain . " Anytime I 've tried to be nice-on those rare occasions somebody has spit on me . I learned as a lawyer you have to be willing to turn the screw . If not , you 're in the wrong business . " <p> David Pain never has hesitated to turn the screw . One time , he talked the San Diego Track Club into grabbing sponsorship of the profitable San Diego Indoor Games , causing the ousted meet promoter to label him a " bald pirate . " On another occasion , the police arrested Pain for refusing to stop jogging on a municipal golf course . The arresting officer accused him of being a " ding-aling . " In 1968 , he organized the first national track and field championships for men in their 40s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Pain also feuds frequently with the press . A sports commentator acting as guest speaker at a San Diego Track Club banquet advised recruiting name athletes to club membership for their publicity value . Pain took the microphone afterward and retorted that anyone with a girth as ample as that of the commentator should not lecture on physical fitness . The commentator stormed out . <p> At a banquet for an amateur theatrics group , Pain found his conversation hindered by a rock band and asked them to play more softly . When they refused , he pulled the plug on their amplifier . On our tour to Europe in 1972 , David and I had dinner following a cross-country meet in London with a number of competitors . The wife of one of the runners lit a cigarette . David told her , please put it out or leave the room ! <p> " David is a bit feisty and just like a woodchuck , " suggests San Diego Track Club member Bill Gookin . " Have you ever encountered a woodchuck ? They 're constantly busybodying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion in the early 1960s when his law firm had as a client Silver Gate Productions which organized the major custom car shows in Southern California . David became involved part-time in management of the company , thus his encounter with the Batmobile . At the height of the Batman craze , he contracted for the appearance of that car one weekend at the San Diego Custom Car Show . Unfortunately , by opening night Friday , the TV producers had fallen behind schedule and the Caped Crusader was still driving the Batmobile around a Hollywood set in his fight against the forces of evil . <p> " We displayed a notice that the Batmobile would not appear , " recalls Pain . " We gave rain checks to anybody who complained . The next morning , we got confirmation that that car was on a flatbed truck coming down from Hollywood . I got the bright idea to ask the Highway Patrol to let me know when the Batmobile reached the San Diego County line . Sure enough , around 10 , I got word that the car had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disc jockeys and alerted them that the Batmobile was on its way , and as the car moved down the coast I kept getting more reports from the Highway Patrol who thought this was something of a lark . By the time we opened the doors at noon , there were 5000 people waiting . The fire marshals finally had to close the doors because of the crowd . " <p> While moonlighting as a custom car entrepreneur , Pain first encountered Al Franken , a sports promoter from the Los Angeles area . Franken sponsored many of the major track meets on the West Coast . <p> In 1964 , Franken started a major outdoor meet in San Diego . The following year , he helped bring the National AAU Track and Field Championships to that city . He founded the San Diego Indoor Games . And in 1966 , he allowed a San Diego attorney to talk him into allowing an event for runners over 40 in his outdoor meet . <p> The winning time in this first-ever " Masters mile " was slower than five minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David H. R. Pain , the attorney who suggested the race . That Masters mile proved so successful that other meet promoters eventually copied it , and the avalanche of athletic competition for oldsters had begun . Although David Pain had no way of knowing it at the time , this avalanche would propel him into a position of leadership in the track world . <h> The remarkable Pain <p> David Holland Rose Pain was born in Taplow , Buckinghamshire , England , on July 31 , 1922 . When he was five , his family moved to Windsor , Ontario , where his father worked on a Ford assembly line . They later settled in California because of David 's health . <p> " Smog had n't been invented yet , " he comments , " and California was considered the ultimate place for people with consumption . " <p> He started his own gardening business while attending North Hollywood High School , prospering to the point where he had four assistants caring for 22 yards . His senior year , he quit attending classes , though stopping by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he not , early in 1941 , enlisted in the Navy , which assigned him to the SS Washington , a luxury liner converted into a troop transport . On the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor , Pain stood on the fantail of his ship off the South African coast and watched two torpedoes , fired by a lurking German submarine , narrowly miss blowing him to pieces . <p> The Washington sailed into Singapore under fog that prevented attacking Japanese airplanes from locating them and deposited the last reinforcements to that city , men whose later prison experiences inspired " The Bridge on the River Kwai . " The ship next sailed to Port Said to pick up the famous " Rats of Tobruk , " Australians who had spent two years defending that city against Rommel . <p> For three years , the SS Washington sailed the South Pacific , transporting fresh troops one direction , wounded the other , with David Pain more an observer than a participant in the shooting war . He finally applied for a commission through the Navy 's V-12 program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning his commission , he became eligible for discharge . Having previously dropped out of high school , he now dropped out of college , but nevertheless earned entry to the University of Southern California law school , where he met his future wife , Helen . He married Helen the following spring , honeymooned one weekend in San Diego and after graduation ( his first ) began practicing law in that city . <p> While establishing his own firm in Ocean Beach , he supplemented the family diet , and satisfied his own competitive urge , by surfing and spearfishing . " To this day I can go out and get my limit of abalone , " he says . Helen learned how to make abalone pancakes , ab-waffles , ab-spaghetti and ab-burgers . Before the birth of the first of their four children , David got bored waiting in the hospital , and went out and caught a 15-pound lobster . <p> His law practice gradually expanded , and he added several partners , including Bob Pippen , who climbs mountains in his spare time . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pippen . " He 's tenacious at digging out details " Pain is tenacious enough to have been threatened more than once for contempt of court . " The only thing Pain does n't get chewed out about is long hair , " says Pippen . Several years ago , Pain helped win the largest wrongful death verdict in San Diego County : $470,000 to the widow of a man killed in a commercial airline crash . <h> All four feet <p> Too-frequent colds caused him to abandon surfing and skin-diving . He learned to fly . As a Los Angeles Rams season ticket holder , he often went to games by air . On one occasion , he found himself lost above the overcast in his twin-engine Beechcraft Bonanza with a failing battery , a nonfunctioning radio and his entire family . Fortunately , a hole appeared in the clouds , enabling him to land in El Cajon . The experience sobered him . He sold the plane , a decision made easier by the arrival in town of the San Diego Chargers . <p> He had begun playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing competitive trips to Los Angeles and San Francisco . <p> " David ca n't be involved a little bit in anything , " says friend Merle Hamilton . " When he goes in , it 's with all four feet . " <p> Pain fought with the club directors who refused to install different sidewalls despite their being ruined by paddleball players , quit the club and eventually dropped handball . <p> " First , I was n't getting enough exercise , " he says . " Second , it was too much of a hassle reserving courts and locating opponents . Third , I was getting home too late evenings . I started jogging mornings with my dog . " <p> It did not take David Pain long to locate other joggers . One of them was Augie Escamilla , a student counselor at San Diego State , who worked out Sunday mornings with a group of older runners . For 12 years , Pain had spent Sunday mornings singing in the choir of the First Presbyterian Church . <p> " I enjoyed it , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But he dropped out of the choir to jog with Augie 's group . <p> " For me to go to church on Sunday now is a total drag , " admits Pain . " I 'd rather go out and run for an hour . I have received more mental comfort from my running than from all the sermons I previously heard . There is something about being able to run on a beach or in a park in the quiet of nature that totally relieves you of the burdens of modem living . You develop an inner peace . You eliminate the turmoils and emotional stresses . I do n't think runners make good churchgoers , and it 's for this very reason . " <p> Running also caused Pain to abandon his seat on the 50-yard line at Charger games . " I 'd rather be a participant than an observer , " he says . Jogging , however , failed to satisfy Pain 's natural competitive urge the way handball did . Handball players were much better organized competitively . They even had special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . The handball players adopted the term " Masters " to describe players in that category . <p> The US Handball Association added a Masters category to its national championships in 1952 in recognition of the fact that handball , because of the many bounces a ball can take off four surrounding walls , was a very difficult game to master . Once a player learns the angles , however , he often can play a control pattern game , rarely having to move more than a step or two in either direction . Shrewd , mature players thus can play handball against faster , yet less experienced , players without excessive strain . Masters competition proved so popular that the US Handball Association later added Golden Masters ( 50 and over ) and Super Masters ( 60 and over ) divisions at its national championships . <p> David Pain reasoned logically : If such age divisions worked for handball , why would n't they be appropriate for track and field ? He approached Al Franken , promoter of the San Diego outdoor meet , with this radical idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for older runners . <p> It was an idea whose time had come . The Masters mile was reasonably popular with spectators but even more so with competitors . During the President Kennedy-inspired fitness boom in the early 1960s , older runners had been inspired to run in gyms , on tracks , along roads , in parks , with no way of measuring their achievement-and very little applause . Masters miles soon sprung up in other parts of the country . Two years after the first one in San Diego , David Pain took one step further and organized a full-event Masters track and field meet . <h> Spotty and ludicrous competition <p> Competition at this first national championships for older runners was spotty and sometimes ludicrous . One runner appeared for the start of the 100-yard dash wearing house slippers with elastic bands to keep them on his feet . A shot putter sewed lace on his gym shorts . A smattering of Olympians--George Rhoden , Bob Richards , Bud Held--added class to early meets , but most participants had not competed in 20 years , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : grandfather jocks . <p> As the Masters movement progressed , competition became tougher . Yet while improving in excellence , the Masters program did not lose its humanity : joggers still remained much a part of the scene . Division into five-year categories helped equalize competition . The Masters program also created an anomaly : men in their late 30s eagerly anticipated their 40th birthday . <p> Pain discovered he was not alone in being bored with being a spectator . He originally planned his veterans ' tour of Europe in 1972 to attend the Olympic Games , with Masters track meets in England and Germany only diversions . When it seemed Olympic tickets at Munich might be scarce , he arranged alternate competitions in Helsinki , Stockholm and Copenhagen . Olympic tickets later became plentiful , but most tour members by then had decided they would rather run in Scandinavia than watch in Munich . <p> The early Masters meets in San Diego may not have been artistic successes , but incredibly they earned large sums of money--largely because of the promotional zeal of David H. R. Pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice show to benefit the Arthritis Foundation , using a telephone soliciting company to sell $42,000 worth of tickets . Never one to abandon a good idea , Pain convinced the Arthritis Foundation to cosponsor the first Masters meet . After all , what better publicity vehicle for such a charity than a bunch of old men running around a track ? In the meet 's first two years , this relationship earned the San Diego Track Club $5000 and $10,000 respectively . <p> " Lord knows what I would have made the third year if the club had n't found out what I was doing , " he says . <p> According to Ken Bernard , " It was the boilerhouse promotion outfit David had selling tickets : 50 solicitors in cubbyholes telephoning everybody in town . But people who bought tickets in January would n't come to the meet in July . This irritated many members . " <p> They became further irritated when Pain had to sue the telephone soliciting company to recover the money . The San Diego Track Club quietly severed relations with its cosponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet , first getting the Amateur Athletic Union to recognize it as the national championships beginning in 1971 , then getting the AAU to amend its rules to permit former professionals , assuming they were over 40 , to compete in Masters competition . Former professional boxer Chuck Davey , who once fought Kid Gavilan for the world middleweight title , now competes as an amateur runner . Wes Santee , barred by the AAU in the mid-1950s for accepting money for running the mile , returned to competition . Many track coaches , also considered " professionals , " found they could run again . Among them was Stanford and Olympic Coach Payton Jordan , who had been a world record-holder in his youth . He soon began setting world records for sprinters in their 50s . <h> Other windmills <p> Pain found other windmills to test with his lance . San Diego runners frequently took early morning workouts on private golf courses where they attracted little more than friendly waves from greenskeepers . On municipal golf courses , however , they often were abused by the management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one public 36-hole course not far from Pain 's La Jolla home : Torrey Pines , the site of the annual Andy Williams tournament . <p> To protest this situation , Pain appeared at a park board meeting with Olympic champion Billy Mills . The board merely referred to committee their suggestion that joggers be allowed on public courses . Pain began to escalate the conflict , making certain he ran past the first tee , and the manager 's office , on his morning run . On one occasion , he led a group of club runners through the grounds on a jog-in . Another time , a high school athletic breakfast at Torrey Pines provided the occasion for a mass workout on the fairways . Several times , the manager chased Pain in a golf cart and even tried to use a truck to run him down . Pain became adept at broken-field running . <p> Finally , one Sunday morning a policeman appeared , called by the management , to issue Pain a misdemeanor ticket for being on the golf course without having paid a greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to jog in circles around the police car . The officer , dizzy , suggested they meet at the club parking lot . <p> " The officer was quite polite , " remembers Pain . " He was only doing his job . " <p> But then a police lieutenant arrived with another officer in a second squad car and began screaming at Pain , using obscenities , and calling him a " ding-a-ling . " He ordered Pain spread-eagled and frisked . David 's dog , Suzie , normally the most docile of animals , began barking loudly . <p> " Grab that dog ! " snapped the lieutenant , and when one of the officers obeyed , Suzie bit him on the hand . <p> Pain was handcuffed , thrown into the back of the squad car , allowed to simmer in the hot sun , driven to the county jail , thrown into a cell with several drunks sleeping it off , and only several hours later was permitted to phone his wife . <p> " Hi , Helen , " David began . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no cash on hand and had to run to their oldest son Randy to borrow the money . Randy considered the request for a moment : " Now would Dad bail me out under similar circumstances ? " <p> The arrest made the front page of the San Diego Tribune and was carried across the country by the wire services , not because of any sympathy for David H. R. Pain , gentleman jogger , but because Suzie had bitten the arresting officer . Later , Pain appeared in court where the presiding judge declared him not guilty of the misdemeanor of not having paid a greens fee since the course management could not sell joggers tickets , anyway . At a later meeting of the park board , the public golf courses were declared open to joggers as long as they did not interfere with the golfers . There is some sentiment among runners to have a brass plaque erected on the course commemorating the Battle of Torrey Pines . <h> A means of keeping score <p> Runners now train freely on public golf courses , but dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park near his office . Evenings after work , he runs on the beach at LaJolla Shores or at a nearby track . When he lived in LaJolla , he sometimes ran from his home to his office in Ocean Beach , a distance of eight miles . Before he installed a shower in his office , he would pause on the doorstep to squirt himself with a garden hose . <p> " He once had a meeting with two little old ladies , " recalls Bob Pippen , " and all he had on was trunks . The average attorney does n't do that . " <p> In his law practice , Pain mostly has abandoned the general work to his partners while accepting only large cases that personally intrigue him . " I 'm quite benign in my practice of law now , " he admits . <p> He is less benign when it comes to athletics . After an operation in the spring of 1972 to remove a malignant mole on one leg , he returned to running too soon , ripping the stitches . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " For some it 's alcohol or women . These character problems become apparent particularly after men get into their 40s . This is when men turn to booze , split up with their wives , become overaggressive in business . As a lawyer , I run into these men all the time . They are totally amoral in their pursuit of the dollar , the making of the deal , the crunching under of their business opponents . These men are not necessarily interested in personal riches . Making money is merely a means of keeping score . They would just as soon put you in bankruptcy if they were playing for matches . " <p> Pain cites the example of one wealthy businessman who briefly became active in Masters track , ran extremely well , won several races , but lost others and eventually quit competing possibly because he could not stand being second in anything . " He approached running by hysterically jetting from one race to another and standing on the starting line with a telephone in one hand , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running : using it to get rid of excess tension . Instead , it was making him more tense . " <p> Pain also suggests that running can act as an aphrodisiac : " It can help men with their sex problems . Men who turn 40 frequently have real ego problems associated with sex and approaching inadequacy . In my law practice , I 've handled hundreds of divorce cases . Very frequently , the woman 's complaint was that their husband , even while very young , never got any exercise . He just let himself turn into a vegetable . " <h> The secret of age-group competition <p> As the manager at Torrey Pines can attest , David H. R. Pain has not entirely sublimated his own aggressive tendencies in his running , but he is trying . " David always was bullheaded , " admits Helen Pain . Pain 's bullheadedness , however , has been the main reason why Masters track became established as a permanent fixture in the athletic world . <p> He refuses to claim all the credit : " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me recently when I visited him in San Diego . " It has to come along at the right time . But I do think Masters track is the most significant new thing to arise in a very old sport . People now can continue to participate even though their abilities have diminished . And this is the secret of Masters track , something that we must never lose sight of . It 's the secret of age-group competition . We have had age-group competition for years with kids . Now we have all these old guys competing and having a wonderful time , because now they can win an event instead of being at the end of the pack . <p> " It 's a chance to relive their youth . Either they missed athletics as a youth , like me , or they were in athletics and enjoyed it and this provides a chance to get back . There is a certain camaraderie in the sport , which is what gives me the motivation to try and stay fit . I do n't think I 'd train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like our trip to Sweden ( for the World Veterans Championships ) this summer , for example . I probably would n't travel . I 'd stay home or go backpacking somewhere on holiday . Now , I 've become a world traveler as a result of the Masters program . <p> " The danger is that a sort of elitism is developing , particularly among people who only want to win , and see the program as merely a means of amassing more trophies and more medals . I think the American Medical Joggers and the National Jogging Association have the right approach , and that is to include everybody and not be so obsessed with individual performances . The only trouble is that track and field does n't lend itself to not trying hard . You ca n't say , ' Well , fellows , let 's run a mile on the track and not pay attention to who wins or your times . ' That 's not track and field . <p> " If you are going to have a program in track and field where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing and measuring field performances in centimeters , people are going to look at those performances . It 's inherent in the beast . I 've been trying to run a five-minute mile since the day I got into Masters track . I 've never succeeded . I got to 5:07 once , and that 's my best . But five minutes is still my objective , and its people who are stimulated by such challenges who are led into the Masters program . " <p> David H. R. Pain paused as he said that , perhaps realizing that he had become the Baron Pierre de Coubertin of the grandfather jocks . " You know , " he finally said , " I get more compensation out of the Masters program because I can feel paternalistic about it . I can talk in terms of my program , and there 's an ego trip involved in knowing you are somewhat instrumental in creating a program that 's not only rewarding to yourself but rewarding to others .
