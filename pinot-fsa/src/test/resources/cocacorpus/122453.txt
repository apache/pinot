Relative number is used when you want to add or subtract a value from the existing number .

But when the creation date changes to 20111120 the increment goes further where it ended with the 20111117 date ! Is there a way to automate that at a new date the increment starts again at 1 ? The work around now is to only rename the same creation dates as one batch , it works fine but in this eara of automation .......... It could be that I overlooked the feature , than sorry ! Thanks ! <p> Reply to #1 : I think you need to look at Name Collision Rules LONG ... hp ? ident=namecollisionrules . If you use the Append Incrementing Number rule you can add a number to all files ending up with the same name . Instead you using &lt;Img Year&gt;&lt;Img Month&gt;&lt;Img Day&gt;&lt;Inc nr&gt; you can use &lt;Img Year&gt;&lt;Img Month&gt;&lt;Img Day&gt; and whenever to files end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incrementing number .

To see the complete list of changes and bugfixes please click her . <h> Version 3.77 <p> 17. apr. 2017Rename file pairs with the same new filename <p> A file pair is when the base name is the same but the extension differ , like this pair : Img2021.jpg Img2021.tif <p> When renamig those and keeping the file paired up while using tags like &lt;Inc Nr&gt; , mark the checkbox " Rename file pairs with the same new filename " in the Settings window . When done , using this pattern in the New Name method : Italy&lt;Inc Nr:001&gt; <p> This can also be used to transfer meta data values from the original file to the other member of the pair . Ex. by using the tag &lt;Img Width&gt; and &lt;Img Height&gt; . <h> Version 3.75 <p> 6. mar. 2017New tag : &lt;Rand Str&gt; <p> In addition to the existing &lt;Rand&gt; tag which only supports random numbers , a tag for adding random strings has been added . The new tag can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Values override <p> Advanced Renamer can rename files based on GPS coordinates embedded in image files , adding country and city to the file names . This is very useful for photos taken with iPhones . Finding the correct city is not as easy as one would imagine . The geo database contains many cities of varying sizes . Advanced Renamer chooses the best possible match by distance and size of the city . This is most often correct , but sometimes it is needed to correct the city . This can now be done by clicking the GPS Values buttons and overriding the collected information . The button will light up when GPS tags like the &lt;GPS City&gt; or &lt;GPS Country&gt; is present in one or more methods . <p> Metadata batch write ( registered users only ) <p> In addition to renaming files Advanced Renamer can now also change embedded metadata like the Date Taken value of JPG EXIF metadata . Most JPG EXIF values can be changed this way . The window for doing this is simple and requires some manual work . But it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change metadata . The Action menu can be used to copy the value of one file to all the other files . <h> Version 3.73 <p> 21. aug. 2016List replace method <p> Even though Advanced Renamer supports using multiple methods in one batch , and even using the same method multiple times , it can be time consuming when you want to replace many different text phrases . For that the List replace method is easier to use . Text phrases in the left column is replaced with the corresponding value in the right column . <h> Version 3.71 <p> 15. feb. 2016Name collision rule : Ignore <p> The new Ignore name collision rule will allow the program to skip items in the list when the target filename already exists . This also applies to duplicates found by examining the complete list of files in the batch and predict any duplicates . <h> Version 3.61 <p> 14. jan. 2014Window for configuring the command line utility <p> The command line version of Advanced Renamer has been included within the package for many years but now you can also configure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The window can be used to configure the command switches available in the command line in an easier way than typing directly in the console . When done the command can be copied to the clipboard for later insertion in the command line terminal or the command can be saved in a . bat file for execution . The new window is available from the Program -&gt; Command line configuration menu item <p> New tags : &lt;Dec Nr&gt; and &lt;File Line&gt; <p> Two new tags have been added in this release . The &lt;Dec Nr&gt; tag will add a decrementing number to the filename . Usually the &lt;Inc Nr&gt; tag and a reverse sort will do , but there are circumstanses when a decrementing tag is desirable . <p> The new &lt;File Line&gt; tag works line the &lt;File Content&gt; tag but yields a whole line , by line number , to the file name . <h> Version 3.59 <p> 18. aug. 2013New tags : &lt;Video Title&gt; and &lt;Video Genre&gt; <p> If available in the video files added to Advanced Renamer , the two new tags &lt;Video Title&gt; and &lt;Video Genre&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filename . Do n't get these tags confused with the &lt;TVShow Title&gt; and &lt;TVShow Genres&gt; which download the meta information from a database on the Internet instead of retrieving the information for the file meta data , <p> Control zero padding in date/time based tags <p> Until now it has not been possible to add date and time based values to file names without padding values below ten with zeros . All the date and time based tags can now be customized like this : Year tags : &lt;Year:00&gt; for 2 digit years . Day tags : &lt;Day:0&gt; for 1 digit days when below 10 . Hour , Min , Sec tags : &lt;Hour:0&gt; for 1 digit hour below 10 . <p> This apply to all date/time based tags including Img , Created , Modified , and TVShow . <p> Month tag output has always been customizable like this : &lt;Month:0&gt; for 1 digit months when below 10. &lt;Month:00&gt; for leading zeros up to 2 digits . &lt;Month:xxx&gt; for short textual month ( jan , feb etc. ) . &lt;Month:Xxx&gt; for short textual month with first character in upper case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textual in upper case ( JAN , FEB etc. ) . &lt;Month:xxxx&gt; for long textual month ( january , february etc. ) . &lt;Month:Xxxx&gt; for long textual with first character in upper case ( January , February etc. ) . &lt;Month:XXXX&gt; for long textual in all upper case ( JANUARY , FEBRUARY etc . ) . For textual month the local Advanced Renamer language is used . <h> Version 3.55 <p> 26. feb. 2013Import information from TV shows <p> With a new import functionality , TV show information can be imported from tvmaze.com . Information about show name , episode name , season and episode number , and air date are available through tags after successful import . For this to work a working internet connection is required and it is also necessary for the files in the list to be ordered correctly . Multiple seasons of the same show can be renamed at once , but multiple independent tv shows must be renamed one at a time . New tags are : &lt;TVShow Genres&gt; , &lt;TVShow Year&gt; , &lt;TVShow Title&gt; , &lt;TVShow Season&gt; , &lt;TVShow EpisodeNumber&gt; , &lt;TVShow Day&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CSV file import <p> Advanced Renamer has always been able to save the file list as a CSV file . Now you can also import a file list from a CSV file . The import window will help configure the import settings . If the file contains a column for new filenames , a List method will be added prepopulated with the new names . <p> New method : Swap <p> A new rather simple method has been added for this relase . It is a method that can swap to parts of a filename divided by a separator . It can be used to swap artist and track name for a music file or season number and episode name for a tv show . <h> Version 3.53 <p> 27. sep . 2012New checksum tags <p> The new checksum tags &lt;MD5&gt; , &lt;SHA1&gt; , and &lt;SHA256&gt; can be used to insert the checksum in the name of the file to be renamed . <h> Version 3.50 <p> 20. aug. 2012Unicode support <p> With the release of version 3.5 Advanced Renamer gets Unicode support . Unicode is a character set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until now the software has yielded unpredictable results when mixing say Chinese characters with English characters . Extraction of meta data from images and audio files will now also work proberly when they contain characters from a different codepage than what the local Windows installation is configured to use . <p> New image formats <p> Support has been added for JPEG 2000 and the 3D JPEG formats MPO and JPS. 3D JPEGs are special images containing two images skewed to form a 3D picture on display devices with support for these formats . Advanced Renamer can read image size from the files and Exif information will also be extracted if present . <p> Script method <p> For those of you with programming skills this new script method based on Mozilla SpiderMonkey 's implementation of JavaScript , will supply many new possibilities . This method is meant for the advanced users of an already advanced piece of software . By constructing a small script file names can be changed in much more complex ways . Also , this method will make it easier for myself to help those of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitate to contact me about your specific renaming task . Documentation and examples of use will be added as soon as possible . Also the JavaScript MDN can be of great help . <p> ExifTool integration <p> Advanced Renamer has support for many file formats including music , video and image formats but now Advanced Renamer has got support for even more meta data information by integrating Phil Harveys ExifTool . When a file is selected in Advanced Renamer the ExifTool button can be used to get an overview of all the meta data information ExifTool support for this particular file . The new tag &lt;ExifTool&gt; can be used to extract these meta data and put them into new file names . Even though native support is preferred , adding new file formats takes time and since this tool is already available , why not make a good use of it . <p> Disable active methods <p> When a method in the method panel is deactivated it will be ignored by the batch process . It is an alternative to removing the method from the panel altogether . <p> Explorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until now the " Add to Advanced Renamer " right click context menu has only been working when using a 32 bit version of Windows . Any 64 bit users could use Advanced Renamer but not the explorer context menu . Now both users of 32 bit nad 64 bit Windows can enable the menu from the settings windows of Advanced Renamer . <p> Folder panel <p> There are many ways to add files and folders to Advanced Renamer : Drag &amp; drop from Windows explorer , Add files menu item , explorer context menu , and the Insert keyboard shortcut . Now Advanced Renamer has got another way of adding items to the list . Click the " Folder panel " menu item in the top of the window and a panel displaying folders and files is enabled . <h> Version 3.20 <p> 17. january 2012Command line automation <p> In this version of Advanced Renamer a special command line executable has been included . This executable ( arenc.exe ) can execute a batch represented by a batch method file and a list of files and folders to perform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of performing batches is meant for users with special needs and a high degree of computer experience . The command line tool can be used as a scheduled job in a server environment or as part of another batch job . <p> New tags : Video tags <p> With the new video tags you can add video information to the file name . A large variety of formats and codecs are supported , including DivX , XviD , WMV , MKV , OGM , and many more . <p> With the new tags you can work with these video and audio information : Width , Height , FrameRate , Duration , Codec , and Bitrate <p> Many modern digital cameras and smart phone cameras can record GPS coordinates inside the pictures they take . In this version new latitude and longitude tags can be appended to the file names . But numeric coordinates is not very informative . Three new tags can be used to add the city , country , and state to the file names . When these tags are used , the coordinates are used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ database . <p> New method : Trim <p> This is probably the simplest of all the methods . This new method will remove characters present in the text box from the beginning and the end of file name . Other methods can already handle this job but this methods makes it easier and faster to do . <p> New method : Renumber <p> This clever method can detect existing numbers in file name and replace them with new number sequences or adjust the existing numbers . The method can be used to adjust a sequence of unordered numbered names e.g. 003. txt , 004. txt , 006. txt can be changed to 001. txt , 002. txt , 004. txt . This task was previously an impossible one with Advanced Renamer . <h> Version 3.15 <p> 29. october 2011New tags : File size <p> Add the size of the file to the new file name . You decide if the file size should be added as bytes , kilobytes , megabytes , or gigabytes . <h> Version 3.13 <p> 25. september 2011 New method : Remove pattern <p> The Replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a filename by supplying an empty text in the field " replace with " , but this was not always obvious to new users . This new method is easy shorthand for using the Replace method to remove patterns from a filename . <p> List method : Apply to button <p> Most methods have the Apply To select box to specify which parts of the filename the method should apply to . The List method has been missing this select box for some time , but now it available to this method too . Most often the only thing you want to change is the name and not the extension of the file , but in some cases you also want to apply the method to the extension . <p> Last result box <p> Previously when the program was done performing the rename the progress dialog would stay on screen until the user chose an action in the window . It has been changed to close automatically and instead show the result of the batch in the lower right corner of the main window . If one or more errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the dialog closing . After running a batch files that are either erroneous or successful can be re-added . <p> Display of unchanged columns <p> Advanced Renamer has columns for original values and columns containing the corresponding new values . In this version the columns containing the new values will become gray if there is no change to the value . It is most notable when setting up a rename batch where some files will end up with the same name as before the rename . <h> Version 3.10 <p> 8. july 2011New tag : Word <p> The new Word tag can be used to extract a word from the file name . The parameter in the tag defines which word should be extracted . &lt;Word:3&gt; will extract the third word of the file name . Characters considered word separators can be set up in the settings window . <p> New tag : Img Subsec <p> Some digital cameras support a burst mode where the camera takes several pictures in one snap . When naming these images based on Exif date and time values they often end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same second . Fortunately some of these cameras store an extra time value called sub second . This value can be used to sort and name the images correctly . <p> Name collision rule changes <p> Before this release the name collision was set up once in the settings dialog . Since different renaming scenarios require different name collision rules , this was not the best place for it . It has been moved to the main window above the list to make it easier to set up the rules specific for the current batch . Two new rules have also been added : Append Image Subsecond and Append Pattern . The Append Image Subsecond will add the value from the Exif Subsecond meta value while the Append Pattern will allow you to add a custom pattern to the end of a file in case two files end up with the same file name . The separator between the file name and the appended part can also be customized . <p> Select desired Exif value for image date and time <p> Jpeg images contains various date time values , date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken . These timestamps are usually the same , but they can differ if the image has been edited with photo editing software like Photoshop , Exif date time values can change . In the settings window of Advanced Renamer you can change which value you want to use for the image date time tags and for the image date time column . <p> Method preset file association <p> In the past method presets were stored in the same location as other settings . This made it difficult to share the presets between computers , friends , or colleagues . Method presets are now saved in custom locations in files with a . aren extension . This allows you to find the presets faster and open Advanced Renamer with a preset preloaded . <p> Insert tag window updated <p> When working with tags you can click the little button next to the edit field and work with the tags in the Insert Tag Window . This window has been updated with extra functionality for field supporting numeric values as an alternative to tags and it has been updated with information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used more places than before a description of how to use them was needed . <p> New Case method : Change case based on pattern <p> If you only want to change the case of a part of the file name as opposed to the complete file name you can use this new pattern based option in the New Case method . You can supply a pattern including tags and/or regular expressions that should get changed to either lower or upper case . <p> Use search pattern in Add , Remove , and Move method <p> The fields in Add , Remove , and Move method can now also handle search patterns with tags . The pattern it automatically translated into a numeric position in the file name . If the Use Regular Expressions checkbox is checked the search pattern will also support regular expressions . Of course you can also type a numeric value directly as always . <h> Version 3.0 <p> 3. mar. 2011New batch modes : Copy and move <p> In addition to renaming files and folders Advanced Renamer can now also copy and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edit field next to the batch mode drop down box . Tags can be used to customize the folder name for each item in the list individually . The New Path column can be used to validate the new path name before starting the batch process . Any folder in the path will be automatically created when the file is copied or moved . <p> Selective rename <p> Choose only to rename some of the files in the list by manipulating the checkbox next to the files . By default all files will be marked for batch processing but you can choose which ones you want to rename . Use the associated functions in the right click menu to use this feature more effectively . <p> Set file timestamps from pattern in filename or directory name <p> If you have files with dates or timestamps in the file name you want copied to the created or modified attribute of the file Advanced Renamer can now recognize the values based on a pattern . The &lt;Year&gt; , &lt;Month&gt; , &lt;Day&gt; , &lt;Hour&gt; , &lt;Min&gt; , and &lt;Sec&gt; tags can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . <p> Context menu " Add to Advanced Renamer " in Windows Explorer <p> A Windows Explorer context menu has been added to make it easier to add files and folders to the list . Right click on one or more items in Explorer and select " Add to Advanced Renamer " to add the items to the list.Note : This feature has to be enabled in the settings dialog . <p> New tag : Substr <p> A new advanced tag called &lt;Substr&gt; has been introduced . The tag can be used to insert a piece of the original filename into the new file name . The tag takes two parameters , an index and a count . Example : Filename is " Hello my friend " and the tag is configured &lt;Substr:7:2&gt; the result will yield " my " . But it gets more interesting when using the tag for searching for phrases . The index and count can be text phrases instead of numbers . Example : Filename is still " Hello my friend " but the tag is now configured &lt;Substr : : 2&gt; . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters from index 7 we search for the first space character and copy 2 characters from that location . This is useful when using this tag on several files with a similar pattern but with name parts of various lengths . This tag is especially useful for customizing the output folder when using Move or Copy mode . <p> Menu item for removing non ID3 and non image files from the list <p> In addition to the option of removing files with errors you can now also remove all files without ID3 tag or image information . <p> When dragging files from Windows Explorer into Advanced Renamer , there is no doubt how the items should be added . But when dragging folders into the list there is two ways these folders can be added , either as the files in the folders or the actual folders for folder rename . When adding the folders as files you get the choice of including subfolders and to supply a filename mask . This dialog will also show when adding folders through the Windows Explorer context menu . <p> Stay current with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check for upgrades online and display a message if a new version is available . It will not take focus away from the current task but simply just state the fact that a new version can be downloaded . <p> Save to CSV file <p> If you want to save all the data shown in the grid to a CSV you can use this new feature . You will then be able to work with the file or folder data in another program like Microsoft Excel .

It will use the text starting a position POS in the filename and copy COUNT characters . If FILENAME is specified , Advanced Renamer will search for the text phrase in that file . If FILENAME is omitted the file which is being renamed is used . <p> Will insert a part of the original filename into the new name . The POS and COUNT parameters are used to define what part of the filename that will get copyed . Example of use : &lt;Substr:5:2&gt; will return " wa " for the filename " The walking man.txt " . <p> The parameters do n't have to be numeric indexes , they can also be text strings to search for in the filename . Example of use : &lt;Substr:ki:an&gt; will return " ng m " for " The walking man.txt " . The following will yield the same result : &lt;Substr:ki:4&gt; <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number in the filename you can put the search term in quotes . Example of use : &lt;Substr : " 2 " : 2&gt; will return " nd " for " The 2nd door.txt " . <p> The optional START parameter will define where to start searching the name . Example of use : &lt;Subtr : " .

Default value for X is 1 . <p> &lt;Dec Nr:X:Y&gt; <p> Works like the &lt;Inc Nr&gt; tag but ads a decrementing number instead of an incrementing one .

Of course nobody means one a few . This is why Advanced Renamer does n't support copying to more than one location at the same time . I have to leave some features out to not make the program to cluttered . <p> As a matter of interest : why do you need to copy the file to multiple locations ? And how many locations are we talking about ? <p> I 'm disassembling a number of . CHM files that were not well constructed . The series of . CHM files utilizes . CSS sheets stored within a folder ( along with images ) for each individual page . One way to quickly change the styles to a uniform , more aesthetically pleasing format , would be to copy one . CSS that contains revisions into each folder . Because AR can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batch edit the HTML files within the directory to refer to a single . CSS . I simply could n't figure out how to pull-off the scenario I proposed and was curious if it was possible . <p> As an aside : a similar situation arises during my " . CHM cleaning " which AR can handle , through a workaround ( of sorts ) . I 'll often have to batch edit the photos stored w/in those directories ( 0-20 photos per folder , for 50-100 folders ) . My batch image processor ( SnagIt ) requires me to add each directory individually - sort of annoying . Even more frustrating , however , is that generates new photos in a new directory ( fortunately , with the original file name ) . So , I use AR to move the original images dispersed throughout the directory to an alternative location and then batch edit them . This creates a new series of photos , identically named , in a new folder . I change the directory name of where AR moved the original images , and change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I then utilize the " undo " feature of AR , and it places these newly edited photos exactly back in the location I need . This feature has been a lifesaver , as it would have taken hours to tediously reassemble these edited photos otherwise . <p> I understand why you would choose to leave this feature out - its rarely needed and there are workarounds .

@@22131414 @2131414/ <h> Rename &amp; add/replace extension problem <p> Please take a look at this problem . I created 2 methods for renaming . First method I use as " list method " &amp; second method I use " Add method " . This will rename and change the " file extension " because in the list I do n't put file extension . <p> When I applied these 2 methods , it will change file name and apply the file extesion that I 've wanted them to be . But , It change the file extension in the wrong place . Some how , the add method change the extension after the " period " in the file name ( anywhere if the file name contains a period in it ) . 
@@22131415 @2131415/ <p> As title says , I 'm trying to use exif info available using the exiftool , to create custom patterns for renaming folders . <p> Essentially , I want to take a collection of files from a folder , and move them into folders named according to date ( format : YYYY MM DD ) . The problem arises because the dates could be all different : date modified , date created , etc . I 've found that the IMG tags ( with Date digitized ticked in settings ) work well for most images . However , images which do n't have such an entry , and video files , run into problems . I 've found that the Exif Tag " CreateDate " provides correct results for all my files ( pictures , videos , etc ) , and would like to use that , but I have no way to edit the folder renaming pattern .

@@22131419 @2131419/ <h> Renaming Video Files ? <p> Hi I was wondering if it was possible to rename m2ts video files ? It does not work using the same method I use for renaming images , I guess I would have to replace the IMG part of the method with another file type but I have no idea what . I seem to be able to rename my video files to the date they were downloaded but obviously I want to rename them to the date they were taken . Thanks : ) <p> The IMG tags can only be used on image files . There is no similar tags for the video files at this moment . I am not even sure if digital video cameras save this kind of information the files in a standardized way . What is the source of the video files , do they come from a personal camera or are they downloaded from the Internet ? <p> Reply to #2 : Hi Kim and thanks for your reply . The files come from my Sony Handycam and they do carry the date taken info @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the camera would be , for example , 20110426065310. m2ts which is the year , month , day , hour , minute , second , so all that info is there I just want to format it like I do my still photos , ie 2011.04.26 06.53.10 as it is easier to read in this format . I can change the format using the &lt;Year&gt; , &lt;month&gt; , etc format but that changes it to the date the file was downloaded not the date it was shot . So I thought if there was something equivalent to the IMG command that you insert before the year etc that would work ? It would be nice to have all my photos and videos named using the same format . <p> Reply to #4 : Hi Kim I was wondering if the new version can now do what I previously enquired about ? I have downloaded it but still ca n't find out if it is able to rename video and if so what " name " I should put in front of year , month etc , eg when renaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reply to #5 : I actually looked at your request in my todo list a couple of days ago . Almost a year has gone since you asked for this feature . The video support has been enhanced greatly since so I might be able to implement this feature soon . A release fixing some problems with GPS location data will be released with a couple of days . Maybe I can get this done too , but no promises . <p> Until then I might have another solution for you . If the files have the names you describe when you unload them from the camera you can try the following : <p> Reply to #5 : I have been working a bit with extracting date and times from video files but have not had any luck coming up with a good solution .

@@22131420 @2131420/ <h> SUGGESTIONS <p> Thank you so much for your nice program . I am using 3.6 and it has saved me lots of trouble . <p> I have a few suggestions below . <p> A " TRUNCATE " FEATURE REQUEST <p> I suggest including a feature that could be called " truncate , " that would truncate all files to the number of characters specified by the user , RATHER THAN simply " eliminating " a given number of characters . <p> For example , if I have 500 files , some with short names , some , medium , and some , long , and I just want to reduce all of them to ten characters , but I do n't want to ASSIGN any particular name , but rather only TRUNCATE whatever name they already have , I think that Advanced Renamer should be able to do it . <p> As you know , Windows has a problem transferring files with long names or long paths , and it can be very complicated to change the names individually . It can be equally complicated to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about is shortening the long name , short enough so as not to be a problem . TRUNCATE would do the trick . <p> In other words , if the file name is already short enough , I do not want to shorten it any further ; I just want all the long file names in the same batch to be shortened . <p> You could also adapt this feature to allow the user to determine the maximum length desired for the truncation . In other words , to leave my short names as is , but to shorten my files of 50 or 200 characters down to 30 . <p> Incidentally , I have many MIDI files downloaded from the Internet , that have the URL embedded into the name , and they have extremely long names . If Advanced Renamer could simply search for the marker " www " in each file name , and delete NOT ONLY THAT but everything to the right of that , that would also be wonderful . At the moment I have 29,000 such files to work with in this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AR is that the help files are not embedded into the program , v3.6 . I do not have regular access to the Internet , so I can not get any help sometimes . I understand that you like to update the help files directly in this way , but I think each download should include its own help files . <p> BUG REPORT <p> " Set upper case first letter " is a feature that works , but which does not reveal that the process was completed in the affected file window . I have to close and reopen a Windows file window to see whether the changes were really made . <p> LIVE EDITING SUGGESTION <p> I suggest allowing manual re-touching of files while they are revealed in the main AR window . It is sometimes easier to access them this way than by going to a system window . You could require an automatic refreshing of the window after such changes , so as not to affect the pending renaming functions , but it would be helpful to have this function . <p> REGULAR EXPRESSIONS <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced and regular expressions to be applied . <p> For example , if I want to search through a long list of files called " 01 scripture 1 " , " 01 scripture 7 " , " 01 scripture 9 " , etc. , and I want AR to simply find and remove the number at the end , but not the number at the beginning , it seems that I should be able to type in something like " scripture /d " in my " replace " window , to accomplish that task , but this does not work in AR at the moment ; I can only choose one function or another . <p> Perhaps you could allow the user to put the real words in quotes , or in brackets , and the regular expressions as is , or vice versa , so that AR will not confuse the regular expressions with the real words to be replaced . But be careful , because sometimes I want to search and replace quotation marks themselves , in the file names , AR should not misinterpret the quotes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a method , but I concur with above , it would be much better to have a truncate option , number of characters or a string to retain . This helps deal with some more complicated file renaming options . I certainly assumed Advanced Renamer had a truncate function , but it does n't . I vote for an explicit truncate function ... <p> Reply to #1 : INTERFACE Suggestion : Allow re-ordering of methods also when they are collapsed , either by enabling the Up/Down move buttons at all times or by allowing drag and drop of methods . This would result in a better overview when moving methods to another position . Some methods take up so much space when fully expanded that I lose orientation .

I told you that I would design the software to solve your problem . I realize now that it can not solve the problem 100% . But do n't worry . I have a couple of ideas to what I can do to solve the problem . I just need a few days . I promise that the final version will be able to help you . <p> 1 . I have used copy mode but if you prefer mode move , you can use that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . I have set the output folder to LONG ... The c : UsersKimTemptestoutput is a static folder on my computer . That part will of course be different on your computer . Advanced Renamer will automatically create any non existing folder . 3 . Added one method , the New Name method and set the pattern to &lt;Name&gt;. &lt;Ext&gt; <p> The problem now is that I could not instruct Advanced Renamer to locate the month in the filename . There is now way of finding it with the substr tag right now . That is the problem I am going to fix in the final version . Other tags might also be useful to express the new path of the files . I will let specific problems dictate which tags are needed instead of trying to predict the upcoming needs . <p> Reply to #4 : Thank You for such a robust and easy to product . I have a question along the lines of the original poster . Where he is using part of the file names as folder names , in my work place we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is also part of the folder name . For example : <p> c : Install PaperworkInstall Field Service Ticket - 14336 J.pdf <p> c : Filecenter201414336 Lancaster <p> Is it possible to have AdvancedRenamer to copy the pdf file into the folder 14336 Lancaster based solely off of the characters " 14336 " ? <p> Reply to #8 : Great tutorial . Good work . I like when other people write tutorials for the program . Because I know too much about the program and how the internals work , my writings about the program are not always good enough .

This might not behave as expected if you have both negative and positive numbers in the same sequence . If you do I think you need to perform two batches , first one for the positive and then one for the negative numbers . Otherwise I think the numbers will clash . <p> Reply to #2 : Thanks for the reply . The problem is that after removing the ' - ' , the numbers would be in the wrong order . For example if the numbers run from -200 to -100 , when the ' - ' is removed , they will now run from 100 to 200 , so if I load them into a player ( these are rendered images ) , they will run in the reverse order .

You would select the data you want to export by creating an array of strings ( here it would be interesting not only to export predefined columns , but for example any EXIF data ) and export to file with a defined function or " return " command to a TXT or CSV . <p> This gets more powerful when defining command lines as . BAT file , in which you could automate the renaming of any file included in a folder , and get a detailed log of original and new data . <p> The EXIF update , I agree the best way would be using ExifTool directly , embedded in the code as it is a very powerful tool in itself . <p> Regarding JavaScript , this is my code : <p> Initial sequence : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder to obtain the tag that will be used to rename the files .

Typing item and hitting dot will show a list of properties on the item object . <p> Before creating the actual script we need to setup a global variable . This is done by clicking the Pre Batch Script button . A window displaying a new script editor will appear . The script created here will only get run once for every batch run . This is a good place to setup a global state variable . Type this into the Pre Batch Script editor : <p> var odd = true ; <p> Now for the actual item script . In the script we will use the global variable named odd setup in the pre batch script , and use it to insert either A or B into the filename . Insert this script into the editor : <p> statement is the line telling Advanced Renamer what the new filename of the item should be . Notice that we return a complete filename including the extension . Most methods in the program is by default configured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when it comes to the scripting method , you need to return a complete filename including the extension . <p> This example is really simple . But to demonstrate the pre batch script I made it a bit more complicated than necessary . Try to remove the pre batch script and instead use this script in the script panel : <p> var str = index % 2 ? ' B ' : ' A ' ; return item.newBasename + ' ' + str ; <p> Notice how the last line is the same but the two first lines for calculating the str variable has changed . This script will by using the index input parameter , produce the exact same result as the previous script . <p> So what else can we do ? By using the properties of the item object we can access all information about the particular item available to the Advanced Renamer batch runner . If we also want to add the image dimensions to the filename in the script we can use a script like this ( assuming we are renaming image files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string containing both normal characters and tags , just like the New Name method . The rule of thumb here is , if it works with New Name method it will also work with app.parseTags . <p> What else can scripting method do ? The answer is : Almost anything you want ! It is a very powerful way of customizing the application behavior , but it requires a much larger skill set than the other methods of Advanced Renamer . For those who find the program too complicated , the scripting method will only make it even more complicated . But for those who are already skilled with programming or scripting skills , the scripting method can be of great help .

What I 'd like is a method to remove the illegal characters . <p> Thanks for the reply G. Lambany . I could n't get the remove to work - pasting the regex into into either the " Remove count " or " Starting at " fields did n't seem to do anything . I did manage to get a replace working with the regular expression you gave though . Thanks for the help ! <p> Illegal ( aka reserved or invalid ) characters in filenames are a Windows issue and must be solved at the operating system level first . That 's to say , Windows has to be happy with filenames before programs can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Windows if it contains illegal filename characters . Illegal characters in Windows include / ? &lt; &gt; : * " ( as well as control-sequence characters ) and must not be used , in fact Windows wo n't actually let you use them . <p> Many TVs , PVRs ( Personal Video Recorders ) , etc. use ' kludged ' filing systems that have no regard for Microsoft 's Windows file-naming conventions thus they literally interpret a TV station 's exact program name without having any regard to any character limitation imposed by Windows . ( Naturally , this is never an issue when playing back a recording through the TV or PVR . ) <p> A classic ( and notorious example ) of this problem is the name of Korean War sitcom M*A*S*H . The asterisks in the name mean that Windows can not process it in any way brain-dead Windows will not even let you rename it . <p> The easiest way around this Windows limitation is to use special renaming or rescue/recovery programs that can bypass the Windows interface and rename any such files . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others . For instance , if a USB thumb drive from my TV contained say a file with the illegal filename ' xyx-M*A*S*H.mts ' then I 'd tell DERescue to ' rescue ' the contents of the drive , the file would then be copied to the PC hard drive as ' xyx-MASH.mts ' which is a completely legit name . <p> ( I might add that at this late juncture it is quite outrageous that Windows and Linux still have the ridiculous limitation whereby certain characters can not be used in filenames . Any printable Unicode character ought to be able to be used in a filename whether it be an * , ? , : or even an Egyptian hieroglyph/cartouche for that mattertell a traditional printer that he can not use * or ? in a book title and he 'd just laugh at you !

This replace character is only used for when extracting metadata , like EXIF , ID3 or similar . For some reason this technique was n't used for TV Show import . In the next version , due in the next couple of days , this will be fixed so that the TV Show tags will replace these characters not legal for filenames . Usually these character are * : and ? . 
@@22131452 @2131452/ <h> Regular expressions <p> A regular expression language is a powerful way of manipulating with texts . Advanced Renamer supports the use of regular expressions for pattern searching and replacing in several methods . The use of these expressions is primarily meant for power users and people with programming experience but none the less gaining knowledge of the basics will prove to be very rewarding . A standard library called PCRE is used which means that people with prior knowledge of this library will feel right at home . Those learning this for the first time will also be able to use the skills in other similar tools . <p> This page will try to give you basic knowledge about the use of regular expressions in the context of file renaming . <p> A simple regular expression <p> A regular expression contains normal characters and metacharacters . The normal characters are interpreted as they are while the metacharacters have special meaning . Let 's start out with a simple expression : <p> zipdddd <p> Given the expression above the resulting match of a filename " BayTowerzip4500.txt " will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metacharacter which represent any numeric value raging from 0 to 9 . The above expression matches any phrase starting with " zip " followed by 4 digits . <p> How can we use this for renaming ? <p> The most common method with regex support is the Replace method . If you in the first text field type the above expressions " zipdddd " and in the second text field type " zipunknown " any file containing " xip " followed by 4 digits will get this text phrase replaced by " zipunknown " . <p> Sequences <p> What if we do n't know how many numbers a zip code consists of ? What if some files contain " zip123 " and others " zip384739 " ? The above expression will only match if there are exactly 4 digits . If we do n't know how many digits there are we can use another meta character . Consider this expression : <p> zipd+ <p> The plus + will match the previous character 1 or more times which means that this expression will match " zip123 " and " zip1234 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to define subpatterns within the pattern itself which proves very useful when using the replace method . A group is defined by enclosing a part of the pattern in a parenthesis ( ) . Given this pattern : <p> zip(d+) <p> The match is exactly the same as before except now we can access the value of the subpattern in a replace scenario . If in the replace method we put " 1zip " in the second text field the result will show that the two parts of the filename have changed place . If the filename contains " zip123 " the filename will contain " 123zip " after the method has been applied . The value of the special metacharacter 1 is in this case " 123 " . If more than one group is used the next group name will be 2 . <p> A more advanced example <p> If we have a filename like this " Michael Jackson - Thriller.mp3 " and we want to change it to something like this " Thriller - Michal Jackson.mp3 " we can apply a regular expression in the replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( . * ) - ( . * ) Replace with : 2 - 1 <p> In this case some familiar notation is used but also two new metacharacter . The dot matches anything character digit or non-digit . The star * matches the previous character 0 or more times . The pattern is build of two similar groups divided by - . The first group matches " Michal Jackson " and putting it into 1 while the second group matches " Thriller " putting it into 2 . Because the first group is replaced by the value of the second and vice versa , the two parts of the filename change place .

In a directory of files , the first set of name conflicts are renamed correctly , if there is another set of name conflicts ( or more than two ) than those are the ones that fail to be named correctly . Definitely a bug . <p> Yes ! I am seeing this exact issue as well . The first name collision is handled with incrementing numbers just fine . <p> Every other time it has to increment , however , it marks the first file ( the 001 in my case ) as a potential error . Specifically : Possibility of multiple files with the same name . It does n't seem to matter how I construct my renaming rule , as I 've tried using date modified tags and substring tags . <p> I 'm on Windows 7 , if that helps . Unfortunately this bug renders the software virtually useless except in the event that you never have things with similar names . <p> This happens for me when I have " burst shots " in the same directory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMG001 , IMG002 , etc but have the same DateTimeOriginal since they are taken so fast by the camera/phone . <p> I pefer to rename all my photos to the following format : YYYY-MM-DD HHMMSS <p> This way they are in chronological order in my master directory . No matter what photos I add to the master directory , they will fall in chronological order since the 18 character file name will order them chronologically based on the new file name based off the DateTimeOriginal Exif information . <p> Since the included colllision rule will add the 001 , 002 until the collision is over , the file names will never meet the 18 digit file name I prefer , there is a workaround that is not as " clean " but will work until the " bug " is fixed . <p> Add the Dir of photos you want to rename . Deselect all the files that have collisions . Process all the files that do n't have collisions . Reselect all the remaining files . Add a new " Add batch method " called " Add " Ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Renaming Method List " Click on the &lt;&gt; Choose &lt;Inc Nr:1&gt; and add any separator you would like . I use " - " so it would look like " -&lt;Inc Nr:1&gt; " Choose the correct " At Index " . In my example , it would be " 18 " Apply to " Name " <p> The resulting renamed file will now have an additional 4 characters " -001 , -002 , etc " added to it . <p> The additional 4 characters will not be relative to the number of collisions , but will be in accordance with the files relative position in the Batch list . <p> After you process these files , they will be in the correct chronological order in the directory . <p> As I mentioned , this is n't the cleanest way to do it because it wo n't rename the files based only the collision then restart at next collision , it will just increment continuously until it reaches the end of the batch list . <p> Request / Rant <p> In my wildest dreams , when collisions occur where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increment the last number by 1 digit . <p> If there are enough collisions to make it eventually collide with the a file name that is already named what the next file would be named , it would then increment the new collision by " 1 " until all collisions in the sequence are resolved , at which point , any new collisions would just start over the renaming process . <p> Hello , I have this trouble too : " Append incrementing number " does not work well , though the preview of the new name adds the right numbers #001 and #002 to the new filename ( I choosed # as separator ) . <p> By the way , I 'm trying on more than 3200 files in 27 folders and 6 methods ( remove , four replace , swap , with one regular expression ) .

The inside a character set has a different meaning to the outside a set . As we 've seen , when outside it means the start of . When inside it means negation , e.g. not any of the characters .

This is done so we can refer to it later on . The d means any digit , and like above , the + is a one-or-more quantifier . This matches the ' 46 ' ( and is known as group 1 , as that is the first group defined ) and stops there as the next character is a dash . So far , we have ' 9-46 ' . <p> Step 5 : Next is the - symbol . This is a literal character , and matches the - following the 46 .

Then you can mask any characters identifying missing GPS data with something generic or just without the GPS info . <p> 3 ) Do exactly what you suggest and understand that the missing GPS data will just leave pictures in a strange formatted generic folder . For example : <p> I have pictures missing date/time and missing GPS . I have a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all pictures . Here is the full rename/move mask : <p> And then I can clean up the generic pattern or replace with generic text . I use " Remove pattern " with " , ( ) " and I also remove " ( United States ) " so only other country names are shown not my own country . <p> For the directory structure if you use GPS data for a subfolder it will not work but if you enclose the value in brackets or something it will work . Using example above with missing GPS data it works because I get the day value as the folder : <p> . 2015(06)Jun05 - <p> Then I can clean up " - " and remove or replace . If I used the country as it 's own subfolder without the brackets it would be this : <p> Which works as generic subfolder where all missing GPS data pictures will show up . I use the same principle for missing date/time . Then use GeoSetter on the files in the generic folder and rename again with the added data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder with " " after the date . Two files with same name will be named " DSC00011.JPG " &amp; " DSC00012.JPG " in same folder . <p> I would also look at using the " IMG " date values instead of Modified for more accuracy and it also allows you to use the " IMG Subsec " value to handle burst photos taken in same second or to possibly sort similar named files with another value . <p> It took me time to dig in and get creative but it works REALLY well for me . My only complaint is the GPS location names looked up are wildly inaccurate but they are kinda close and I can go fix things manually until the GPS location lookup is fixed .

@@22131466 @2131466/ <h> Manual renaming <p> After file names are loaded into AR , Is to possible to manually edit a file name from the AR display window ? This feature will be useful in the following context : Suppose a method is created which converts all file names except one or two . These one or two files might have been left out by AR , because the search pattern used in the method does not precisely match with the file name . Instead of modifying the search pattern to include these two files ( risking possible side effects ) , it will be easier to manually rename these two file names . Is this feature available in AR now ? If not , Is it possible to incorporate it ? Thanks MC <p> Reply to #1 : That is not possible in a dead easy manner .

Click the Add menu item above the file list . <p> In the drop down list pick Files and a dialog for opening files appear . <p> Select the files you would like to rename and click Open . <p> Tip : You can also drag and drop files or folders from Windows Explorer to Advanced Renamer . <p> Setup renaming methods <p> Now you need to setup how the files should be renamed . This is done in the left part of the program where it says Renaming method list . <p> Click the button Add method and select a method in the appearing window . We will be using New name method in this example . With the New Name method you can construct a completely new filename based on known information of each individual file . <p> In the box called New Name you can write the new name of the file . Type in " MyFile&lt;Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you look in the column called New Filename you can see the new filename each file will have . As you see &lt;Inc Nr:1&gt; will be replaced with a incrementing number starting from 1 and &lt;Ext&gt; will be replaced with the file extension . <p> Start renaming <p> First verify the new names in the column New Filename . If the column is not visible you can add it ny clicking the Customize columns menu button . <p> Click the button Start Batch in the top of the window . <p> In the new window click Rename . <p> Now you will see a progress bar progressing as the files are renamed . <p> When it completes you are done and can click OK . <p> You can also read these examples of how you can setup Advanced Renamer in various scenarios : <h> Examples <h> Downloaded files <p> Case : I have downloaded a bunch of files from the internet , but all the spaces are and all the files ends with an unwanted suffix . The file name could be something like **27;1061;TOOLONG . <p> We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remove cooltvstation from the files . <p> Replace underscores with spaces . <p> Make the first letter in every word upper case . <p> Do the following : <p> Add the files to the list . <p> If there are methods in the method list click the Clear Methods toolbar button . <p> The new file names should now look something like this : The X Tv Show.avi <p> Verify the names in the list . <p> Click Start Batch . <p> What we did here was to use more than one method at the same time to produce the desired result . When using more than one method you should make sure they are applied in the correct order . You can move the methods up and down to change the order in which they are run . <h> Pictures <p> Case : I have taken a bunch of pictures with my digital camera and want to change the file names from something like DSCF3028.jpg or something more useful with the date and time the picture was taken in the file name of the picture . <p> Most digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file when it is taken . Advanced Renamer can use this information to give the file a name with the date and time the picture was taken . <p> Do the following : <p> Add the files to the list . <p> If there is methods in the list click the Clear Methods toolbar button . <p> Tips : If you have taken more than one picture within a second this will not work because more than one file will get the same name . To make it work you will need to change the Name Collision Rule to Append Incrementing Number or Append Img Subsec . <h> Scripting <p> I often get various questions at the forum for how to use the program and how to configure it for various tasks . Sometimes the particular task is so complex and so specialized that the batch methods supplied with Advanced Renamer can not help the user . This is why I added JavaScript support to the program and in the next paragraphs I will show you how it works . <p> I will base my example on a simple task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want all odd files to end with A and all even to end with B. The files could have names like this : img2001.jpg img2002.jpg img2003.jpg img2004.jpg img2005.jpg img2006.jpg <p> We want the resulting filenames to end up like this : img2001A.jpg img2002B.jpg img2003A.jpg img2004B.jpg img2005A.jpg img2006B.jpg <p> First add the files to Advanced Renamer . Then add the Script method to the method panel . Make sure this is the only method in the panel . In the script editor we can create the script needed for producing the new filenames . The script is executed once for each item in the list . The input parameter item contains the item from the list and its many properties . Typing item and hitting dot will show a list of properties on the item object . <p> Before creating the actual script we need to setup a global variable . This is done by clicking the Pre Batch Script button . A window displaying a new script editor will appear . The script created here will only get run once for every batch run . This is a good place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pre Batch Script editor : <p> var odd = true ; <p> Now for the actual item script . In the script we will use the global variable named odd setup in the pre batch script , and use it to insert either A or B into the filename . Insert this script into the editor : <p> statement is the line telling Advanced Renamer what the new filename of the item should be . Notice that we return a complete filename including the extension . Most methods in the program is by default configured to only work with the name part of the filename , but when it comes to the scripting method , you need to return a complete filename including the extension . <p> This example is really simple . But to demonstrate the pre batch script I made it a bit more complicated than necessary . Try to remove the pre batch script and instead use this script in the script panel : <p> var str = index % 2 ? ' B ' : ' A ' ; return item.newBasename + ' ' + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same but the two first lines for calculating the str variable has changed . This script will by using the index input parameter , produce the exact same result as the previous script . <p> So what else can we do ? By using the properties of the item object we can access all information about the particular item available to the Advanced Renamer batch runner . If we also want to add the image dimensions to the filename in the script we can use a script like this ( assuming we are renaming image files ) : <p> The parseTags method will actually take a string containing both normal characters and tags , just like the New Name method . The rule of thumb here is , if it works with New Name method it will also work with app.parseTags . <p> What else can scripting method do ? The answer is : Almost anything you want ! It is a very powerful way of customizing the application behavior , but it requires a much larger skill set than the other methods of Advanced Renamer . For those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only make it even more complicated . But for those who are already skilled with programming or scripting skills , the scripting method can be of great help . <h> Add method <p> If your filename is missing some words or letters , use this method to add some extra to your filename at a given position . <p> Add Specify the text that should be added.Note : You can use tags here . <p> At index Use this to tell Advanced Renamer at what position in the filename the text should be added . If you want to add it to the beginning of the file , set the index to 1 . If the index is longer than the filename , the text will be added to the end . If the value is non-numeric the index will be set to the index of the pattern supplied . <p> Backwards Use this to make Position count from the end of the filename . If you check this , set Apply To to name and set Position to 1 , the text will be added just before the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use regular expressions If checked the " At index " value can be expressed as a regular expressions pattern . The pattern will be translated to a numeric value of the position of the pattern in the filename . <p> Apply To Specifies if the change should be applied to the name , extension or both . <h> Attributes method <p> This is not a regular renaming method . It does not change the filename . It only changes the file attributes . You can change Archive , Read Only , Hidden or System , to NoChange , Set or Unset . <p> This function can be useful when eg. copying files from a CD-ROM . When you copy files from a CD-ROM , all the files will be read only . You can use this method to remove the read only attribute of the files . <h> List method <p> This is a very simple method . There are no fancy features in this method . To use it , you have to type in the new filename of every file in the list or load the new names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Load List and Save List buttons to load and save lists of filenames . You can load a file that contains a previous Advanced Renamer file list ( a list saved by List -&gt; Save List ) , but you can not load that list with List -&gt; Load List . <h> Move method <p> Use the move method to move a number of characters from one position to another . <p> Move from Specifies the index to move from . If the file name is " my cool file name " and this value is 4 , the start index will be where the letter " c " is . <p> Move count The number of characters to be moved . <p> Move to The position to move the characters to . If the file name is " my cool file name " and move from is 4 , move count is 5 , and move to is 1 , then the file name will be " cool my file name " . <p> Move relative If checked , the value of move to will be relative to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the move from is counted from the end of the filename instead of the beginning . <p> Use regular expressions If checked the value of Move From , Move Count and Move To can be a regular expression search pattern . <p> Apply toSpecifies which parts of the filename that should be included in the rename . <h> New case method <p> This method can change the case of the filename . This can be very useful for files used on a website or downloaded from the web . <p> You can specify how the case should be changed by using one of the following : Lower case Upper case Upper case first letter Lower case first letter Upper case first letter in every word Lower case first letter in every word Set pattern to lower case Set pattern to upper case Invert case <p> Use Apply To , to specify which parts of the filename that should have new case . <p> When you choose " Uppercase first letter in every word " or " Lowercase first letter in every word " , the Word Separator in the settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When using the " Set pattern to lower/upper case " option the pattern text box can be used to only change the case of a part of the filename instead of the whole filename . If the use regular expressions checkbox is checked you can also specify the pattern as a regular expression . <h> New name method <p> Use the New Name Method when you want to completely alter the filenames . This method is useful when you do n't want to use any parts of the filenames and give them completely new names . Tags are used to give each file or folder in the list a unique name . Use the hyperlink buttons to insert tags that gives certain information about the files . <p> Patterns If you want to save and load different patterns for the New Name Method , you can click the " ... " button and the Pattern Dialog will appear . <p> Type in your new pattern and click the Add button . The new pattern will be added to the list . To edit a pattern , just select it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button . Click the New button to make a new pattern and click Add when done . To delete a pattern , right click it in the list and select Delete or use the Del button on your keyboard . <h> Remove method <p> If you want to remove some of the characters of the filename , this is a good method . <p> Remove Specify how many characters that should be removed . If non-numeric the value is used as a search pattern . <p> Starting at Specify the starting point of the removal . If non-numeric the value is used as a search pattern . <p> Backwards When checked , the Start position will be calculated from the end of the filename . <p> Use regular expressions If checked the " Remove count " and " Starting at " text fields can be regular expression . The expresions are used as search patterns and translated to a numeric value . <p> Apply To Specifies if the change should be applied to the name , extension or both . <p> Note : If you want to remove certain characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use the replace method instead . <h> Remove pattern method <p> Use this method to completely remove a piece or a pattern from the filename . You can use it to remove trivial stuff like a predefined string but you can also use this method to remove more advanced patterns . You can use tags and regular expressions to specify what you want removed from the file or folder name . This method works as the Replace Method configured to replace a pattern with nothing . <h> Renumber method <p> This method can be used to change existing numbers in file names . You can not use this method to add new numbers , for that use the New Name or Add method . <p> Number position This field decides which number in the filename you want to change . If the filename is " File004A202.txt " and you set it to 2 it is the number 202 that will get changed . <p> Change to The change to drop down box is used to switch between the two renumbering modes . Absolute number is used when you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The New Number field decides the number for the first file . Relative number is used when you want to add or subtract a value from the existing number . This can be handy if you have a sequence of files with gaps between some of the numbers and you want to preserve this gap . This is commonly used when a sequence starts at 0 and you want to change it to start at 1 instead . <p> New number ( only Absolute number mode ) Defines the number of the first file . Subsequent files will get their number calculated based on this number and the index of the file in the list . <p> Number difference ( only Relative number mode ) If you want to add 3 to the number of all files in the list set this text field to 3 . If you want to subtract three from the numbers type -3 instead . <p> Skip ( only Absolute number mode ) If set to 1 the resulting names will be 001 , 002 , 003 , 004 . If set to 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 007 . <p> Zero padding Is used to control the padding of zeros in the new number . Automatic ( the default ) will calculate the maximum length of the number and set the padding length based on this length . When Manual is used you can use the Number Length field to specify a minimum length of the numbers . No Padding will not add zeros to the front of the number . <p> Apply to Use the apply to drop down box to tell the method in which part of the filename it should look for numbers . Can be set to Name ( default ) , Extension , or Both . <h> Replace method <p> If you want to remove some words or letters from the filename and replace them with something else , you can use this method . Just type in the text you want to be replaced and the text it should be replaced with . This method can also be used to remove specific phrases . To do so just leave the box Replace With blank . <p> Text to be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to replace more than one phrase , you can separate the different phrases with . Note : You can use tags here . <p> Replace it with Specify what the text in the previous box should be replaced with . If you want to remove the words and not replace them with something else , then leave this box blank.Note : You can use tags here . <p> Case Sensitive If this is checked , the words " hello " and " Hello " are two different words . If you want to replace the text no matter what case they are in , leave this box unchecked . <p> Use regular expressions When checked , regular expressions can be used to replace certain patterns of the filenames . This feature is for power users only and requires basic knowledge of using regular expressions with the PCRE library . <p> Apply To Specifies if the change should be applied to the name , extension or both . <h> Script method <p> The script method is probably the most advanced feature of Advanced Renamer . With this method a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods right in the program . As with any method , the script method can be saved and opened by any other user on any other computer . Write the script in the text box and click Apply Script to see the result in the file list . The Pre Batch Script button can be used to setup prebatch variables . <p> How to use The script in the method panel will get executed once for every file or folder in the list in the order the files are sorted in the list . The parameter " index " contains the number the item in the list has . The parameter " item " is an object representing an item in the list and contains every piece of information Advanced Renamer knows about this file or folder . The information can be used to create a new filename which will be set by returning the new filename . Remember the new filename must contain the extension of the file . <h> Swap method <p> The Swap method can swap two parts of a filename divided by a separator . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Jackson - Thriller.mp3 " to " Thriller - Michael Jackson.mp3 " . <p> SeparatorThe separator used to divide the two parts of the filename . Everything on either side will get swapped . <p> Occurence If the separator exists more than once in the filename you can use this control to define which occurence of the divider to use when swapping . <h> Timestamp method <p> With the timestamp method you can change the date and time of the filename . You can either change it to a fixed date/time , a date/time relative to the current date/time of the file , date/time from EXIF tags in images , or a pattern in the filename . <p> Apply to A file contains three different date/time values . One for when the file was originally created , one for when it was last access , and one for when it was last modified . Use these checkboxes to select which date/time values you want to change . You can check more than one of them , but at least one has to be selected . <p> Image date and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are image files the date and time value will be set to the EXIF date taken value found inside the image file . <p> Absolute date and time / Delte date and time This determines if the values of the edit fields below are the absolute time or if the values are relative to the files current date and time.Note : When you change from absolute to delta time , you should review the values of the edit fields . <p> Filename pattern / Dirname pattern When checked a pattern edit field will be visible in the bottom . In this field a pattern for how the date and time values can be retrieved from the file or parent directory name . The tags &lt;Year&gt; , &lt;Month&gt; , &lt;Day&gt; , &lt;Hour&gt; , &lt;Min&gt; , and &lt;Sec&gt; have special meaning in this method . They are used to specify how the date and time parts are recognized in the name . <p> Example : If you have a filename with year , month , and day values in the name and you want to set the file date to this date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jpg " the pattern **38;1090;TOOLONG will automatically retrieve the date . <p> Regular tags can also be used in the pattern , but note that the six date and time tags have special meaning here . <p> Day / Month / Year / Hour / Min / Sec When absolute or relative date/time is checked you can specify individual time parts in these six fields . If Delta Date and Time is checked , these values are either added to or subtracted from the file date/time . If you type 1 in Hour , 1 hour is added to the date/time and if you type -1 , 1 hour is subtracted from the date/time . <h> Trim method <p> Use this method to remove unwanted spaces , dashes , and other unwanted characters from the beginning and end of the filename . Sometimes when using many methods you end up with too many spaces in either end of the filename . To avoid this , use this method . <h> Default tags <p> &lt;Inc Nr:X:Y&gt; <p> Will insert an increasing number starting with X and up . X can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the list , the program will add leading zeros to all files below 100 like this 001 , 002 , 003 etc . If you do n't want leading zeros you can turn them off in Settings Dialog . Default value for X is 1 . <p> The second optional parameter Y can be used to define the stepping of the increasing number . When used like &lt;Inc Nr:1:2&gt; the results will be 001 , 003 , 005 , 007 etc . <p> &lt;Inc NrDir:X:Y&gt; <p> Acts like &lt;Inc Nr&gt; with the exception that this function counts per folder . Default value for X is 1 . <p> The behaviour of the optional parameter Y is the same as the parameter Y for the &lt;Inc Nr&gt; tag . <p> &lt;Inc Alpha:X:Y&gt; <p> Will insert an increasing letter starting with X and up . X can be any letter value . If you use a small letter , it will use small letters in all the files and big letters if you use a big on . <p> Note : This function can only go up to Z. If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value for X is A. <p> The behaviour of the optional parameter Y is the same as the parameter Y for the &lt;Inc Nr&gt; tag . <p> &lt;Name&gt; <p> Inserts the original name of the file . Not the path and not the extension , only the name . e.g. if you have a file called " c : windowsnotepad.exe " , this command 's result will only be " notepad " . <p> &lt;Ext&gt; <p> Will insert the original files extension . Notice that this tag does not include the " . " . e.g. if you have a file called " c : windowsnotepad.exe " , the result of &lt;Ext&gt; will be " exe " . <p> &lt;DirName:X&gt; <p> Inserts the last directory name . eg. " c : windowsnotepad.exe " will give " windows " as result . <p> If X is a numeric value that value will be used to select a folder name in the sequence from the right part of the path . <p> This will insert a number telling how many files there is in the directory where the file is located . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Note : It does not include other directories . <p> &lt;Num Dirs&gt; <p> This will insert a number telling how many sub-directories there is in the directory where the folder is located.Note : This only works on folders . Like the &lt;Inc Nr&gt; , this function is zero padded . <p> &lt;Num Items&gt; <p> Inserts the total number of items in the list . Like the &lt;IncNr&gt; , this function is zero padded . <p> &lt;Word:X&gt; <p> Will insert a word from the filename index by X. &lt;Word:3&gt; will insert the third word of the filename . Word are separated by values present in the word separator text field in the settings dialog . Default value for X is 1 . <h> Advanced tags <p> This is more advanced tags for the more advanced users because they are more difficult to use . <p> &lt;File Content : POS:COUNT:FILENAME&gt; <p> Will insert a text phrase from a file . It will use the text starting a position POS in the filename and copy COUNT characters . If FILENAME is specified , Advanced Renamer will search for the text phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is being renamed is used . <p> Will insert a part of the original filename into the new name . The POS and COUNT parameters are used to define what part of the filename that will get copyed . Example of use : &lt;Substr:5:2&gt; will return " wa " for the filename " The walking man.txt " . <p> The parameters do n't have to be numeric indexes , they can also be text strings to search for in the filename . Example of use : &lt;Substr:ki:an&gt; will return " ng m " for " The walking man.txt " . The following will yield the same result : &lt;Substr:ki:4&gt; <p> In the rare cases where you actually want to search for a number in the filename you can put the search term in quotes . Example of use : &lt;Substr : " 2 " : 2&gt; will return " nd " for " The 2nd door.txt " . <p> The optional START parameter will define where to start searching the name . Example of use : &lt;Subtr : " . " : 5:3&gt; will return " Story " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the &lt;Substr&gt; tag but searches the string backwards . <p> Example of use &lt;RSubstr:2:3&gt; for " A cool baby " will return " bab " <p> &lt;Rand:MIN:MAX&gt; <p> Inserts a random number . MIN and MAX can be used to specify a minimum and a maximum range . <p> &lt;Rand Str:LENGTH&gt; <p> Inserts a random string . Use the LENGTH value to specify the length of the string . Uses the values from a to z in lower case to produce the random string . <p> &lt;ExifTool:VALUE&gt; <p> Insert value from the external program ExifTool . VALUE is the name of the ExifTool tag to be used . <p> &lt;Inc Hex:X:Y&gt; <p> Will insert an incrementing hex based number starting with X and up . X can be any number value . Note X should be a decimal number , not a hex based number . For more information , see &lt;Inc Nr&gt; tag . Default value for X is 1 . <p> &lt;Inc Roman:X:Y&gt; <p> Will insert an incrementing roman numeral starting with X and up . X can be any number value . Note X should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more information , see &lt;Inc Nr&gt; tag . Default value for X is 1 . <p> &lt;Dec Nr:X:Y&gt; <p> Works like the &lt;Inc Nr&gt; tag but ads a decrementing number instead of an incrementing one . The X value is used to tell the program what the starting number will be and Y is the step value between each file . <h> Datetime tags <p> Inserts the value belonging to the tag based on the computers local time and date . They are very self explained . Remember that these values are calculated at start of rename and not when the file is actually renamed . All tags except &lt;Year&gt; have a length of two characters at all time . <p> &lt;Sec&gt; <p> &lt;Min&gt; <p> &lt;Hour&gt; <p> &lt;Day&gt; <p> &lt;Month:X&gt; <p> The optional parameter can be used to specify another format than the standard leading zeros format . <h> Checksum tags <p> Calculation of file checksum . Checksum values can be used to verify the contents of a file and avoid corruption . <p> &lt;MD5&gt; <p> MD5 file checksum value . <p> &lt;SHA1&gt; <p> SHA-1 file checksum value . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags <p> These tags can be used to insert the size of a file at the time of rename into the filename . <p> &lt;Filesize&gt; <p> File size in bytes . <p> &lt;Filesize Kb&gt; <p> File size in kilo bytes . <p> &lt;Filesize Mb&gt; <p> File size in mega bytes . <p> &lt;Filesize Gb&gt; <p> File size in giga bytes . <p> &lt;Filesize Tb&gt; <p> File size in tera bytes . <h> GPS location tags <p> Some digital cameras record GPS coordinates as an Exif tag in the pictures they take . This is especially true for cameras in smart phones like iPhones and Android based phones . <p> The Country , City , and State tags use the GPS coordinates to lookup a textual representation of where the picture was taken in an online database containing more than 100,000 cities . A functioning internet connection is needed to use this functionality . When using the City tag the closest city with a population of at least 1000 people will be used . <p> Please note that the accuracy of the GPS position might be a little off . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the GPS satellites and measure the exact location . The accuracy is not very important when using the City , State , and Country tags . <p> &lt;GPS Country&gt; <p> The country in which the picture was taken . <p> &lt;GPS City&gt; <p> The nearest city to where the picture was taken . <p> &lt;GPS State&gt; <p> The state in which the picture was taken . For countries outside the US this value might be blank or contain a region instead . <p> &lt;GPS Lat&gt; <p> The GPS latitude as a decimal number with four significant decimals . <p> &lt;GPS Lat Deg&gt; <p> The degrees of the latitude . <p> &lt;GPS Lat Min&gt; <p> The minutes of the latitude . <p> &lt;GPS Lat Sec&gt; <p> The seconds of the latitude . <p> &lt;GPS Lat Dir&gt; <p> The latitude direction . Posible values are N and S. <p> &lt;GPS Lng&gt; <p> The GPS longitude as a decimal number with four significant decimals . <p> &lt;GPS Lng Deg&gt; <p> The degrees of the longitude . <p> &lt;GPS Lng Min&gt; <p> The minutes of the longitude . <p> &lt;GPS Lng Sec&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dir&gt; <p> The longitude direction . Posible values are W and E. <p> &lt;GPS Alt&gt; <p> GPS altitude . <h> ID3 tags <p> These tags only work on MP3 files with an ID3 Tag . These tags will insert the ID3 Tag into the filename . If a file contains both ID3v1 and ID3v2 , only one of them is used . Use the Settings Dialog to change in which order Advanced Renamer should look for these tags . <p> Note : If the tag consists of letters that are not allowed in a filename , they are replaced with " " . It can be changed in the Settings Dialog . <p> &lt;ID3 Album&gt; <p> &lt;ID3 Artist&gt; <p> &lt;ID3 Genre&gt; <p> &lt;ID3 Title&gt; <p> &lt;ID3 Track&gt; <p> &lt;Bitrate&gt; <p> &lt;Duration&gt; <p> Formattet duration of the audio playtime , like this : 7mins , 4secs <p> &lt;ID3 Album&gt; <p> &lt;ID3 Hour&gt; <p> The hour time part of the audio duration . Use parameter to control zero padding : &lt;ID3 Hour:0&gt; <p> &lt;ID3 Min&gt; <p> The minute time part of the audio duration . Use parameter to control zero padding : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the audio duration . Use parameter to control zero padding : &lt;ID3 Sec:0&gt; <h> Image tags <p> These tags only work on a selected amount of image files . Some tags , like the width and height , work on most images , other tags like Author and Copyright needs valid Exif information embedded in the image files . Also note that not all tags are supported by all cameras . <p> &lt;Img Width&gt; <p> Inserts the image width if possible . <p> &lt;Img Height&gt; <p> Inserts the image height if possible . <p> &lt;Img Year&gt;&lt;Img Month:X&gt;&lt;Img Day&gt;&lt;Img Hour&gt;&lt;Img Min&gt;&lt;Img Sec&gt; <p> Use these tags to insert date and time values for the date the picture was taken . <p> See &lt;Month&gt; tag for a description of the parameter for the &lt;Img Month&gt; tag . <p> &lt;Img Subsec&gt; <p> Will insert the subsecond part of the EXIF information . This value is not always present in jpeg files but some cameras will add this value when taking pictures in burst mode . <p> These tags are special width/height tags for adding the width or height in inches , centimeters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height in pixels are used with the DPI resolution embedded in metadata in the file . If no DPI-value is present 72 is used as a default . <h> TV Show tags <p> TV Show tags can be used to add TV Show information to a list of files . You need to use the TV Show Import window before using the tags . <p> &lt;TVShow Title&gt; <p> The name of the TV Show . <p> &lt;TVShow Genres&gt; <p> The list of generes the show is associated with . Genres are divided by , . <p> &lt;TVShow StartYear&gt; <p> The first year the show was aired . <p> &lt;TVShow EpisodeTitle&gt; <p> The title of the episode . <p> &lt;TVShow Season&gt; <p> Season number . <p> &lt;TVShow EpisodeNumber&gt; <p> Episode number . <p> &lt;TVShow Year&gt; <p> Year the episode was aired . <p> &lt;TVShow Month&gt; <p> Month the episode was aired . <p> &lt;TVShow Day&gt; <p> Day the episode was aired . <h> Video tags <p> Video tags can be used to extract information from video and movie files . Note , not all video types and codecs are supported . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> &lt;Video Height&gt; <p> Inserts the height of the video . <p> &lt;Video FrameRate&gt; <p> Number of frames per second . <p> &lt;Video Duration&gt; <p> The total duration of the video formatted in hours , minutes , and seconds <p> &lt;Video Hour&gt; <p> The hour time part of the video duration . Use parameter to control zero padding : &lt;Video Hour:0&gt; <p> &lt;Video Min&gt; <p> The minute time part of the video duration . Use parameter to control zero padding : &lt;Video Min:0&gt; <p> &lt;Video Sec&gt; <p> The second time part of the video duration . Use parameter to control zero padding : &lt;Video Sec:0&gt; <p> &lt;Video Codec&gt; <p> The video codec used to encode the video ( DivX , XviD ) . <p> &lt;Video Audio Codec&gt; <p> Audio codec used to encode the audio in the video file ( AC , MP3 ) . <p> &lt;Bitrate&gt; <p> Bitrate of both video and audio combined . <p> &lt;Video Bitrate&gt; <p> Bitrate of the video part of the file . <p> &lt;Video Audio Bitrate&gt; <p> Bitrate of the audio part of the file . <h> Batch modes <p> Advanced Renamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and folders . From version 3.0 it is also possible to move and copy files using the same naming technology . The batch mode drop down box is located above the files . When copy or move mode is selected a edit field will appear to the right . This field is used to specify the output folder . The clever part is that tags known from renaming methods can also be used here . Any non existing folder part will be created when the file is moved or copied . <p> Example of use : When the pattern below is used all the files will be located in a folder based on when the file was initially created . <h> Columns <p> When you right click the column header , a popup menu will appear . In that menu , you can choose which columns you want shown.Note : The column Name can not be removed . <p> If you want the columns to be shown in a different order , you can drag the column headers to new positions . All columns , except for the Name column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content of the columns by clicking on them . If you click one more time , it will sort in reverse order.Note : Not all columns can be sorted.Note : When you add new files , the new files will not be sorted automatically . <p> The columns can be dragged when there are no files in the list and when there are files in the list . But it is recommended to set up the columns before adding files to gain higher performance . <p> If you click the Customize item in the list , you will see the Customize Columns Dialog ( shown below ) . You can use this dialog for easier control of the columns . Using this dialog will also increase the performance of column settings . <p> Use the checkboxes in the Columns List to set whether the column should be shown or not . Use the 4 buttons ( Top , Up , Down , Bottom ) to move the items.Note : The column Name can not be moved . <p> To the left you can choose between different predefined column sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be shown in the Columns List . <p> It is also possible to use the Save Button to save a new set based on your settings . When you click the Save button , you are asked for a Column Set Name . Type a new name if you want to save it as a new set or type an existing name to overwrite an existing column set . <h> Command line automation <p> If you need to perform batches by automatically , like in a server environment , you can use the command line automation tool . The tool can be used to perform a batch defined by a previously saved batch method file . <p> In the Advanced Renamer folder you will find the file arenc.exe Start a shell and run the arenc.exe with the -h switch to get additional information . <h> ExifTool <p> ExifTool is a program by Phil Harvey ( **37;1130;TOOLONG ) distributed with Advanced Renamer to create support for more file formats like raw camera files , documents , zip files etc . ExifTool supports both more formats and more tags which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tag values can get investigated by selecting a file and clicking the ExifTool button in the Fileinfo box . From here you can copy a &lt;ExifTool : &gt; tag and paste it into a method of choice . <h> Fileinfo <p> The FileInfo Box is shown in the bottom of Advanced Renamer . It is possible to remove it in the Settings Dialog . It will display various information about the currently selected item in the list . The information displayed will vary depending on the type of file selected . Information about filename , location , and filetype will always be displayed for both files and folders . When a music file is selected the ID3 information will be shown , displaying track title , artist , album , track number , year , and genre . When an image file is selected a sample picture will be shown along with image height and width information and other embedded EXIF data . If you right click any information in the FileInfo Box a menu with a copy menu item will appear . This menu item can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clipboard . <h> File pairs <p> In the settings dialog you can activate file pair renaming . This will make sure file pairs will keep being paired together . <p> So what is a file pair ? A file pair is when two or more files are located in the same folder and differ on the extension . The following is a file pair : Img001.jpg Img001.tif <p> File pairs can be common when working with image files , where the same image may exist in different formats . Some cameras may produce both a JPEG file and a RAW file . This is also common for video files . <p> You can also use this mode to transfer metadata from a media file to a paired file . Imaginge using this pattern in the New Name method : Img&lt;Img Width&gt;x&lt;Img Height&gt;&lt;Inc Nr:002&gt; <p> For this pair : Picture2027.jpg Picture2027.txt <p> The result will be : Img2000x1000002.jpg Img2000x1000002.txt <p> Note , the media file must be located before the paired file in the list . <h> Hotkeys <p> F1 <p> Show this user guide <p> F2 <p> Override new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> F9 <p> Start batch <p> Del <p> Remove the selected file(s) from the list <p> Ins <p> Add file(s) to the list <p> Ctrl + Alt + Up <p> Move selected file(s) up <p> Ctrl + Alt + Down <p> Move selected file(s) down <h> Name collision rules <p> When making new names there is a chance of two files ending up with the same name . The default behavior is to fail and not rename the file but you can change this behavior by applying a different name collison rule . The 4 rules are described below . <p> Fail <p> Do n't let Advanced Renamer rename files with a name collision . This is the default behavior . <p> Append incrementing number <p> Will append a incrementing number grouped by similar filenames . If the resulting new names are as follows : <p> Foo.txt Foo.txt Bar.txt Bar.txt Bar.txt <p> The resulting names will be : <p> Foo.txt Foo001.txt Bar.txt Bar001.txt Bar002.txt <p> Append image sub second <p> Will append the Exif value Image Sub Second ( if present ) to files with the same name . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box will allow you to supply a pattern containing tags that should be applied to the end of all files with a collision . <h> Regular expressions <p> A regular expression language is a powerful way of manipulating with texts . Advanced Renamer supports the use of regular expressions for pattern searching and replacing in several methods . The use of these expressions is primarily meant for power users and people with programming experience but none the less gaining knowledge of the basics will prove to be very rewarding . A standard library called PCRE is used which means that people with prior knowledge of this library will feel right at home . Those learning this for the first time will also be able to use the skills in other similar tools . <p> This page will try to give you basic knowledge about the use of regular expressions in the context of file renaming . <p> A simple regular expression <p> A regular expression contains normal characters and metacharacters . The normal characters are interpreted as they are while the metacharacters have special meaning . Let 's start out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression above the resulting match of a filename " BayTowerzip4500.txt " will be " zip4500 " . The " d " is a metacharacter which represent any numeric value raging from 0 to 9 . The above expression matches any phrase starting with " zip " followed by 4 digits . <p> How can we use this for renaming ? <p> The most common method with regex support is the Replace method . If you in the first text field type the above expressions " zipdddd " and in the second text field type " zipunknown " any file containing " xip " followed by 4 digits will get this text phrase replaced by " zipunknown " . <p> Sequences <p> What if we do n't know how many numbers a zip code consists of ? What if some files contain " zip123 " and others " zip384739 " ? The above expression will only match if there are exactly 4 digits . If we do n't know how many digits there are we can use another meta character . Consider this expression : <p> zipd+ <p> The plus + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that this expression will match " zip123 " and " zip1234 " and " zip8000000 " . <p> Grouping <p> It is possible to define subpatterns within the pattern itself which proves very useful when using the replace method . A group is defined by enclosing a part of the pattern in a parenthesis ( ) . Given this pattern : <p> zip(d+) <p> The match is exactly the same as before except now we can access the value of the subpattern in a replace scenario . If in the replace method we put " 1zip " in the second text field the result will show that the two parts of the filename have changed place . If the filename contains " zip123 " the filename will contain " 123zip " after the method has been applied . The value of the special metacharacter 1 is in this case " 123 " . If more than one group is used the next group name will be 2 . <p> A more advanced example <p> If we have a filename like this " Michael Jackson - Thriller.mp3 " and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Michal Jackson.mp3 " we can apply a regular expression in the replace method like this : <p> Text to be replaced : ( . * ) - ( . * ) Replace with : 2 - 1 <p> In this case some familiar notation is used but also two new metacharacter . The dot matches anything character digit or non-digit . The star * matches the previous character 0 or more times . The pattern is build of two similar groups divided by - . The first group matches " Michal Jackson " and putting it into 1 while the second group matches " Thriller " putting it into 2 . Because the first group is replaced by the value of the second and vice versa , the two parts of the filename change place . <h> Settings dialog <h> Environment <p> Explorer Context Menu When turned on you will be able to add files and folders in Windows Explorer by just right clicking the items.Default : Off <p> Associate . aren files with Advanced Renamer Files named . aren containing renaming presets can be opened with Advanced Renamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presets from the file.Default : On <p> Save settings folder Those where to save your personal settings . Normally the files are located in an application folder in the user account folder . If you prefer you can store the files where aren.exe ( the Advanced Renamer executable ) is located . This is the setting used when using the program in a portable configuration.Default : When using the installer : Perosnal folder , when using the portable version : Same folder as aren.exe <h> Image files <p> Thumbnail width &amp; heigh This specifies the dimension of the thumbnails when Advanced Renamer is in thumbnail mode . The thumbnail mode works with any file , but is only really useful when sorting and renaming pictures.Default : Width : 120 Height : 120 <p> EXIF-field for image date time operations Image files can have up to three different timestamps stored in the Exif informations . Use this option to choose which value you want Advanced Renamer should use when reading file information.Default : Date taken <p> Use EXIF information for image width and height If turned on , the program will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the image file . If no EXIF information is found , Advanced Renamer will open the image to determine the dimensions of the image . If this feature is turned off the program will always open the image file to find the width and height which is slower than using EXIF . EXIF is primarily used on JPEG images taken with a digital camera.Default : On <h> Music files <p> ID3 Sequence Choose in which order Advanced Renamer should look for ID3 tags in music files.Default : ID3v2 , ID3v1 <h> Program <p> Show FileInfo BoxIf checked , the FileInfo Box to the left of Advanced Renamer is shown . Learn more about the FileInfo Box here.Default : On <p> Confirm Clear list When you select Clear from the List menu or close Advanced Renamer , when there are still files in the list , a confirmation box will be shown . If you uncheck this , the confirmation box will not be shown.Default : On <p> Show grid Toggles the file and folder list grid.Default : On <p> Show help getting startet Will display a button in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no files in the list . Default : On <p> Auto close progress dialog When turned on the batch progress dialog will automatically close when there is no errors . Default : Off <p> Check for updates at start up Let Advanced Renamer automatically check for updates every time the program starts . A link to the download site will be displayed in the bottom of the main window when there is an update . Default : On <h> Renaming <p> Replace Unsupported With Determines what unsupported chars in ID3/MP3 Tags should be replaced with . ID3 Tags often includes chars that are invalid for filenames eg. : or / . Default : " " <p> Word separators Some features work on the words of a filename . The New Case method can change case of the first letter of every word , and the Word tag can be used to insert a word from the filename in an other location of the filename . Use this text field to change which characters are used to separate the words.Default : " . , -() ! " <p> Use wildcards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to use * to represent " anything " when replacing text in the Replace method . Default : On <p> Use zero padding in Inc Nr tags When turned on the numbers produced by Inc Nr and Inc NrDir will have leading zeros . The number of leading zeroes will depend on the number of items in the list or the number of files in the folder depending the tag in use.Default : On <p> Checked state affects Inc Nr tags If checked the Inc Nr tag will only increment for items in the list where the checkbox is checked.Default : Off <h> The List <p> Files vs . Folders You can not rename both files and folders at the same time . You can choose between Files View or Folders View by using the two buttons above the list . <p> Add Files There are several ways to add files to the list . You can drag files from Explorer or any other file manager . You can also click Add in the toolbar or in the right click menu or click the Insert button on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the open files dialog . <p> Add all Files in a Directory You can also choose to select all files in a directory by clicking first Add then Directory in the toolbar . A dialog like the one to the right will appear . If you want all files in subdirectories to be added as well , you can check the Include Subdirectories checkbox . Use the Mask box to specify what file types you want to add . If you want to add more than one file type , you can separate them by ; ( eg. *. jpg ; *. gif ) . If you want to add all files , just leave the Mask blank.Note : This is not possible when you are in Folders View . <p> Add Folders To add a folder to the Folders View , the best way is to drag them from Explorer or any other file manager . Another way is to click Add and then Directory in the toolbar . That is the same as right clicking in the list and choose Add or just hitting the Insert button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the list , you just select them and select Remove from the right click popup menu . Or you can use the Delete button on your keyboard . <p> Move Items It is also possible to move the items to another position in the list . It is only possible to drag one item to a new position , but if you use CTRL + UP or Down , you can move all selected items either up or down . <p> Save List If you want to save the list for later use , you can either click List -&gt; Save in the toolbar or you can right click and choose Save List . The list will be saved in a regular text file , which can be opened in any text editor . <p> Load List To load a list of files , click List -&gt; Load in the toolbar or right click and choose Load List . The list does not have to be a list saved by Advanced Renamer . You can write the list in any raw text editor , save it and load it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exit thumbnail mode , use the button Thumbnail on the toolbar . Thumbnail mode is intended for sorting and renaming image files by displaying the actual image instead of the small icon in the list . You can use the settings dialog to specify the size of your thumbnails . <p> Next to the Thumbnails button there is a View Style selection button . The button can be used to change how the files will be displayed in the list . Some views are more suited for sorting image files than others but displays less details . <p> Be aware that extracting thumbnails from all the files in the list may take some time and stress your computer hardware . Using too big a list in thumbnail mode can make Advanced Renamer and your computer slow . <h> CSV import <p> With the CSV import window you can import both files and new file names into Advanced Renamer . <p> FilenameThe csv file can either be a file previously saved by Advanced Renamer or created in a program like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice . <p> Base folderIf the csv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can use this control to define a common base path for the files . <p> Column separatorThe separator used to separate the individual columns in the csv file . This is usually ; or , . <p> First line is headerIf the first line in the csv file is a header line describing the column names you should check this to ignore this line . <p> Column for original filename / Column for new filenameThe column index of the original file names and the new filenames . <h> TV Show import <p> If you have files representing TV Shows you can import the tv show and use the TV Show Tags to add show information to the filenames or create completely new filenames based on the show information . Before starting you should add the files to Advanced Renamer and make sure they are n the correct order . Click Import in the menu and select TV Show Import . Type the name of the TV Show and click search . Locate your show in the list , select it and lick next . <p> On the next page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and select the episodes you want to import . Click OK and the information will be available as tags in Advanced Renamer.

Any suggestions as to the issue ? Help please ! <p> The folder contains image names from 0 to 999 each with 3 suffixes so there are roughly 4000 lines total . The Lightroom ( and other ? ) image management programs do not seem to recognise the suffix so annotations become attached to the wrong image . <p> My solution means the new image name will no longer match the filepath image name . So I am presuming I will use AR to rename all the actual images as well ? Or perhaps there is an easier way ? <p> The problem has arisen because the annotation program PixFiler deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would now like all annotations contained within the image itself . <p> I have read the csv guide and can load the first column via CSV Import , but each option I try in Advanced Renamer produces " Can not find source file " in the Status column . <p> If CSV Import will not work , is there any way of separately working on the first column only , then copying it back into the CSV later ? <p> I would very much appreciate any assistance . <p> David <p> Edit - Trying to think more laterally about my problem , is the timestamp renaming method going to be easier to implement ? <p> The timestamp for my all images is recorded and will be unique between the Pixfiler metadata ( containing the annotations ) and the original image . Helps says I can " change the date and time of the filename " . Does this mean that I can change the image name from DSCxxxx to say 2009-05-02 11:49:23am ? A csv file could then be used to transfer my annotations into the image itself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annotations issue ? ( On reading Help I see that the New Name Method with Datetime tag will only apply a start of rename time and not date taken time , so will not work for me ) . <p> Reply to #8 : Further to my donation to your program , can you please tell me the name of a simple text editor which will allow renaming and removing in a list of image names in an easy manner similar to the way Advanced Renamer does it . ( I know nothing about the command interface ) . <p> Can you tell me , do any of these Editor programs have a simple graphical method for ( say ) deleting the last 3 characters of each cell in a column , eg <p> DSC037903 DSC038043 <p> changes to <p> DSC0379 DSC0380 <p> Your program does this in a simple easy to follow graphical format without writing macros or scripts , but simply by selecting remove/replace/add etc menu options , then selecting check boxes against required filenames . Very simple and graphical , and I am not good at macros , or the command line interface . 
@@22131472 @2131472/ <h> Date/time bugs <p> I have been having the problem that setting the timestamp for creation or modification is off by 1 hour . Similarly using the timestamp to change the file name is off by 1 hour in the other direction . This may be related to daylight savings time in Windows 7 . <p> In addition I have had difficulty with the timestamp in a batch where several commands were done in a row . 1 . Set the timestamp from the information in the name . 2 . Adjust the timestamp by an offset 3. insert timestamp info into the name <p> The first time I would execute it , it didnt't work for a given file . But then put the file back and it worked . It appears that the first time sets the timestamp , and the second time adjusts it and puts it into the name . <p> However if I separate the steps and do them one at a time , I can get it to work reliably . <p> It is good that the Exif data can be used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using it to change the filename , again possibly daylight savings problems . But I would like to be be abe to change it such as the Date taken , the copyright , and the author . In particular an option on the timestamp method to change the Exif timestamp would be super . <p> This would be VERY helpful for maintaining the Exif information while using editors that do not handle it correctly , or translation between formats that do not have these fields . <p> Reply to #1 : I have had this request before . The use of timestamps needs some work . I will take a look at it at some convenient time . Also as I remember , timestamp changes are not revertable . I think the 1 hour off issue is due to some dayligt savings time configuration . What time zone are you in ? <p> Reply to #2 : I am in US Central time . Which is currently on daylight time . I was translating a time to Thailand which is currently on standard time . That is my camera was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Thailand so I needed to translate to the Thai time . I had put the date-time taken into the filename yy-mm-dd hr ; mn ; ss . When I put the encoded time in the file name into the modification time , it changed by 1 hour . The delta time change worked as one would expect . But then when I put the modification time into the file name there was a 1 hour change in the reverse direction . So the end result was the correct encoding in the file name . <p> I do this so the pictures will be automatically in order . I could use the date taken , but that is often wiped out by various programs and not supported in all formats . It is a jungle ! ! ! <p> Perhaps variables for storing various date times when making translations would provide a fix . In other words when a date-time is referenced or changed also keep it in a variable . Then the next command that references it would use the value in the variable rather than the value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next operation in a string that the previous one has not been finished . I do n't know if this has anything to do with the fact that I have a dual processor . Pr perhaps a check for completion is necessary . <p> Reply to #3 : When timestamps methods and naming methods in the same batch you wo n't always get the result you expect . I will make sure it will get fixed in a later release . I am working on adding unicode support to Advanced Renamer so it might take a little while until I get to fixing this . <p> Reply to #4 : The time offset was found by doing the process one step at a time and not by putting them into the same batch . When I put the steps together as one batch nothing worked properly . Essentially the first time I ran it nothing seemed to happen , but the second time , it worked . I found that the first time changed the modification date , but that did not transfer to the file name . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hooray for getting unicode to work . Ant renamer has had that for a long time , but it is not as versatile as your program , and it messes up sometimes when using the EXIF date taken to change the file name . It also does not have multiple level undo , but it has a much simpler interface . <p> A nice enhancement to your interface might be to have a button which puts back the list of files used in the last batch . This is not an undo , but rather a means for getting the same files back for subsequent changes . Ant keeps the list of files which sometimes causes problems if you forget to clear it when changing other files , so the current behavior is probably better . Ant development is dead . <p> Some well know commercial programs such as some MAGIX products still ca n't handle unicode , and sadly Karenware gags on it . Since Karen is deceased her wonderful programs may never be updated . They are available in source for the venturesome . <p> Reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unicode conversion . That biggest problems arise when dealing with resources in files . By resources I mean ID3 tags in MP3 files , some Exif information in image files , and information in video files . I was afraid all the wonderful translations people have submitted were no longer usable , but they still work ! ! Some visual errors seen by people using more obscure ( obscure to me ) alphabets are also fixed with the unicode support . <p> Advanced Renamer already have a button for adding the renamed or non-renamed files to the list again . After the rename you will see a result-box in the lower right corner of the program . In that box you have the option of adding the files again .

By clicking the Filename column you can change sort by this column . Clicking the column again will sort them in reverse order . Using the IncNr tag when sorting the list in reverse order will have the same effect as a DecNr tag .

So I need to use ExifTool tag which is **33;1271;TOOLONG . Unfortunately it is not possible to build folder structure for copying files using this tag , because &lt;Substr : : POS:COUNT:START&gt; tag works only on original file names which do not contain the correct date yet . <p> Therefore my job has to be divided into two phases : <p> - the first phase is to rename files according to ExifTool information and place them into the flat folder - the second one is to copy files , producing needed folder structure taking ( new ) original names into account . <p> The point is : the argument of the &lt;Substr&gt; tag could be the current ( latest ) filename ( instead of original filename ) .

And ( . + ) And does the $ specify to AR to stop searching the filename once it finds the expression specified between and $ thereby ignoring the rest of the filename ? I notice you have ( . + ) at the beginning and the end of the expression what does this do exactly <p> Also what is the difference between using the $ in the Replace With field vs using / in the Replace Field . When should I use one or the other . <p> I really appreciate your skill with this app . Tell me are you the developer because I think all of the help I 've gotten to my questions so far are from you ? <p> I would like to get rid of all the text dates and have them converted to digit dates in the specified format instead . Is there a better , more efficient way to do that ? <p> Sometimes there are year ranges in the format yyyy-yyyy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method which will create the aforementioned format to not interfere with these dates . <p> Right now I am using about 35 different methods ( maybe more ) to accomplish this but If there is a way that I can more efficiently do it like the volume resolution method you showed me I would absolutely love that . Right now some of the batch methods I am using have upwards of 300 methods in them so it takes a while to load if I want to load a different group of methods because there are so many methods in them even though I am using a SSD for my OS and the batches are also stored on a SSD . <p> I would like to be able to convert all the following formats into the form " ## ( Of ## ) " and I would like to be able to do it all in the same replace method if possible . Right now I am accomplishing this end through the use of 21 separate replace methods . <p> I also have other similar tasks where it would be VERY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same replace method . So is there a character I can use to separate multiple criteria when the " Use regular expressions " box is checked so that AR will be able to see them .

Thank you in advance <p> Reply to #1 : Advanced Renamer tries to figure out why a file might not be renamed correctly . When there is no indication of not being able to rename a file and it still ca n't be renamed the Unknwn Error message is displayed . This is most oftens means that the file is in use or is located in a folder where you do n't have write access , like on a cd-drive or in the program files folder . <p> Reply to #3 : You can not rename a folder when a file in the folder or a child folder is in use by a program . There might be other circumstances where you can not rename a folder due to similar issues . This is normal Winodws behavior.

With some pictures , their WEST longitude is interpreted as EAST longitude , giving India instead of Panama .

Is this even possible ? Hopefully I made my goal clear enough . Thanks in advance ! <p> Reply to #1 : I do n't think you can set up a renaming rule that will do that .

Do you have any examples of using the command line with the list feature ? <p> Reply to #3 : Your case is a very special case . That might be why no other renamers support this feature . It is not that it is impossible to implement , but it is difficult to design in a way generic enough for other people to use it too . <p> I always tell people that the command line tool can do all the same things the graphical user interface can do .

Is there a way to get a one character wildcard , or is there some better way altogether to use instead ? <p> Reply to #1 : A simple way to add dashes to dates is to use the Replace method and configure it like this : Text to be replaced : ( dddd ) ( dd ) ( dd ) Replace with : 1-2-3 Use regular expressions : checked <p> The d character is used to represent one digit ( 0-9 ) .

Working with TIF files of 100MB each will take a while otherwise . <p> Reply to #1 : TIF files are generally large and slow which will also impact the performance of analyzing the files in Advanced Renamer .

@@22131597 @2131597/ <h> Subfolders Rename <p> First of all , thanks for the AdvancedRenamer . Renaming files has never been so smooth and easy I must say . However , I stumbled across a problem when I tried to batch rename folders and subfolders they contain . The very issue has been mentioned here on the forum several times but never really answered . The folders are not restricted or write-protected . I reckon the real problem is changing the paths to the subfolders by renaming root folders . Collision occurs and AR produces an error . <p> I could think of two solutions but unfortunately I was n't successful in applying none of them . 1 . Starting renaming process from the deepest folder so the root folders stay untouched until final phase of the batch rename process . 2 . Refreshing the path information after each file is processed so the changed folder name is updated at the beginning of each individual rename . <p> Does any of those make any sense ? I 'd be really grateful for your help - it 'd really be a life ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Renaming sub folders can be tricky because of the operating systems locking mechanisms . It is very easy to accidentally lock the subfolder or parent folder being renamed and preventing the rename operation . There are a couple of solutions I can implement , but none of them are bullet proof and they all take quite a bit of time to implement . I a future release this problem is hopefully reduced .
