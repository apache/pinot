A briefing is provided below . <h> Brief Snapshot of suicide in Australia1 <p> Suicide is a prominent public health concern . Over a five year period from 2011 to 2015 , the average number of suicide deaths per year was 2,687 . <p> In 2015 , preliminary data showed a total of 3,027 deaths by suicide ( 12.7 per 100,000 ) , 2,292 males ( 19.4 per 100,000 ) and 735 females ( 6.2 per 100,000 ) . There were 2,864 deaths in 2014 ( 12.2 per 100,000 ) . <p> In 2015 , preliminary data showed an average of 8.3 deaths by suicide in Australia each day . <p> For those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent , there were 152 deaths due to suicide ( 110 male , 42 female ) , which was the 5th most common cause of death . For NSW , Qld , SA , WA and NT , the standardised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25.5 per 100,000 ) was twice the rate of non-Indigenous ( 12.5 per 100,000 ) . For further facts and statistics relating to the Indigenous population , visit the priority population facts and stats page . <p> The highest age-specific suicide rate for males in 2015 was observed in the 85+ age group ( 39.3 per 100,000 ) with 68 deaths . This rate was considerably higher than the age-specific suicide rate observed in all other age groups , with the next highest age-specific suicide rate being in the 45-49 , 40-44 and 50-54 year age groups ( 31.5 , 30.6 and 30.5 per 100,000 respectively ) . The lowest age-specific suicide rate for males was in the 0-14 year age group ( 0.3 per 100,000 ) and the 15-19 year age group ( 11.8 per 100,000 ) . <p> The highest age-specific suicide rate for females in 2015 was observed in the 45-49 age group with 82 deaths ( 10.4 per 100,000 ) , followed by the 50-54 , 35-39 and 55-59 age groups ( 9.4 , 8.6 and 8.6 per 100,000 respectively ) . The lowest age-specific suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 8 deaths ( 0.4 per 100,000 ) followed by the 65-69 age group ( 4.5 per 100,000 ) and the 60-64 and 75-79 age groups ( both 5.4 per 100,000 respectively ) . <p> Suicide rates in Australia peaked in 1963 ( 17.5 per 100,000 ) , declining to 11.3 per 100,000 in 1984 , and climbing back to 14.6 in 1997 . Rates have been lower than this since that year . The age-standardised suicide rate for persons in 2015 was 12.7 per 100,000 . <p> Consistently over the past 10 years , the number of suicide deaths was approximately 3 times higher in males than females . In 2015 , 75.6% of people who died by suicide were male . <p> Of all causes of death , 1.9% was attributed to suicide in 2015 . The proportion of total deaths attributed to suicide was higher in males ( 2.8% ) than females ( 0.9% ) . <h> Facts and Statistics1 <h> Suicide and age <p> Overall , the age-specific suicide rate in 2015 was highest in men aged 85 or above ( 39.3 per 100,000 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males , with the exception of those aged over 85 , in 2015 age-specific suicide rates were highest among those of middle age ( i.e. 40-54 ) . <p> For females , 2015 data showed that the highest age-specific suicide rate was observed in the 45-49 year age group ( 10.4 per 100,000 ) . The age group with the highest age-specific rates tends to vary in females , with the 45-49 age group the fourth highest in 2014 . <p> Age-specific suicide rates are lowest in those aged under 20 years of age . <p> For children ( 0-14 years ) , death by suicide is rare in Australia ( 0.3 per 100,000 ) . Age-specific suicide rates are low for both males ( 0.3 per 100,000 ) and females ( 0.4 per 100,000 ) . <p> The table below provides a comparison of trends in suicide between 19973 ( the most recent peak ) and 20151 . <p> Age groups <p> Sex <p> 1997 <p> 2015 <p> No. of deaths <p> Age-specific rate ( /100,000 ) <p> No. of deaths <p> Age-specific rate ( /100,000 ) <p> 15-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> F <p> 33 <p> 5.3 <p> 56 <p> 7.8 <p> 20-24 <p> M <p> 295 <p> 42.8 <p> 192 <p> 22.5 <p> F <p> 60 <p> 9.0 <p> 54 <p> 6.7 <p> 25-29 <p> M <p> 294 <p> 40.5 <p> 207 <p> 23.4 <p> F <p> 59 <p> 8.1 <p> 60 <p> 6.9 <p> 30-34 <p> M <p> 246 <p> 34.6 <p> 216 <p> 24.6 <p> F <p> 56 <p> 7.8 <p> 59 <p> 6.8 <p> 35-39 <p> M <p> 215 <p> 29.2 <p> 214 <p> 27.2 <p> F <p> 64 <p> 8.6 <p> 68 <p> 8.6 <p> 40-44 <p> M <p> 216 <p> 31.5 <p> 251 <p> 30.6 <p> F <p> 58 <p> 8.4 <p> 70 <p> 8.4 <p> 45-49 <p> M <p> 153 <p> 23.5 <p> 244 <p> 31.5 <p> F <p> 45 <p> 7.0 <p> 82 <p> 10.4 <p> 50-54 <p> M <p> 141 <p> 25.3 <p> 235 <p> 30.5 <p> F <p> 51 <p> 9.5 <p> 74 <p> 9.4 <p> 55-59 <p> M <p> 98 <p> 22.5 <p> 155 <p> 21.7 <p> F <p> 32 <p> 7.6 <p> 63 <p> 8.6 <p> 60-64 <p> M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 24 <p> 6.6 <p> 35 <p> 5.4 <p> 56-59 <p> M <p> 77 <p> 22.8 <p> 108 <p> 18.9 <p> F <p> 25 <p> 7.1 <p> 26 <p> 4.5 <p> 70-74 <p> M <p> 69 <p> 24.5 <p> 78 <p> 18.6 <p> F <p> 22 <p> 6.7 <p> 28 <p> 6.4 <p> 75-79 <p> M <p> 131 <p> 31.6 <p> 61 <p> 20.2 <p> F <p> 41 <p> 7.0 <p> 18 <p> 5.4 <p> 80-84 <p> M <p> - <p> - <p> 52 <p> 26.2 <p> F <p> - <p> - <p> 17 <p> 6.7 <p> 85+ <p> M <p> - <p> - <p> 68 <p> 39.3 <p> F <p> - <p> - <p> 17 <p> 5.7 <p> Total <p> M <p> 2,146* <p> 23.3** <p> 2,292 <p> 19.4 <p> F <p> 577* <p> 6.2** <p> 735 <p> 6.2 <p> Note : * represents the sum of all deaths including ages not stated. ** represents the age-specific rate of all deaths including ages not stated . <h> Suicide and gender1 <p> Suicide is approximately three times higher in males , which is consistent across every state and territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The ratio of male to female suicides rose from 2:1 in the 1960s to over 4:1 in the 1990s . Since the year 2000 , the ratio of male to female suicides has been approximately 3:1 . <p> For males , in 2015 the most common mechanism of suicide was hanging ( 58.8% ) , followed by poisoning by drugs ( 10.3% ) , firearms ( 7.6% ) and then poisoning by other agents ( 7.4% ) . <p> For females , in 2015 hanging ( 48.7% ) was also the most common method , followed by poisoning by drugs ( 26.3% ) . <p> In 2015 , suicide represented 2.8% of all male deaths and 0.9% of all female deaths . <p> The proportion of deaths attributed to suicide varies greatly among age groups1 with a much greater percentage of the total causes of death attributed to suicide in younger age groups . This variation reflects considerably lower number of deaths in younger people , and the greater proportion of deaths by other causes in older people . <p> Age groups <p> Suicide as a percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 33.9 <p> 20-24 <p> 37.9 <p> 31.4 <p> 25-29 <p> 33.8 <p> 24.9 <p> 30-34 <p> 27.9 <p> 17.8 <p> 35-39 <p> 23.6 <p> 13.2 <p> 40-44 <p> 18.4 <p> 9.1 <p> 45-49 <p> 13.5 <p> 7.3 <p> 50-54 <p> 8.7 <p> 4.4 <p> 55-59 <p> 4.2 <p> 2.8 <p> 60-64 <p> 2.4 <p> 1.2 <p> 65-69 <p> 1.6 <p> 0.6 <p> 70-74 <p> 1.0 <p> 0.5 <p> 75-79 <p> 0.6 <p> 0.2 <p> 80-84 <p> 0.4 <p> 0.2 <p> 85+ <p> 0.3 <p> 0.0 <p> Total <p> 2.8 <p> 0.9 <h> Suicide by state and territory1 <p> Combining suicide data over a five-year period provides a more reliable picture of differences across the states and territories due to the relatively small number of suicides in some states and territories in any one year . <p> In recent years ( 2011-2015 ) , the state based age-standardised suicide rates were highest in the Northern Territory ( 18.7 per 100,000 ) and Tasmania ( 14.2 per 100,000 ) , followed by Queensland ( 14.1 per 100,000 ) , Western Australia ( 13.9 per 100,000 ) and South Australia ( 12.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New South Wales ( 9.7 per 100,000 ) , Victoria ( 9.7 per 100,000 ) and the Australian Capital Territory ( 9.3 per 100,000 ) . <h> Attempted suicide5 <p> According to hospitals data , females are more likely to deliberately injure themselves than males . In the 2008-2009 financial year , 62% of those who were hospitalised due to self-harm were female . <p> For males and females , the highest rate of deliberate self-harm occurred for those aged from their teens to middle age . In 2008-2009 , 73% of those who were hospitalised due to self-harm were aged between 15 and 44 years , with the highest rates observed in females aged 25-44 years ( 6,809 per 100,000 population ) . The same age group also had the highest hospitalisation rate in males ( 4,791 per 100,000 population ) . <p> From 2008 to 2009 , there were 26,935 cases of hospitalised care due to self-harm ; a rate of 117.9 cases per 100,000 population . It is important to recognise , however , not all people who are hospitalised due to self-harm may have intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much lower among both older men and women 65+ years ( 4% ) and children under 14 years ( 1.9% ) than other age groups in 2008-2009 . However , the average length of stay in hospital due to self-harm was highest among older age groups i.e. 65+ years . <h> Groups at risk of suicide <p> People with a previous history of attempted suicide are at greatest risk of suicide5 . <p> Mental disorders such as major depression , psychotic illnesses and eating disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide especially after discharge from hospital or when treatment has been reduced6 , 7 . <p> People with alcohol or drug abuse problems have a higher risk of dying by suicide than the general population . <p> Males are around three times more likely to die by suicide than females . <p> The suicide rate for Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander People ( 25.0 per 100,000 ) is twice as high as non-indigenous people ( 12.5 per 100,000 ) . <h> Youth suicide1 , 2 , 3 <p> In 2015 , 89 males aged 15-19 years ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 22.5 per 100,000 ) died by suicide . <p> Males aged 15-19 years ( 11.8 per 100,000 ) were the second lowest of all male age-specific suicide rates . <p> In the same year , 56 females aged 15-19 years ( 7.8 per 100,000 ) , and 54 females aged 20 to 24 years ( 6.7 per 100,000 ) died by suicide . <p> Considering all causes of death , suicide accounted for 28.6% of deaths among 15-19 year old males and 37.9% of deaths among 20-24 year old males in 2015 . The corresponding percentages for females in both of these age groups are 33.9% and 31.4% respectively . <p> During the mid-1980s , suicide rates for 15-19 year old males rose rapidly and peaked at 21.0 per 100,000 in 1988 . Over the following decade , rates fluctuated around 17-19 per 100,000 for this group and stood at 18.4 per 100,000 in 1997 . <p> For males , suicide rates in those aged 15-19 years have gradually declined since the 1990s , with a peak of 19.0 per 100,000 in 1991 . The suicide rate has fluctuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 10 years . <p> For females , the suicide rates for females aged 159-19 show that rates peaked in 1997 ( 9.0 per 100,000 ) and were lowest in 2003 ( 3.8 per 100,000 ) . Preliminary data for 2015 was 7.8 per 100,000 . <h> Note : about using statistics <p> Caution should be exercised in reporting and interpreting suicide and self-harm information . <p> In the past , the reliability of suicide statistics is affected by a number of factors including differences in state-specific reporting methods across Australia , and delays in the post-mortem processing of possible suicides by coroners . <p> The ABS has instituted a significant quality assurance process to improve the quality of coding of deaths data . ABS advises that care should be taken in comparing suicide data since 2013 with all suicide data from 2006 - 2012 , as the quality improvement review process on this data has been finalised . <p> As the release of the 2015 preliminary data was earlier than previous years , the data shown here represents 2013 ( first revision ) and both 2014 and 2015 preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2013 data will be available in early 2017 . <p> Due to the relatively small numbers of suicides in some states and territories , even one or two deaths can have a significant impact on standardised suicide rates . Thus comparisons across Australia must be done cautiously . <p> Data on suicides can be reported in different ways , including : the number of people who died by suicide ; the age-standardised suicide rate ( e.g. seven per 100,000 people , this allows for the comparison of groups with different age structures and sizes ) ; and as a percentage of deaths from all causes which were due to suicide . <p> The comparison of international suicide statistics can be very difficult due to differences in procedures for coronial reporting and classifying deaths , definitions , time periods , and the level of undercounting.

Below is a summary of brief facts about mental illness that media professionals can use within a story or use to provide context for a story . <p> Please also visit our Story sources and contacts page for organisations which can provide further detailed information and statistics about specific mental illnesses . <p> In 2007 , the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) conducted the second National Survey of Mental Health and Well-being . The survey involved approximately 8,800 people aged over 16 years and living in private dwellings in all states and territories of Australia . <p> Almost one in five Australians surveyed had experienced symptoms of a mental disorder during the 12 month period before the survey . <p> Anxiety disorders were most common 14.4% , followed by affective disorders - 6.2% ( of which depression is 4.1% ) , and substance use disorders 5.1% ( of which 4.3% is alcohol related ) . <p> The percentage of people meeting the criteria for diagnosis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevalence decreasing with age . Twenty-six per cent of 18-24 year olds had experienced a mental disorder , while only 5.9% of people aged 65 years and over had experienced a mental disorder . <p> People unemployed or not in the paid workforce had the highest rates of mental disorder , a prevalence rate of 26% for unemployed men and 34% for unemployed women . <p> Those with a mental disorder averaged three days out of role ( i.e. unable to undertake normal activity because of health problems ) over a four week period . This compared with one day out of role for people with no physical or mental condition . <p> Adolescents with mental health problems reported a high rate of suicidal thoughts and other health-risk behaviours , including smoking , drinking and drug use . <p> Twelve per cent of 13-17 year olds reported having thought about suicide , while 4.2% had actually made a suicide attempt . Females had higher rates of suicidal ideation than males . <p> When it came to use of substances , 23.1% reported smoking , 36.7% reported drinking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of Australian children and adolescents aged 4-17 have mental health or behavioural problems . <p> This rate of mental health problems is found in all age and gender groups . Boys were slightly more likely to experience mental health problems than girls . <p> There is a higher prevalence of child and adolescent mental health problems among those living in low-income , step/blended and sole-parent families . <p> Mental health problems were experienced by 21.1% of males and 22.1% of females with weekly household incomes of less than $580 , compared to 8.9% of males and 9.1% of females living in households with a weekly income of more than $1,030 . <p> For youth living in step / blended families ( 25% of males , 19.7% of females ) and sole parent families ( 22.2% of males , 26.7% of females ) reported experiencing mental health problems , compared to youth ( 11.3% of males , 10.7% of females ) living with their original parents together . <p> Only one out of every four young persons with mental health problems had received professional health care . <p> Family doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most frequently used by young people with mental health problems . Younger children ( 4-12 ) were more likely to visit paediatricians and family doctors , while older children were more likely to visit school-based counselling services . <p> Even among young people with the most severe mental health problems , only 50% receive professional help . Parents reported that help was too expensive or they did n't  know where to get it , and that they thought they could manage on their own . <p> Men and women experience similar rates of mental illness , but rates are highest for men and women living alone . Similarly , rates of mental disorder were higher among people who were separated or divorced ( 17% for men and 19% for women ) . <p> Women are more likely than men to experience anxiety disorders ( 18% compared with 11% ) and affective disorders ( 7.1% compared with 5.3% ) . <p> Men were more than twice as likely as women to have substance abuse disorders ( 7% compared with 3.3% ) , with alcohol use disorders more common than drug use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and affective disorders in combination . <p> Men were more likely to have substance use disorders in combination with either affective or anxiety disorders . <p> One in five recent mothers will experience a mild , moderate or severe form of post-natal depression . <p> Though men and women are affected by schizophrenia in approximately equal numbers , women tend to experience later onset , fewer periods of illness and better recovery . <p> Mental illness is not a life sentence . Most people will recover fully , especially if they receive help early . Some people may require ongoing treatment to manage their illness . <p> Some people have only one episode of mental illness and recover fully . For others , mental illness occurs only occasionally with years of wellness between episodes . For a minority of those with a more severe illness , periods of acute illness may occur more regularly and , without medication and effective management , leave little room for recovery . <p> Many kinds of treatment are available . Not all involve medication . <p> Though some people experience significant disability as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full and productive lives while receiving ongoing treatment and medication . <p> Many people experiencing mental illness delay seeking help because they are frightened by the illness and fear stigma and discrimination . Reducing the stigma will encourage more people to seek help early . <p> Most people with a mental illness are treated in the community , with most consulting their GPs . <p> Myth : mental illnesses are all the same <p> There are many types of mental illness , which can be distinguished by clearly defined symptom profiles . <p> Though a particular mental illness will tend to show a certain range of symptoms , not everyone will experience the same symptoms - for example many people with schizophrenia may hear voices , while others may not . <p> Simply knowing a person has a mental illness will not tell you how well or i 'll they are , what symptoms they are experiencing , or whether they may recover or manage the illness effectively . <p> Mental illnesses are not purely ' psychological ' and can have many physical features . While a mental illness may affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have strong physical effects such as insomnia , weight gain or loss , increase or loss of energy , chest pain and nausea . <p> Myth : people who are mentally i 'll are violent <p> Research indicates that people receiving treatment for a mental illness are no more violent or dangerous than the general population . <p> People living with a mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence , especially self-harm . It has been calculated that the lifetime risk of someone with an illness such as schizophrenia seriously harming or killing another person is just 0.005% , while the risk of that person harming themselves is nearly 10% . <p> There appears to be a weak statistical association between mental illness and violence . This seems to be concentrated in certain subgroups , for example - people not receiving treatment who have a history of violence , and those who abuse drugs or alcohol . However , the association between mental illness and violence is still weaker than the association between violence and alcohol abuse in general , or between violence and being a young male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : some cultural groups are more likely than others to experience mental illness <p> Anyone can develop a mental illness and no one is immune to mental health problems . <p> People born in Australia have slightly higher rates of mental illness that those born outside Australia in either English-speaking or non-English speaking countries . <p> Many people from culturally and linguistically diverse and refugee backgrounds have experienced torture , trauma and enormous loss before coming to Australia . These experiences can cause significant psychological distress and vulnerability to mental illness . <p> Cultural background affects how people experience mental illness and how they understand and interpret the symptoms of mental illness . 
@@30350532 @4050532/ <h> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians <h> Facts and statistics about social and emotional wellbeing and suicide <p> It is important to note that caution should be exercised in examining information and data on patterns of mental illness and suicide in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities , as accurate statistics and population estimates are unavailable . There may therefore be limitations with regards to the quality of data elicited from existing research . Discussion in the field draws both on available Australian research and limited data on hospitalisation and mortality rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people . The following information is presented to progress the development of an understanding of the factors that influence and impact on the mental health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians . <p> On Tuesday 20th March 2012 , the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) released the 2010 Causes of Death data . The suicide statistics on this webpage were updated in April 2012 to reflect the new data . <p> Click on the links below , for a quick link to relevant sections on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strait Islander person is a person of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as such by the community in which he or she lives . <h> Population Context1 , 2 <p> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples comprised 2.5% ( 550,000 people ) of the total Australian population in 2009 . Torres Strait Islanders comprised 6% of the total Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population . Of these , 90% identify as Aboriginal , 6% identity as Torres Strait Islanders , and 4% identify as both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander . <p> A significant proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people ( 68% ) live outside the major urban centres . In 2006 , around one in four Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians lived in remote areas compared with only one in 50 other Australians . <p> Over half of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population live in either NSW ( 30% ) or QLD ( 28% ) . Although the Northern Territory ( NT ) has only 12% of Australia 's Aboriginal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NT population , which is the highest proportion in any state or territory . More than half ( 58% ) of all Torres Strait Islander people live in Queensland . <p> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are a young population with a median age of 21 years compared with 37 years for other Australians . As a result , it can be misleading to make direct comparisons with the broader Australian population which has a different age structure . <p> The estimated life expectancy at birth of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is much lower than for other Australians . <h> Mental Health <p> Some people , including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians , prefer the term ' social and emotional wellbeing ' , rather than ' mental health ' because of its more positive and holistic connotations3 . <p> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have traditionally viewed health as not only including the physical health of the person , but also the social , emotional and spiritual wellbeing of the whole community .

Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people carry a significant burden of loss and bereavement from an early age , due in part to the high rates of mortality , illness , incarceration , deaths in custody and involuntary hospitalisation among people in their communities . <p> Any consideration of mental health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be set within the context of Australian history and social change . Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and communities continue to be affected by the European colonisation in terms of the loss of traditional lands , the forced separation of families and the loss of cultural identity . <p> Data on hospitalisation and mortality due to serious mental disorders and illnesses provides a main source of information about mental disorders in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people .

@@30350546 @4050546/ <h> What is the media ? <p> The means of mass communication such as newspapers , radio , magazines and television ; <p> The group of journalists and others who constitute the communications industry and the profession . <p> Traditionally there are two broad groups of media within Australia : <p> Broadcast media - including radio and television ; <p> Print media - including newspapers and magazines . <p> A recent addition to the media landscape is the Internet and the availability of online sources of news . Further information on targeting approaches to the individual sectors of the media can be found on our Contacting Media page . <h> What is their goal ? <p> The primary purpose of the media is communication . Events or information is interpreted and reported to a defined audience with the goal of educating , informing , entertaining and in some cases , protecting that audience . <p> However , it must be noted that in many cases the media is a profit-driven business , which must sell its product - the information or news it reports . The media are driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their audience . <p> Audiences are usually considered to be most interested in things that affect them directly or that could affect them or those around them or potentially cause them harm . <h> Do all media target the same audience ? <p> While some media organisations aim to provide information and entertainment to the general community there are also those that cater for particular population groups . Multicultural media and Indigenous media are two specific examples . <p> Multicultural and multilingual media- Australians from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are served by a range of media . SBS provides multilingual and multicultural radio and television broadcasts . In addition there is a network of over 100 community broadcasters ( resourced and supported by the National Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasters Council ) and many multicultural print media publications available in Australia . <p> Indigenous Media- There is a variety of Indigenous media organisations in Australia , supported by the Australian Indigenous Communications Association . Broadcast media includes a national Indigenous television service , a commercial television network in central Australia as well as an extensive network of commercial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major Indigenous print media publications and several smaller ones . In addition , organisations such as SBS and the ABC have designated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander departments and staff . Each of these broadcasters produces a weekly Indigenous current affairs program . <p> As well as these two large groups there are other media organisations , broadcast and print , who target particular population groups such as youth , or older people . In addition media organisations with a broader general focus may also have sections or programs targeting particular groups . <h> Who decides what gets reported ? <p> Many journalists are able to decide what stories they report . However , they do not always have a say over what stories are included in a publication or in the final cut of a program . This decision is made by the editor ( in print media ) , news director ( in television or radio news ) or the program director or producer ( in radio and television programs ) . The decision may depend on a number of factors such as a change in priorities or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations or regulations on reporting ? <p> Each sector of the media is served by a peak body and has a code of practice or code of ethics . While membership of these peak bodies is voluntary there is also broader regulation for broadcast media . The peak body for print media is the Australian Press Council . Broadcast media are covered by the Broadcasting Services Act , which is administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) . Individual broadcasters are also required to have codes of practice , which outline applicable standards to the public . These codes of practice are registered with the ACMA . There are also Acts that cover specific sectors such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act that covers the ABC , and the Special Broadcasting Services Act that covers SBS . Journalists from all sectors of the media also have a voluntary code of ethics under the Media , Entertainment and Arts Alliance . <p> Information about regulatory bodies , codes of practice and codes of ethics can be found from the following websites : <p> Talkback - These involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with a program presenter and possibly an invited expert . <p> Specialist programs - Many stations will also have specialist programs that may focus on health issues . <p> Radio in Australia is provided through an extensive network , which includes public broadcasters , commercial and community stations as described briefly below . <h> Public Broadcasters <p> Australia has two public radio broadcasters - the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) and the Special Broadcasting Service ( SBS ) . <p> ABC radio is made up of 60 metropolitan and regional stations and four national networks ( ABC Classic FM , Radio National , ABC News Radio , and Triple J - the youth network ) and an Internet service . It is government funded and is governed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act ( 1983 ) . <p> SBS is Australias multicultural and multilingual broadcaster . It broadcasts in 68 languages across a network which is available in all capital cities and key regional centres . SBS is funded by a mixture of government funding and commercial revenue . The role of SBS is defined by its Charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1991 ) . <h> Commercial Stations <p> There are approximately 260 commercial radio stations in Australia , represented by Commercial Radio Australia ( CRA ) . The majority of commercial radio stations can be found in regional areas and broadcast on both AM and FM frequencies . Commercial stations are usually funded by advertising revenue and are operated for profit or as part of a profit making enterprise . There are 32 operators that own commercial radio stations in Australia . Of these , 12 networks own 80% of stations . <h> Community Stations <p> There are over 350 community radio stations in Australia , 60% of which are in non-metropolitan areas . A community , as represented by a community radio station , may be defined in terms of interest , geographical or cultural boundaries . Most community radio stations rely to a large extent on volunteers for their day to day running . They may receive financial support from sponsors but this must not in any way influence the programming .

These may also explore current community issues . <p> Television in Australia is provided through public broadcasters , commercial free-to-air stations , subscription television and a small number of community stations as described briefly below . <h> Public Broadcasters <p> Australia has two public television broadcasters - the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) and the Special Broadcasting Service ( SBS ) . The ABC provides a national TV service with local and national programming and two digital channels . SBS television provides a national television service as well as two digital channels .

Commercial free-to-air television is run for profit or as part of a profit making enterprise and is funded through advertising revenue . The peak media body for commercial free-to-air television is Free TV Australia . <h> Subscription Television <p> The major distinctive feature of subscription television is the direct contract between the television provider and the subscriber . Subscription television has a smaller target audience than free-to-air television and offers more specialised programming . The peak body for subscription television is ASTRA ( Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association ) . <h> Community Television <p> Australia has a small number of free-to-air community television stations most of which are located in capital cities . The peak body for community television is Free TV Australia . <p> Print is a large and diverse sector of the media and news/information is presented in many different forms .

@@30350547 @4050547/ <h> Student wellbeing <h> Looking after your own mental health <p> As a journalism or communications student , or when you begin working in the field , you may find yourself in circumstances which are distressing or in which you need additional support . For example , journalists may be required to report on traumatic events , such as natural disasters , accidents , warfare , or violent crime . Journalists are often working to tight deadlines and may be under considerable pressure in the newsroom . Most students and people entering a new career experience some stress . Students in any discipline may have motivation problems , concentration lapses , or personal difficulties which make it difficult to manage their study . As student journalists , we also need to talk about the ethical reporting of difficult or emotive issues , such as suicide , abuse or violence . This can be distressing for some people . <h> Discussion and disclosure <p> It is important to recognise that a number of students on campus will have had some experience of difficult life events or mental illness - either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People around you may have had personal experiences with abuse , violence or mental illness . Some students may know someone who has attempted to take their own life or has taken their own life . In discussing any issues like this , we need to be sensitive to the needs of others and to the issues they may not have disclosed . While its important to explore these topics , keep some guidelines in mind . <p> Always show respect for the views of others - you can disagree constructively and calmly and explain your perspective , but do n't ridicule anyone for their beliefs ; <p> In general a lecture or tutorial is not the best place to disclose in-depth personal information or distressing experiences - even if you feel fine about it , others may not . Talk about the issue more broadly in class , then talk to trusted friends or in private with a professional if you feel the need ; <p> If you know you might be distressed by a particular lecture or tutorial - perhaps because you 've had difficult personal experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel unable to attend , explain this to your lecturer or tutor . It may still be important for you to learn about the issue in some other way as part of your professional development - particularly if you want to be able to help others in the future ; <p> If a discussion brings up difficult issues for you , talk to your lecturer or tutor afterward , or to a professional . <p> Most university campuses have a confidential counselling service that can be readily accessed by students . <h> Dealing with stress <p> Everyone experiences stress from time to time and the experiences that trigger it are different for each person . An event that someone else finds stressful might not trouble you at all ; on the other hand , you might find certain things difficult when others do not . Do n't judge or blame yourself ( or other people ) for feeling stressed . We all have different personalities and experiences that contribute to who we are . Both positive and negative events can seem stressful , because they force us to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stress can motivate us and have a positive effect . However , severe or ongoing stress is distressing and it can ' paralyse ' us with fear and prevent us from working constructively on what we are trying to achieve . It is important to develop positive strategies for dealing with stress . Suggestions include : <p> Monitor your stress - recognise your own signs of stress and identify situations you find difficult , so you can be more pro-active about managing stress at these times ; <p> Set goals and priorities - be realistic , focus on what you want to achieve rather than comparison with others , accept that there are some circumstances outside your control ; <p> Manage your time - avoid procrastination , plan ahead , make a schedule and follow it , evaluate how you are spending your time ; <p> Have fun - schedule some ' time out ' for yourself , pursue your hobbies or interests , spend time with friends ; focussing too intensely on something can lead to ' burnout ; <p> Look after your body - exercise ( e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat healthy food , get regular sleep , and avoid frequent or heavy use of drugs or alcohol ; <p> Relax - learn and use breathing techniques , progressive relaxation , visualisations or meditation to consciously relax your mind and body - these become easier with practice ; <p> Ask for help - if these approaches do n't work and you feel ' paralysed ' or unable to manage your stress , seek advice from a lecturer , counsellor or health professional . <h> Depression and anxiety <p> More pronounced feelings of depression or anxiety can occur when people have experienced severe or prolonged stress , or can arise without any obvious stress . These feelings can be temporary and may resolve over time by themselves , or they can develop into clinical depression and/or anxiety , which is more severe and long-lasting . <p> Try to be aware of your own wellbeing and supportive of others . People should seek help from a counsellor or a health professional if they have a few of the following symptoms most of the time , for two weeks or more : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky or violent behaviour . <p> If you or someone you know is in need of personal support , your university campus should have an on-site counselling service , or be able to refer you to a counsellor in your local area .

@@30350550 @4050550/ <h> Suicide in the media <p> More than 100 international studies have been conducted looking at the link between media reporting of suicide and suicidal behaviour . A critical review , Suicide in the News and Information Media , was conducted in 2010 to inform the development of resources for media and other sectors engaged by the Mindframe National Media Initiative . The study was an update of an earlier critical review which examined how the media represents suicide and the impact of that representation on attitudes and behaviour in the community1 . <p> There is strong support for the relationship between media reporting of suicide deaths and increases in completed and attempted suicide rates . These increases can not be explained by suicides that may have occurred anyway , as they are not followed by commensurate decreases in rates2 . <p> For example , a major 1995 study of coverage in Australian newspapers found that rates of male suicide increased following reports of suicide , with actual male suicides peaking on the third day after the story first appeared3 . <p> The way in which suicide is reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting that can contribute to a reduction in rates is generally lacking , there are some isolated studies that suggest reporting that frames suicide as a tragic waste and an avoidable loss , and focuses on the devastating impact of the act on others , has been linked to reduced rates of suicide . <p> For example , a 1997 Australian study of reporting of Kurt Cobains suicide in a range of media found that rates of suicide among 15-24 year olds fell during the month following the reporting of Cobains death . Significantly , media coverage of Cobains death was highly critical of his decision to suicide4 . <h> Aspects of reporting contributing to risk <p> The review of international research indicated that imitation or copycat suicide is more prevalent under certain circumstances . <p> Risk is related to the prominence of the coverage , with repeated coverage and prominent news items strongly associated with subsequent suicidal behaviour5 , 6 . <p> It is accentuated when the reader or viewer identified with the person as either someone that is similar to themselves7 or someone they admire such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subgroups in the population ( e.g. young people ; people experiencing a mental illness ) may be particularly vulnerable12 , 13 . <p> Explicit descriptions of the method or location have been linked to increased rates of suicide by that specific method or at that specific location14 , 15 , 16 , 17 . <h> Newspapers <p> Higher rates of suicide have been reported during periods when suicide stories are run in newspapers . As noted above , in Australia , male suicide rates have been found to increase following the reporting of suicide18 . <p> Higher rates of suicide have sometimes been recorded after celebrity suicides receive front page coverage . A US study ( 1984 ) and Austrian studies ( 2001 , 2004 ) found suicide rates and attempts of suicide increased significantly in the month celebrity suicides were published19 . <p> Higher rates of suicide by a particular method such as burning or poisoning have been found to follow the appearance of newspaper stories on a suicide by these methods20 . <p> The number of subway suicides and suicide attempts in Vienna dropped after the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these locations21 . <h> Television <p> Some studies have found that rates of suicide increase following television news reporting of suicide . For example , a 1982 American study found that the national suicide rate increased for a period of 10 days following a news story on suicide22 . <p> Increases in the number of teenage suicides have also been recorded following news stories on suicide in international studies 23 . Coverage of suicide of elderly people has also been linked to higher levels of suicide by older people 24 . <p> Studies have also found a relationship between the method of suicide portrayed in a fictional film or television program , and increased rates of suicide using this method 25 . <h> Mixed media <p> Several Australian studies have looked at the relationship between reporting of suicide across media and suicide rates .

The findings also suggested the portrayal of suicide was becoming more romanticised , glorified and condoned , with young people being disproportionately represented in films with a suicide theme .

Are you the most appropriate organisation or person to be commenting on the issue under question ? Do you have the time or people available to work with the media ? <p> Familiarise yourself with relevant organisational media policies . These should provide guidance about who within the organisation is authorised to speak with the media and on which particular issues . <p> Avoid engaging in repetitive , prominent or excessive reporting of suicide as this may have the effect of normalising suicide and has been linked with increased rates of actual suicide . However , this does not mean that all suicide reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to have benefits for the community . That is , does it provide an opportunity to increase community understanding , highlight groups at risk or promote help-seeking behaviour in some way ? If this is the case , consider in what ways you may be able to have input . <p> While you always have the option of saying no you may want to consider the impact of not participating in a story . That is , the story may still be run without expert comment and advice . Would this outcome be worse than if you did participate ? Sometimes , even negative stories can provide an opportunity for education and suicide prevention messages , or at the very least encouraging the inclusion of helpline numbers . <h> Should you take part in the story ? <p> When deciding whether to participate in a story you may want to consider what type of media is making the approach and whether you are best placed to provide them with information . Do they have a national , state or local audience ? Do they require general information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to a specific incident ? <p> It would be beneficial as an organisation , or individual , to prepare a list of topics and areas that you are able to provide information about or to comment on . For some organisations specialising in suicide prevention , the list may be extensive while for other organisations with a specific focus , the list may be quite limited . <h> Provide expert comment/advice <p> If your organisation is able to provide advice or comment to the media it may be useful to compile a list of qualified people within the organisation who can speak to the media about suicide . One individual may not be an expert on all aspects of the issue . <p> If you are providing an expert who will make comment , make sure they are familiar with the Mindframe principles outlined in this website . <p> If the information requested is on issues that lie outside your area of experience or expertise , refer media professionals to a suitable local or national expert in the field . Alternatively , you can refer them to the Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of this site . <p> You may want to designate at least one person who can discuss ways of reporting suicide with media professionals who approach your organisation and ensure they are aware of the Mindframe resources for media professionals . This may most naturally be a public affairs unit or an identified media liaison representative . For smaller organisations , a designated person who is informed about the issues may be appointed . <h> Encourage media to add crisis support contacts to any story about suicide <p> Vulnerable people may be distressed by reports of suicide and , in some cases , may be prompted to harm themselves . It is important that 24-hour crisis support service contacts ( telephone and/or online ) are included with all reports about suicide ( CLICK here for the media guide to adding help-seeking information ) .

Avoid discussing these details and discourage media professionals from including them in reports wherever possible . At the very least , the method and/or location of suicide should be mentioned only in general terms . <p> You may want to provide alternative suggestions for ways to report the act that do not provide specific details .

In many cases mentioning the persons name or showing them visually in the media can cause distress to the family and community . <p> For suicide deaths involving an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person , avoid releasing their name or details to the media . Explain the reason for withholding this information and request that media professionals respect appropriate cultural protocols . <h> Use appropriate language <p> The language used in media reports can contribute to suicide being presented as glamorous , normal or as an option for dealing with problems . <p> Media professionals are given recommendations about appropriate language . It is important that the language you use when talking to the media is consistent with these suggestions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should also be checked for appropriate language . <p> When talking about suicide : <p> ' non fatal ' or ' attempt on his/her life ' <p> ' unsuccessful suicide ' <p> ' took their own life ' or ' died by suicide ' <p> ' successful suicide ' or ' committed suicide ' <p> statements such as ' increasing rates ' or ' cluster of deaths ' <p> ' suicide epidemic ' which is sensationalist and inaccurate <h> Support the media to place a story in context <p> Placing stories about suicide in the context of risk factors and other mental health issues can assist in breaking down myths about suicide and promote a better understanding of it as a wider issue and a challenge for the community . <p> Some factors to be considered include : <p> Provide information about suicide and its relationship to mental illness and other risk factors .

Those born in the United Kingdom are the largest group of overseas-born residents ( 5.3% ) , followed by New Zealand ( 2.5% ) , China ( 1.8% ) , India ( 1.5% ) , Vietnam and Italy ( 0.9% each ) . <h> Refugee and asylum seekers <p> Since the beginning of its humanitarian resettlement in 1947 , Australia has welcomed more than 750,000 people from different countries in response to changing global resettlement and humanitarian needs2 . <p> From 2009-2010 , a total of 13,770 visas were granted under the Humanitarian Program . This comprised 9,236 visas granted to persons overseas and 4,534 visas granted to people in Australia3 . <p> Australia 's Humanitarian Program has two components : <p> Offshore resettlement for people in humanitarian need overseas ; and <p> Onshore protection for those people already in Australia who engage Australias protection requirements under the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention4 . <p> On 18 August , 2012 the Migration Act 1958 was amended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMAs ) to Australia . In particular , the Migration Act now provides for transfer of people entering Australia via offshore methods to a regional processing country5 . <h> The mental health of migrants <p> Over a quarter of a million first generation adult Australians from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are estimated to experience some form of mental disorder in a 12-month period6 . <p> The prevalence of mental disorders for people born in Australia was higher ( 19.5% for males and 24.0% for females ) than people born overseas ( 17.7% for males and 19.9% for females ) . For people born in non-English speaking countries the prevalence of mental disorders was 8.4% for males and 16.2% for females7 . <p> The nature of this relationship ( particularly when compared to the general Australian population ) is difficult to determine but may be explained in part by the healthy migrant effect . This relates to the fact that people who successfully migrate to Australia are required to complete rigorous health checks and testing which means they are more likely to be physically healthier than the remainder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Prevalence of affective and anxiety disorders do not vary significantly by country of birth . However there is a modest trend for people from non-English speaking countries to have a lower prevalence of affective and anxiety disorders compared to those born in Australia or another English-speaking country9 . <p> People born in non-English speaking countries have lower levels of substance use disorders ( 1.6% ) than people who were born in Australia and other English-speaking countries ( 6.0% and 4.4% respectively ) 10 . <p> Research suggests that whilst many migrants arrive in Australia with good mental health , their mental health tends to deteriorate after the first 12 months spent in Australia . This is often linked to the stressful process of acculturation , language and social difficulties and difficulties in finding employment11 . <p> The conceptualisation of mental illness differs from culture to culture . In less industrialised cultures mental illness may be interpreted as being caused by external forces . For example12 : <p> In south-western Greece , residents are more likely to attribute causes of psychotic illnesses to a metaphysical belief of a magico-religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans are more likely to conceptualise psychiatric symptoms physically ( somatisation ) . The somatisation of psychological problems in some communities may result in the misdiagnosis of the illness and subsequent inappropriate treatment . <p> The impact of language around mental illness may be different in other cultures . For example , in Islamic culture , being labelled as ' insane ' can carry positive connotations . The individual might be seen to be innovative , original and creative , or attempting to find alternatives to static and stagnant modes of living13 . <p> Older migrants are at an increased risk of depressive disorders and suicide . Factors contributing to this risk include : loss , physical illness or disability , or the onset of disorders such as dementia , which often results in a loss of competency in English . Nostalgia and loss of hope of returning to the homeland and increased inter-generational conflict are particular stressors in the later years of life for migrants in Australia14 . <p> People from diverse backgrounds settling in rural and remote areas may face increased isolation due to language and communication barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social networks , alienation and discrimination15 <h> Refugees and mental health16 <p> Refugees and asylum seekers are at high risk of mental health problems as a direct result of the refugee experience and their displacement . In addition , they come from a range of countries and cultures and have a wide range of experiences that may affect their mental health . <p> There is substantial evidence that trauma and loss may have profound and ongoing effects on people who migrate to Australia as refugees . <p> The mental health problems that refugees and asylum seekers may experience are anxiety disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder , depression and chronic grief . <p> Refugees who have a mental illness face many obstacles in accessing treatment for psychological trauma and mental illness in both the pre- and post-migration period . <p> Stressors that may accompany the post-migration period for refugees include : uprooting , which may include loss of family , friends and possessions ; poverty ; and experiencing marginalisation and racism in the host country . <p> Experiences that exert a negative effect on children during war are : the violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members , separation from family , migration , terrorist attacks , child soldier activity , bombardments and shelling , physical injuries and famine . <h> The effect of detention on mental health <p> Asylum seekers who are placed in detention whilst their refugee status is determined experience a specific set of stressors , reflecting both the detention environment and the detention process itself . Some of these stressors include ; loss of liberty , uncertainty regarding return to country of origin and social isolation17 . <p> Research examining the relationship between detention and mental health suggests that time in immigration detention significantly impacts on the mental health of refugees ; even when other risk factors ( e.g. previous history of trauma , age and gender ) are taken into account18 . <p> An inquiry undertaken by the Australian Human Rights Commission found that19 : <p> Mental distress in varying degrees is common in detained asylum seekers with ' a large number of detainees experiencing mental health problems ' . <p> Factors regarded as increasing the risk of mental distress included : prior experiences of torture or other forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the length and conditions of detention ; and the feelings of anxiety and desperation in those whose refugee claims are rejected . <p> There is ' considerable tension created by the regime of control necessary to implement the policy of mandatory detention ' and the indeterminate nature of the detention made it considerably more difficult to endure . <p> Prolonged detention has harmful effects on the mental health of adults and development of children and adolescents . <p> Institutionalisation of children has a negative impact on their mental health . Children in immigration detention centres may suffer from anxiety , distress , bed-wetting , suicidal ideation and self-destructive behaviour including attempted and actual self-harm20 . <p> The longer children are in detention the more likely it is for them to suffer serious mental harm21 . <h> Women and children refugees <p> Women and children make up 80% of the world 's refugees and displaced persons22 . <p> For many women refugees , the violent situations that cause them to flee their home countries is the beginning of a path which may itself present many dangers such as physical abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widowed or become separated from their husbands during flight and become the sole adult responsible for their dependent children .

The following principles provide some guidance for media based on the best available evidence to encourage that portrayals of self-harm are appropriate , responsible and safe . <h> When reporting about self-harm : <p> Avoid perpetuating myths about self-harmPerpetuating myths about self-harm in the media can lead to people being viewed in a negative manner by family , friends and even professionals . This can prevent a person from accessing the support or information that they need . The emotional pain that people who engage in self-harm experience is real and overwhelming ; hence , people who engage in self-harm DO NOT do it to : <p> Manipulate others/ situations ; <p> Attract attention ; <p> Feign suicide ; and <p> Because they belong to a subculture ( e.g. Emo or Goth ) . <p> Why should I run the story ? Consider the prominence and context of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-harm . In some studies , participants have commented that even the mention or reference to self-harm in various forms of media is enough to prompt them to engage in self-harming behaviour when feeling vulnerable . <p> Positioning the storyTo avoid sensationalising self-harm , avoid placing the words " self-harm " in the headline or lead . Position the story on the inside pages or further down in the order of reports in TV and radio news . <p> LanguageThe language used in a media report may glamorise or sensationalise self-harming behaviour . For example referring to self-harm as a ' fad ' or talking about the occurrence of self-harm as a ' self-harm epidemic ' or self-mutilation epidemic can be unhelpful and is inaccurate . Using labels to describe people who engage in self-harm , for example , cutters or self-harmers can lead to increased stigma around these behaviours . <p> Do n't  be explicit about the method of self-harmDont be explicit about the method of self-harm .

Are your sources reliable ? Information you have received from a witness , neighbour or first responder to an incident may be inaccurate . Speculation about someone 's mental health status contributes to stigma and discrimination . <p> Media guidelines and codes of ethics emphasise the right to privacy . Consider whether there may be consequences for the person 's health and wellbeing if you disclose their mental illness . <h> Check that the representation of mental illness is fair and balanced <p> Ensure that your story does not exaggerate a person 's illness or the effect mental illness has on their behaviour or life . <p> Mentioning the person 's mental illness in the headline or lead can sensationalise the illness and reinforce stigma .

However , audiences are likely to make generalisations about people with a mental illness as a result of the coverage <p> Check the relevance of mental illness to the story . Report a person 's mental illness only where this has been confirmed by official sources and when relevant to the story <p> Take care not to imply that mental illness was a factor in a story unless confirmed .

When interviewing someone with a mental illness , use the tips below . Interviewing a person with lived experience of mental illness requires sensitivity and discretion . While many people are happy to speak to the media , it can be difficult to talk publicly about a deeply personal issue . <p> Where possible , source someone who is supported to speak to the media .

Is there potential to include information that will assist in dispelling myths and stereotypes , provide accurate information about illnesses and their treatment , or provide details of services available for those experiencing mental illness ? <p> While you always have the option of saying no you may also want to consider the impact of not participating in a story . That is , the story may still be run without expert comment and advice . Would this outcome be worse than if you did participate ? Sometimes , even negative stories can provide an opportunity for education , or at the very least the inclusion of helpline numbers or other support information . <p> What type of media is making the approach and are you best placed to provide them with information ? Do they have a national , state or local audience ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community group , or information related to a specific incident ? <h> Provide expert comment/advice <p> If your organisation is in a position to provide advice or comment to the media it may be useful to compile a list of qualified people within the organisation and the aspects of mental health , mental illness and/or mental health care they can speak to the media about . One individual may not be an expert on all aspects of the issue . <p> If you are providing an expert for comment , make sure they are familiar with the Mindframe principles outlined on this website . Always look for opportunities to provide appropriate information on mental illness and mental health care that debunks some commonly held myths . The information may not be included in the story , but it may influence the way the story is written . <p> If the information requested is on issues that lie outside your area of experience or expertise , refer media professionals to a suitable local or national expert in the field . Alternatively you can refer them to the Story sources and contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website . <p> You may want to designate at least one person who can discuss ways of reporting mental illness with media professionals who approach your organisation and ensure they are aware of the Mindframe for media professionals resources . This may most naturally be a public affairs unit or an identified media liaison representative . For smaller organisations , a designated person who is informed about the issues may be appointed . <h> Provide appropriate helpline contacts ( telephone and online ) <p> Vulnerable individuals may be distressed by stories about mental illness . Alternatively , the story may prompt someone experiencing mental illness to seek help . Therefore , it is important that contact information for relevant organisations is included with all reports about mental illness . <p> Where possible provide media professionals with helpline contacts ( telephone and online ) and treatment and support options for those who may be affected by the report . Suggest that this information be included somewhere in the report , or at the end of the report . <p> Some contact details for national helplines and other services are contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist to the Mindframe for media professionals section of this website . <p> It is important to provide support information relevant to the audience of each story . For most reports it will be appropriate to cite a national helpline/online contact such as the one provided by SANE Australia on 1800 18 SANE(7263) as well as the local mental health service ( if the story is local in focus ) . However , you may also want to consider contact details for particular population groups . <p> Preparing a list of contacts ( both local and national ) , that your organisation could use in stories will assist you when deciding which details to give to media professionals . This may be particularly useful when information is required within a short deadline . <p> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians may prefer to see a doctor or health worker at their local Aboriginal Medical Service . Contact details for all states can be found on the VIBE website at www.vibe.com.au . <p> For Australians from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds it would be useful to include contact details for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health service , as well as the national Telephone Interpreter Service ( 13 14 50 ) . Information on services is available from Mental Health in Multicultural Australia on 1300 136 289 or at www.mhima.org.au . <p> For young Australians it would be more useful to provide the Kids Help Line on 1800 55 1800 , contacts details for local Child and Youth Services or websites such as www.headspace.org.au and www.reachout.com.au . <h> Use appropriate language <p> The language used when reporting on mental illness plays a big role in keeping alive stereotypes , myths and stigma . Unfortunately , people involved in mental health are not always aware of the language that they use especially in stressful situations like conducting a media interview . Journalists will pick up on the language used by mental health spokespeople and are unlikely to edit direct quotes even when they recognise that the language may not be helpful . <p> It is important that the language used is consistent with that suggested for media professionals . Remember that your comments potentially reach many members of the community . Avoid labelling or stigmatising language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals . <p> Avoid referring to someone as a victim , suffering from or afflicted with mental illness or any language that suggests mental illness is a life sentence e.g. a person is not a schizophrenic , they are currently experiencing , being treated for or have a diagnosis of schizophrenia . <p> Be careful not to imply that all mental illnesses are the same and ensure that correct terminology is used when a diagnosis is referred to . <p> Be aware of the language you use when referring to someone leaving hospital e.g. a person is discharged from hospital not released and they leave or abscond , they do n't  escape . <p> Ensure that medical terminology is not used out of context , e.g. schizophrenic policy . <p> Special attention to language must also be taken when providing information about mental illness , mental health and suicide for use in multi-lingual media . In many cultures mental illness is a foreign and ambiguous concept . If understood at all , it can be heavily stigmatised and the idea of recovery is almost unknown . Often the terms used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other languages , as these languages may have no equivalent term and the literal translations are misleading or meaningless . Use plain English and remove colloquial terms and jargon . You may choose to check with an interpreter whether any of the concepts you plan to refer to need further explanation . <p> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are generally not comfortable with mental health and mental illness and prefer instead that health is presented in the context of social and emotional wellbeing . For more information see The National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal Social and Emotional Wellbeing and Mental Health which can be found in the consumer section of the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing website at www.health.gov.au . <h> Avoid negative stereotypes <p> While language is important , it is not the only factor that contributes to stereotypes .

Below are some examples of how you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If a story is about a particular individual ( or individuals ) living with mental illness , encourage inclusion of information that presents a balanced view of the person as more than just their illness . This might include information that shows them participating in work , relationships , sport or other aspects of community life . <p> Be aware that the media may sometimes link mental illness with violence . If they are seeking background to a story involving a violent act by a person with a specific diagnosis , firstly question the relevance of the persons mental illness to the story . Secondly , you may want to take the opportunity to provide the person with accurate facts about the association between mental illness and violence ( see Mental Illness Facts and Statistics ) . <p> In any stories about mental health or mental illness , encourage media professionals to include information that demonstrates that mental illness is not a life sentence and that while some people may be quite disabled by their illness , many more can recover fully and participate in all aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have or have had a mental illness are happy to speak to the media , talking publicly can be a difficult and distressing experience .

@@30350583 @4050583/ <h> Self-harm in Australia <h> Definitions <p> The issue of self-harm is complex both from a definitional perspective and in relation to the scarcity of data regarding frequency and patterns of self-harm in Australia1 . There is no universal definition of self-harm and additionally , there are diverse views concerning the reasons or risk factors for self-harming behaviours . <p> In general , self-harm ( sometimes referred to as self-injury ) is understood to involve a person deliberately causing him or herself physical pain as a means of managing difficult or painful emotions , or as a way of communicating their distress to others2 , 3 . <p> There are many forms of self-harming behaviours . Reckless driving and other high-risk behaviours can , in some cases , be indicators of self-harm . The act of self-harming is not directly or necessarily an attempt by a person to end their life4 ( although acts of self-harm can result in disability or death in severe cases of physical injury5 , 6 ) . <h> Risk Factors <p> Individual motives for self-harming behaviour are diverse . For instance , they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low self-esteem , anger , isolation , grief or traumatic life experiences including childhood emotional , physical or sexual abuse7 . <p> Self-harming behaviours typically commence in adolescence8 , although this may not be the case for all individuals . <p> Self-harming behaviours may be linked with mental illness , in particular depression , anxiety , personality disorders , phobias , conduct disorders and substance abuse9 , 10 , 11 . It has been suggested that self-harm is a phenomenon in and of itself12 as self-harming behaviours can reflect the level of a persons distress independent of mental illness13 . <p> Other research14 , 15 , 16 , 17 suggests that individual , social and environmental influences may contribute to a persons risk of self-harm . Influences can include : poor problem-solving skills , impulsivity , emotionally and physically abusive environments , war and poverty . However , some people who self-harm may have no experience with any of these factors . <p> The relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex . Often the motivation for self-harming behaviour is to cope with , or to gain a sense of relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to result in death18 . <p> Any action that is deliberately intended to cause death is best regarded as a suicide attempt19 . Any deliberate attempt on ones life that results in death is best understood as suicide . <p> Self-harm and suicide are distinct and separate acts . Some have suggested that self-harm should be established as an independent clinical syndrome20 , 21 . <p> A study22 found that more than 50% of 118 individuals evaluated for self-harming behaviours reported not having suicidal thoughts at the time of engaging in self-harming behaviour ; in fact , self-harm was described as a way to avoid suicide23 , 24 . In one study25 a participant reported that her self-harming behaviours helped her to feel more in control whereas her suicidal behaviour occurred when she felt out of control . <p> Acts of self-harm need to be taken seriously . Individuals who self-harm may be considered at higher risk of further , more severe forms of self-harm and a potential to suicide26 .

Data from 2008-0928 based on instances of hospitalised self-harm reflect cases in which individuals were admitted to hospital for treatment during a financial year period ; it does not capture those who have been attended to in emergency departments or by general practitioners .

Second , while it is very difficult to measure the severity of self-harm cases , it can be inferred that the majority of severe cases would be admitted to hospital ( other than those who die prior to hospitalisation ) 30 . <h> Further note on interpreting statistics <p> The number of hospitalised self-harm cases recorded in any one year is affected by a range of factors including admission and treatment practices across Australias health system and the categories used to classify reasons for hospitalisation .

The age-standardised rate for hospitalised self-harm in Victoria ( 109.7 per 100,000 ) and New South Wales ( 109.2 per 100,000 ) were most similar to the national age-standardised rate ( 118.5 per 100,000 ) .

@@30350603 @4050603/ <h> Suicide in the media <p> More than 100 international studies have been conducted looking at the link between media reporting of suicide and suicidal behaviour . A critical review , Suicide in the News and Information Media , was conducted in 2010 to inform the development of resources for media and other sectors engaged by the Mindframe National Media Initiative . The study was an update of an earlier critical review which examined how the media represents suicide and the impact of that representation on attitudes and behaviour in the community1 . <p> There is strong support for the relationship between media reporting of suicide deaths and increases in completed and attempted suicide rates . These increases can not be explained by suicides that may have occurred anyway , as they are not followed by commensurate decreases in rates2 . <p> For example , a major 1995 study of coverage in Australian newspapers found that rates of male suicide increased following reports of suicide , with actual male suicides peaking on the third day after the story first appeared3 . <p> The way in which suicide is reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting that can contribute to a reduction in rates is generally lacking , there are some isolated studies that suggest reporting that frames suicide as a tragic waste and an avoidable loss , and focuses on the devastating impact of the act on others , has been linked to reduced rates of suicide . <p> For example , a 1997 Australian study of reporting of Kurt Cobains suicide in a range of media found that rates of suicide among 15-24 year olds fell during the month following the reporting of Cobains death . Significantly , media coverage of Cobains death was highly critical of his decision to suicide4 . <h> Aspects of reporting contributing to risk <p> The review of international research indicated that imitation or copycat suicide is more prevalent under certain circumstances . <p> Risk is related to the prominence of the coverage , with repeated coverage and prominent news items strongly associated with subsequent suicidal behaviour5 , 6 . <p> It is accentuated when the reader or viewer identified with the person as either someone that is similar to themselves7 or someone they admire such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subgroups in the population ( e.g. young people ; people experiencing a mental illness ) may be particularly vulnerable12 , 13 . <p> Explicit descriptions of the method or location have been linked to increased rates of suicide by that specific method or at that specific location14 , 15 , 16 , 17 . <h> Newspapers <p> Higher rates of suicide have been reported during periods when suicide stories are run in newspapers . As noted above , in Australia , male suicide rates have been found to increase following the reporting of suicide18 . <p> Higher rates of suicide have sometimes been recorded after celebrity suicides receive front page coverage . A US study ( 1984 ) and Austrian studies ( 2001 , 2004 ) found suicide rates and attempts of suicide increased significantly in the month celebrity suicides were published19 . <p> Higher rates of suicide by a particular method such as burning or poisoning have been found to follow the appearance of newspaper stories on a suicide by these methods20 . <p> The number of subway suicides and suicide attempts in Vienna dropped after the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these locations21 . <h> Television <p> Some studies have found that rates of suicide increase following television news reporting of suicide . For example , a 1982 American study found that the national suicide rate increased for a period of 10 days following a news story on suicide22 . <p> Increases in the number of teenage suicides have also been recorded following news stories on suicide in international studies 23 . Coverage of suicide of elderly people has also been linked to higher levels of suicide by older people 24 . <p> Studies have also found a relationship between the method of suicide portrayed in a fictional film or television program , and increased rates of suicide using this method 25 . <h> Mixed media <p> Several Australian studies have looked at the relationship between reporting of suicide across media and suicide rates . A Queensland study found a peak in suicide rates following extensive negative publicity about suicide in the psychiatric wards of a local general hospital26 . <p> Conversely , suicide rates among young Australians aged 15-24 were significantly lower in the month following Kurt Cobains death when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some instances , reporting of suicides in certain locations has led to safeguards being introduced in these places to prevent suicide . <h> Fictional portrayals <p> A literature review conducted in 2010 indicated that the portrayal of suicide in film and television drama was widespread , and depictions of the act becoming lengthier , more extensively modelled , and more likely to involve firearms had increased over time28 . The findings also suggested the portrayal of suicide was becoming more romanticised , glorified and condoned , with young people being disproportionately represented in films with a suicide theme . This report is available to download here . <h> Australian reporting <p> Rather than restricting media coverage of suicide , Australian Research29 , Media Monitoring Project 2000/2001 2006/2007 , has indicated that there has been a two-fold increase in the reporting of suicide since the dissemination of the Mindframe resources . Importantly , the study also indicates that media have integrated the guidelines into their reports , with an overall improvement in quality from 57% in 2001 to 75% in 2007 , with an improvement across seven of the nine principles outlined within .

@@30350620 @4050620/ <h> Journalism and trauma <p> The nature of news is such that journalists are often required to report on events that may be distressing , such as suicide , terrorism , violence , war or natural disasters . Journalists may be visiting sites where there is graphic evidence of death and violence , they may see and be affected by other people 's distress , or may be required to interview those who have been bereaved or are in shock . <p> It is increasingly recognised , within Australia and internationally , that such experiences can have a profound effect on journalists . These effects can range from temporary discomfort to more long-lasting distress about dealing with these situations . This can happen even to an experienced journalist who has covered such stories for many years and has not found them overly upsetting before . As a journalist or a student of journalism , it is important to be aware of the potentially distressing nature of the work and to be prepared to seek personal and professional support if you find this troubling . <p> In addition , journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivors of traumatic events , or those who have been recently bereaved in a violent way , such as through suicide , crime or disaster . Keep in mind that these people may be grieving , disoriented , shocked or frightened . They may also not be thinking clearly or could be experiencing a range of emotions that might affect their motivation for speaking to the press . They may even regret speaking to the media later when they have recovered somewhat from their experience . <p> The following sections summarise some of the issues for journalists to be aware of in relation to reporting on traumatic incidents . Useful links are also provided . <h> The effects of trauma on journalists <p> Reporting on distressing events and working with the survivors of trauma can have a personal effect on the journalist . It is important to recognise that journalists ; like other professionals , need to safeguard their own wellbeing in these situations . This may run counter to the culture in some media organisations and among some journalists , but unresolved stress can have a significant impact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include : <p> Temporary stress reactions to traumatic events are not uncommon , but repeated exposure to stress and trauma may increase the risk of more serious and long-lasting difficulties such as depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , panic disorder or substance abuse . It is important to be aware of this possibility and to take steps to safeguard your own wellbeing throughout your career to minimise the impact of trauma . <p> Here are some suggestions about looking after yourself : <p> Maintain a healthy and positive lifestyle , with a good diet and some regular physical exercise . Limit your use of alcohol and other drugs and do n't use them to cope with problems ; <p> Learn to recognise your own signs of stress and monitor stress levels . Develop constructive ways to relieve stress , such as time out , exercise , or meditation ; <p> After reporting on a traumatic event , accept that it is normal to have troubling feelings for a time . Do n't buy into a culture that requires journalists to show no emotion . Some people find it helpful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structured lifestyle , but make time for ways to relieve stress ; <p> If you are very distressed , or your feelings and stress reactions do n't improve over time , make an appointment with a GP , counsellor or psychologist to talk about your experiences and feelings . <h> Ethical practices <p> There are ethical issues you may wish to consider when reporting on traumatic events . Maintaining your ethics and professionalism under pressure will ensure that you are comfortable with your own actions when you reflect on them later and will help you deal with your own feelings about the incident . <p> Before you interview a person who has been a witness to trauma , or a victim of violence , think about whether it is strictly necessary to interview the person immediately . They may be grieving , shocked , disoriented , or frightened . They may feel either guilty or elated that they have survived if others have not . This means that they may not be thinking clearly when they are asked for an interview or may have their own confused reasons for speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your role as a journalist and that they are able to give their consent to talk with you . <p> Some points to consider include : <p> Follow any directions that are given by the authorities , such as police or emergency services , about going onto the site or interviewing those involved . In particular , follow instructions about not revealing information that has not yet been publicly released , such as the identity of those involved ; <p> Identify yourself immediately and clearly as a journalist and explain that you are there to report on the event . Make sure that those who are distressed understand this before speaking with you ; <p> Give clear details of what type of report you are doing print or broadcast , what angle you intend to take . Make sure they understand that their comments or footage may or may not be used in the final edit of the story ; <p> Offer to pause the interview ( and stop filming or recording ) if a person is becoming distressed . Some people may feel more comfortable if they are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have someone with them during the interview ; <p> Avoid revealing the identity of those involved unless you have their consent . Do not reveal the identity of a deceased person unless the authorities have officially released such information ; <p> Try not to take photographs or footage of specific people without their consent . Avoid capturing particularly disturbing images such as severe injuries or dead bodies , and do not show the method of death in cases of suicide ; <p> Review the facts with an interviewee before you finish and read back any quotes you are thinking of using . Make sure , again , that you have their consent to include their comments or images in a report . <p> Mindframe for journalism and public reations education Ethical Practices <h> Bereavement after suicide <p> It is important to be aware that those who lose a friend or relative to suicide often experience significant distress and may be at risk of suicide or mental health problems themselves . Respect people 's privacy and deal with the bereaved with sensitivity . Where possible , it may be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Those who have been bereaved sometimes want to tell their stories to the media in an effort to raise awareness about the issue of suicide and to deal with their own feelings of loss .

Members of the public may also be unaware that certain types of stories about suicide - particularly those that focus on a single case and are explicit about the method of death - may actually increase the risk of suicide in the community . <p> As an ethical and professional journalist , you might consider checking what people would like to achieve by speaking publicly about their experience , then broadly discussing the recommendations for covering suicide in the media . In general , it is preferable to avoid prominent or repeated reports about cases of suicide in the community . You could still include a reference to the events but you should omit detailed descriptions of the method of death .

You may wish to compile a list of media contacts . The first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with . <p> To identify media professionals you may want to work with , you can look at past work by these individuals . Ask yourself the following questions : <p> Are they fair and accurate ? <p> Are they in a position to cover your issues ? <p> Does their style appeal to you or your organisation ? <p> Alternatively , there are media guides and databases that list media organisations and those who work within them . These guides are available by subscription online or are held in public libraries . Organisations with media units are likely to already have identified contacts . <p> Be persistent and do n't  be discouraged if your story does n't  get coverage . There are many factors that influence whether a particular story is included , many of which are not specifically related to the story itself , so keep trying . <p> It may also be useful to find a local champion .

This will vary depending on the media professional you are dealing with , e.g. a specialist health reporter may be more familiar with mental health terminology than a general news reporter ; <p> Plan the means by which you will approach the media for coverage , i.e. telephone , email , face-to-face ; <p> Consider whether you are able to provide pictures or opportunities for video footage or audio . <p> Sometimes it is worth approaching more than one media outlet with your story . At other times it may be beneficial to give exclusive rights to one organisation . <p> The key people to contact and requirements for stories to be covered will vary between different types of media ( print , television and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. news versus programs ) . It is advisable to contact the specific media outlets you plan to work with and ask who the contact people are and the specific requirements they have . <p> Table 1:Characteristics of different sectors of the media ( at the bottom of this web page ) is by no means exhaustive but provides a simple guide as to what some of the differences between types of media might be . <h> Example : Target your approach <p> A mental health service in a regional city wants to publicise the opening of a new youth mental health service . They have identified two specific target audiences for this information . One target group is young people who might potentially access the service . The second group is parents who may want to encourage a young person to access the service .

Emphasise the quality of the service , experience of staff , evidence base of the approach taken ; <p> Language simple , no jargon ; <p> Spokesperson manager or clinician from the service . <h> Plan how you will make contact <p> The way you make contact will depend on the nature of your story and the relationship you have with people in the media . <p> The most common way to pitch a story is to prepare a media release .

If the round system worked ideally , these reporters would all know the laws and restrictions pertaining to the courts .

They bring with them their general knowledge as well as what they have learned at university or in cadetship training . That is not to say that all court reporters are legal novices some have law degrees or extended legal knowledge . Nevertheless , the range of expertise amongst court reporters can be huge , especially in cases where the usual court reporter is absent and a less experienced colleague may cover courts in their stead . <p> This wide range of expertise , coupled with journalists often limited knowledge of complex issues such as mental health and suicide , can result in a severely restricted pool of knowledge to accurately cover coroners ' findings , committal proceedings , bail applications , pleas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Do journalists work together ? <p> Court reporting tends to be somewhat different to other journalistic rounds in that reporters often cooperate with each other , even when they represent different media outlets . The regular contact between journalists at the courtroom means that they will often rely on each other to fill in material they miss , or for tips for a good story . <p> Nevertheless , competition amongst journalists exists in all rounds and courts are no different . Reporters will use a wide range of sources to find out what 's going on in courts , confirm information and investigate stories . <h> What types of media are more interested in the courts ? <p> Print media have a long history of covering courts , sharing the courts media rooms and dedicating one reporter to the round . Radio and television on the other hand tend to send reporters along on a more ad-hoc basis , when a good story is expected in court . Knowing what 's in a days court line-up will usually come from police stories ( earlier arrests ) and police tip-offs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Print journalists often therefore have a great ownership of the round that they nurture and cover systematically , which allows them to develop sources within the courts and often form positive working relationships ( sources are outlined below ) . <h> How is the news story developed ? <p> Changes in technology have led to greater multiple-platform reporting , using online as well as traditional media . This means that one story can have several versions for a range of media which will be built up from earlier stories . It also means that the speed with which stories can be developed and released is greatly increased . <p> In one recent example , a reporter was able to send notification of a verdict in a case by text message from the courtroom , meaning that a story brief was available on a newspapers website within minutes of the verdict , beating radio reports . That story was later expanded when the journalist wrote the details of what had happened in the proceedings , but this is a good example of how quickly news media can reach an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually follow a set path where , once written and filed by the journalist , it is subedited for the print version of the paper ( and/or the online version ) . At this point , the journalist usually has no control over the editing of their story . This can prove problematic in covering court stories because the story in its entirety can often provide context and important background which may , due to space , have to be reduced or removed . <p> To view a flowchart which shows the typical process in developing a courts story , please click here . <h> What about headlines ? <p> Headlines are also written by the subeditor , beyond the control of the court reporter . While they should reflect the storys key point , these can sometimes be skewed toward a catchy phrase or word choice that is more sensational than the body of the story . It is worth remembering that journalists do not control this element of newspaper production , despite being the public face of the story . <h> Who are key sources of information ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation in court reporting . The most common sources are : <p> Since the early 1990s , an additional common source in many jurisdictions has been the Court Information Officer . Those jurisdictions without these officers have been noted to be at a disadvantage when it comes to court-media relations . <p> The issue of access to information and meeting media deadlines is crucial to getting a story right . In most cases , not providing information or making transcript costs prohibitive will not result in a story being abandoned . It is more likely that it will result in a story being run either incompletely or with inaccuracies . Assisting the media to gain access to accurate information is , therefore , key . <h> References <p> 1 Johnston , J. ( 2004 ) .

Each approach from the media for interview should be considered individually and thought given as to whether or not to participate . <p> If a decision is taken to participate in an interview , time should be invested in planning to achieve the best possible outcome . <p> This section contains issues to consider when making a decision whether to participate and planning for interviews . <h> Deciding whether to participate in an interview <p> There are a number of factors to consider when deciding whether or not to participate in a media interview : <p> Never agree to participate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Media Unit or Public Affairs Department . <p> Find out what you can about the interviewer . <p> Try to look at some of their previous work ( preferably on the same or a related topic ) and evaluate it in terms of : their attitude to the subject ; whether their reporting is fair and accurate ; whether they might be receptive to your view ; and whether you like their style . <p> Find out what you can about the interview . Ask the journalist : <p> Why they want to do the interview ? <p> What angle they are planning on taking ? <p> Whether anyone else will be interviewed ? <p> How long the interview will be ? <p> Whether they require pictures ? <p> Will the interview be live or pre-recorded ? <p> While it is unlikely you will be provided with the questions in advance it is quite reasonable to ask what subjects they are planning to cover . <p> Ask yourself : <p> Whether you can give the information that the journalist requires ? <p> What would be the benefits and disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you feel comfortable . <p> If you decide not to participate in the interview consider whether you can refer the journalist to another suitable contact . <p> It is best to participate in an interview if you : <p> Are able to manage your feelings about the issue and are n't  at risk of becoming too angry or upset . <p> Are not too personally involved with the issue being reported . <p> Have time to prepare . <p> Are authorised to participate . <p> Are currently well , and believe that participating will not cause you unmanageable stress . <p> Have good support . <p> Feel confident about talking to the media about the subject matter . <p> Feel your right to privacy will be respected . <p> Trust the motives of the journalist will fit with your reasons for wanting to do the interview . <p> Are comfortable with the effect your participation may have on your family or community . <p> If you are not confident of any of the above issues it may be better to wait and participate at another time . <h> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do not go into an interview without giving yourself time to prepare . For example , if a radio program calls wanting you to participate in an interview ask if you can call back in 10 minutes ( or however long you need to compose yourself and prepare ) . <p> Know your subject and your organisation well . If you are not completely familiar with the information then arrange to be briefed before the interview by someone else in the organisation . Gather together relevant facts and statistics you may wish to refer to during the interview . This is important even if you do not have long to prepare . <p> Define the message you want to get across and tailor it to the target audience . A useful exercise may be to have a colleague or friend repeatedly ask you what your key message is until you can respond with a clear , succinct statement . <p> Identify approximately three main points and keep coming back to these during the interview . You could write these points on a card and refer to it during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interview and whether it is relevant for the target audience . For example , what language should you use for a youth program or a program aimed at Indigenous Australians.
