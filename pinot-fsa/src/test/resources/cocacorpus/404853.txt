@@104679321 @79321/ <p> Once a week I lead a group of nine seminary students who come together to talk and pray about being godly husbands . At our first meeting we established that being a godly husband is not first and foremost about technique and it is not first and foremost about learning the latest relational skills . No , being a godly husband begins with being a godly man , and being a godly man begins with loving God above all else . <p> Our Lord Jesus himself said that the greatest commandment was to " love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind , and with all your strength " ( Mark 12:30 ; see Deuteronomy 6:5 ) . This is the greatest commandment because God has created us first and foremost to be in relationship with himself . This is the foundation of life and foundation for our marriage . If God is not our greatest priority , we have no foundation upon which to build our lives or our marriages . <p> So what does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Loving God above all else is not first and foremost a feeling , it is first and foremost obedience to his Word . Notice how Jesus defines what it means to love him : " Whoever has my commands and obeys them , he is the one who loves me " ( John 14:21a ) . Loving God above all else will mean repenting of any known sin in our lives and surrendering the control of our lives to God . <p> Loving God above all else will also mean that we seek to cultivate our relationship with him . This is done primarily through reading his Word , prayer , and fellowshipping with other believers through church and through spending time together . It is important for us to be committed to these things but also to be realistic about what stage of life we are in be flexible according to your time constraints and set your expectations accordingly . <p> Second Priority : Love Your Wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a sobering command ! Consider the implications carefully : The way that you love your wife should be a reflection of how Jesus loves the church . To put it a bit more practically still : Your wife should know what Jesus love is like simply by the way that you love her . <p> So what was Jesus love for the church like ? Above all else it was self-sacrificing . " Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her " ( Ephesians 5:25 ) . Husbands will love their wives the way that Jesus loved the church when they live self-sacrificing lives in marriage and put their wives good ahead of their own . <p> Perhaps one of the most practical steps we could take is simply to ask our wives : " Honey , are there any areas in our marriage where you do not feel like I am loving you ? Are there any areas where you feel like I am putting myself ahead of you and your good ? " These are bold questions to ask ! Moreover , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestions that might come ! But if we are serious about loving our wives as Christ loved the church , we will probably need our wifes help in order to understand how better to love her . <p> Consider seeking out a brother whose marriage you respect and meet together on a regular basis to pray about being a godly husband . God consistently tells us in his Word that relationships and accountability are powerful tools for growth ( see Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 ; Hebrews 10:24-25 ) . How can you make use of these tools to love your wife better ? <p> Third Priority : Manage Your Family ( Ephesians 6:4 ) <p> Parents are exhorted to bring up their children in the fear and admonition of the Lord . In Deuteronomy 6:6-7a the Lord commands : " These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts . Impress them on your children . " Fathers in particular are commanded to instruct their children in the ways of the Lord : " Fathers , do not exasperate your children ; instead , bring them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ephesians 6:4 ) . <p> This last verse contains an important contrast : exasperating children vs. bringing them up in the instruction of the Lord . Yes , children are supposed to obey their parents ( vv. 1-3 ) . " But fathers , " Paul says , " do not make this difficult for them ! " ( v. 4 ) . Godly fathers are not dictators who need to prove their authority by constantly giving orders and commands and making new rules . Instead , godly fathers focus on helping their children to understand who the Lord is they want their children to know that Gods ways are good ways and that his commands are for their good . <p> 1 . Since God is the perfect Father , one of the most practical things we can do is get to know God better . What is his character like ? How does he respond to us as his children ? As we grow in our understanding of who God is and how he relates to us , we will grow in our understanding of how we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second step to take is to seek out the counsel of those who have gone before us . S++ren Kierkegaard once said , " We have to live life forwards , but can only understand life backwards . " The trick , then , is to find someone whose " backwards " is your " forwards " ! Seeking out a godly father for wisdom and advice is invaluable . <p> Fourth Priority : Provide for Your Family <p> ( 2 Thessalonian 3:10-12 ) <p> The importance of providing for our families should not be missed : " For even when we were with you , we gave you this rule : If a man will not work , he shall not eat " ( 2 Thessalonians 3:10 ) . Paul is not talking here of those who earnestly desire work and have been laid off or are struggling to find a job . He is talking about those who are lazy . Thus he continues : " We hear that some among you are idle ... Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11-12 ) . <p> Providing for our families presents at least two different challenges . On the one hand , some of us find that our jobs can be unenjoyable and frustrating . On the other hand , some of us choose to let our jobs take a higher priority than our wives , families or even God himself . <p> 1 . The first thing we need to do is recognize that we are called to be faithful servants of Christ in whatever job we have . When Paul writes to Christians who are slaves he gives this advice : " Serve wholeheartedly , as if you were serving the Lord , not men , because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does " ( Ephesians 6:7-8a ) . Even if we do n't  enjoy it , we need to be faithful to God in the work that he has provided . <p> Fifth Priority : Be Involved in a Local Church ( Hebrews 10:25 ) <p> My wife , and I have some good friends who live in England . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The turnaround began with two things . First , the husband began to cultivate his relationship with God .

This was very instrumental in his growth as a husband and in the growth of his entire family in the Lord . <p> The practical step to take here is quite obvious : get involved in a good local church that believes in the Bible and teaches it well ! Involvement in a local church is not an option for the Christian : it let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the Day approaching " ( Hebrews 10:25 ) .

Nettie was in the last month of pregnancy with our first child . But a lot of people were expecting me in St. Louis . I kissed Nettie good-bye , clattered downstairs to our Model A and , in a fresh Lake Michigan breeze , chugged out of Chicago on Route 66 . However , outside the city , I discovered that in my anxiety at leaving , had forgotten my music case . I wheeled around and headed back . I found Nettie sleeping peacefully . I hesitated by her bed ; something was strongly telling me to stay . But eager to get on my way , and not wanting to disturb Nettie , I shrugged off the feeling and quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the steaming St. Louis heat , the crowd called on me to sing again and again . When I finally sat down , a messenger boy ran up with a Western Union telegram . I ripped open the envelope . Pasted on the yellow sheet were the words : YOUR WIFE JUST DIED . People were happily singing and clapping around me , but I could hardly keep from crying out . I rushed to a phone and called home . All I could hear on the other end was " Nettie is dead . Nettie is dead . " When I got back , I learned that Nettie had given birth to a boy . I swung between grief and joy . Yet that night , the baby died . I buried Nettie and our little boy together , in the same casket . Then I fell apart . For days I closeted myself . I felt that God had done me an injustice . I did n't want to serve Him any more or write gospel songs . I just wanted to go back to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hunched alone in that dark apartment those first sad days , I thought back to the afternoon I went to St. Louis . Something kept telling me to stay with Nettie . Was that something God ? Oh , if I had paid more attention to Him that day , I would have stayed and been with Nettie when she died . From that moment on I vowed to listen more closely to Him.But still I was lost in grief . Everyone was kind to me , especially a friend , Professor Frye , who seemed to know what I needed . On the following Saturday evening he took me up to Madam Malone 's Poro College , a neighborhood music school . It was quiet ; the late evening sun crept through the curtained windows . I sat down at the piano , and my hands began to browse over the keys.Something happened to me then I felt at peace . I feel as though I could reach out and touch God . I found myself playing a melody , one I 'd never heard or played before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into place : " Precious Lord , take my hand , Lead me on , let me stand ! I am tired , I am weak , I am worn , Through the storm , Through the night lead me on to the light , Take my hand , precious Lord , Lead me home . " The Lord gave me these words and melody . He also healed my spirit . I learned that when we are in our deepest grief , when we feel farthest from God , this is when He is closest , and when we are most open to His restoring power . And so I go on living for God willingly and joyfully , until that day comes when He will take me and gently lead me home.Thomas A. DorseyGospel SongwriterA TRUE Story -- by Thomas A.

@@104679339 @79339/ <p> In one year I knew of at least 10 Christian couples ( who were either associates or close friends ) , who got divorced or separated . It was puzzling to say the least because I looked up to many of these individuals as examples for my own marriage . <p> While I do n't know all the dynamics of why each divorce took place in these relationships , I do know that God 's plan is for marriage to work . I also understand that it takes two to make the marriage work . With this in mind , as women , there are some things we can do to work on maintaining and divorce proofing our marriages . <p> In addition to prayer and faith , doing these things will often require pressing past your emotions and feelings in order to strengthen the marriage relationship and protect it against the enemy 's traps . While nothing is guaranteed , you can do your part as a wife in helping to strengthen your marriage relationship . <p> Below are the following things you can do to divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with God . <p> Stay in God 's presence , ( Psalm 16:11 ) . This is more of a lifestyle than anything else . Being in God 's presence means enjoying Him and worshiping Him by appreciating who He is and His plan for your life . It involves carrying yourself in a way that shows the love of Christ to others , especially your husband . <p> Renew your mind with God 's Word , ( Romans 12:1-2 ) . Do you ever wonder why Christians fall into so much sin ? One of the main reasons is the decision not to renew the mind . The Bible tells us to renew our minds on a consistent basis . If you do n't renew your mind with God 's Word , then you will replace it with something else . In fact , your spiritual desires will ultimately be replaced with lust . This is an insatiable desire for something . It could be in the area of food , money , material things , people , sex , etc . In fact , lust does n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spiritual growth , or anything else . Lust just wants what it wants ! As a result , this can cause a breakdown in the marriage relationship . This is why it 's so important to be diligent in studying God 's Word on a daily basis . <p> These types of problems and emotions can pour over into your marriage , whether you want them to or not . I struggled with my past relationships with men . While I was not with my ex-boyfriend(s) physically , I often struggled with hurt , anger , bitterness , un-forgiveness , and resentment . In turn , this caused me to doubt my husband 's love for me , and I often categorized him with the other men of my past . <p> In addition , I often blamed my husband for what other men did to me . This was unfair to my husband , and he did n't deserve this type of treatment ; so I decided to overcome these issues by replacing them with God 's Word and applying His perspective on my problems . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trashy " love " novels . What you watch , listen to , and/or read will become apart of you . While these shows may seem exciting , intriguing , and good for entertainment , they send improper messages about marriage and your role as a wife . <p> You may be saying , " Why should I stop ? " <p> Let me respond to that statement , " Do any of these shows give you sound Biblical principles for being a godly wife ? " <p> If your answer is no , then I recommend you replace watching these shows with reading Biblically based books on marriage and spiritual growth . <p> Some books include : <p> The Marriage You 've Always Wanted by Gary Chapman <p> The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman <p> The Love Languages of God : How to Feel and Reflect Divine Love by Gary Chapman <p> Fireproof ( which also comes in a DVD movie ) by Alex Kendrick and Stephen Kendrick <p> 4 ) Learn to forgive ... quickly ! <p> Forgiveness is very important when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way like no one else can . Maybe it 's because we have given so much of our selves and we expect so much from them . But you must understand that your husband will disappoint you and even hurt you at times . Understand that you will do the same to him . For this reason and because God requires it , you must be willing to let go and love him despite the hurt . <p> 5 ) Be Creative in Your Communication - Be willing to communicate with your husband about your marriage . Always start off with a positive statement.Communication is important , especially in the area of finances . In fact , money is one of the top reasons for divorce . When I first married my husband , I never expected to have money problems because I always thought it would be available to us . But when I started losing jobs and my husband started making some transitions , these things put a strain on our finances . In fact , we lost our home because our finances were in turmoil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had we discussed our finances in a more open manner . Eventually I took responsibility for my negligence and careless spending habits by learning about money from God 's perspective . We 've learned our lesson , and now we 're very honest and open about money . To start your journey , I suggest you educate yourself on how you can improve your finances . There are books on finances and you may even want to consider seeking financial counseling . <p> 6 ) Refuse to compare your marriage or your spouse with someone one else 's . Sometimes it 's so easy ( when we feel discouraged or lonely within our own marriages ) , to look at other people and become frustrated or jealous with them because they seem to be doing well in their marriages . It 's unhealthy , unrealistic , and it puts too much pressure on you and your husband . If you can get the mindset that God has a different and unique plan for you and your husband , then you can be yourself and he can be himself without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Make Passionate Love to Your Husband on a Consistent Basis . <p> Sex plays a large part in maintaining a healthy marriage . In fact , making love on a consistent basis can do the following things : <p> Help you feel closer to your husband . <p> Help him to feel good and you to feel good . <p> Demonstrate to him how much you love him . <p> Reduce the temptation for either of you to look for love and affection outside of your marriage . <p> Open the door to intimacy and communication at a later time <p> ( If for some reason , sex is not pleasurable for you , or you were sexually traumatized in the past , I suggest you prayerfully talk to your husband to see how you can improve your sex life . You may also need to seek help in the form of books and/or counseling . ) <p> 8 ) Take an interest in what interests your husband . In some cases , sex may not be the biggest priority for your husband . Other things such as work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more important . While you and your husband may be different and have different interests , you can still humor him . For instance , let 's say he 's a sports fan and you do n't enjoy sports . You could start by getting yourself a jersey with his favorite team and wearing it on game day . <p> At least it would show him you were taking notice of his interests . He may enjoy jazz . Take an evening to serve him dinner as you listen to his favorite jazz artist . There are so many creative ways you can show support to your husband , even when you do n't enjoy some of the things he does . In the long run , he 'll see the sacrifice and efforts you make to learn what interests him ; and in turn he may do the same thing for you . <p> 9 ) Let go of pride and just say , " I apologize , " or " I 'm sorry , " even when you think you 're right in the situation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God will reward us , ( 1 Peter 5:6 ) . <p> 10 ) Be content , ( but not complacent with ) , where you are in your marriage . Paul tells the believer to be content where we are . Understand that marriage is a process , but recognize that God is doing something in your marriage relationship . Thank God for your husband and remember that things could always be worse , ( Hebrews 13:5 ) . <p> While divorce in the Kingdom of God is rampant , as Christian women , we can do some things to prevent our marriages from ending .

I thought , I 'll wait a minute , and whoever it is will go away.I waited and waited , but the ringing doorbell seemed to get louder and more insistent , and then the person ringing also started knocking loudly.I thought to myself again , Who on earth could this be ?

@@104679370 @79370/ <p> Many of you reading this may not know that God designed marriage to work according to the way he created the man and the woman . Each gender has its own marital duties that when practiced appropriately make the marriage thrive . " The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife , and likewise the wife to her husband . " ( 1 Corinthians 7:3 ) <p> What are the martial duties that scripture is talking about ? <p> Understand that in a Christ-built marriage the husband has responsibilities and the wife has responsibilities , lest the marriage would have no purpose and no direction . When both the husband and the wife are practicing their duties properly it keeps the relationship structured , organized , and spiritually blessed . Everyone is happy , no one is in need of anything , and no one is looking outside the bounds of the marriage for companionship . <p> " Wives submit to your husbands as to the Lord " . ( Ephesians 5:22 ) It is a wife 's duty to submit to her husband . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women . Jesus Christ is head over the husband and husbands are head over the wife in just the same way that Christ is head over the church , his body , of which he is the Savior " . ( Ephesians 5:23 ) This does not mean that man is superior to the woman . <p> In God 's eyes men and women are equal heirs of His kingdom , and that 's all that matters ! In society there is a push and shove mentality that the different sexes exhibit with each other from time to time , but it does n't mean a thing ! You ca n't take this life to heaven with you . Why work so hard proving something that you can not take to heaven with you ? In fact , you will not see heaven if you are so burdened in this life with things of the flesh . " For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . " ( Matthew 6:19-21 ) <p> God chose to make Eve out of Adams flesh and bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become " one flesh " . The goal in marriage should always be of " oneness " between husband and wife . Do you see " oneness " in marriage today ? The wife is doing her own thing and the husband is doing his own thing . They each have their own jobs , their own money , their own friends , etc . Are we honoring God with our marriage , or satan ? Where is the oneness ? Why are we not procuring for ourselves spiritual treasures that we can take to heaven with us ? <p> When a Christian wife rebels against her duty of marriage she is rebelling against God and His plan for her in the marriage , consequently the marriage will have difficulties , much like what we are seeing today . Reality is , if the husband does not fulfill his marital duty to his wife properly she will have a difficult time submitting to her husband . In fact this is where the attitude of feeling like a doormat has been brought into Christian culture . <p> Wrong attitudes grow like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that ninety percent of the Christian culture has been deceived and they do n't even know it . Women have been deceived into believing that being a wife and mother is not good enough and that she must go to college and have a good career and boss her husband around . After all , most women have been told they are equal to or above men and will not be treated like a doormat . Many of them have the " no man will tell me what to do " attitude ! <p> More and more men are being emasculated by their wives . Consequently men are looking outside of America for suitable marriage spouses so they may find a good woman who will treat him like a man . I know of many such marriages and the wives are treated with love and almost anything their heart desires . Many American women are really missing out on the blessings that come with a healthy Godly marriage . <p> If one link in the marriage is weak , ultimately the marriage will have no leg to stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to their husbands in everything ? It is because her husband , being the man that God created him to be has a built in natural instinct to be a protector , provider , and leader . All men have this ability , even those men who believe they were born without it . When a woman usurps her husband 's headship she will be in constant suffering in her marriage because she is trying to row her boat against the nature of the current . <p> A man needs to be treated like a man for him to be able to properly carry out his God-given calling . It is wrong for any woman to try and undermine the natural instincts of her husband because of a messed up attitude that has evolved from a confused culture-it is not natural for a woman to behave like a man and it is not natural for a man to behave like a woman--it does n't matter what century himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are commanded to love their wives-in the same way Christ loved and gave himself up for us . This is why it is so important to understand what real love is . Love is not s superficial feeling of lust and desires like so many think , but principled acts and behaviors that must be acted upon and sometimes sacrificed for . <p> A husband can not love his wife properly if he does not put Jesus Christ above himself and utilize the power of the Holy Spirit within him . Now there is a wonderful treasure to store up for yourself in this life . When a husband loves his wife in the ways of the Lord , he is giving up his own life for that of his wife , to make sure her needs are met and taken care of , above his own . A husband must pray about this daily and ask Christ to help him love his wife because there will be days when he may not feel like being very loving.A man who learns to love his wife in the ways of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a wife who respects , honors and loves her husband . Let 's stop all the fussing and fighting and let 's start honoring God with our marriage . What one thing can you do today to help bring your marriage back to God ? What spiritual treasures can you store up for yourselves in marriage ? Do you feel intimidated to submit to your husband 's ? Are you loving your wife in the Lord ? If you want a gloriously blessed marriage , husbands must take back their God-given headship position and start honoring God with their marriage ! This is what will fix Christian culture !

" A father , his son , and a friend of his son were sailing off the Pacific Coast , " he began , " when a fast approaching storm blocked any attempt to get back to shore .

That was good enough for me , provided his goal was to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on with his wife and children . I did n't care if I was ruining a marriage and family . In fact , as I 've said earlier , I thought I was the one deserving to be his wife and even the mother of his children . I did n't feel guilty about anything . At the back of my mind , she deserved what was happening to her . She had her chance to be with him and she blew it . <p> Everything was perfect . Even my family accepted him . Yet , there was a lot of insecurity going on inside of me at that time . There were times when we were eating in a restaurant and he would just leave me alone because he had to talk to someone who knew him and his wife and therefore he could n't introduce me . The worst incident was when he could n't bring me to his office Christmas party because I was not the wife . I felt slapped on my face that day . Reality started sinking in . <p> I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and I ended up more and more frustrated . That 's when I started asking myself : " If this man really loves me , then how come he ca n't give me the only thing I wanted ... a marriage " ? <p> Despite all these insecurities , I still held on to the relationship because there was nothing better for me out there . Nothing ... until Jesus came along . He was there all along but I was ignoring Him . So when He finally got my attention , the scales fell off my eyes and I realized my sin for what it was . I broke up with him and never turned back again . <p> So you see , not all mistresses are out there to deliberately steal your husbands from you . Most of them are good women who do n't even have plans of being with married men . Yet , they are hurting and insecure women who are easy preys to any man 's attention and care . This was the case with me . I did n't even know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feelings with me . I was very vulnerable . <p> Another thing I want to point out is this ... a woman who is not in God does not have a clue about the sanctity of marriage . I wanted marriage for myself but I did n't know how sacred it was in the eyes of God . I was blaming my man 's wife for what happened to him . I had no guilt feelings . I did n't even feel like I was doing anything wrong . <p> Listen to me single women . <p> A married man will never be a good husband material . If he can cheat on his wife , he will cheat on you too . If he ca n't value the sanctity of his marriage , he will never be able to value anything . Have nothing to do with married men , unless you are in a group setting . Mine started as a business meeting and look what happened . And even if the man is a Christian , and you are a Christian too , I still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are setting yourself up for a trap if you do n't listen to this advice . <p> Listen to me married men . <p> How dare you prey on single women or any woman for that matter if you already have a wife . Be content with what you have . How sure are you that the woman you want to be with will be a better wife than the one you have ? The only reason why you are excited to be with her is because she is the other woman . Make her your wife with the responsibilities of a wife and mother and she will be no different than the one you already have . And since you are the one who has the problem , then whoever you will be with will be the same ... because of you ! <p> Listen to me married women . <p> If you are a married woman and not a Christian , there is no better advice I can give you than to surrender your life to Jesus . <p> If you are a woman of God , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if you suspect that your husband is cheating on you , do your investigations in private . Better yet , ask God to reveal things to you . Once you know who the woman is , invite her for a one-on-one talk but do n't intimidate her . Your goal is to lead her to Jesus . This will be very challenging but if you are all about God and His perfect will , then you will be able to do this . <p> Do n't forget that I did n't see anything wrong with what I was doing . Nobody said anything . Things would have been different had somebody approached me , called my sin for what it was , and showed me that only Jesus can love me the way I deserved to be loved . <p> Remember ... it is an insecurity issue . This is the bottom-line . This is what needs to be exposed . And unless a person 's security is anchored on God , the problem will never be solved . 85506 @qwx945506 85505 @qwx945505

The good news is it was , and my treatment was nothing compared with what some woman go through . I was still so scared and the emotional toll it placed on my mind and feelings was probably the hardest thing for me to deal within my life.Anyway , just before I was diagnosed with cancer , I had decided to expand my business .

I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of town that was heavily populated with shoppers.I had found the " perfect " spot .

I had made an appointment to meet the landlord and sign the contract the next day .... then I received a call from my Doctor saying that I had in fact , had Breast Cancer and we needed to operate as soon as possible . I was not able at that point to sign the contract and had to let my " perfect spot " go . It was rented shortly after that .

He had worked harder and longer than the other man in the company and felt he was the " perfect " man for the job . He was devastated.He and his wife struggled to let go of that promotion and focus on moving forward and accept that this was not the time or the job for him at this point in his career.Two years later the President of this company stepped down from his position and this man became the President of that company !
