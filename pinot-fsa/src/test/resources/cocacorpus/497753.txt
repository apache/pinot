By focussing on Lhasa I mean to emphasise the contemporary urban nature of a city that is too-often associated with a mysterious past . As with other cities , Lhasa provides constant and sometimes intimate contact with strangers people who we may or may not see tomorrow and these photos , all taken in public spaces or accessible venues , deal with that specifically urban experience . Whether tourists at the Potala ( Lhasa Nights #10 ) or pilgrims at the Jokhang ( # 11 ) , eating dinner ( # 8 ) or visiting night clubs ( #5 ) , life in Lhasa involves a series of interactions with people whom we do not know , and who do not know each other .

@@79925526 @1425526/ <p> Fig. 1 Fig. 2In 1957 Douglas Barrett published two gilt brass statues in the British Museum , a Shakyamuni Buddha and a Manjushri : both are inscribed with a Chinese reign mark , da Ming Yongle nian shi ( bestowed in the Yongle era of the great Ming ) ( 1403-1424 ) . 1 ( Figs. 1 , 2 ) Barrett found little reason to doubt the evidence of the inscriptions , but others questioned the attribution of an early Ming ( 1368-1644 ) date. 2 The statues seemed to have more in common with Himalayan style and iconography than other early Ming Buddhist works that conform to classical Chinese sculptural traditions , such as a Hongwu period ( 1368-1398 ) Buddha in the British Museum dated 1396. 3 This stylistic anomaly contributed to the doubts that some had about the age of the two Yongle marked statues . In 1975 Heather Karmay ( Stoddard ) published research on early Ming annals that detailed imperial gifts of Buddhist statues to Tibetan monasteries during the Yongle period , 4 and concluded that the reign marks engraved on the relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the period : she was aware of eleven examples including the two statues in the British Museum. 5 In 2001 Ulrich von Schroeder recorded fifty-four gilt brass statues in Tibetan monastery collections bearing the same da Ming Yongle nian shi mark , confirming the evidence found in the early Ming archives. 6 <p> Fig. 3While the authenticity of the da Ming Yongle nian shi mark on the BM gilt brass statue of Shakyamuni Buddha is now generally accepted , doubts have been raised over the age of its separately made throne back ( torana or prabhamandala ) and the throne base into which the figure is secured . The authors of a technical and stylistic study published in a British Museum Technical Research Bulletin concluded that the sculpture of Buddha was of the Yongle period but the throne and mandorla ( sic ) were probably of a later date. 7 As a result of metal analysis by X-ray fluorescence it was established that the throne sections were constructed from relatively pure copper with a very low iron content ( &lt;0.1% ) . The low iron content suggested to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a later date than the Yongle period gilt brass Buddha . No comparison with other Yongle period or later copper samples was cited , and no elucidation was offered as to why copper with a low iron content is indicative of a post Yongle date . While acknowledging stylistic links to bas-relief depictions of Buddhas and thrones at the Yuan period ( 1271-1368 ) Juyongguan Cloud Platform , the paper argues that the gilt copper throne sections are " nearly identical " to thrones depicted on Qing period ( 1644-1911 ) embroideries that pay homage to an early Ming prototype . ( Figs. 3 , 4 ) The authors thus conclude that the gilt copper throne sections of the British Museums Yongle period Buddha are later than the statue and were possibly made in the Qing dynasty . <p> Fig. 4It is important to consider the reliability of the evidence used in the BM report . The paper concedes that the use of copper itself can not be used as an indicator of date : the low iron content of the copper was the factor believed to suggest the later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously considered if there were a large number of comparative copper samples that could be reliably dated to the Yongle through the Qing period , but this data does not exist and in any case would not be conclusive , as Keith Mitchell has demonstrated. 8 Rigorous stylistic analysis , however , reveals that the throne of the BM Buddha is far from " nearly identical " to the thrones of the Qing embroideries , which are in fact merely superficially comparable to the gilt copper throne . As this paper will argue , the BM throne and torana are composed entirely of quintessential Yuan and early Ming period design elements , with some detail unique to the Yongle period , while the embroideries depict Qing period motifs in a composition that imitates a Ming style . The British Museum gilt copper throne sections can therefore be shown beyond doubt to be Yongle period and not later copies as proposed in the BM Bulletin . <p> While the Qing embroidery recreates the general shape of an early Ming throne it does not include the following highly distinctive Yuan and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BM gilt copper throne and torana . <p> The pillar at each corner of the recessed central panel corresponds to those on Yongle stupas . ( Figs. 5 , 6 ) A similar design is seen in Yongle sutra illustrations and on the thrones at Juyongguan . ( Figs. 7 , 3 ) There is no reference to this ubiquitous Yuan/early Ming throne pillar on the Qing embroidery . <p> Fig. 8The corners of the gilt copper throne have subtly upturned ends . This feature originates in medieval eastern India and in Newar art and architecture of Nepal , as seen in a thirteenth century Tibetan thangka of Tara by a Newar painter . ( Fig. 8 ) Newar artists , including Anige ( 1245-1306 ) , the Controller of Yuan Imperial Workshops , were responsible for innovation in Chinese Buddhist art during the Yuan period . Indeed the thrones of the Buddhas at the Yuan period monument at Juyongguan , which so closely resemble the throne of the BM Buddha , depict the same upturned corners seen in the thirteenth century Tara painting . Upturned corner projections are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each corner of the throne on the Qing embroidery , however , is marked by a post and finial , a virtually ubiquitous design element of late Ming and Qing period shrines and pedestals. 9 This universal late Ming/Qing period architectural device is clearly not the inspiration for the classic Yuan/early Ming upturned corner design of the gilt copper throne . <p> III . The quintessentialYongle style of the lotus petals on the BM gilt copper throne base <p> Thus , the thrones of the embroideries selectively interpret the form of early Ming thrones using Qing period detail , while the throne and torana of the BM Buddha embody the very essence of Yongle style in both its details and overall structure . These gilt copper sections , displaying quintessential stylistic elements of the Yongle period that are absent in the Qing embroideries , are indeed rare and exquisite examples of Yongle period metalwork . Important stylistic anomalies demonstrate that Qing period works such as the embroideries could not have been the inspiration for the gilt copper throne sections , as proposed in the BM Bulletin. 13 Conversely , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works such as the British Museums Yongle Buddha , throne and torana . <p> Fig. 10 <p> Fig. 11 <p> Fig. 12 <p> To date , only one other imperial Yongle period gilt brass Buddhist statue with original throne is recorded . The Buddha formerly in the Speelman collection is the same style but larger than the British Museum example and has a similar gilt copper throne and torana with overall height of 72.5 cm . ( Fig. 10 ) The overall height of the BM Buddha and throne is 59 cm . Similarities extend to the way in which both statues are prepared for consecration , when sacred materials were placed in the cavities . ( Fig. 11 , 12 ) Evenly spaced chisel cuts are usually made on the base rims of Yongle statues to retain a metal plate that seals the consecration material within . ( Fig. 13 ) The BM and Speelman examples do not show these marks . ( Fig. 14 ) Instead , holes are drilled horizontally through the rims into which dowels would have been fitted to secure the sealing plates . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outline of the holes would still be visible , and a blemish on the smooth gilt surface , 14 but once statue and throne are united the lower rim is concealed within the well of the throne , hiding the imperfection by design . ( Fig. 17 ) The holes in the lower tier of the separate gilt copper thrones , which the British Museum paper was unable to explain , 15 are also for the insertion of dowels to retain metal sealing plates. 16 The dowels would have been considerably easier to conceal within the elaborate scroll motif of the thrones than on the smooth gilt surfaces of the Buddhas . This is demonstrated on the Yongle stupa that is sealed in the same manner : gilt-headed dowels are inserted into holes made in the scroll design on the lower edge . ( Figs. 5 , 18 ) <p> 10 .

The rounded petal with an elaborate flourish at the tip ( but with no ornamental flourish on the sides ) as seen on the integral lotus pedestal of the 37 cm high British Museum Buddha , is used only in bronzes over ca 25 cm and occur in both the Yongle and Xuande periods . The slim petal type with the three-point curl at the tip is used in Yongle cast images below ca 22 cm . Conventions for lotus petal design according to size are maintained throughout imperial Yongle and Xuande Buddhist metal sculpture . <p> 13 .

The present law technically allows this ivory to be sold by the elephant owners , either pruned from a live elephant or cut off of one that dies a natural death , and banning ivory sales by the proposed " Elephant Law " will render this ivory economically worthless , reducing the value of live elephants to owners . This in itself could contribute to the abandonment and deaths of elephants , as they are extremely expensive animals to keep .

@@79925536 @1425536/ <p> Text and images copyright Ian Alsop and Asian Arts : not to be reproduced without permission <p> Among the curious puzzles of early Nepalese sculpture and architecture are the empty niches of the lovely Licchavi stone caityas that dot the Kathmandu valley . These elegant caityas are fully decorated , often with exquisitely detailed carvings , but the niches where one might suppose the figures of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas would normally reside , are vacant . fig.1 , left <p> Several explanations have been offered for this puzzling detail of these monuments . One is that the figures originally contained in the niches were destroyed during the week-long Muslim incursion led by Sultan Sham ud-din Ilyas of Bengal in 1349 . Another , proposed by Ulrich Wiesner in an article on these empty niches , is that the niches were emptied by a single Brahmanical act of religious dominance.1 <p> The physical evidence belies the first explanation , for the niches are carefully carved out , and show no signs of the damaged bits and pieces one would expect from such a fate ( fig. 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty ( there are several notable exceptions ) , which would give the invading force far greater destructive powers than it in fact had . While Swayambhu and Pasupatinath suffered greatly from the incursion , some outlying sites of great antiquity and importance , such as Cangu Narayana and Sankhu , were spared . Yet caityas from the unaffected areas are just as empty as those in the path of the sultan 's rampage . <p> Wiesner 's explanation is supported by the notion , prevalent among Newar Buddhists , that there was a terrible persecution of Buddhists at the time of Shankaracharya . This notion is not supported by concrete historical evidence however , and Nepal 's recorded history , while bearing witness to the prevalence of Brahmanical ways among the ruling families , nowhere supports the idea of a single disastrous persecution of the Buddhist community at the hands of radical Hindus.2 <p> A small early figure of the Buddha Ratnasambhava in the Pritzker collection in Chicago presents us with a possible solution to this puzzle . The miniature figure sits inside a decorative niche of gilt repousse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small prong protruding from his back ( fig. 3 , left ) . The size and shape of the figure in its repousse case strongly suggests that it was once inserted into the empty niche of a caitya from the same period , 3as is represented in a composite photograph ( fig.4 , below right ) .4 <p> There are several large stone stupas in the Kathmandu valley which are decorated with sculpted metal figures occupying niches . The ancient stupa of Swayambhu and its in-town " reflection " , Kathesimbhu come to mind . Although the images presently residing in the niches of these major sites are far more recent than their foundations , we may surmise that the toll of thievery over the centuries necessitated the occasional replacement of the metal images . <p> Whereas the larger images in the niches of these stupas were designed to be left in situ permanently , the encased Buddha of the Pritzker collection was probably only inserted into the niche at the time of periodic ritual worship , in much the same way that gilt repousse kosas or kavacas ( sheaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and , in some cases uncarved and aniconic ) deities during special services . When not in use , these portable images were left in the care of the donor or his family , or the guthi or monastery responsible for the worship performed . <p> The practice of creating kosas and kavacas , we might note here , was particularly practiced during the early period ; the storehouse of Cangu Narayana contains many superb examples on a Vaisnava theme , and in fact one the earliest and most precious examples of Nepalese repousse work is the kavaca of the Lord of Cangu himself.5 <p> The type of worship involving the periodic embellishment of a stone figure with a portable metal covering or decoration survives in some cases to this day , but does not appear to have survived in the case of the Licchavi caityas . Gods , like dynasties , enjoy ascendance and then suffer from decline , and the Licchavi caityas appear to have been abandoned when the guthis supporting them lapsed and their economic support declined.6 Neglected , their place as objects of worship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more recent descendants of the original donor . In most cases later caityas , usually much simpler in design than the sophisticated Licchavi versions , include sculpted stone representations of the Buddhas , evidence that the earlier practice of embellishment with gilt metal had disappeared . <p> The little Pritzker Buddha not only provides us with a quite satisfactory explanation for the empty niches on the Licchavi caityas , but also explains the many tiny Buddhist metal sculptures which form an interesting but little-remarked part of early Nepalese art . Usually of seated or standing figures of the Buddha - but sometimes of bodhisattvas as well - these images are found in many collections and have occasionally appeared in the auction sales . Fig. 5 shows a diminutive figure of the Buddha Amitabha similar in style to the Pritzker Ratnasambhava , but without the repousse surround , while fig. 6 shows a standing Bodhisattva figure that might have been used to fill one of the more elongated niches . Figs. 7 and 8 show later examples of Buddhas that suggest that the practice of supplying metal figures for caitya niches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Often these small figures have prongs or tenons protruding from their backs ( see fig. 9 , left , and fig. 10 , below right ) , and it has long been a puzzle as to what these tenons were used for . I for one often conjectured that the diminutive figures may have at one time been part of a larger mandorla or surround of a main image . I am now of the opinion that these figures were once part of the same type of ensemble represented by the Pritzker example . The relatively poor condition of the gilt repousse case surrounding the Ratnasambhava suggests the delicacy of the repousse part of the element , and this delicacy is most likely the reason why we have not found more repousse pieces to fit the myriad small Buddhas and bodhisattvas . In fact it is somewhat a miracle of history that the Pritzker Buddha and his repousse niche have survived the vagaries of some thirteen centuries to guide us to an answer to the riddle of the Licchavi caityas . <p> Fig. 4 Composite photograph of Licchavi caitya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should be noted that this composite photograph was not assembled with the dimensions of the specific caitya and the figure , and is therefor hypothetical as regards this particular example .

This expedition lasted until November and totaled 161 days in the field . Having so much time was most useful and I was able to meet or exceed all my research objectives . I also wish to express my gratitude to the provincial , prefectural , county , and township officals of the the Tibet Autonomous Region for their support and expertise . <p> For over one decade , I have been actively involved in the exploration of the Byang-thang region of Tibet in conjunction with my research into pre-Buddhist culture and archaeology ( see bibliography ) . While Tibet is synonymous with Buddhist learning and culture , its civilization extends much further back into antiquity than the Buddhist period . My findings demonstrate that Tibet supported a sophisticated culture long before the dawn of the Buddhist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely connected to the early Bon religion , an amorphous indigenous belief system which seems to have been enriched by various traditions coming from adjoining countries . The Bon religion , now heavily assimilated to Buddhism , is still very much in practice in Tibet and adjacent countries . <p> The investigation of pre-Buddhist culture is very much in its infancy and there is still a great deal of work to do . I am hopeful that in the next decades we will obtain answers to pressing questions related to this study such as the chronology of archaeological sites , the nature of cultural borrowing and influences in early times , and the true extent of pre-Buddhist civilization . <p> Of particular interest is the pre-Buddhist Zhang Zhung civilization which was based in northern and western Tibet as late as the 8th century . The literature of the Bon religion is replete with references and allusions to Zhang Zhung which , according to these sources , was large and powerful . One of the main objectives of my research is to establish the historicity of this kingdom and its role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into early Tibetan civilization is comprised of three major disciplines : textual studies , ethnography and archaeology . I am involved in the collection ( mostly in photographic form ) and translation of texts and manuscripts which shed light on pre-Buddhist practices . Among the most important of these are gsol-kha , scriptures written in praise of indigenous deities such as the mountain gods and lake goddesses . <p> Most importantly , I am engaged with interviewing senior members of the older generation . These cultural luminaries are becoming very rare in a land which is fast becoming a cultural desert . They preserve much cultural lore and knowledge that in many instances is not being transmitted to the younger generation . This means that once they pass away the heritage of Tibet and by extension , the rest of the world , will be much impoverished . <p> I will continue to examine ethnographic and textual materials in my various publications : however , in this report we will focus on archaeology . <p> During the expedition I was able to document around 100 pre-Buddhist sites . On top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade ( where I surveyed around 50 other pre-Buddhist sites ) , I believe I now have sufficient data to outline the typology and preferred location patterns of pre-Buddhist archaeological sites . There are still many ancient sites to be discovered but it now seems as though we have a representative selection encompassing most regions of the Byang-thang . <p> The types of pre-Buddhist archaeological sites found on the Byang-thang can be classed as follows : <p> A word on what constitutes the pre-Buddhist period is in order : I use the word pre-Buddhist to denote cultural phenomena and physical evidence which have their origin in the period before Buddhism came to dominate Tibet and which in content display distinctively non-Buddhist characteristics . The first diffusion of Buddhism began in the early seventh century , in the reign of King Srong-btsan sGam-po . Buddhism however , did not come to dominate the religious sentiments of Tibet until the ninth or tenth centuries . It seems likely therefore that pre-Buddhist edifices and art could have been produced as late as 1000 . In certain situations , as in very remote areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context can be extended as late as 1250 . On the other end of the chronological spectrum are pre-Buddhist sites of deep antiquity dating to the early Metal Age and earlier . For an assessment of pre-Buddhist chronology see my book Divine Dyads : Ancient Civilization in Tibet . <p> As this point in the investigation there is little archaeometric data to rely on . I hope with the publication of my findings the situation will change and the archaeological community will find the interest and resources to explore some of these sites . Much will depend on academia forging mutually beneficial relations with the government of the People 's Republic of China and local Tibetan communities . <p> I attribute archaeological sites to the pre-Buddhist period on the basis of the following criteria : <p> 1 ) Sites mentioned in Bon literature as belonging to the Zhang Zhung period ( pre-Buddhist kingdom centered in north and west Tibet ) <p> 2 ) Ruins ascribed by elders as belonging to the ancient Bon po , Mon pa , Zhang Zhung kingdom , or in certain instances , to the Gling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interviews and map making . At no time did I disturb the ground or in any other way affect the integrity of the sites . I am well aware that once archaeological sites are put on the map they are vulnerable to the attacks of the unsavory . As a first priority , it is imperative that this heritage be conserved for future generations . Secondly , once those interested are aware of this heritage , measures will be taken to carry the investigation to the next stage ; the scientific excavation of selected sites . Until such steps are taken a huge gap will exist in our knowledge of Eurasian archaeology . <p> Among the archaeological sites I surveyed on the Changthang Circuit Expedition are those that contain rock art . I have documented the rock paintings at gNam-mtsho in four scholarly works and still recently , I found examples I was unaware of . Among the most notable is what may be the largest pictograph to come to light in Tibet ( see image no.1 ) . It is a red ochre stupa ( mchod-rten ) painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two meters in width . On the basis of style , I believe this stupa was painted no later than 1300 . There are also four smaller companion stupas which are very difficult to discern unless the light is right . <p> The most common subjects in gNam mtsho rock paintings are animals , not surprising when you consider that livestock still form the linchpin of the economy . The deer , an animal with archaic religious associations figures prominently in pictographs . Paintings of deer were produced from the early Metal Age ( perhaps even in the Neolithic ) until relatively recently and come in many styles and forms ( see images 2 and 3 ) ( the color calibration scale in this and other rock art images is used by the International Federation of Rock Art Organisations ) . The horse also figures prominently in rock paintings , an animal with an extremely high status in the northern steppes of Tibet . Most compositions featuring the horse do so in conjunction with mounted hunters and warriors ( see image no. 4 ) . There are however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here which is painted in close proximity to a Bon mantra ( see image no. 5 ) . <p> Among the most important abstract paintings are those of the g.yung-drung ( swastika ) . Many of these are oriented in a counterclockwise fashion characteristic of Bon tradition ( see image no. 6 ) . Tibetan historical sources ( such as sTag-lung chos byung ) tell us that the Bon-po were forcibly dislodged from gNam mtsho by 1250 , and the majority , if not all , of their art was produced before this date . <p> In extreme northwestern Tibet , I came across a petroglyphic site which to my knowledge has not previously been documented . It is a very important site in that it includes carvings produced over millennia . The earliest petrogylphs may well date to the Neolithic , beginning a tradition which lasted until relatively recent times . As one might expect from such a site , the petroglyphs exhibit great diversity in terms of content and the techniques used to carve them . Among them is a figure similar to those in north Asia sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age ( see image no. 7 ) . <p> The earliest variety of petroglyphs feature animals which in design parallel those found in south Siberia and Mongolia and dated to the Neolithic or Bronze Age ( see image no. 8 ) . The two animals represented here appear to be a yak and either a horse or onager . <p> Of great interest are petroglyphs exhibiting cultural motifs associated with the pre-Buddhist Zhang Zhung kingdom ( see image no. 9 ) . While an Iron Age date is indicated for these types of petroglyphs , it can not be ruled out that in some instances they were made as late as 1250 . The motifs present include the g.yung-drung , crescent moon , raptor with outstretched wings , tree and two anthropomorphs with headdresses consisting of three prominent lines reminiscent of horns or feathers . Bon texts ( such as Sources for a History of Bon ) record that Zhang Zhung adepts had such embellishments . Another motif depicted on this panel is a pair of primitive mchod-rten with triple-pointed finales ( bya-ru bya-gri ) such as the ones Bon-po @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most primitive techniques used to create petroglyphs consists of pecking at the rock with stone or metal tools to create the images . This type of petrogylph is well represented in the site I surveyed ( images 10 and 11 ) and could potentially be as old as the close of the New Stone Age ( Aeneolithic ) . In one of these examples , two anthropomorphs mimic each other 's arm movements giving the impression that they are dancing . Crown-like objects on the tops of their heads are reminiscent of feathers or horns , both of which were used in pre-Buddhist times to adorn the head . In the other composition - produced through pecking - an unusual two-headed yak is portrayed . <p> Ungulates with long sinuous antlers and curvilinear designs in the body like the one shown here are found at various sites in western Tibet ( image no. 12 ) .

Early historical carvings are also in evidence in the site I surveyed ( image no. 13 ) . The ma-ni mantra inscription and mchod-rten shown here are of the same type found in Ladakh and Baltistan and which are generally believed to date from Tibet 's imperial period ( seventh to mid-ninth centuries ) . <p> In western Tibet there are a number of hilltop ruins connected by the local residents to the Mon-pa . These are called Mon rdzong or Mon mkhar ( A.H . Francke first described the genre at the turn-of-the-century in Ladakh and Professor G. Tucci did likewise , in the middle of the century in Rong-chung ) . On the expedition I surveyed around one dozen Mon mkhar . The Mon-pa were a semi-legendary prehistoric people probably of non-Tibetan origin . The forts they supposedly left exhibit diverse styles of construction ( see images 14 and 15 ) . I have several reasons to believe that some of the structures attributed to the Mon-pa were in actuality constructed in the Zhang Zhung period . One reason is that among the Buddhists of mNga ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little or no awareness of the significance of Zhang Zhung . <p> Among the most interested monumental remains are those attributed to Zhang Zhung and which are said to have functioned as religious centers ( see images 16 and 17 ) . I had the good fortune of being able to document more than one dozen of these types of structures . In some cases , as in Nyi-ma and gNam-ru counties , Bon literature corroborates the oral accounts attributing these structures to the pre-Buddhist period . The Zhang Zhung religious centers ( sad mkhar ) are built in a very different fashion from their Buddhist successors . The rooms are small ( four to nine square meters ) and are often oval-shaped . Most notably , these are all stone constructions with stone rafters , arches and roof slabs ( where these features are still intact ) .

I had noted this site and a little of its history in Divine Dyads but it was not until the present expedition that I had an opportunity to visit it . According to the Bon-po elders of the region , the remains of walls , terraces and other structures found on the southwestern side of the headland of Gyer-ru mtsho ( Gyer-ru mtsho do ) belong to the Zhang Zhung period ( see image 19 ) . While I presently lack the scientific capability to verify these claims , it is clear from Bon religious tradition that Gyer-ru mtsho was indeed the site of activity in the time of Zhang Zhung . <p> It is now apparent that gravesites lay scattered all over northern Tibet . They often form clusters of up to twenty structures and can either be oval or square in shape ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four meters across . On the expedition I documented about one dozen of these sites . These graves are almost without exception attributed to the Mon-pa . In some instances , I found graves which had been opened revealing the burial chamber inside ( see image 22 ) . <p> Another type of structure attributed by local Tibetans as being the graves of Mon-pa ( Mon dur ) are found on mountain and ridge tops ( see images 23 and 24 ) . I have found five sites of this typology . These consist of superstructures two or three meters square with a central chamber built above ground level . These chambers are usually less then one metre square and therefore , could only have accommodated an adult corpse which had been dismembered or reburied . While I can not confirm the oral history associated with these sites it is clear from Tibetan historical sources that burials were a feature of pre-Buddhist culture .

The pillars protrude up to 1.8 meters from the ground and are frequently found in rows of three to ten standing stones . When there are multiple pillars they are sometimes made of stones of contrasting colors . The enclosing structures might have originally been taller but now without exception , they have been reduced to ground level . These perimeters are square or rectangular in shape and vary in size but typically are around eight meters by eight meters .

This year , I discovered six of these sites which , in local culture , are frequently attributed to the Mon-pa or Gling Ge-sar of the Tibetan epic . The menhirs are often found in association with other types of structures . <p> The standing stones vary in height from 25 centimeters to 1.5 meters and can number many hundreds in a single complex . The stones appear to have been aligned in neat rows oriented to the cardinal directions . They are now often inclined , heavily worn and covered in lichen , indications of their substantial age . The menhirs appear to be constructed from both raw and dressed stones depending on their size and the particular site . The adjoining structures are usually leveled but in certain instances above ground ruins have survived . The ruins usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . The walls of these structures are extremely thick and exhibit a high degree of stone working skill . There is some indication , in the way of local accounts , that they may have functioned as graves . <p> The most significant archaeological site of this type ( which I refer to as monolithic arrays ) is called Yu Kham-bu . It is comprised of six large complexes each with a concourse of standing stones lying adjacent to long structures . Without exception , the fields of menhirs lay on the east side of the buildings . The buildings range in length from 20 to 60 meters . The outer walls of these edifices are upwards of two meters thick . There also appear to be inner walls of considerable thickness . The width of the buildings averages around ten meters and therefore , at least on the ground level , they had very small inner spaces as compared to their exterior dimensions . The crumbling walls of the edifice I call Tower Complex still exceed three or four meters in height but potentially may have been much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their massive construction and fine masonry .

I believe that it is essential that Tibetans reclaim their ancient heritage as they are much more than mere hybrids of Indian and Chinese civilization . Tibet possesses a past every bit as profound and unique as any of the other great cultures of antiquity . <p> I would very much welcome input from interested parties : <p> Bibliography of Works Relating to Tibetan Archaeology by John Vincent Bellezza

@@79925562 @1425562/ <p> Anyone traveling through Kham is struck by the region 's beautiful houses . Made of traditional materials in diverse styles , Tibetan homes in Kham are handsome , spacious , and well adapted to their environment . What distinguishes them most from the houses of central Tibet is the abundant and skillful use of wood . Kham has always possessed great forests , wood is an excellent building material , therefore carpentry skills in Kham have been developed to a high degree . <p> House , Baiyu County . The Chinese-style tile roofs are not common in Kham , but areincreasing in popularity because they are more rain-proof than traditional flat roofs . A less lavish house is visible to the right rear . <p> Detail of wood construction , Ganzi County <p> Now , however , forests are dwindling , and the government recently banned further commercial tree-cutting throughout Ganzi Prefecture and surrounding areas . What does this mean for the carpenter and his skills ? In Lhasa , the government is tearing down many old houses , threatening the city 's timeless Tibetan character . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thriving or struggling to survive ? <p> During my many travels , I 've had ample opportunity to observe traditional Kham architecture both inside and out . I 've watched cityscapes grow and change as the region develops , and I 've worked with builders . With this background , I went with architect and environmental planner William Semple to interview carpenters in Kangding County . For many years Semple has been researching the connection between natural resource management and preservation of Tibetan building traditions . Our exploration brought us many surprising discoveries , and showed how , despite the influx of ethnic Chinese , Tibetans still have a strong hand in shaping the architectural landscape of their homeland . <p> Kangding County contains Kangding City , which is the prefectural capital of Ganzi . It is the most economically developed county of Ganzi , both because of the proliferation of government offices , schools , and other state-owned enterprises , and because of its nearness to Han-dominated eastern Sichuan .. Kangding county was heavily logged decades ago , and almost no old-growth forest remains . Thus , timber is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of random stone . <p> Inside rural Kangding homes , however , wood is used lavishly . The roof is supported by horizontal timber beams and held up by wooden columns . Rooms are paneled and often contain ornate cabinetry . Floors , ceilings , and furniture are also wooden . This kind of interior decoration is not particular to Kangding ; in fact it 's common throughout Kham , being used by virtually everyone who is at least middle class and lives in a traditional Tibetan home . When there are no locally harvestable trees , wood is imported from other areas . <p> Farm-house kitchen . Stove is in the foreground , with tile-covered chimney . A door at the far left looks into the living room beyond . <p> From the sheer numbers of traditional houses , it is evident that there is a plentiful supply of carpenters . In fact , their numbers are probably growing as economic prosperity slowly increases and more people can afford their services . Customarily , raw timber for house-building is supplied by the home-owner . The carpenter brings only his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Carpentry skills are passed down from father to son . Wages are 20-40 yuan a day , depending on the experience of the carpenter and whether or not he receives food from his employer . Typically , a new house lasts for sixty years before it must be replaced . <p> Painting is also an important trade , for few Tibetans would regard their home as complete until it has been painted inside and out . Outside painting is generally much plainer than the interior decorations . I have been told that prior to about 1980 , private homes were not lavishly decorated--this honor was reserved for monasteries . But within the last couple of decades it has become acceptable for ordinary families to enjoy richly painted designs and carvings in one or more rooms of their homes . Nowadays , for a middle-class or wealthy family , such interiors are almost de rigeur . <p> Painting skills , when not learned from a parent , can be studied at a few schools scattered around Kham , for example the Tibetan School in Kangding , or Gyalten Rinpoche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Thonglha Tsewang at Palpung Monastery in Derge train many students over the course of their careers , and those who are not successful at thanka painting can try their hand at the less demanding job of household and monastic decoration . Painting is done not only on wood , but also on clay walls and sometimes even concrete . <p> It 's been my experience , amply repeated in many parts of Kham , that the Cultural Revolution not withstanding , traditional home painting and carpentry are alive and well today . Lack of trained builders is not a problem . What about lack of materials , especially with the newly enacted ban on commercial logging in western Sichuan ? <p> Gaba Township , Kangding County , about three hours ' journey from Kangding City , is a prosperous agricultural area . The population is overwhelmingly Tibetan , with only a handful of Chinese teachers and other experts stationed here by the government . Except for official buildings such as schools , virtually all the structures in Gaba are traditional . Dorje Tsering , a carpenter living and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built nowadays are better than the old houses . Materials and technique have improved . " Dorje Tsering did not expect the ban on commercial cutting to affect his livelihood , because according to the law , local people will still be allowed to harvest timber for local construction . There is good timber to be had three kilometers from his house , he told us . Whenever they cut one tree , they plant seven or eight more , he said . He did not expect he would have to change professions any time soon . <p> A bigger threat to Dorje Tsering and his brethren is the Chinese carpenters with whom they must compete . According to another man who is also called Dorje , in his home village in Gonlo Township , Ganzi County , " People hire Chinese carpenters because the Chinese can finish a house in two weeks . Tibetan carpenters take a month . " The reason for the difference , according to Dorje , is that Chinese carpenters will build a whole house for one lump sum payment , whereas Tibetan carpenters want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a better quality house , but they do n't want to contract for the complete job because they do n't want to work so hard . " <p> Another threat to traditional carpentry is a growing preference for concrete buildings . William Semple and I heard that in Tagong we would find a construction site where we could see carpenters at work , so we drove there full of anticipation . Upon arrival , we found a huge pagoda under construction on the plain beneath the sacred Zhara La mountain , not far from Tagong Monastery . But to our dismay , we saw that the temple was in Chinese style , and made of steel-reinforced concrete , not timber . Was this an example of deliberate Chinese cultural infiltration into Tibet ? We asked around until we found the foreman , Huang Nengqing , an employee of Ganzi Number Two Construction Company . <p> Chinese-style temple under construction outside Tagong . The main building material is steel-reinforced concrete . <p> Huang told us that the temple had been commissioned by Dorje Tashi . This was astonishing news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in Los Angeles about a year ago . He is a rinpoche , well-regarded , and has built an orphanage and a home for the elderly in Tagong . " He raised three million yuan from overseas Chinese , " Huang said . " Also , some Americans and French donated money , and people in the special economic zone of Shenzhen . It will be his private stupa . " <p> Although Huang is Chinese , he has lived in Ganzi Prefecture all his life , and is accustomed to working on Tibetan buildings . He said , " My father was a carpenter ; he built many monasteries . I 've worked in construction for 40 years . My favorite project was Anjue Monastery . " ( Anjue , called Ngacha in Tibetan , is a landmark in Kangding , located prominently next to the government guest house . ) " The one I built was destroyed in the Cultural Revolution , and the new one is not in wooden style . The wooden style needs much more skill to construct than the concrete style . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> We were sad to learn that more buildings are being made from concrete , and that this is basically in accordance with the wishes of many people , Chinese and Tibetans alike . There are several reasons why people prefer concrete . First , concrete is thought to be stronger-- " if we use wood , it wo n't last as long , " said one workman in Tagong . Second , as the foreman Huang noted , concrete buildings requires less skill to construct . Third , concrete is thought by Chinese and Tibetans alike to reflect a more ' modern ' lifestyle : " The tall buildings in Kangding are beautiful . The higher , the more beautiful , " said carpenter Dorje Tashi . In Yajiang Semple and I found that wealthy families were covering the outsides of their stone walls with a layer of concrete because they liked the clean , finished look that concrete imparted to their homes . <p> Lastly , concrete buildings are much less vulnerable to fire . This is easily overlooked by those of us who live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone call . In history Kangding has been swept several times by devastating conflagrations , and even now , with primitive electric wiring and numerous other hazards , fire is a constant threat . Earthquake is another serious hazard , for the region is extremely active seismically . William Semple noted that new concrete buildings going up in Kangding City appeared to be fabricated very soundly for earthquakes , including strongly built foundations and other structural details . <p> Kangding City , it should be noted , has not one single traditional Tibetan building apart from its three monasteries . These days it is fashionable for apartment blocks to have Tibetan-inspired flourishes such as trapezoidal outlines for the windows , and faux beam ends beneath the roof-line . Almost all new buildings in Kangding are so embellished . But the basic construction and layout is identical with those of concrete apartment blocks found all over China . <p> Even Kangding 's monasteries are not loath to use concrete for construction , or to include Chinese-style temples on their grounds . In fact , Tibetans do not seem to make much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monastery 's most important temples will be in Tibetan style surmounted by a Chinese curving roof of gold-covered tiles . <p> Carpenters construct a pavillion with a Chinese-style roof at Palyul Monastery , Baiyu County . <p> Nevertheless , it would seem that economics is a far more important driving force for architecture in Kham than taste . In Kangding City , land is simply too valuable to be expended on single-family homes . No one in Tibet or China has yet to devise an apartment building that houses ten families , occupies minimum acreage , includes plumbing and electricity , and is made of traditional Tibetan materials . There is a cement factory just outside the city , so concrete is cheap and plentiful , whereas stone blocks and timber are expensive and must be carried a far distance . <p> Apart from aesthetic considerations , there is one serious drawback to concrete as a building material in Tibet : it is an extremely poor insulator . According to Semple , a concrete wall has the same insulating effectiveness as a pane of glass . People keep themselves warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a charcoal brazier , or a wood-burning stove . Thus , money saved on construction materials is subsequently paid back in the form of increased heating expense and the everyday misery of being cold . Not only that , but ' modern ' designs rarely give any thought to passive solar heating , whereas traditional Tibetan houses are situated with windows facing the sun . <p> In rural areas and remote towns , forests are closer and concrete more dear , therefore it should not be surprising that timber buildings are numerous . Derge , in the far west of the prefecture , is a bastion of traditional carpentry , where even nails are often made from wood . The Dege county seat does contain a commercial district of concrete and brick buildings , and institutional buildings such as hospitals and schools are also constructed in modern style . Yet there is also a sizable ' old town ' of traditional houses , and they ring the city 's perimeter . As the population grows , new traditional homes are constructed .. This pattern is repeated in the towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tagong , Litang , Batang , and Bamei . Luhuo alone is almost entirely without traditional buildings--they were flattened by an earthquake in the 1970s . <p> Monastery architecture is probably the least resistant to change . I discovered in the course of my work to restore Baiya and Palpung monasteries , monks are resistant to even the slightest construction innovation , such as inserting a layer of sheet plastic in the roof to keep out rain . Where innovations have been introduced , they are often poorly implemented . In Ganzi County , Rongbatsa Township , a temple belonging to Gyalten Rinpoche was given a concrete roof , which they expected would be more waterproof than traditional clay . However , over the next 16 years the building settled , opening large cracks that they had no proper materials for sealing . The monks put clay into the cracks , but it quickly washed away , and rain poured into the building . <p> Before Semple and I began these interviews , I expected to find that the greatest threat to Tibetan architectural traditions is the logging ban . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sensible reasons of economics and safety . Therefore , to encourage preservation of indigenous Tibetan architecture , I believe the following might be helpful : <p> 1 . Develop methods of making traditional Tibetan buildings fire and earthquake resistant . Find a way to seal their roofs against rain .

@@79925580 @1425580/ <p> Maijishan , a Chinese word which literally means wheat stack mountain , is the name of a 142 meter high hill located in the Xiaolongshan forest 45 kilometers southeast to the Tianshui city of the Gansu Province in China . The mountain got its name because it looks like a huge pile of wheat straw on the northern side of the Qinling Mountain Range ( fig.1 , left ) . It is surrounded by luxuriant vegetation , splendid landscape and picturesque scenery and enjoyed the reputation of being the most beautiful place in the Qin 1 territory . 2 ( fig.2 , below ) . Its location is also significant since it lies just a few miles south of the Silk Road . Its topography and location attracted Buddhist monks , artisans and artists who dug out the caves , meditated , sculpted and painted over a period of many centuries . Consequently it was gouged with grottoes and adorned with sculptures and murals in different historical periods . <p> The history of the Maijishan Buddhist grottoes can be traced back 1600 years . According to the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qin ( 384-417 A.D. ) one of the sixteen states of the five barbarian peoples . The Biographies of Eminent Monks of the Liang Dynasty ( Liang Gao Seng Zhuan ) reported that two eminent monks , Tanhong and Xuangao , used this place to meditate with more than three hundred disciples in 402 A.D. It seems that the construction of the caves must have been started before this date . 5 The most vigorous and prolific period of architectural and artistic activity coincided with the reign of Northern Wei ( 385-534 A.D. ) , Western Wei ( 535-556 A.D. ) and Northern Zhou ( 557-581 A.D ) dynasties . The complex continued under the rule of succeeding dynasties right up to the Qing ( 1644-1911 A.D. ) 6 when not only some of earlier caves were altered , reconditioned and embellished with figures and murals , but also new ones were added . 7 <p> The middle area of the hill was destroyed in a violent earthquake in 734 A.D. 8 and the grotto group was divided into two parts , the east and the west . Now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the west . In these 194 grottoes , 7200 sculptures and over1000 square meters of mural paintings are preserved . 9 <p> Fig. 3 <p> The sculptures and murals housed in the Maijishan caves are significant for the knowledge of the development of Chinese sculpture , painting , and architecture and help trace the development of Buddhism as well . The earlier examples reflect syncretised forms of Indian , Central Asian and Chinese styles . Gradually , the form evolved to reflect a more native Chinese style as the artists of Maijishan integrated their creativity and imagination with exotic art styles and produced sculptures and murals with a more indigenous flavor . So a transitional phase of Chinese Buddhist art can be seen here . <p> The sculptures of the Maijishan caves are all Buddhist , and various sculptural formats an techniques can be seen in the complex : shallow and deep relief , in the round sculpture in various media , including stone , stucco and clay . The supreme importance of this grotto complex lies in its clay and stucco sculptures . Since the local rock is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stucco clay modeling . Some figures are solid with a thick layer of clay whereas some are hollow and formed over a rough wooden skeleton 10 ( fig.3 , above ) that was covered in wheat husks , hemp , reeds and mud before being smeared with the final layer of sculpted clay . After carving , statues were painted with lively colours . The abundant use of clay sculpture places this site in a distinctive position among rock- cut cave sanctuaries of China . 11 Stone sculptures are also found here but in less number and not made with local rock . It seems that they may have brought from somewhere else . <p> Fig. 4 <p> Fig. 5 <p> Fig. 6 <p> Fig. 7 <p> The mingling of different dynasties is vividly reflected in the sculpture embellishment of Maijishan .

Traces of earlier construction and influence of Indian and Central Asian styles can be easily discerned in this cave . <p> A fusion of Indian , Central Asian and Chinese styles is found in the caves of Northern Wei period . These statues are slim and ethereal figures with benevolent expression exemplified in numerous caves . 14 The simple and solemn figure of a seated Buddha in cave 148 ( fig.5 , above ) manifests an earlier phase of the Northern Wei style . 15 The dominating great standing Buddha and his attending bodhisattva on the western cliff in niche 98 also belong to the Northern Wei period ( fig.6 , above ) . 16 Western Wei statues continued the Northern Wei fashion with their stylistically similar clothing patterns and slender bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous caves such as 60 ( fig.7 , above ) and 147 ( fig.8 , below ) as well as many others . 17 Among the most notable is cave no.44 which depicts an exquisite image of Buddha with a lofty bun of curly hair , high nose , pralambakarna ( long ears ) and a gracious smiling face which looks calm and indifferent to the outside world . His arched eyebrows and half-closed downward looking eyes create an expression of calm serenity . This sculpture represents the Western Wei style in its elegant posture and dignified appearance .

When a Chinese person gives another Chinese person a gift , they might give and not say a thing . No need for words . The recipient will understand , because the gift is an auspicious symbol . To give a negative example , you would n't want to buy someone a big old clock as a gift because " old clock " also means " to breathe ones last . " A wristwatch will do . Or an elephant . <p> The word for elephant , xiang , is the same as that for sign . And if the elephant has a vase ( ping ) , that would rhyme with peace ( taiping ) . And so the gift would allude to the popular saying taiping youxiang : when there is peace , there are signs . ( And now you know why , during the Qing dynasty , real elphants carrying vases on their backs appeared in processions celebrating the emperors birthday . ) Operative here is the East Asian love of the seemingly oblique , the nuance , the suggestive . As the saying goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cracking the code , as it were , often finds a four-character epigram hidden in the pictorial symbolism . " The fisherman receives the profit " ( yuren deli ) , for instance , refers to an epigram from the Warring States dynasty . As the name of the dynasty reflects , people were often quarelling , and when two people give in to their anger , they do n't  realize their fighting leaves the field open for a third person to come in and grab the spoils . The pictorial expression on display here is a small carving depicting a snipe with its beak caught in a clam , and a passing fisherman taking both of them away . <p> One more example . " Leading ones children to court , " wishes that a mans sons follow in their fathers footsteps and become high officials . So a carving of a large fish together with a smaller fish in a tidal composition would suggest the phrase , because the Chinese words for fish and abundance sound alike ( yu ) , reinforced by the fact that fish lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many children . And the words for tide and court ( chao ) are also cognates . <p> To an outsider , a number of linguistic vectors intersect here , but to a Chinese person , its a natural part of their culture . After all , Chinese words are , at bottom , based on pictorial representation . And the Chinese language has more words than sounds , so one sound can mean several things . <p> Who would have thought that cracks in a vase might be good ? Yet crackles in glaze ( sui ) suggest suisui , year after year , and the vase itself ( ping ) is a visual pun on a word for peace ( pingan ) . <p> Its interesting to realize this tradition goes back 2,000 years . Yet scholars have remained aloof as to shedding any discernable useful light on this phenomenon .

For example : the coat of arms of the Borough of Congleton , in Cheshire , contains a conger eel , a lion ( leo ) and a tun ( another word for a barrel ) . The sequence spells " conger leo tun , " referring to the towns name . In general , the Western rubric for this would be rebus , where an image is used to represent a sound ( a pictogram for a phonogram ) . <p> Setting aside sounds for a moment , considering just images , one begins to view the world as if it were a text . For instance , noodles are long , and thus evoke longevity ; an excellent menu choice for your birthday . <p> And good things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , so the sight of fish swimming in pairs is a sign of a happy marriage . Mandarin ducks mate for life , and so they 're an ideal symbol of conjugal happiness . They might also be shown swimming alongside a lotus . Since a lotus comes to its seed-bearing stage early , this suggests the early arrival of children ; plus , a word for lotus sounds like a word for harmony ( he ) . <p> Children can also be evoked by a melon or a gourd , which contain many seeds . Thus , under one emperor , pomegranates became a popular gift at the throne , as people wished him the blessing of quick sons , continually , and all succeeding in high office . <p> The associations are , in and of themselves , enjoyable to contemplate , and the works of art on display are all superb and often sublime .

I had a chance to find out more through my old friend Mimi Church who had been there several times on her way to or from Western Tibet and the mysteries there . <p> In November of last year my wife Lois and I and a sculptor friend , Mary Shaffer , had the chance to go to the Limi valley with Astrid Hovden , Norwegian PhD candidate who has been studying the culture , religion and language of the Limi valley for the past two years . She was an incredible guide to this fabulous place , and introduced us to the people and culture of the valley .

But as the flood grew fiercer , the embankments burst and water gushed towards the village with great force . <p> Fig. 6 <p> Fig. 7 <p> Fig. 8 <p> Fig. 9 <p> Fig. 10The ground was shaking as the water carried a large amount of rocks and debris . The rocks made the water change its course several times , and chunks of land kept sliding down on both sides of the valley colouring the water almost black and filling the air with a strong smell of mud . <p> Fig. 11People immediately started evacuating the houses near the river bank and managed to move most of their belongings to the houses of relatives further away . After a while it became too dangerous to enter the houses and people could only passively watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . <p> At around 7:30 pm , the first wall gave in , and an hour and a half later two houses were cut open by the flood . People were crying as they witnessed their fields and homes being gradually carried away by the torrents of water . <p> By 10 pm in the evening , the flood slowly started to recede , and by the next morning , the water level was down to normal . <p> Fig. 12 <p> Fig. 13 <p> Fig. 14 <p> Fig. 15 <p> Losses <p> Fig. 16Two houses belonging to Mr. Tsering Ngodrup Tamang and Mr. Sonam Gyaltsen Tamang , which were situated near the river bank , were completely destroyed by the flood . <p> In addition , the families living in the five directly adjoining houses will have to rebuild their houses . <p> The flooding river has carved out much of the moraine ground on which the village is built , and twelve houses and the one thousand year old monastery which is now located only a few metres from the river bank are at great risk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sunkhani visited the site of the disaster the day after the flooding and estimated that approximately 200 ropanies of land were destroyed that evening . <p> Fig. 18Since the flooding started in 2006 more than 100 fields have been washed away and another 100 fields were completely covered by sand and rendered useless by the recent flood . Some of the livestock is reported missing after the flood and a few of the families have lost all their fields . Food aid will therefore be needed for the winter . <p> Water mills and important infrastructure like bridges and sections of the main road through the valley were also washed away , and virtually the whole path at the bank of the flooding river leading up to their pastures in a neighbouring valley was completely flooded . <p> Glacial Lake Outburst Flood ( GLOF ) <p> The cause of the flood is the outburst of a glacial lake , a so called GLOF , in the mountains above Halji village . The flood has occurred at almost the same date at the end of June every year since 2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local villagers ( including the author of this report ) have climbed up to the glacier to find the source of the flood . <p> Fig. 19 <p> Fig. 20 <p> Fig. 21 <p> Fig. 22 <p> In front of the glacier ( covering a plateau at an altitude of 5200-5400 metres ) are four glacial lakes , all of which feed into the flooding river . <p> However , the main source of the flood is a sub glacial lake , partly visible from a deep crevasse located at an altitude of 5300 metres . According to a team of villagers who climbed the glacier just after the flood in 2009 , the lake was partly covered by a big ice sheet , about 20-25 meters thick . Ice sheets must have broken off and fallen into the lake , discharging huge amounts of water , leaving a wide scar all the way down to the village . <p> Fig. 23 <p> Fig. 24 <p> Fig. 25 <p> Initiatives so far <p> Fig. 26 The Nepali government provided some support for the building of gabion walls in 2010 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls at the side of the village , which helped retaining the water for some time , but the embankments were too short and too low to hold against the currents when the river grew bigger in the evening . <p> After the recent flood , the district authorities have also allocated rice and money for buying kitchen utensils to the two families who lost their houses . However , seven families will have to build new houses this winter and more funding is needed . <p> What can be done ? <p> In order to estimate the risks for future outbursts of the lake and resulting impacts , an expert team consisting of a hydrologist , a glaciologist and an engineer should be mobilized and sent up to the glacier . The expert team should produce a detailed technical report assessing the risk for further flooding and develop long term strategies to minimize the risks of a future disaster . Long term mitigation strategies may involve the digging of a canal enforced with embankments to divert the flood away from the village and monastery , and if possible , controlled drainage of the lake .

The Editor <p> Fig. 1 <p> Not far from the royal square of the old city of Patan in Nepal ( fig. 1 ) is an active Buddhist institution , a monastery in name but one that no longer houses celibate monks . Among several popular names , the most favored is Uku , to which Nepalese append baha ? or bahal ( from vihara , Sanskrit for monastery ) . One of the few essentially physically complete and active monasteries among more than 150 that once crowded the small city ( fig. 2 ) , Ukubaha ? also bears a formal Sanskrit name , Sivadeva sa ? skarita Omkuli Sri Rudravarn ? a mahavihara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sivadeva II ( r. 694705 ) and Rudravarma II ( r. 11671174 ) , the one said to have founded the monastery , the other to have restored it . 1 <p> Physically , Ukubaha ? follows ancient Indian models that were probably introduced into the Kathmandu Valley about the early fourth century C. E. with the arrival of the Licchavi peoples from northern India . Ukubaha ? may antedate the Licchavis , however , since accumulating evidence now points to some prior Ku ? a ? a presence . As viewed today , Ukubaha ? consists of a spacious quadrangle comprised of four two-story wings around a slightly sunken paved court ( figs. 3 , 4 ) . The south wing houses the principal shrines , exoteric on the ground floor ( fig. 5 ) , esoteric on the floor above , and is capped by a large cupola , its roof embellished with a row of gilt stupas . The other wings , at one time housing for the monksand eventually invaded by familiesnow serve a variety of institutional purposes for the monasterys community , the sa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 4 <p> Fig. 5 <p> In keeping with traditional Nepalese architecture , the structures at Ukubaha ? are built of brick and wood in the post and lintel mode . They are roofed above a grid of rafters with a thick layer of clay sandwiched between two layers of tile . In lieu of tiling , the south-wing roof and cupola are sheathed in gilt copper in honor of the deities they shelter . Such roofs are very heavy , and their wide overhanging eaves demand extra support . This is achieved by means of struts , or brackets , sloping timbers set between roof and wall at approximately a 45 degree angle . The struts do not penetrate the building but are simply braced against it and depend in part on the weight of the roof to keep them in place . At Ukubaha ? , in keeping with other sacred structures , the struts have been carved in the form of the gods , a practice that further sanctifies the monastery and adds to its splendor . <p> Fig. 6 <p> Fig. 7 <p> Fig. 8 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small figural struts upholding the roof of the large cupola at Ukubaha ? ( fig. 6 ) , the quadrangle wings below lack the full encircling suite proper to the Nepalese monastic courtyard . Indeed , at Ukubaha ? there are only seventeen struts at this level : eleven on the south ( and shrine ) wing ( see fig. 4 ) , and six facing them across the courtyard on the north wing ( fig. 7 ) . The south-wing struts are polychrome painted , but the north-wing struts are plain . Among the south- wing group , the central six are multi-headed , multi-armed Tantric images that typify Nepalese figural struts from about the fifteenth century on ( fig. 8 ) . Like the small cupola struts , they bear inscribed dates equivalent to 1653 . The remaining south-wing struts , three at the left of the central group and two on the right , are also of approximately the same date . Some have been erroneously ascribed to the thirteenth century because in part they are modeled after far older figural struts such as the splendid company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north wing , have long been ascribed to the thirteenth century as well , which we shall see is erroneous . <p> At one time , the north-wing sextet was installed at the rear of the south wing ( fig. 9 ) , but in 1982 , when the monastery was renovated , they were moved to the interior of the quadrangle for security and placed in their present position on the north wing , three at each side of the entryway ( see fig.7 ) . By that time no figural strut was safe from predation . <p> In 2004 I learned of a Nepalese wooden sculpture that had been radiocarbon dated between 531 and 672 . This was surprising . Until then the only Nepalese wood carvings of such antiquity were believed to be the ca. seventh-century reliefs in the Jokhang , the principal temple in Lhasa , the Tibetan capital . Allegedly , no other Nepalese wood carving predated the thirteenth century , or the twelfth at the very earliest . Yet suddenly , here was a Nepalese carving as old as the Jokhang reliefs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be other equally early carvings . To find out , I decided to test two objects still in situ in the Kathmandu Valley that , like the Ukubaha ? struts , were also thought to have been made around the thirteenth century . Through the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust ( KVPT ) , an international organization devoted to historic preservation in Nepal , which was then working at the very sites , I obtained the needed samples . Something little larger than a toothpick will do . The results of the two tests were astounding . One of the tested objects was made sometime between 900 and 1030 and the other , a figural strut , even more surprising , between 770 and 970. 2 The latter could have been made by a great-grandson of one of the Nepalese wood carvers invited to embellish the Jokhang . Given the common mind-set ( albeit unfounded ) that everything in the Kathmandu Valley had been torched in the week-long Muslim raid of 1349 , I was certain the revolutionary findings revealed by the tests would be met with disbelief . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Together they clearly demonstrated the existence of a continuous tradition of wood carving throughout the long centuries supposedly barren of them . Moreover , the photographic documentation that accompanied the study showed wood carving to be far more than an architectural adjunct but a fine art , comparable in quality to the finest Nepalese bronzes and paintings . Speaking most eloquently to this proposition are the figural struts on the north wing of Ukubaha ? . <p> Fig. 10 <p> Because these struts , like the first two tested objects , were considered to be rare thirteenth-century survivals , they were obvious candidates for radiocarbon testing . To obtain the needed test sample , I again turned to the KVPT , and following delicate negotiations with the sa ? gha elders , Dr. Rohit Ranjitkar himself , engineer , architect , and Nepal Program director , climbed the ladder to secure it ( fig. 10 ) . From that sample we now know that five of these " thirteenth-century " struts were actually carved between 690 and 890 , by a carpenter who was most likely a near descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although , given the expense , only one Ukubaha ? strut was tested , four of its companions are so like it stylisticallyindeed , were probably made by the same personthat I feel secure in dating them the same . The sixth strut , the second as viewed from left to right within the courtyard , is stylistically and chronologically anomalous . It is an interloper among the suite and , as established in the forthcoming study , could not have been made before the late tenth to early eleventh century at the earliest , and is probably much later . <p> Given the overlapping dates of the other five struts ( 690890 ) with the reign of Sivadeva II ( 694705 ) , it seems likely that the suite for the monastery quadrangle was a royal commission of which only these five remain . If so , the king certainly engaged one of the most skilled of his subjects in the shaping of wood . <p> Fig. 11 <p> The monastery quadrangle where these struts have come to rest is not of their time . It is almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have risen above Licchavi foundations . But at each renovation or rebuilding , bits and pieces of the old structure along with some of its precious contentsmanuscripts , bronzes , wood carvings , and other valued goods ( fig. 11 ) were saved and passed from generation to generation . Indeed , that seems to be the case for all the surviving Nepalese wood carvings created between the sixth and thirteenth centuries . However , as identified through my study , not only are there these isolated survivals but at least two ca. 1200 still-standing temples . <p> Although I took countless photographs of the handsome Ukubaha ? struts between 1966 and 2000 , I felt that for publication they would be better served by professional photographs . To that end , in October 2006 I enlisted Neil Greentree , friend and member of the Freer and Sackler Galleries photography laboratory . To our horror , when we stepped into the courtyard we found thatthe painted struts exceptedall the wood had been newly stained black ( fig. 12 ) . The struts that for so long had been a weathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was to beautify them for a ceremony to be held in the courtyard . There was no remedy ; we enjoyed the ceremony and Neil did what he could ( figs. 14 , 15 ) . <p> Fig. 12 <p> Fig. 13 <p> Fig. 14 <p> Fig. 15 <p> In September 2009 , in the hope that time had softened the blackening , Neil returned to Ukubaha ? with determination and a state-of-the-art camera to better the somber photographs from 2006 . Regrettably , the struts were still as black . Before submitting the new photographs for publication we decided that if the details in these carvings were to be seen we should artificially return them to a more natural appearance by computer enhancement of the digital filesin other words , lighten them . But , in reality , the struts are still black . Although the doctored photographs revealed details of unimaginable clarity , by then , with the book in layout , we could not introduce new images showing them , only substitute the existing images with better ones . <p> The new Ukubaha ? photographs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable struts for decades , probably no one has seen them since the master carpenter brushed the last wood chips away and fitted them high above in the gloom of the eaves . The accompanying photographs , then , are offered to the readers of Asianart.com as a supplement to those in the forthcoming book so that after almost a millennium and a half of obscurity they will once again be seen . <p> Fig. 16 <p> To my knowledge , the first to publish an Ukubaha ? strutor for that matter any Nepalese wooden sculpturewas Pratapaditya Pal in his 1974 Art of Nepal ( fig. 16 ) . It is an excellent frontal shot that captures the full length of the strut . The carving depicts the classic Nepalese version of a salabhajika , a Sanskrit literary term meaning " the one who breaks the branch of the sala tree . " The branch breaker is a comely maiden reaching for fruit or flowers in the branches above while supported by a dwarf seated among geometric forms at the base . The salabhajika is also a yak ? i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in this composition her legs be crossed . Her dwarf support is a yak ? a ( occasionally a yak ? i ) , her male counterpart . His cubistic seat symbolizes rocks that denote a natural setting or mountainous terrain . Corner struts excepted , until about the end of the fourteenth century this version of the salabhajikamaiden , tree , dwarf , and rockswas the only composition used in Nepal when carving a figural strut . <p> The strut Pal chose for his illustration is Ukubaha ? strut 6 . By coincidence , I chose the same strut to illustrate an article published the same year ( Slusser 1974 , fig. 2 ) . In contrast to the frontality of Pals view , mine was slightly three-quarter and showed carving extending around the side of the strut . But my view cropped away most of the rock motifand all of it when used elsewhere ( Slusser 1982 , pl. 162 ) and , unpardonably , did away with the tree altogether . In our early acquaintance with these , and other , old salabhajika struts , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maiden , carved almost full round , that we little remarked her clothing and ornaments and ignored all elsetree , dwarf , and rocks . Pal , for example , beyond mentioning that strut 6 depicted the tree-dryad motif , wrote almost exclusively in these terms when describing it . The yak ? is are " slender and elegant , " their modeling " soft but sensuous " ( Pal 1974 , 133 ) . " Desirability , " he continues , " is the most obvious quality " as they " reveal their physical charms with uninhibited candor . " But remember , these struts are on a slant and high above in the shadow of the eaves . They can be looked at only from afar . We did not , almost could not , examine them . We simply did not even know that we should , so satisfied were we in contemplating the beguiling bodies over which , again quoting Pal , " the suggestion of movement flows across the surface of torso and thighs . " For me the first hint of missed detail came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time textile patterns engraved on the maidens saris . <p> Fig. 17 <p> Fig. 18 <p> Fig. 19 <p> Fig. 20 <p> Fig. 21 <p> So , through Neils new photographs let 's lookno , seesomething of what we 've missed . And well start with Ukubaha ? strut 6 ( fig. 17 ) , the one Pal introduced in 1974 ( see fig. 16 ) . In that old photograph , if we get beyond admiring the salabhajikas seductive form , we can see that she 's wearing a diadem , a few ornaments , a scarf , and a skirt secured by a wide , intricately carved belt . But there is so much more . Zooming in on the salabhajikas head we now see above her handsome face , with its arched brows over elongated eyes , aquiline ( now damaged ) nose , and full lips , an elaborate coiffure , pulled to the side in a large chignon threaded with pearls and finished with a jeweled rosette ( fig. 18 ) . It is complemented by a jeweled diadem under whose edges steal a row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborately coiffed but may favor slightly different styles . One , for example , eschews the jeweled rosette in favor of three dangling tresses loosed from the formal chignon ( fig. 19 ) . Another maiden , in this master carvers hands , dispenses with the jeweled diadem , and some even with the formal chignon , the better to see every wavy tress and the very strands that compose it ( figs. 20 , 21 ) . From these photographs we can fully appreciate that despite the " desirability " of the maidens bodies , their gentle , pensive faces display no hint of it . <p> Fig. 22 <p> Fig. 23 <p> Fig. 24 <p> Fig. 25 <p> Fig. 26 <p> Fig. 27 <p> It is clear that the Ukubaha ? master carpenter wished these bodies to be admired . That their alluring breasts and svelte limbs not be hidden , ornaments are few and clothing is the narrowest of shoulder scarves and the most gossamer of skirts . Gossamer , indeed , but worn seductively low on the hips , secured by a richly jeweled belt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most attractive of ways . On some of the skirts only faint traces of design remain , but on others time has dealt a bit more kindly . Preserved on one , if faintly , are broad bands of intricate detail that when newly carved must have mirrored the rich fabrics worn by Nepalese princesses ( fig. 22 ) . Miraculously , on another skirt the design remains crisp and clear . It is a charming pattern consisting of broad bands contained within paired lines , the bands filled alternately with large blossoms or waterfowl ( most likely ducks ) , some rows walking left and others right ( figs. 23 , 24 ) . Carving each of these tiny creatures , surely measured in millimeters , had to be time consuming . But as we now begin to see , to the Ukubaha ? master it was no deterrent . For this heavenly company there would be nothing but the best . From the available photographs heretofore , or even the testimony of our own eyes , we could not imagine that we had been left such a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open it . <p> No less than the salabhajikas themselves , the trees under which they stand command the Ukubaha ? masters full attention . Their branches are sap-filled and burgeoning with flowers and fruit that the maidens seek , and , in keeping with the latters patterned garments , every fruit and every flower is worthy of care ( fig. 25 ) . Although a given fruit may number dozens upon dozensthe sides of the struts are also carvedeach one becomes a miniature sculpture with a constricted end and evidence of the spent blossom from which the fruit developed . Even the tiny peacock that comes to peck the fruits must be accorded the patterning of its flamboyant plumage ( fig. 26 ) . Moreover , for this master carpenter , vegetation will not be confined to the face of the strut but will also be carved everywhere on the scarcely visible sides ( figs. 27 , 28 ) . <p> Fig. 28 <p> Fig. 29 <p> Fig. 30 <p> Fig. 31 <p> So , too , respecting the dwarf yak ? as and yak ? is seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; each is an individualized sculpture in its own right . The positions of these small figures vary , their faces reveal different expressions , and while one yak ? a may wear a neatly trimmed mustache and Vandyke ( fig. 29 ) , another is clean shaven . Likewise , their hair styles are varied and only some wear ornaments or dhotis of patterned cloth ( fig. 30 ) . The single female support , like her mistress above , is carefully coiffed , ornamented , and provided a patterned skirt , to emerge under our masters hand as an altogether charmingand heretofore neglectedsculpture in miniature ( fig. 31 ) . <p> Fig. 32 <p> Returning to strut 6 , where this photographic odyssey began , we glimpse the pleasure the carving of these struts must have given the Ukubaha ? master . Although the salabhajikas are semidivine , they are not bona fide deities who must be represented in accordance with exact rules . For the Nepalese salabhajikas , only the compositionmaiden , tree , dwarf , and rockswas ordained . For the rest , nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dwarf of strut 6 , then , will not be plain . He will have a wide belt over which hangs the tail of his dhoti , and from the belt will dangle a large pouch with an ornamental clasp ( fig. 32 ) . It simply does not matter that these details will be almost invisible on the side of the strutand before Neils photographs , they likely were . One senses in them an urge for perfection but also , perhaps , a reluctance to complete the commission . The detailed ornamentation of the struts must have been artistically satisfying but also the more belts , ducks , fruits , and peacock feathers , the more enduring the spell of artistic freedom the carving of them allowed . <p> The five struts are not the only old wood carvings within the Ukubaha ? courtyard . There is also a galaxy of exquisite reliefs to be found in the window framing and console cornices . Stylistically , they are a Ku ? a ? a and Gupta legacy from centuries past but carved by Nepalese hands and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are , however , little noted . The public ignores them , they have escaped scholarly attention , and their age is unknown . I did test one of them , resulting in a radiocarbon date of 10301240 . Since these dates overlap the reign of King Rudravarma II ( 11671174 ) , they suggest , as tradition affirms , that he indeed may have restored the monastery . Perhaps it followed an earthquake or some other calamity such as those the chronicles and diaries report for the Kathmandu Valley with such regularity . It is to be hoped that before the next one that might destroy themperhaps a lurking earthquake as the tectonic plates grind beneath the Himalayassomeone will undertake an all-encompassing photographic and art-historical documentation of them .

Below the central figure there is a gold-lettered inscription that reads " Homage to mthong ba don ldan " ( mthong ba don ldan la na mo ) .

" <p> This discovery made clear the reason why this painting was called mthong ba don ldan and why the sDe-dge xylograph was called " Deity Yoga of Majusri " even though the main deity is not Majusri but Sakyamuni . <p> On the occasion of the International Conference " Contribution of Tibetan Culture to Global Understanding : Progress and Prospects " held in New Delhi in 2009 , I read a paper entitled " What is mThong ba don ldan ? " and made clear this fact . However , owing to time constraints , I could not deal with it from a broader perspective . <p> In this paper , I will discuss the significance of the discovery of the tradition of thangka based on the Majusrimulakalpa for considering the origins of thangka , the most popular genre of Tibetan art , and the historical and stylistic development of Tibetan paintings . <p> The pa ? as of the Majusrimulakalpa were already studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first painted scroll reconstructed by Lalou8Lalou 1930 , Planche I is somewhat different from that of mThong ba don ldan since she did not know any example of a modern Tibetan thangka depicting the first painted scroll of the Majusrimulakalpa . <p> From a stylistic viewpoint , the aforementioned three examples are all modern executions . However , an old example which has the combination of the same attendant figures , made during the 13th to 14th ceturies is also found . This is a painting which was once brought to the Hahn Cultural Foundation by an art dealer . This thangka depicts Sakyamuni in the **26;82;TOOLONG in the centre flanked by two attendants Majusri and Maitreya , while the rest of the canvas is divided into eight registers depicting the afore mentioned series of attendant deities . <p> However , in this thangka , the lotus stem supporting the lotus seat of the main deity and the two naga kings , Nanda and Upananda are omitted . <p> On the other hand , Prof. David P. Jackson found another example of the same iconography in a auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art NY Sept 21 , 1995 , No.77 . This thangka depicts Sakyamuni in the **27;110;TOOLONG in the centre flanked by two attendants Majusri and Maitreya , while the rest of the canvas is divided into nine registers . And aforementioned series of attendant deities are arranged in eight regesters except for the bottom . This thangka also omits , the lotus stem supporting the lotus seat of the main deity . However , two naga kings , Nanda and Upananda are depicted on both sides of the throne of the main deity . <p> Generally speaking , Tibetan thangka developed from the geometric structure stressing the front view to the natural arrangement of a bird's-eye view . The difference of the aforementioned three modern and two old thangkas of the mThong ba don ldan is a good example of such a stylistic transition of Tibetan thangka paintings . <p> However , the arrangement in which the main deity sits on a central lotus seat and attendants sit on small lotus seats branching off from the stem of the main deity 's lotus is a traditional design of Buddhist icons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miracle at Sravasti , the Buddha preaching in an assembly , and Amitabha Buddha in the Pure Land . Moreover , this design is clearly prescribed in the Majusrimulakalpa . <p> Therefore , old examples of the mThong ba don ldan intentionally omitted such multi-lotus structures of the mThong ba don ldan and applied the standard structure of the old Tibetan thangka to the mThong ba don ldan . Modern examples , on the other hand , restored the traditional multi-lotus structure from the Majusrimulakalpa . <p> This fact suggests that the origins of the thangka may lie in the Indian pa ? a , although Tibetans encountered the painted scroll for the first time in the Hexi Corridor when it was under the control of the ancient empire of Tibet ( Tubo/Tufan ) and studied it under Chinese painters . If Tibetans studied pa ? a directly from India , they should adopt the Tibetan translation " ras bris/ras ris " frequently used for translating the Indian term pa ? a in Buddhist scriptures such as the Majusrimulakalpa . <p> The Indian Buddhist pa ? a is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thangka , the most popular genre of Tibetan Buddhist art . However , we do not know any example of an Indian Buddhist pa ? a since Buddhism disappeared almost completely from Indian soil in the thirteenth century . <p> Moreover , before this painting , there had not yet been discovered a Tibetan thangka that has a composition completely coinciding with the description of a pa ? a prescribed in a scripture of Indian origin . <p> The discovery of mThong ba don ldan in the collection of the Hahn Cultural Foundation and the successive discoveries of old examples are important not only for the study of Tibetan Buddhist iconography but also for considering the lost Indian pa ? a , the matrix of Buddhist painted scrolls transmitted to all Buddhist countries in Asia . <p> 2 .

Almost every painting and applique in this exhibition includes one or more representations of monks , known as lamas , and mystics .

In no other society did every family so willingly and proudly send a son or a daughter to take the monastic vow .

@@79925610 @1425610/ <p> It is not often that an implement of warfare evolves into an item of jewelry . But that is precisely what happened with Chinese archers rings . <p> From ancient times , archery in Asia was well developed for warfare , hunting , and sport . Archery implements have been unearthed in Chinese tombs going back at least 4000 years . The Mongolian warriors who conquered China in 1271 to establish the Yuan dynasty owed much of their success to their skill in shooting arrows from horseback . Their implements , techniques , and tactics allowed them to shoot their targets from galloping horses and then twist around in the saddle for a parting backward shot after passing . The Manchu clan that conquered China 400 years later to establish Chinas final dynasty , the Qing , was equally skilled with bow and arrow . Their prowess with archeryagain , especially from horsebackallowed a relatively small band of Manchus to conquer all of China and rule it for over 250 years . <p> A number of technological developments contributed to the success of archery in north-eastern China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she in ancient China ( modern term banzhi ) . The archers ring is used on the thumb of the stronger hand , the one that pulls the bowstring . In addition to protecting the thumb , the ring provides a precise release action for the bowstring . The sidebar explains how these thumb rings were actually used . <p> Earliest known archers ring <p> An early form of archers thumb ring was found in the tomb of Fu Hao , the powerful consort of the fourth king of the Shang dynasty ( 1250 B.C. ) . Like other very early archers rings , it had a slot cut into it to engage the bowstring . Other early rings , from roughly the Zhou dynasty period ( about 1000 B.C. ) , had a small tooth projecting from the side . Archaeologists speculate that this helped pull the bowstring across the trigger mechanism of a crossbow , but that it later degenerated into a traditional embellishment . Some early archers rings , including Fu Haos , have one or more small suspension holes to allow the ring to be tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also used for hunting game . Upcoming bow-and-arrow hunts were mentioned in Chinese " oracle bone " inscriptions dating back 3,500 years . From its beginnings in warfare and hunting , archery soon became a sport , and later , a skill that any cultured Chinese gentleman was expected to master . Up through the end of the Ming Dynasty ( 13681644 ) archery remained one of the standard examination tests for civil service . <p> Early agate archers rings <p> As the Qing dynasty declined in the late 1800s and China faced attack from modern foreign powers , archery became less relevant as a military skill . Chinese scholar-gentlemen soon dispensed with the difficult business of actually mastering archery and simply wore an archers ring on their thumb to imply a manly skill they did not truly possess . Many Chinese portraits painted in the 18th and 19th centuries depict high officials and well-off merchantswho clearly spent no time on horseback chasing down targetsproudly wearing their archers rings . From its practical origins four millennia earlier , the archers ring had evolved into a fashionable adornment , a status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rings <p> Its surprising that an item as small and plain as a cylindrical thumb ring can provide so much opportunity for artistry . Much of the enjoyment of these rings comes from the materials they are made of . The earliest archers rings were usually made of horn , jade , or ivory . But as archers rings became more ornamental and less practical , the materials that could be used expanded greatly . In this way they are very similar to Chinese snuff bottles , and many of the same materials were used . <p> Iron and silver and enamel rings <p> The archers ring must be reasonably hard and durable . To a Westerner the obvious choice of material would be metal , but surprisingly few metal rings are known . Perhaps forming a ring from bronze or silver was simply not challenging enough for the Chinese artisan . <p> Archers rings in various hardstones are the most common . Of course the stone that holds the place of honor in China is jade . Nephrite jade is in fact a very practical choice as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lovely as well . As we have seen , the oldest known archers ring was made of this precious material . By the Qing dynasty , archers rings had mostly become personal adornments rather than utilitarian accessories for archery , and many of them were now made from the other type of true jade , jadeite . Jadeite , which was not used in China in significant amounts until the late 1700s , comes in a more exciting color palette than its sister jade , nephrite . Nephrites subtle colors , and jadeites more brilliant hues , along with the swirls and patches of contrasting color often seen in jade , make even an undecorated thumb ring a thing of beauty . <p> Although many thumb rings are left undecorated to show off the material , others have a design or inscription incised into the rings cylindrical surface or carved in low relief . Agate is another popular material for thumb rings , and the artist often takes advantage of that material to carve cameo style scenes through contrasting layers of color . <p> Mughal jade archers rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tabbed form , rather than the cylindrical Manchu style . Many of these are nephrite jade , and Indias Mughal rulers had them decorated with elaborate inlays of gold and precious stones . <p> Glass can be used for thumb rings , either overlay carved , as in a snuff bottle , or simply imitating another material such as jade . The famous snuff bottle collector Emily Byrne Curtis had a clear glass ring painted on the inside with butterflies and flowers to match one of her inside-painted snuff bottles . The pair is illustrated in Bob C. Stevens The Collectors Book of Snuff Bottles . The inside of her ring is lined with silver to protect the painting . <p> Peking glass rings <p> It is interesting that early rings that show signs of usage and burial are often thinner walled and carefully shaped on the inside instead of being precisely cylindrical , as if custom fitted to the archers thumb . Some early rings are also carved with designs on the inside , possibly to increase the archers grip on the ring . <p> One issue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " These rings usually have one end chamfered and the other concave ( dished in ) . Logically one might think that the concave end should go against the bowstring to provide the sharpest release action . But Stephen Markbreiter in his 1975 Arts of Asia article argues for just the opposite , since placing the concave end toward the thumbnail provides more freedom of movement for the thumb . Even paintings showing archers rings being worn are of little help in resolving this question , since few of the subjects ever actually used the rings in archery . Most rings with scenes or inscriptions on them support Markbreiters view , if we assume the scene is to be viewed by the wearer , not by others . <p> A Famous Set of Rings <p> Even more impressive than a well-carved single ring are sets of rings . Several rings of similar or complementary types , in a fancy case , made the perfect gift for a friend ( or bribe for an official ) . The cases holding sets of archers rings are often as impressive as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings and case <p> A famous set of archers rings was auctioned in April 2007 at Sothebys Hong Kong . Lot 602 , " Extraordinary Group of Seven Jade Imperial Archers Rings , " along with its original fitted cinnabar box and cover , former property of the Qianlong emperor ( and probably stolen from the Summer Palace ) , went to an Asian collector for the princely sum of US$6.1 million . Qianlong , perhaps the most well-known emperor , was a major patron of Chinese arts . He also strongly promoted the preservation of traditional Manchu culture and heritage , of which archery and archers rings were key elements . It is not surprising that the famous engraving of Qianlong which is the frontispiece to Sir George Stauntons account of Lord Macartneys embassy to China shows archers rings conspicuously displayed on both of Qianlongs thumbs . <p> The seven Qianlong rings , identical in size and shape , are of white jade , light and dark green jade , " red skin " green jade , and archaic Han jade . The rings are incised with scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own calligraphy .

The inside of the box is incised with two additional Qianlong poems , including " Song of the Jade Archers Rings . " The base has a four-character Qianlong reign mark . Each ring is kept in a yellow silk liner within separate compartments to prevent damage . The Imperial workshops devoted extraordinary care to the design and workmanship of these masterpiece rings and their container . <p> Archers Rings as Jewelry <p> Nephrite ring <p> Thumb ring <p> Chinese thumb rings need not reside passively on a collectors shelfthey can be worn as attractive ( and durable ) items of jewelry .

A thumb ring can also make a " conversation piece " pendant , worn on a precious metal chain with the most attractive side facing outward . A Mughal-style ring inlaid with gold and gems offers additional opportunities for incorporation into jewelry designs . <p> Decorative Uses <p> Chinese objects incorporating thumb rings <p> With the modernization of China in the 1920s , thumb rings became useless even for status purposes , and great quantities became available for other decorative uses . Most of these rings are made of low-quality jade or pseudojade , and are still being made today . They appear on all sorts of made-in-China objects where a small cylindrical decoration is needed . These include miniature flowerpots , handles for Chinese charcoal-heated irons , opium lamp barrels and opium pipe dampers , parts of walking sticks , scroll ends , napkin rings , snuff bottles , saltshakers , toothpick holders , and even as mouthpieces for Chinese musical instruments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Collector <p> Collecting Chinese thumb rings shares many similarities and advantages with collecting snuff bottles . Several dozen rings can be housed in a single small padded box . The rings are less fragile than snuff bottles , less expensive , and are available in the same broad variety of materials and artistic motifs . Like so many Chinese decorative arts , top-quality archers rings were once easy to find at very low cost . But the better examples sought by collectors todayinteresting rings of top-quality material , with good carving , signs of use , and no damagehave become scarce and costly . The beginning collector should become acquainted with the limited literature on the subject and see as many collections as possible before making any serious purchases . An exceptionally fine collection of more than 500 thumb rings is housed in the Grayson Archery Collection at the University of Missouri Museum of Anthropology . <p> Whether you wear your archers rings , collect them , or merely admire them in a museum , you are honoring a humble object that contributed to the conquest of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arrow is attached to the bowstring using a v-grooved " nock , " the string and arrow are pulled back by three fingers , and the arrow is released .

The other style is a lighter weight ring with a rigid tab or tongue that fits over and protects the pad of the thumb .

Also shown is an example of the tabbed ring , which sometimes has an oval hole so the ring can be turned 90 degrees after putting it on to lock it to the correct orientation .

Structurally , the ancient pit dwellings rested on a single row of pillars down the center that were loosely embedded into the earth , creating a kind of a hinge joint to provide flexibility and stability during an earthquake .

( fig. 10-11 , above ) <p> If the buttress represented for gothic architecture the aesthetic outcome of a structural intention , enabling the walls to have larger punctures , then the timber bracket could be thought of as the Japanese equivalent , enabling the roof eaves to stretch beyond the vertical columns . But the aesthetic outcome of the bracket also broke down the visual scale of the building , it source stemming from a genetically functional intention , unlike the icons and sculptures on the surfaces of stone buildings of the West and India . The entire system was an ingenious craft in pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus providing a looser connection to behave as a shock absorber during an earthquake . The bracket represented the perfect blurring of the lines that separated function , structure and ornament ( figs. 12-16 , above ) . <p> The significance of Japan 's wooden traditions is aggravated in that there were no architects in traditional Japan , shokunin ( craftsmen ) being the form givers of the Japanese vernacular 5 ( fig. 17 , left ) , much of the character evolving as pragmatic responses to problems . For instance azekura-zukuri or storage chambers made of triangular shaped logs evolved a stacked aesthetic ( similar to the log cabins of the West ) that came from the natural rhythms of the regional wood . During the moist summer season the wooden members expanded sealing the gap between the stacked logs and protecting the inside from moisture . During the dry winter season the wood shrunk creating a gap between the stacks and letting outside air in ( fig. 18 , below ) . The aesthetic of Japan 's castles amalgamating timber with plaster and tile emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , below ) . In some jokamachi ( castle towns ) such as Odawara , the pragmatism of the castle spread through the townscape , houses often plastering their lower levels if not their entire surfaces in white . The yuka or raised floor emerged to keep the wood away from the moist earth , and allow the breezes to flow around it to keep it healthy ; and the vertical interior of the traditional minka , evolved from the need for the smoke from the hearth to rise to the underside of the thatched roof , and keep it free from pests before escaping from the roof vent ( fig. 21 , below ) . <p> The lightness of a chopstick is peculiar to Japan and could be compared to the lightness of the shoji screen . There are chopsticks in other cultures , but they are heavier , made of ivory , silver or other metal ; there are sliding doors in many cultures , but the ability to slide a door with the tip of one 's finger is unique to Japan . The evolution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as room dividers with the addition of thick opaque paper . Gradually this paper began to get increasingly translucent and evolved into the light shoji with washi ( rice paper ) stretched across a grid of wooden pieces , evolving the latticed Japanese aesthetic ( fig. 22-23 , below ) . <p> But perhaps the most sublime notion to the culture of wood was in the subtle perceptions of its sounds , smells and sights . The practical yet elegant uguisu-bari , the squeaking floors of the castles was an ingenious security alarm to protect the feudal lord from intruders , and the soft vibrations and smells of fresh tatami was part of a cultural rhythm . The architecture of the tea hut 6 added a metaphorical dimension in putting a premium on the rusticity and the beauty of the knots in the wood , materials chosen scrupulously on a discriminating aesthetic sensibility . Such an approach probably took its origins from the aesthetics of modest timber huts , evolving unique standards that allowed natural characteristics such as bark and crude surfaces to be used ( figs. 24-25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed in the tea rooms came from a variety of trees , including Japanese cedar , red pine , chestnut and bamboo , due to which a process of coloring was employed - wherein all of the wood sections of the building were coated with a pigment mixed from a red cosmetic resin called ni and soot - so that the wood became nearly black while simultaneously the knots and other natural features in the wood remained visible . <p> The contrast between Japan 's culture of wood and the timber traditions of the West could be summed up in the Japanese notion of Setsuna , meaning transience . It imparted to wood the same materiality of life and death as at the heart of human consciousness , translating in the Japanese resistance to nails , thereby not hurting wood or wooden components . On another plane the notion manifested the inevitable tolerance at the wooden susceptibility to fire , moisture and harsh weather . It was this philosophical and pragmatic resultant that brought forth a distinctly Japanese attitude to wood and its use . <p> Traditional wooden Japanese cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthquakes but after every death , new cities and buildings were reborn . For instance in the Edo period , due to numerous fires through out the city , the Shogun government mandated Edoites to have clay tiles on their roof . But the people in response put clay tiles only where they could be seen , leaving their cheaply built townhouses to be destroyed in the next fire . There was a famous phrase - urban fire and street fights are flowers of Edo - embodying the subconscious propensity towards transience and rebuilding . To rebuild a house every three to five years after being destroyed by a fire was as natural as replacing the fragile washi paper in the shoji , a cyclic renewal like that of the revered Ise shrine . <p> Shikinen Sengu , the rebuilding of the Ise shrine every twenty years 7 would never have been had Japanese architecture been made of stone . It is the rituals of Ise , marking more than thirty steps in its cyclic construction process - and keeping alive a thirteen hundred year old tradition - that differentiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The first group of rituals mark activities that disturb the natural environment , such as tree harvesting and ground breaking . True to the spirit of ancient Shinto beliefs , they intend to appease the kami gami ( deities ) for the lives that are being taken as part of the process . The apologetic enactments protect the workers from harm and heavenly recrimination . <p> Another group of rituals celebrates that commencement of particular phases of the wood construction process . An example is the Kozukuri hajime-sai ( festival marking the beginning of making children ) , held before the loggers harvest the forest trees , including prayers for the worker 's safety . This group of rituals also marks the inception of new phases of work and serves as a periodic reminder of the sacredness of the entire endeavor . A third group of rituals is held after the installment of particular building elements . An example is the Shin no mihashira hoken , which celebrates the installation of the sacred heart pillar beneath the main sanctuary . This pillar has no aesthetic or structural function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the building . But it represents in symbolic form a kind of an axis mundi connecting heaven and earth . The ceremony demonstrates the reverence for the symbolic values that are associated with distinct building elements . <p> The fourth group of rituals celebrates the entire construction process as a sacred activity . The Oshiroi ishi mochi-sai ( White Stone Placement Festival ) , involves each of the hundreds of thousands of participants , placing a river washed pebble on the ground within the inner sanctum . The final group of rituals celebrate those aspects of wood construction that the early Japanese believed to be important . They reveal among other things the major perceptual difference between Japanese and Western understandings of nature - the Shinto attitude of humility and gratitude to the world of energy and matter , and the acknowledged interdependence of man and nature . Through renewal and rebuilding the transience of timber as a building material becomes at Ise its greatest celebration . <p> In the changes that Japan saw during the past century , there were at least two historic circumstances that threatened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Meiji Restoration 8 in 1868 , when a modern government implied a new constitutional monarchy as a paradigm shift from the past . In an attempt to strengthen authentic cultural roots and enhance the symbolic presence of the emperor as a descendent of the kami , the new government deprived the existing custom of integrated Shinto-Buddhist places and ordered the removal of everything Buddhist from Shinto shrines , eventually aggravating a national revolution to raze Buddhist temples . Several wooden temples were brought down as a result and many castles destroyed and replaced as government offices or military posts . The second was during World War Two , when entire cities were destroyed , and numerous wooden structures were razed to the ground to slow down the spread of fire . <p> With the post-war years seeing the wide adoption of American lifestyles by the Japanese , new building methods replaced earlier wooden traditions in response to safety concerns . Such changes represent for contemporary Japan - when the idea of razing an entire forest for building is both ethically and ecologically questionable - a shift of dialogues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rituals of Ise , beckons a selective assessment of construction methods , where traditional wooden components of demolished buildings can resurrect themselves through reuse in their modern counterparts , and is founded on the conviction that Modern build-and-scrap practices pose a global threat to the environment . Another attitude , seeking to amalgamate nostalgia and pragmatism , re-evaluates the physicality of the modern Japanese wooden structure : the wooden ground sill is placed on top of a concrete foundation , connections are made using nails and bolts , the traditional joinery techniques of notching and cutting are renounced , and the structural distribution relies more on the rigidity of its outer faces than a single pillar at its core . ( fig. 29 , above ; figs 30-33 , below ) <p> Yet another method , rejecting the literal and intellectualizing not so much the tangibility of its past products but more the processes that made it , argues that contemporary techniques such as exposed concrete - a popular tendency in Post-Modern Japan - relies heavily on the craftsmanship of today 's construction workers , and thus keeps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then with modern construction workers using power tools for most activity , there is - for those that treasure Japan 's authentic intentions - the apparent danger that modern concerns with labor efficiency and cost effectiveness could undermine that contemplative and focused atmosphere integral to the refined aesthetic of the past . <p> Today even at Ise , where the culture of wood is practiced with the same rigor on the ancient holy ground , and where even the minutest dent made by an object falling onto the soft wood of the shrine proper is symbolically a defilement necessitating the piece of wood to be replaced , the shrine has opted to have the suyane - the traditional temporary shed over the construction site - made of prefabricated modern materials for better protection of both the building and the workers during its disassembly . <p> What thus remains most noticeable in this dialogue is the ever-dwindling voice of Japan 's culture of wood , not because there is no single culprit this culture can point to and accuse , but because the culture itself is dying . For is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hammers joining timber beams ; and only natural that the electric drill dominates a steel-driven urban frequency ? With every rare and remnant traditional townhouse razed to the ground , does not Japan express a helplessness , an involuntary desperation to keep alive its modernity , at the cost of renouncing its past ? The culture of wood is nostalgia , a slice frozen in Japanese myth . The culture of wood is dead . <p> But in observing today 's Japan , it occurs that buildings are designed in the expectation not that they will stand the test of time , but that they will be torn down sooner rather than later and replaced by something more appropriate to the economic and technological demands of the future . The annual degree of change within the densely built urban zones is about 30% , encompassing fatade improvements to entire new structures . In Tokyo more than a hundred thousand square feet of building is demolished every day , more that six times that number constructed on a daily basis 9 . On its scarce and notoriously expensive land the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - obscure and prominent , dilapidated and fresh - that challenge any simple understanding about the normal course of aging , necessitating a substantial reinterpretation of the meaning of durability and ephemerality in architecture . This peculiar outlook to apprehending the city as a series of fleeting events rather than an object of substance echoes the age-old profundity of transience , change and renewal . In Tokyo , which so constantly seems under construction - urban skylines crowded with forests of cranes - the ghost of its ancient culture of wood still possesses the ' brand new city ' built everyday ( fig. 34 , above - fig. 35 , below ) . <p> And so like the ' Angelus Novus ' in Paul Klee 's painting , Japan seems like the angel of its own history looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating . His eyes are staring , his mouth is open , his wings are spread . His face is turned towards the past where he sees a deep-rooted culture . He perceives a chain of events , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at his feet . The angel would like to stay , awaken the dead , keep alive what is being wrecked . But a storm is blowing from Paradise ; it has caught in his wings with such violence that he can no longer close them . It irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned , while the pile of debris before him grows skyward . The storm is Japan 's progress . <p> 1 It is possible that the existence of Japanese architecture in which pillars are lined up in a single row in the center of the building is related to the significance of the ' yorishiro ' . The ' yoroshiro ' also eventually became the original shape of the Shinto shrine . The shin no mihashira ( esteemed pillar of the heart ) under the center of the floor of the main temple at Ise is significant because it is regarded as a ' yorishiro ' in which the Gods reside . back <p> 2 The Yayoi era ( 200 B.C. - A.D.250 ) brought with it wet rice cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn prompted advances in building techniques and the development of the second type of prehistoric building that was elevated on posts . The best example of a Yayoi community is Toro in Shizuoka Prefecture , where one can see the Yayoi pit dwelling and elevated storehouse in conjectural reconstruction . back <p> 3 The Shoin style of residential architecture gradually developed during the Muromachi period ( 1338-1573 ) out of the Shinden style . Early Shoin style features were found particularly in the ' kaisho ' hall of Shinden complexes and the abbot 's quarters ( hojo ) of Zen monasteries . The earliest extant example of this style is the Dojinsai room of the Hall of the Eastern Quest ( Togudo ) in Yoshimasa 's Silver Pavilion complex in Kyoto . The word ' sukiya ' literally means abode of refinement and the most successful examples of the Sukiya style combine the elegance of the formal Shoin style with the relaxed atmosphere and artistic idiosyncrasies appropriate to a man of taste . Each sukiya structure though unique , shares with all others certain general characteristics of understatement and irregularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style is the Manshuin , a monzeki temple built for an abbot in north Kyoto . back <p> 4Though the bracket complexes used in the Japanese , Great Buddha and Zen styles are all different in configuration , that of the Japanese style is the most basic and its general characteristics apply to the other two as well . The development of the three-stepped bracket is also a subject of elaborate study beyond the scope of this essay . back <p> 5The craftsmen who built the temples and shrines of Japan 's pre-modern era were grouped into a number of distinct specialties including carpenters , plasterers , stone masons and sawyers . Illustrations on folding screens , picture scrolls and woodblock prints provide glimpses into their activities , some of the most telling being those by Kuwakata Keisei ( 1764-1824 ) , called Shokunin zukushi e ( Pictures of Tradesmen ) . Very few tools used by the carpenters remain from the Edo period , but compilations such as the Wakan sansai zu e ( Sino-Japanese Illustrated Encyclopedia ) and illustrations made by the Nagasaki painter Kawahara Keiga ( 1786 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 6The Tea Ceremony originated as a Zen technique of meditation and spiritual training involving a host preparing tea for a guest . The entire act traditionally occurred in Tea Hut that was approached through a Tea Garden designed to abet the feel of a forest . The ' Soan ' ( literally grass cottage ) Tea Hut in Kyoto is an example of a ' Soan ' style ' Chasitsu ' or space in which the traditional ' Cha-no-yu ' or Tea Ceremony was held . Typically the Hut was designed as a remote rustic cottage with a Tea Room for the ritual proper and an Ante-room for preparations and storage . back <p> 7 The Ise shrine buildings are rebuilt on a contiguous lot every twenty years in order to ensure ritual purity to Ameterasu , the goddess of the Sun . The rebuilding process , beginning with the cutting of special limber far in the mountains , takes years to accomplish and is enormously costly . Ise therefore is the only shrine today that is regularly built , though the practice was common at many shrine sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokugawa Era in Japan found an end in the Meiji Restoration . The emperor Meiji was moved from Kyoto to Tokyo , which became the new capital . The new government aimed to make Japan a democratic state with equality among all its people . The boundaries between the social classes of Tokugawa Japan were gradually broken down . In order to transform the agrarian economy of Tokugawa era into a developed industrial one , many Japanese scholars were sent abroad to study Western science and languages , while foreign experts taught in Japan . back

The colonial art-school 's emphasis on perspective and realism endowed the idealised , traditional imagery with more tangible and sensual presence . This combined with the newly introduced photography and the proscenium theatre in the usage of eclectic yet powerful iconic and narrative formations enabled a depiction that heightened corporeality and individuality .

In a sense ' classical ' Hindu mythology was revived , romanticised and circulated all over the country . This set in motion a process of reconfiguration of the culturally heterogeneous Indian space into a more homogeneous Hindu space based on a commonly shared new iconic visuality .

He received a prize in an exhibition organized by the Society for the Promotion of Industrial Art in 1879 . From 1880 to 1884 he did commissions in Allahabad and Lahore . Bamapada Banerjees popularity rests on his paintings illustrating Hindu mythology . He was deeply influenced by the genres of European history painting .

In recognition of his talent , the British government conferred the title of Rao Bahadur upon him in 1927 . He was accomplished in oils , watercolours and pencil drawings , and nearly 50,000 works have been credited to him , excluding drawings and sketches . A number of Dhurandhars works were reproduced for mass circulation at Ravi Varmas presses . Unlike Ravi Varma , his senior contemporary , Dhurandhar was a trained academic realist . <p> C.

Though the profession was looked down upon in his extended aristocratic family , Ravi Varma received encouragement from his maternal uncle in his artistic pursuit .

@@79925624 @1425624/ <p> The powerful imagery of the Himalayan mask tradition is drawn from the diverse traditions of shamanism , village myths and the classical traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism . In this essay the author probes the ' greater context ' of Himalayan masks , finding in them stylistic and thematic affinities with cultures as widespread as those of Eurasia and the Americas , and covering a period extending from the upper Paleolithic era to the present . <p> Surviving in isolated valleys , and hemmed in by the world 's tallest mountains , the peoples of the Himalayas maintain a subsistence economy of pastoralism and horticulture . They identify with the syncretic belief systems known to us as animism , Hinduism and Buddhism , and share a common love of the masquerade1 . The broad dispersal throughout the Himalayan region and beyond of a masking tradition suggests that it has ancient roots . <p> For the purposes of this article , Himalayan masks will be divided into three main categories . Masks which depict deities , heroes , and comic characters from the ' high culture ' of Buddhism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 and include monastery and temple masks which are worn by Buddhists and Hindus in dance ceremonies . Many Newari masks ( 4 ) from the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal portray Hindu gods and goddesses or subjects from epic dramas such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. 3 Classical Buddhist masks often depict figures from the great Buddhist pantheon , including ferocious defenders of the faith such as Mahakala ( 3 ) . Some of the Buddhist masks introduced here were used in the mysterious dance known in Tibet as Cham , in which protector deities are invoked and negative forces are dispersed . <p> ' Village ' masks often incorporate elements from the classical Hindu and Buddhist traditions , but their primary defining characteristics derive from local village myths . Lakhe masks , popular among the Hindus of the Kathmandu Valley , may be considered to belong to this category . Lakhe is a local demon most commonly depicted with characteristically Gorgon-like features ( 7 ) reminiscent of the Gorgon face familiar in Mediterranean sculpture and painting traditions ( 6 ) . Lakhe 's appearance , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the classical Hindu god , Indra . Readers will note that Indra ( 4 ) and Lakhe bear similar markings on their foreheads . Village Buddhist masks , largely created by the rural ethnic Monpa and Sherdukpen peoples of Arunachal Pradesh in northeast India and eastern Bhutan , were often used in morality dramas , such as the Ache Lhamo , which will be described in greater detail below . <p> Primarily from the tribal areas of Nepal , another style of mask , the ' Primitive-shamanic ' , may have been used by sorcerers for purposes of healing , oracle augury and life crisis initiations ( 8 ) . Our ignorance is great with respect to these tribal masks . One reason for this lack of knowledge is the very remoteness of their geographic origin . While this has favoured their survival , it has also inhibited our knowledge of the people who created them and the cultural traditions requiring their use . I would suggest that these masks are the expression of an ancient pan-Asian mask culture which was still in evidence at the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Indonesian islanders such as the Batak of Sumatra ( 9 ) and the Atoni of Timor , as well as among the tribal people of India , the shamans of Siberia ( 14 ) and others . <p> The making and use of masks , born of shamanism , extended into Himalayan village folk traditions and eventually became absorbed into the higher classical traditions , invigorating them and giving them new meaning . In Asia , masks were probably first used in a shamanic context , and for this reason , my discussion of Himalayan masks begins with the primitive-shamanic . <p> At best , specific ethnic attributions of primitive-shamanic masks are speculative . The reasons for this uncertainty include similarity of function and iconography and the aforementioned isolation of these peoples from Western observers . However , it is clear that most Himalayan shamanic style masks were created in Nepal . The Magar and Gurung tribes , living at an altitude of 7,000 feet in the middle hills of the Himalayas , have produced hardwood masks which tend toward a glossy , high patina arising from exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the middle hills include the Sherpa , Bhotya , Tamang and Rai , some of whose masks will be mentioned below . <p> Masks of the lowland Tharu people , living near the Indian border , are often of a softer wood , pigmented with polychrome or white kaolin clay . Hardwood examples also exist . <p> Some masks from the Tharu tribe are among the most primitive examples to have come to light , while those of the Rajbansi ( village dwellers in the Tharu ) display iconography more directly derived from Hindu models . The latter are examples of what I have termed village masks , to be discussed in greater detail below . An interesting illustration of the distinctions between primitive and village Tharu masks can be seen in plate 22 . <p> On first examination , these masks appear to defy categorisation . Each mask seems to be unique . But after viewing many , we begin to see that they fall into iconographic groups . Masks with fur attachments , creating a bearded , mustachioed character ( or characters ) , whose identity remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other masks , probably from the Middle Hills , do not now possess bearded attachments , but perhaps once did , and may therefore also belong to this group . <p> Another character , with a lumpy head and brutish facial features , also appears often ; we have dubbed this type ' Potato Head ' ( 12 ) . Markings on the forehead sometimes offer a means of classifying masks . One example ( 13 ) bears a prominent trident mark - an attribute of the Hindu god Shiva - and many masks with this mark have survived . However , in this context the trident does not necessarily imply a knowledge of Shaivite religious dogma , but may simply be an instance of a symbol borrowed in isolation from its original meaning . <p> Other masks display a solar disc above a crescent moon , but again the meaning of such a motif remains as yet unclear . The mask illustrated in plate 16 has a ring in his nose which is a common feature of the Tamang tribe , though we can not be certain that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rai are known to fashion house-protecting masks from tree fungus ( 17 ) , while another multi-ethnic character mask is created from felt and goat skin. 4 The red pigment around the mouth of plate 18 may well symbolise blood sacrifice , either animal or perhaps ( in former times ) human . <p> We may infer great age for these masks . Their black , shiny patina and their surfaces of multi-layered pigment all suggest an unspecified but undeniable antiquity . That they have survived for so long suggests they were greatly valued by the Himalayan societies that created and used them . Passed on as heirlooms from generation to generation , each use added sacred power . It is also clear that old masks were repaired rather than discarded ( 16 ) . <p> There can be little doubt that many of these masks are hundreds of years old . Precisely how they were used we can not say , but we may infer much by examining , albeit briefly , the principles of shamanism . <p> Shamanism is the term commonly used to describe the indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autochthonous Asian minorities , and the North and South American Indians . More of an animist world view than a religion , it is thought to have been brought to the New World from Siberia by reindeer hunters following their prey at the time of the last Ice Age , circa 15,000 BC . <p> The etymology of the word shaman is interesting . Long believed to be derived from the Siberian Tungus word saman ( itself thought to be native Altaic ) , it has recently been suggested that its etymology goes deeper still . It seems that the Siberians borrowed the term from the Chinese shamen , meaning ' wandering Buddhist monk ' , to give title to their own ancient religious practices . This linguistic relationship reflects the respect felt by the Siberians for the awe-inspiring Buddhist practices which they observed . As discussed in greater detail below , Buddhism also assimilated elements of shamanic practices . <p> Certain themes present themselves wherever shamanism is found . For example , the shaman is not the greatest warrior of the tribe , an office more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often begins his or her life as a sickly individual - either physically or mentally impaired . There comes a time when he or she must depart the community and live alone , 5 and it is during this isolation that the shaman calls upon nature spirits , such as animal totems , to be vehicles of self-healing . If unsuccessful , he or she is not heard from again . However , assuming a positive outcome , the individual returns to the community empowered by these spirits in strange and mysterious ways . As a result of this ' conversion experience ' , such an individual may live within the village , but is always perceived as socially distinct from others in the community . <p> And what role does a shaman play in his or her community ? Ancestor spirits hover nearby , monitoring adherence to local traditions and taboos . They require careful propitiation . Moreover , all of man 's ills ultimately derive from the spirit world . Malevolent spirits must be subdued . All of nature is alive with the supernatural . The shaman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other plane . Existentially , the individual who is ' the other ' within the earthly community more truly inhabits the world of the spirits . <p> Fertility and ' life crisis ' transitions are the basis of many animist concerns and rituals . These include birth , puberty , marriage , attaining a social rank ( status ) and death . At these moments of transition , an individual is in grave danger as he ' dies ' in terms of his former self and has not yet been reborn into his new identity . At these moments of vulnerability , it is the shaman who ushers the initiate 's soul across the uncertain gulf . Therefore , the shaman serves as a bridge between this world and the next , acting as a ' soul guide ' to ease these life passages . <p> In order to operate on this higher plane , the shaman must fully identify with the powers which he hopes to wield . Masks are one of the empowering mediums by which the shaman ' becomes ' the spirit which he invites to possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other tools which help bring about this transformation include ritual costume ( 20 ) , weapons , drums , and perhaps psychotropic substances , including fly-agaric mushroom ( amanita muscaria ) and hemp ( cannabis ) . 6 <p> The shaman functioned not only as priest of this other world , but as a practising physician whose knowledge of drugs extended to practical cures for physical ills . These organic medicaments might be administered during rituals involving mask use for demonic exorcisms. 7 Folk medicine entailed a great understanding of ethno-botanical pharmacology . This knowledge was preserved from generation to generation , and thus the office of shaman encompassed that of ecological conservator . <p> Central Asian shamanism was diffused on horseback . Early archaeological evidence suggests that shamanism permeated a bronze-using culture stretching from Tibet through Ordos , west China , and southern Siberia . Across this territory , two primary cultures existed , often in opposition- settled farmers and aggressive , nomadic herdsmen . Both held animistic beliefs , each using shamans to intercede in the spirit world for their own particular ends . <p> Icons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has come to be known as the ' animal style ' . Subjects depicted include the steppe tiger ( 15 ) leaping on the back of a deer , reflecting the theme of victor and victim . A lineage of shamanic barbarians must include the Scythians ( 6th to 4th century BC ) , the Huns ( 300-100 BC ) and later , the Mongols ( Genghis Khan , circa 1162-1227 , and his descendants ) . The settled peoples , frequently targeted by the aggressive horsemen , sought refuge in remote valleys where their descendants may still be found today . <p> Himalayan scholars generally believe that the origins of the Tibetan people lie in the nomadic , non-Chinese Ch'iang tribes who lived off animal husbandry many centuries before the Christian era in eastern Central Asia and in the far northwest border region of China. 8 It is highly likely that they participated in the Central Asian culture of shamanism and the migrations broadly described above . The physical evidence of this prehistoric ( pre-7th century AD ) shamanic culture can still be found in Tibet today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the sets of minhirs and tombs arranged in stone circles in the lake region on the southern fringes of the Changthang the northern portion of the Tibetan plateau ; and the ' animal style ' in the decoration of metal objects ( knives , stirrups , buckles , etc. ) practised at Derge and in Amdo in eastern Tibet , which is similar to that of the Ordos bronzes and the ' Scythian ' art of the steppes " ( 15 ) . 9 <p> Some of the cultural minorities of Nepal preserve an archaic Tibetan tongue . They are thought to have migrated from the central Tibetan plateau long ago . Certain scholars suggest that insight may be gained into the culture of pre-Buddhist Tibet by examining today 's Magar and Gurung tribes of Nepal. 10 It is my contention that the primitive-shamanic style masks of Nepal ( 14 , 21 ) , so similar to those of Siberia , are a continuation of a common type possibly used in Neolithic Tibet . <p> Shamanic traditions existed in India as well . These traditions are preserved among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stylistic conventions of their masks are most akin to those found on the Tarai , not unreasonably , given their relatively close geographic proximity . <p> The tribal minorities of India were pushed aside by the advances of the Aryans during the second millennium BC . Little is known about these Aryan tribes except that they entered India through Afghanistan and the Hindu Kush , speaking a proto-Indo-European language . They preserved an oral tradition of the Vedas ( which were to become the fundamental Hindu scriptures ) , extolling philosophical principles of karma ( the laws of cause and effect ) , caste , and the authority of the priestly class . By its very nature , Hinduism is syncretic , absorbing many indigenous belief systems , including the worship of nature spirits . One finds many elements of animism , and by extension the principles of shamanism , deeply imbedded in this ' high culture ' religion . <p> The other great Indian religious tradition to influence Himalayan masks is Buddhism . Biographical details of the Buddha ( ' The Awakened One ' ) , historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born a prince of the Shakya clan in Kapilavastu , near the present border of Nepal and India , he was appropriately named Siddhartha ( He whose aim is achieved ) Gautama , and lived from approximately 560-480 BC . Isolated within the walls of his father 's opulent palace , he was spared the knowledge of human suffering . In a series of excursions outside the palace during his twenties , he encountered the existential suffering which all must face : poverty , sickness , old age , and death . These encounters so moved him that he renounced his birthright and became an ascetic , joining yogis in the forest . After seven years of meditation and ascetic deprivation , he achieved Enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya . <p> After some initial hesitation , he decided to share his hard-earned insights and spent his remaining forty-five years teaching . The Buddha 's teachings are rooted in a compelling observation : despite all the efforts of human beings to find happiness and avoid pain , their lives continue to be filled with suffering and dissatisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognised that the causes of suffering lie within our very own minds : they are delusion , attachment , aversion , pride , and envy . The Buddha also realised that it is possible to free oneself permanently from suffering through a rigorous and well-structured training in ethics , meditation , and discriminating insight , which leads to a profound understanding of the way things really are , that is , enlightenment - a state of profound freedom and complete fulfilment . <p> The original Buddhist teachings were atheistic . However , it may be observed that it is human nature to yearn for a personalised saviour . As the tradition was passed from generation to generation , many buddhas and bodhisativas ( compassionate beings who assist sentient beings in their efforts for spiritual salvation ) came to form a vast Buddhist pantheon . <p> NOTES1 .

The Fifth Dalai Lama vowed to build a temple to the displaced spirits at the excavation site , but he died before he could fulfill his goal .

Similarly the present Dalai Lama is quick to point out that there is no reason to assume any contradiction between the Sixth 's lack of celibacy and his role as Dalai Lama . Yet even in the age before puritan values could undermine those in public office , the Sixth Dalai Lama was considered a threat by Tibet 's Mongol overlords .

Many Tibetans believe that simply seeing these paintings can open the mind to universal spiritual truths . Unlike much Tibetan art the images on the Lukhang walls transcend their origins .

The trail to Tashi Kabum leads up to the right , crests a ridge then descends to the valley floor of the Puyon Khola . The Tashi Kabum site is less than an hour 's walk above Yara , consisting of a half dozen caves dug into the ridge side about 50 m above the valley floor .

These same similarities also suggest that the two caves are closely related , lending truth to the legend that there were five or seven other cave temples with chortens in this area . The Luri cave temple appears to be more important than Tashi Kabum , perhaps the first of the cave temples built in this area . The interior of the Luri cave is more detailed , and the complex of associated caves nearby is considerably larger .

However , a closer look at all these " Pala-Newari " and " Pala-Tibetan " or Nepalo-Tibetan artistic traditions will naturally help identifying specific stylistic groups beyond a simple Pala pattern which I feel characterises in different degrees the great majority of " Himalayan " art works of that period . <p> When emphasising " more the Indian content " of the Cleveland Green Tara ( fig. 13 ; Weldon , fig.1 ) as David Weldon does with regard to some earlier Pala period elements in that painting , he clearly underestimates the distinctive Nepalese profile of this masterpiece datable on stylistic grounds to the third quarter of the 13th century . No comparable 13th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to some extent as a source of inspiration . <p> Fig. 2 <p> Fig. 3 <p> Fig. 4 <p> Fig. 5 <p> The only other - and in my opinion approximately contemporary - Newar paintings of a similar - though not of the same - individual style as the Cleveland Tara are the three Tathagatas in the Boston , Los Angeles and Philadelphia museums ( Weldon , fig.6 ) . These paintings find close parallels or rather reflections among the sixteen large mandala paintings in the Changma temple ( Lha khang byang ma ) at the Great Sutra Hall in Sakya executed after 1280 by no doubt Nepalese artists . These murals are in some sections originally preserved but so far are quite unknown . 1 They are in composition and stylistic details so closely related to the slightly later mandalas at Shalu that they can be with some probability attributed to the same atelier . As Weldon rightly suggests , there would be no need to construct for these Shalu paintings , as hitherto has been done , an art historical detour via the Yuan China art milieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas Weldon accepts the possible authorship by Aniko for the Cleveland Tara ( as Kossak and I have suggested some years ago ) , he rejects unconvincingly any further attribution to what might be called an " Aniko style " in the sense of an atelier tradition or a related group of some roughly contemporary or slightly later sculptures . <p> Weldons analysis of four images he borrowed from my book 3 leaves out eight more statues that were documented in my more detailed papers from 2006 to 2009. 4 Weldon seems to follow the motto " What is not known ( or recognised yet ) can not exist " when he declares them all briefly and without proper arguments as being " made in a revivalist style for Tibetan patronsof 18th century at the earliest " . But most of them in fact date to the 13th century such as for example the Newark ( fig. 1 ) and Lhasa ( figs. 5,6 ) Avalokiteshvaras or the two Vajrapani statuettes in the Philadelphia and Lhasa museums ( figs. 8 , 9 ) , all of a very distinctive style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as 18th century copies . 5 A similar Nepalese copper image of a bodhisattva Maitreya with gold and silver inlays preserved in the Potala Palace is another addition to the small " corpus " of the " Aniko style group " comparable with the Lhasa Avalokiteshvara in material , metal inlay ( though slightly less refined ) , design of the lotus throne and of its petals . ( fig. 7 ) 6 One may also note a Nepalese Vajrapani statue once in the Ford Collection , Baltimore , which indeed " does not conform to any regional convention that has yet been identified " 7 <p> Fig. 7 <p> Fig. 8 <p> Fig. 9 <p> Fig. 10 <p> With few exceptions Tibetan stylistic copies of earlier prototypes from Kashmir , Pala India or Nepal made in the 18th century can be recognised by a trained eye relatively easily . However , very refined metal inlays 8 ( figs. 1 , 8 , 9 ) reflect earlier contemporary Indian and Newari painting style textile patterns as seen in the Cleveland painted Tara and San Francisco Green Tara kesi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How Indian Pala style models were transformed into " Indo-Nepalese " as well as " Indo-Tibetan " statuary of a closely related stylistic physiognomy may be shown by two ca. mid-13th century bodhisattva images in the Beijing Capital and Palace Museums ( fig. 3 ) 10 <p> Fig. 11 <p> Fig. 12 <p> Fig. 13 <p> Fig. 14 <p> Weldon also misinterprets the San Francisco Green Tara Kesi ( fig. 12 ; Weldon , fig.15 11 , which in proportions and design is without any doubt clearly associated with the Cleveland Tara ( fig. 13 ) and other Nepalese paintings of that period , no matter if woven around " 1295 " or " 1315 " . Indeed this textile is the sole representative of the famous textile image production supervised by Aniko at the Yuan court . And the ornamental vocabulary as referred to by Weldon with regard to other 14th century kesi such as the Metropolitan Museum Vajrabhairava mandala does not change from one decade to the other , especially in fabric images which are often manufactured much later than their painted models : like for example the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tibet Museum ( fig.14 ) which is , in my opinion - in contrast with the usually suggested Xixia Tangut origin - a later woven reproduction of an early 13th century Tibetan painting . The kesi was probably made in the imperial Yuan dynasty ateliers in Hangzhou and sent to Tibet in the late 13th or early 14th century . 12 A production of the Acala kesi around 1300 would be supported by the following arguments : the floral ornament and the lan dza sript frieze on the original ( ! ) fabric border do not exist much before 1300 . The pearls stitched on the figures in the lower register ( only one is preserved ) indicate a Mongolian period origin . And some linguistic inconsistencies in the Tibetan inscription point out to a later non-Tibetan textile atelier . So what does it matter for our stylistic considerations in view of an " Aniko style " ( which no doubt did exist ! ) whether this kesi was made in the late 13th or earlier 14th century ? And how do Pala style forerunners such as the Potala Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sculptural style , which is based anyway , like so many other Himalayan statuary traditions , on earlier Pala prototypes ? <p> Fig. 15 <p> Fig. 16 <p> Fig. 17 <p> Fig. 18 <p> Unfortunately Ulrich von Schroeders " Buddhist Sculptures in Tibet " ( Hongkong 2001 ) does not include sufficiently later Nepalese and Tibetan statue traditions , and no images of a genre as reviewed here , of which , however , examples may still exist in Sakya monastery or in the Potala Palace collection . <p> Other attributions to Aniko or to his style such as the Maitreya painting in the Chicago Art Institute ( Weldon fig.7 ) or of the gilt silver **25;139;TOOLONG in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts ( Weldon fig.10 ) are rightly rejected by Weldon . A thorough analysis will easily identify both images as much later syncretistic replicas where floral ornaments and figural style ( painting ) or the design and technique of the gilt lotus petals ( statue ) alone rule out a Yuan dynasty date . And those misleading attributions and chronologies by John Huntington have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 <p> Fig. 19 <p> Further studies after my publications in 2007-2009 suggest , however , that the attribution of two very similar statues to the " Aniko style group " has to be reconsidered .

That was so long ago that it seems like a lifetime , but more like someone elses life than my own . I can barely remember NOT being on the road in Asia in my life . <p> Fig. 1 But after a few years of self imposed exile from the subcontinent , in part enforced by current political realities since 9/11 , I chose to return to India , a place I had not seen in 18 years . Yes , I had been to Pakistan , an inextricable component of the subcontinent , as India ( or Hindustan ) derives its name from the Indus River , which passes through the heart of present-day Pakistan , emptying into the Arabian Sea .

He reserved his few remarks to extolling the benign rule of the Pallava king in addition to the piety and bravery of the local populace . <p> Fig. 2 Kanchi , as it was known at the time , was also a Buddhist centre . It is believed that Bodhidharma , who went to China in the 6th century to spread Buddhism , is originally from there , and it is said that the Buddha himself visited this once great city .

The town can hardly be termed a tourist destination as I saw only one stray backpacker , sprawled on the lush grounds of the Kailasanathar Temple , and while one finds a cursory mention in travel guides , Kanchipuram remains a minor footnote to the attractions of Chennai ( formerly Madras ) and the more popular beach/temple site of Mahaballipuram . <p> Getting there was remarkably cheap and easy , a two hour ride on a local train from Chennai with none of the crowds one might expect .

I knew we must be close to our destination when , as the train slowed to a crawl , I spotted a huge temple standing alone in a field . Eventually our carriage heaved and jerked to sudden stop .

We declined their offers . <p> Dropping our belongings at the hotel , we started to walk in the direction of Kailasanathar Temple , the first stop on our art quest itinerary . Kanchipuram is not a large town ( approximately 155,000 people , small by Indian standards ) , but signs of the learning tradition that dominates the intellectual landscape are omnipresent in the form of clinics , hospitals , and many physicians with private practices .

Surrounded by lush green lawns featuring a huge stone Nandi ( the sacred bull often seen as Shivas mount ) to one side , the temple compound is not large but obviously ancient .

A handful of Indian tourists wandered through the site as we took our time , absorbing the incredible sculpture as well as the hidden alcoves containing wall paintings from the same early period . It was an exceptional feast for the eyes , a soothing and awe inspiring experience . <p> Tearing ourselves away , we ventured on to the next temple on our list , Ekambareswar .

With darkness falling , the festival culminated in the preparation of traditional chariots bearing large wooden images to be dragged through the streets with stout ropes by men , women and children alike . After hours of revelry , we wearily made our way back to the hotel , thankful for our good timing to be present for this festive occasion . <p> Fig. 13The next day was not unlike the first .

What follows is a discussion of the visual imagery ; but first , a brief bit of background is in order ..... <p> The collaboratives origins lay in a commission from Linda Reichert , artistic director and founder of Network for New Music , a premiere national group dedicated to the commission and performance of new music . Reichert clearly had a specific synergy in mind ; Andrea and I , along with choreographer Manfred Fischbeck , were invited for lunch and presented with her vision for the upcoming NNM 2008-09 season , which would devoted to collaborative explorations between music and the visual arts - appropriately entitled MIX .

The catalyst for that journey had been my determination to rediscover and identify a particular landscape first glimpsed many decades ago in my high school library . The location portrayed in that earlier sighting was unidentified , yet as an image of terrible beauty , I had never forgotten it . Prolonged bouts of web-surfing finally yielded results ; a photo depicting a virtually identical image was identified as the Kali Gandacki river gorge in Upper Mustang , Nepal . My mystery location finally revealed , I planned a journey about which I 'd fantasized for decades . With my husband , Peter Horodowich , I traveled up that gorge beyond the massifs of Dhaulagiri and Annapurna to the kingdom of Lo Monthang in northwest Nepal in the fall of 2006 . <p> Kali Gandaki <p> Fortresses of the Raja and Rani <p> Meditation Caves <p> Recalling now those memories of that spectacular land and its tenacious people , I was moved to celebrate them .

So moved , I initiated proto drawings and a proposal outlining my interpretive vision and presented it to my colleagues , who immediately felt an affinity for its philosophical message and expressive potential . Indeed , Linda Reicherts inspiration was such that her vision now foresaw a physical journey to Lo ; artistic integrity required the effort ! And so Andrea Clearfield and I traveled to Lo in Upper Mustang in the late summer of 2008 ; for Andrea the allure of vast and unknown vistas , 3 for myself , a return to a wild and beloved place ; for both of us , the challenge of physical and mental borderlands and the liminal spaces between . <p> Lung-ta in Lo , Upper Mustang , Nepalese Himalaya <p> Border Checkpoint <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " restricted area " . The origin of this status lies both in political strife and economic agendas , past and present . As the Nepalese government forbids solitary travel within the region , this proscription brought us the companionship of Dr. Sienna Craig , a cultural anthropologist from Dartmouth College . Recent friends , we had serendipitously learned of each others plans to enter the kingdom , and determining that our agendas were harmonious , welcomed the opportunity to travel together . Siennas companionship was an unexpected gift and delight ; fluent in Nepali and Tibetan , with deep personal and cultural knowledge of the region 5 , her skills were a tremendous asset . We were joined by two additional companions ; our guide and liaison Gyaltso Bista , close friend of Sienna and amchi practitioner in the service of the Loba King , Jigme Palbar Bista , and as Sienna would be traveling with her not-quite four year old daughter Aida , she would be aided by Norzing-La , daughter of the Loba Queens lady-in-waiting , Dawa .

These concepts physically and metaphysically permeate the Kingdom of Lo , which is believed to be the last remaining enclave of pure Tibetan culture . Though the origins of these concepts lie deep within the ancient Central Asian , Himalayan , and Vedic cultures , their underlying sensibilities are familiar to the West. ; many of our myths reflecting similar concepts and structures . But the relevance of this iconography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing capacity to connect with the present ; in this essential respect Lung-Ta lives ! <p> Lung-Ta is multivalent in depth , flexibility , and relevance ; it exists conceptually on dual planes of both the metaphysical and the vernacular - the universal and the personal the eternal and the temporal . The Lung-Ta , or Windhorse , lends its name to the Tibetan or Buddhist Prayer Flag . This common vernacular form can be seen strung at shrines , monasteries , and sites of spiritual significance , both public and private . Though images , specific text , and motivational intent of Lung-Ta may vary greatly , the predominant form is a square of cloth upon which is printed an image ( from which its name is derived ) of the Celestial Horse bearing upon its back the Flaming Jewels of the Dharma , surrounded by the text of Buddhist prayers and accompanied by the Four Animal Guardians . ( Photo ) As it flies , it sanctifies the animating and permeating wind , carrying the blessings of the Dharma heavenward . Snapping in the wind , it recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , Lung-ta signify places of power - high mountain passes , venerated gompas - and confer blessing and protection upon points of vulnerability - both human and inanimate . <p> Lung-ta with Windhorse <p> Lung-Ta also refers to a more subtle concept ; that of the Mind riding upon the Spirit , as a Horseman rides upon a Horse . Indeed , early Vedic peoples visualized the structure of the World-Cosmos as analogous to the horses body . In Tibetan , ta is horse and lung signifies not only breath or wind , but atmospheric energy , and further , the prana , or vital energy , surging through the subtle or vajra ( diamond ) body which all individuals are believed to posses . The energy of the horse represents the Heavenly Wind ; the great Pranic Breath of the Cosmos upon which rides the Mind , that of the innate consciousness of the universe that is the inheritance of Man . In some traditions and interpretations this association becomes so close that the two are conflated ; this merging of identification being common in early totemic cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negativity and ignorance , the Mind ( Rider ) soars into the Heavens upon the eternal energy of his Soul ( Steed ) and unimpeded attains Liberation , or moksha ; the reconciliation of Spirit and Matter , Prusha and Prakriti , Atman and Brahman . <p> The horse is pivotal to the cultural and physical life of Lo ; it is the seminal symbol of both wealth and virtue . Indeed , in the writings of Dr. Sienna Craig , the intimacies of this cultural relationship extend to burial and medicine ; the Loba and Mustangi regard for their horses often being evidenced in similarity of ritual practices for both humans and horses . The horses body provides a metaphor for innumerable emotional , physical and spiritual states . It offers an ever present reminder of the internal aspiration for the spiritual skill of the Cosmic Rider who is One with the Cosmic Horse ; the great Buddhist poet Milarepa 's " Song of the Galloping Horse of a Yogi " gives eloquent voice to this affinity : <p> In the mountain hermitage which is my body , In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle of my heart , The horse which is my mind flies like the wind . He gallops on the plains of great bliss . If he persists , he will attain the rank of a victorious Buddha . Going backward , he cuts the root of samsara ; Going forward he reaches the high land of buddhahood . Astride such a horse , one attains the highest illumination 6 <p> As is here evident , the concept of Lung-ta is highly accommodating of creative synthesis . Its imagery is highly plastic , expressing both physical and metaphysical energies . In approaching my work for the collaborative , it was important for me to envision formal structures that could clearly translate into their expressive counterparts in music , so that this lovely duality would be effectively realized through the complimentary forms of music and image . Approach and treatment were selected with consideration of their translation into musical structure . Thus , forms evocative of wind and movement permeate the Triptych . In my paintings , Lung-Ta is expressed through dynamic gesture incorporating elements of the equine form , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast Tibetan plateau . The speed of the horse associates it with the wind , and through natural extension , the clouds . Indeed , among the Tibetans , one particular form of cloud with a twisting , trailing form is known as a " Mares Tail " 7 . Clouds , and all natural forms , are highly codified in Tibetan visual iconography , as are their symbolical associations . In determining Lung-Tas visual vocabulary , I have respectfully referenced these forms , interpreting and integrating them within the biomorphic structure . " Cloud Streets " ( long continuous bands of clouds ) and " Mares Tails " merge with muscular fragments , suggesting the shifting energies and moods of the Windhorse as it flies through the heavens , and convey this alliance between horse and wind . Their shifting states of existence are conveyed through biomorphic expression- the perpetuity of material flux - the endless " becoming " of the physical ; the manifest within the immanent . <p> Manjushri <p> Avalokiteshvara <p> Vajrapani <p> I have used the expressive potential inherent in the equine form to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities associated with each of the bodhisattvas of the Rigsum Gompo , described below . The tripartite further translates into musical movements ; thus , in Manjushri , rolling clouds unfurl and stream outward , referencing the Bodhisattva who " dispels the Clouds of Ignorance . " <p> Their gentled streams merge into the following imageAvalokiteshvara . Here the cloud streets are calm , and the great biomorphic form is gently closed within itself , or " collected " ; an equine term that signifies balance , harmony and benevolence . <p> The cloud streets continue onwards , and in Vajrapani , the bodhisattva emblematic of skillful method or action ( vajra=lightening ) , they explode in a lightening stroke outward and off the picture plane ; the resulting energy resonates and reverberates throughout the jagged biomorphic structure . <p> The horizontal rush of the cloud streets manifest the universal winds and complement the surging tsa lung , which conceptually ground the work . Passing through all three images , they are here depicted as three pure gold threadsthe Prana channels - carrying the breath of life . Crowning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space recedes upward according to Tibetan sensibility . Movement , light , and speed are the essence of LUNGTA . <p> Rigsum Gompo <p> Offering Wall <p> Tsarang Monastery <p> To the imagery of the Windhorse ( Lung-Ta ) , I have joined the colors of the Rigsum Gompo , the Three Protectors . They function as a visual benediction . The Rigsum Gompo is a triad of three Buddhist deities , or bodhisattvas , symbolically depicted within the region of Lo as three simple square edifices , or chortens , enrobed in the colored clays of this region . They are emblematic of the three corresponding Buddhist Protectors who are respectively : Manjushri , whose attributes are Wisdom and the color red-yellow ; Avalokiteshvara ( Tibetan-Chenrezig ) 8 , whose attributes are Compassion and White ; and Vajrapani , whose attributes are Action or Power , and the color blue-black . These three deities are positioned at points of vulnerability around villages and , as a triad , form an ideal unified force for the protection of all sentient beings . Rigsum Gompo are strategically situated in protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veneration and offering . They confer protection upon the homes of villagers . In my paintings , the Rigsum Gompo are represented as three color fields occupying the lower third of the image plane . They are painted with the actual colored clays of Lo , originating from specific areas within the region , brought back by me for this purpose . Upon each of the three color fields is transcribed one of three stanzas comprising a Prayer for Planetary Peace9 , which was written at my request by Tenzin Bista , an amchi and senior monk from Choede Monastery in Lo Monthang , specifically for this work . Addressed to the crucible of these greatly troubled times , the prayer is an invocation and benediction for Everyman , the Earth , and All Sentient Beings . I have transcribed this prayer 10 , literally , in iron ( fine iron particles in acrylic suspension ) . Iron is regarded as spiritually efficacious , being associated with the meteoric iron that frequently falls upon the Tibetan Plateau . Its associations with the horse , lightening , life force , chaste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark it as a powerful signifier . The text of this prayer is written in the cursive form of Tibetan , called kyug yigor " running hand " . Its expressive form , rarely seen in the West , is evocative of the rushing cloud formations of the Tibetan Plateau , and resonates with the dynamic movements of the biomorphic forms racing across the three canvases . The Lung-Ta images are painted in acrylic on transparently primed linen and are each six by six feet . They are presented in a form analogous to the vernacular expression of Lung-Ta , that of the prayer flag ; they have been cut from their stretchers and fly freely when hung in their venue . As the raison detre of the visual arts is , ultimately , the expression , communication and reception of spiritual values , their sensibility is therefore , of a sacral nature . <p> My art has long been grounded in both external and internal locations of extremis ; the deserts , seas and heights of the earth , and from the great philosophical visions which continually spring forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctified place where both body and mind are driven inexorably towards the reconciliation of opposites .

Through this requisite submission of the ego to the abrasion of vast and impersonal forces , our apprehension of the eternal is ever refined , our sense of connection ever deepened , our creativity continually enhanced . <p> As mentioned in the first lines of this essay , a heightened sense of cultural change and fragility informed our work . Societies are rapidly changing , increasingly stretching the limits of communal connection . Art can be a powerful force for easing this dislocation ; it can offer a momentary sense of communal transcendence-tenuous , yet essential ; West meeting East ; thesis and antithesis birthing synthesis , yet one more variation of evolution of Self through Other .

@@79925670 @1425670/ <p> Mukti Singh is one of Nepal 's foremost traditional painters . A Magar from Bandipur in the Eastern hills , Mukti came to Kathmandu and began painting in the 70s , and quickly became attracted to the early medieval Newar style of the 13-16th centuries . In this style he has become a master , one of the only painters using this style and associated techniques who does not rely on copying earlier works , preferring to design his own compositions within the bounds of Newar iconography and style . 
@@79925671 @1425671/ <p> One of the defining technical characteristics of a thangka 1 , its most distinctive feature , is that it is painted on both sides . Thangkas are painted on a canvas support prepared and coated on both sides . Thangkas are rolled , as Chinese and Japanese works often are . The back of a thangka is as carefully prepared as the front , so that consecrated formulas , mantras , and other religious or historical writings can be inscribed on it . Before the 15th century , a pair of presentation frame textiles in cotton or silk was added by a single seam on its upper and its lower borders only , with the sides left unframed . Later thangka mounting included textiles on all four sides of the painting , usually in silk brocade . <p> All these particularities make restoration and conservation of thangkas a very specific job . Their conception , the place where they were kept and the way they were handled have also to be taken into consideration . Thangkas are exclusively religious works of art , honored in monasteries or private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butter lamps - this latter a cause of dirtiness we do not find in the painting of western countries . Many thangkas have been vandalized during the last 50 years as a result of the terrible cultural upheavals in Tibet during the period of the Cultural Revolution . This set of conditions causes specific mechanical wear , and alterations , which will be briefly described in this paper . <p> Fig. 2 <p> Tibetan paintings have to be freely rolled and unrolled . In their original form , they come with neither easel nor frame , the presentation textiles sewed on their upper and lower borders being there only for display purposes . Considering that both sides of a thangka have to be visible , we had to develop very specific conditions of conservation . New theoretical , methodological and solutions had to be found , combining occidental technology with Tibetan history and practice . <p> Fig. 3 <p> The restorer will find in a thangka a normal size painting with the graphic precision of a miniature or an illumination . The basic elements of Tibetan painting are accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the miniaturism of the painting of a thangka , the indispensable comprehensive knowledge of the depicted subject , exponentially increases the difficulty of any intervention on a painting . <p> The Buddhist Tibetan pantheon is very complex . Thangkas are the expression of this pantheon and they reflect its complexity by an extremely varied iconography . <p> METHODS USED IN MUSEUMS AND COLLECTIONS UP TO THE PRESENT <p> In France , before the 60 's , most Tibetan paintings were kept at the Guimet Museum and were restored by a famous Parisian relining workshop with an exclusively occidental approach . Torn thangkas or thangkas with a weakened support were lined and stretched on a frame , which made it impossible to see their back or roll them . <p> Fig. 4 <p> In the USA , to let the back of the thangka be viewed , some restorers had the idea to glue it on a Plexiglas pane , more or less thick but also somewhat flexible , with a synthetic adhesive . Again , the ability to roll the thangka was lost , and so was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred onto a paper support , in the Chinese or Japanese way , but this process crushes , flattens , and stiffens a work of art that draws all its beauty from movement , depth of field , and suppleness . This method also occults the back of the thangka . <p> Sometimes the presentation textiles were removed , or inappropriately replaced by others with no consideration for style or period . <p> As to the treatment applied to the pictorial coating , the ignorance of the original Tibetan techniques lead to practices with often disastrous results , practices such as : <p> - Use of high retention solvents - Use of vacuum tables wearing out the edges of the tears unprotected by the coating - Drastic cleansing without taking into account that each coating or color requires a specific treatment - Use of aggressive and non-selective varnishes that spoil the specific shine of the different original paints <p> Fig. 5 <p> Since the 1960s -1970s , the thangkas arriving on the market have shown occasional traditional Tibetan restorations made with small sewed or glued pieces of textiles . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum intervention on the surface of the painting . In fact a real traditional Tibetan method exists , involving the sewing or gluing of a strip of canvas into the larger cloth , and then an integration is made with a final coating ; but they used this technique only for the initial preparation of the canvas and never for restoration purposes . <p> To sum up we can say that many attempts have been made to find a suitable method of conservation for these specific works of art , none of them being satisfactory . In Tibet , the concept of restoration and conservation is relatively unknown , and paintings were left in their original condition , or replaced . <p> EXAMINATION : DEVELOPMENT OF OUR METHOD <p> First , we perform a thorough examination of the work of art , following the usual scheme . <p> Treatment of the support <p> Whenever an intervention or consolidation of the support is necessary , it is crucial that it should be done without lining . Conventional restoration of easel painting with a very degraded support is usually conducted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides , as they need to be rolled and unrolled freely 2 , we have to deal with a totally different problem . <p> Problems on the support of the Thangka <p> To understand and analyze the alteration of the thangka support - which is often a problem with the glue - it is sufficient to examine the dynamics and the flexibility of the feel of the roll of the painting ( as long as the painting is unencumbered with previous restorations or linings ) . <p> Fig. 6 <p> Fig. 7 <p> Fig. 8 <p> There are several elements and possibilities in the " roll " of a thangka : <p> - The roll is rather firm , flexible , without tear , but an examination in transmitted light reveals a variable state of lacuna . When a thangka has not been too much handled , the weaving remains strong , even if a traction at the periphery of a lacuna could in term reduce the resistance of the fiber , leading first to a crack , then to the unweaving of its edges , then eventually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very soft , dry and fragile . This could be caused by a sizing problem , loss of molecular linking in the glue , or by a bad initial preparation of the thangka - The roll is affected by previous rudimentary restorations - Evidence of vandalism or neglect : tearing , wrenching , laceration , maculation , stamping , crumpling. - In later thangkas ( after the 15th century ) , a presentation textile ( often made of silk ) is sewed on the four borders of the paintings , and can react to humidity problems in various ways . <p> RESTORATION : CONDUCTING OF THE METHOD <p> We will keep in mind at all times the need for preserving the homogeneity and organic quality of a thangka . We need a comprehensive perception of the work of art and a comprehensive treatment involving its whole , as a coherent and living body , and resulting in a display in total visibility of its two sides , free from all constraint . <p> 1 . Preliminary <p> Fig. 9 <p> Fig. 10 <p> A first visual analysis should show if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find : <p> - patches and various restorations on the back of Thangka - too brittle and very dry paint - various mutilations by animals ( usually rats ) - very greasy stains - general state of dirtiness <p> 2 . The straightening <p> The restorer will lay a rather flexible intercalated support on his/her working table . This support is compulsory for every intervention . The straightening will proceed with a light moistening and a low temperature ironing using a protective film of sulfured paper ( greaseproof paper ) , done with a steady movement on the back of the thangka . <p> When the painting has recovered its position and its natural cohesion , we can start the process of preparing inserts for damaged areas , and the thread-to-thread attachment of these inserts . The original dimensions should be rediscovered and the painting rebalanced to preserve the integrity of the whole . <p> The upper and lower borders are important for the display and the hanging of the painting : they should be given the necessary solidity . The lateral borders , if present , will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous work . <p> 3 . The preparation of a repair inset and the thread-to-thread operation to join to the original <p> To proceed to a thread-to-thread operation , particular care should be given to the choice of the textiles to be used : quality of the cloth , the thread torsion , weaving , composition of the fiber , dye , suppleness have to be thoroughly checked . <p> In the case of a lacuna , the first task is to eliminate the fraying and the greasy residues at the end of the fibers . It is very delicate task , with many possible variants : as the threads may be dry or brittle , numerous or scarce fibers , etc . Once the fibers are clean , they are finely carded on + millimeter at the utmost . <p> Fig. 11 <p> An insert of canvas is prepared ; the shape of the lacuna is accurately reported on it , using tracing paper . The edges of the insert cloth are carded the same way as the edge of the original . The canvas is " decatie " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glued on both sides with starch or animal glue and glycerin . The coating is then colored with watercolor or pigments . <p> The assemblage of insert to original is done on the back of the painting , by the millimeters of free fiber ends , using a diluted flexible non-acid vinyl glue in adequate quantity ( aqueous emulsion of vinyl homopolymers ) . The sure cohesion of the two parts is obtained by applying pressure . <p> The point of the operation is to prevent the zone of the insert from becoming a weakening or weakened area in the future or a source of cracking for the coating plaster and pictorial layer ; and to integrate it into the flexibility and the weave of the whole painting . <p> 4 . The refixing : The reintegration of the coating or gesso on the back of the painting <p> Fig. 12 <p> We can then proceed to the refixing of the painting , partial or general , with diluted animal glue . This is the determining operation on the backside of the thangka , which has been untouched till now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give the intervention its final quality . <p> The work of art is not , at this state before refixing , totally mechanically safe , as the fibers are still free on the back of the thangka and if not filled up , this would cause , unilateral tractions prejudicial to the work of art . <p> The colored gesso is prepared with adequate animal glue with kaolin and chalk : kaolin gives flexibility ; chalk makes the load . These materials should have a density and strength slightly inferior to that of the original work of art ; the coating should be very finely ground and very homogeneous , laid while fluid with a brush . All the ingredients will be prepared and tested by the restorer . Their reversibility must be maximal . <p> 5 . The cleaning ( method and cases ) <p> Fig. 13 <p> Fig. 14 <p> The analysis of the paint composition allows us to carry out this most delicate operation .

The gold inscription centered just above the lower register states that the painting is " the personal meditational image ( thugs dam ) of Onpo Lama Rinpoche , " who briefly acted as fourth abbot of Taklung monastery between 1272 and 1273 .4 The reference to this painting as Onpo 's thugs dam suggests that Onpo used the painting in Tantric visualization practices , specifically the first of three meditational stages ? known as kyerim ( skyes rim ) , the development , or generation , stage ? whereby the appearance of the deity and his or her entourage is memorized until it can be reconstructed vividly within the mind of the practitioner . <p> An inscription on the back of the painting was composed by Onpo himself .

" 5 These inscriptions were probably composed by Onpo sometime between 1264 ( when , at age thirteen , he met his teacher Sangye Yarjon ) and 1273 , the year after Sangye Yarjon 's death , when Onpo left Taklung for eastern Tibet . <p> However , analysis of the painting 's consecratory inscriptions and the top register of spiritual teachers suggests the likelihood that the painting itself was executed considerably earlier and that the other inscriptions were later additions to the work , which possibly dates to the time of Tashipel and which Onpo inherited from his teacher .

As in present time , the early inhabitants had to face continuous encounters with deadly snakes infesting forests and marshy grounds . They were overwhelmed with the incomprehensible terror of sudden death and could think of no better way to relieve themselves from that fear than appeasement and veneration .

Especially the emblem of the cobra was transformed into a religious and mythological symbol and is often represented in combination with a lingam as symbol for Shiva. ( fig. 6 , left ) The snake symbol was also taken over by Buddhism and Tantrism , from where it passed into contemporary esoteric circles . This topic is however not in the field of the present article . <p> Snake worship in a kind of combined animistic-Hindu form is alive to the present day almost everywhere in India , and is particularly pronounced in South India . Votive steles with snake images are often erected below trees because people believe that the dwellings of the snakes are situated underneath the roots .

By their great charm Nagis ( fig. 7 , below ) could rouse the passion of a man ; unions between mortal man and immortal woman are often met with in Indian fables .

Many private houses have a corner of their garden reserved for snakes ( kavu ) . It must not be entered by humans and accordingly develops its own eco-sphere with otherwise unknown vegetation , often with medicinal plants . In temples and even in Christian churches metal images of snakes and their eggs are given as votive offerings in search of protection from snake bite and evil .

Farmers here , as everywhere in India , will never kill a snake which they find in their fields or in the house because snakes are respected as sacred and help the peasants by eating up rodents which are a great threat to the crops . <p> In Bengal an anthropomorphic serpent folk goddess , Manasa , presides over the serpents .

A stone image of a snake ( fig. 12 , below ) is first submersed in a spring or pond for a certain time to be impregnated with the mysterious power of the snakes living there . Then the barren woman circumambulates the Ashvatta tree ( ficus religiosa ) and has the snake stone established under the tree , or it is lined up with others in the precincts of a temple . <p> Fig. 11 : Brass image of an erect cobra <p> Fig.12 : Snake stone with theriomorphic images <p> Fig. 13 : Upper part of achoti <p> Edgar Thurston reported in 1909 that Nagavadam ( cobra 's hood ) is the name of a subdivision of the community of the Palli , who wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head , in the dilated lobe of the ears .

( fig. 13 , above ) <p> Snake earrings of India <p> Fig 14 : Dvarpala ( doorkeeper ) <p> We can not be certain how long snake earrings have actually been worn by women in India , because no antique common jewellery objects remain , due to the custom of melting all ornaments when a person dies . There are however medieval temple sculptures showing earrings with cobras. ( fig. 14 , right ) One can surmise that tribal groups probably used snakes as ornaments as long as they have worshipped them . <p> In Orissa and Gujarat snake earrings are called nagulu or nagali from the skrt. naga -snake .

This is obvious with the nagali of Rajasthan and Gujarat , where the most abstract forms of snake earrings are found . All four existing types are of different appearance but reveal basically identical designs . <p> Asked for an explanation of the name of their nagali ( figs. 15-15a , below ) , women in Pushkar , Rajasthan , describe a mushroom which is called snake umbrella and comes out after the rains , because snakes have the habit of hiding under its hood .

As other Rabari , these herdsmen have shrines for snakes , but associate them with Lord Vishnu in the form of Shesha and deny a connection of these images with their earrings . The typical traditional earrings of another section of the large Rabari community , the Dhebaria , show the same basic shape , but the wires are soldered into a cone with decorations of enamel or colour and appliquTs added .

They switched from gold to silver and have their earrings made of solid sheet .

They now wear simple silver wire spirals of 10-15 cm length which are screwed into the distended lobe ( figs. 21-21a , below ) .

So Krishna pardoned him and then let him go free to leave the river . <p> The circles on the hoods of the cobra are believed to be the footprints left by the divine boy dancing on the heads of the defeated Naga Kaliya.

" 1 The kalasha is surmounted by an alms bowl ; Tucci notes that Amitayus is sometimes described as holding a " vase for alms , " and perhaps that is what is intended in this painting.2 Works such as the Sukhavativyuha and the Saddharma Pundarika describe Amitayus/Amitabha preaching the dharma in an exquisitely rarefied realm known as Sukhavati Paradise.3 There are no specific references to this paradise in the painting , but Tucci notes that " besides being a heaven , Sukhavati remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Buddha analogous to the historical Buddha preaches the Law ; he Amitayus ... is accordingly represented under the bodhi tree . " 4 Here , the leaves and branches of the bodhi tree can be seen behind the spire of Amitayus 's temple . <p> The enthroned deity is flanked by two standing attendants , the bodhisattvas Padmapani ( on his right ) and Mahastharnaprapta ( a form of Vajrapani , on his left ) . Amitayus appears within the trilobe arch of a temple whose superstructure ( shikhara ) rises above the attendant bodhisattvas in receding tiers , and is then surmounted by a shrine enclosing a Buddha in bhumisparsha mudra , the earth-touching gesture , a reference to the historical Buddha 's enlightenment . Streamers arranged in an even scrolling pattern fall from a parasol at the top of the shikhara , and cloudborne attendants bear a parasol and a banner , symbols heralding the attainment of enlightenment . The painting is unusual in the iconography of its side registers , each of which portrays three enthroned Buddhas within temples . Of the six , five hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bear the colors associated with the five Tathagatas : green ( Amoghasiddhi ) , white ( Vairochana ) , yellow ( Ratnasambhava ) , blue ( Akshobhya ) , and red ( Amitabha ) . The sixth Buddha stands at the lower left holding an alms bowl . Four seated figures of Amitayus flank the spire of the temple , as do images of Avalokiteshvara ( below them , on the left ) and Ushnishavijaya , on the right . <p> In the top register are eight Buddhas , perhaps the seven Buddhas of the Past and Maitreya , the Future Buddha.5 In the bottom register ( far left and far right ) are the Four Guardian Kings ( caturmaharajas ) , each associated with one of the four cardinal points of the compass : Dhrtarashtra holding a stringed instrument ( east ) , Virudhaka holding a sword ( south ) , Virupaksha with a serpent and a stupa ( west ) , and Vaishravana with a staff and mongoose ( north ) . The deities Achala ( with sword and noose ) , a wrathful Vajrapani ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bottom register , along with the consecrating monk , a mustached figure drawn with great sensitivity and seated in front of a white , gold patterned cloth . He holds the stem of an incense burner , fashioned in the shape of a lotus bud , from which smoke is rising . At the monk 's right a low table supports a stupa whose plinth bears crossed fly whisks flanked by offering lamps and other implements associated with ritual practice . <p> Little is known about the worship of Amitayus in Tibet , although it is likely that all Buddhists would have venerated this deity to promote health and prolong life . A late-twelfth-century painting in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is a portrayal of Amitayus accompanied by an inscription which states that the painting was dedicated during a long life attainment ceremony performed by Chokyi Gyaltsen ( d. 1189 ? ) .6 Tucci notes a hymn to Amitayus written by the Sakya hierarch Phakpa ( 1235-1280 ) in 1258 , but there is no reason to associate this work specifically with the Sakya order.7 A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains features seen in twelfth-century works , such as the cloud-borne deities flanking the top of the shikhara ( compare with those in the twelfth-century Ushnishavijaya , cat . no. 6 ; and in the twelfth-century One-Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara , cat . no.12 ) , and the similarly rendered standing attendants ( compare those in the twelfth-century Buddha , cat . no.15 ; and in the ca. 1200 Buddhist Hierarch , cat . no. 17 ) . Despite these earlier elements , the painting shares a wealth of features with other thirteenth-century works . Amitayus shares with the early-thirteenth century Amitabha ( cat . no. 23b ) an elegant , similarly drawn head and torso . The coloration and drawing of their respective lotus petals are also similar , with curling leaves that resemble frothy waves . The lotus petals also resemble those in the thirteenth-century Amoghasiddhi ( cat . no. 25 ) and Maitreya ( cat . no. 24 ) . Amitayus 's robes , an iconographic feature associated with his nirmanakaya ( emanational body ) , or earthly form , show an understanding of and appreciation for Chinese silks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper robe is arranged in loose , rich patterns , sometimes folded to expose the underside of a fabric in contrasting but complementary colors and designs .

@@79925700 @1425700/ <p> Since the late 1970s , CT scanners have probed patients bodies to help identify the causes of their illnesses . Just as the technique of computed tomography imaging revolutionized the practice of medical diagnosis in its time , its contemporary use in the art world could ultimately change the way some works are appraised . The quality and reliability of the images produced by a CT scanner also called a computed axial tomography scanner or a CAT scan literally " undress " the art work and reveal its internal structure . <p> The CT scanner , or " CT " , as it is more briefly known , provides a more accurate measurement of the density of the component parts of the object under examination , thereby dissociating parts that are usually merged on a conventional X-ray film . It therefore has its place among the various scientific disciplines used to clarify the history of art works : manufacturing techniques , initial functions , later uses , preservation , etc . <p> In conventional radiology , the X-ray beam projects onto the film the accumulated shadows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas are completely masked by the shadow of denser parts . CT avoids this drawback by enabling each part to be viewed separately . The principle is to record a series of " slices " or sections of the object . The images are recorded in digital format and special image processing software is used to construct sections on any spatial plane desired . The sections can be combined to give a global view of the object and the transparency of the component parts can be modified at will . These operations reveal valuable information about the objects background : <p> - manufacturing techniques , showing for example , whether pottery was modeled from a clay coil , turned on a wheel or stamped , - natural damage , such as oxidation , erosion , or cracking , - repairs : impregnation , infiltration , gluing of chips or fragments , etc. , - restoration : a clear and accurate reconstruction of the damaged parts , - even the tricks used in assembling the piece . <p> The technique of CT scanning , when combined with a pertinent interpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can provide proof of the inner state of an art work . Although it can help establish the history of the piece , when used in conjunction with other techniques of observation and analysis , it is not a dating test . <p> Like all sophisticated equipment , the CT has its limits . It was designed principally to examine the human body so the three-dimensional objects scanned must not exceed a diameter of 50 cm or the weight of a man . Although a medical CT can handle most materials , an industrial CT should be used for metal items . <p> CT scanning of antiquities is not recent : in 1979 , the year when the Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Allan M. Cormack and Sir Godfrey N. Hounsfield for inventing the CT scanner , Dr Derek Harwood-Nash published the first article on his use of a CT to study an Egyptian mummy . He was already fully aware of the advantages that this essentially non-destructive technique had to offer scientific fields such as Egyptology , Paleontology and Archeology . <p> Since then , precisely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to examine objects from the past , as it leaves them intact for future generations . For example , a CT scan of an Egyptian sarcophagus can pinpoint the ceramic or stone scarab hidden in the mummys thorax and give a precise view of the underside . Any hieroglyphs engraved there can then be photographed , enabling an Egyptologist to decipher the history of the deceased without violating the sarcophagus . <p> Detailed reports of other applications in the cultural heritage field have been published in the press , in specialized magazines or on the Internet : CT scans have assisted in the study of stringed instruments ( violins , cellos and guitars ) , archeological pottery vases , antique glasses , wooden and ivory netsuke , real and fake fossils , and dinosaur eggs . More recently , CT scanning has proved useful in making models of ancient musical instruments , identifying art works for insurance purposes , and making three-dimensional polymer reproductions of art works ( stereolithography ) . <p> The value of CT for art works lies in the fact that each particle of material making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent from the adjacent particles , because the composition of non-synthetic materials is seldom homogeneous . The density of these particles remains perfectly stable over time because it is mainly dependent on the concentration and average atomic weight of its atoms . When a physical or chemical change occurs in the object it will show up unfailingly as a change in the density of the material . For example , oxidation will cause a lowering in the density of the oxidized material in relation to the non-oxidized particles . <p> Since it is designed to measure the density of matter , the CT is particularly appropriate for detecting any change in the state of a material . The result of the examination is usually presented as an image in which the densest particles appear dark grey or black , while those of lesser density are of a lighter grey . Unfortunately , these images , displayed in a scale of greys , do not always speak for themselves ! They must be interpreted , just as , in the medical field , a radiologist is needed to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see whether or not the vertebrae are fractured . The quality of this interpretation obviously depends on several criteria such as the quality of the CT , its initial calibration , the adjustment of the parameters used for the examination , and the type of algorithm used to construct the images . <p> Apart from its non-destructive character , the CT has another substantial advantage over other scientific tests in that it examines the entire object rather than just a sample . <p> When used under optimal conditions , its resolution power , that is the minimal diameter of a particle of material for which the CT can measure a density value , is about 0.05 mm . This resolution power is therefore largely sufficient to detect , for instance , a crack in a wooden , ivory , pottery or stone sculpture , even if the crack is invisible to the naked eye and does not show up on a conventional X-ray film . <p> Sculptures in Wood and Similar Materials <p> Fig. 1 <p> Fig. 2 <p> Wood is an ideal material for studying with a CT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly dehydrated and therefore of low density , and secondly because it has growth rings of varying density , arranged in a regular pattern which is disturbed by the least tampering . A CT study of growth rings in a wooden sculpture can be a valuable aid for detecting the assembly of different pieces of wood , whether they are of the same or different species , as well as any gluing or breaks ; it can even be used to identify the species . It can be still done if the sculpture has been covered with opaque varnish , or a thick layer of patina or paint , even if the latter contains metallic pigments such as white lead . This is often the case for polychrome wood sculptures , on which paint and patina may be used to hide defects . <p> For wooden sculptures , CT scanning has the added advantage of showing the extent of damage caused by borer or termites and even detecting the eggs or larvae of living wood-boring insects . Such a diagnosis is valuable in recommending a conservation treatment such as anoxia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , ritual stigmata , fetishes or magic charges are sometimes concealed inside the sculpture or under a layer of condensed organic matter , and non-invasive investigation may she 'd light on their nature and original function . <p> Objects made of other low density organic matter such as plant fibers , leather , and horn , can also be studied by a CT , despite the lack of visible growth rings . The weave of concealed fabrics is also clearly shown by this technique . <p> Ivory and Bone Sculptures <p> Fig. 3 <p> Fig. 4 <p> Bone and ivory are the densest organic materials . Yet they can easily be CT scanned because the size of the piece is usually within acceptable bounds . <p> A CT scan of the Burmese ivory stupa ( fig.3 , above ) , illustrated opposite , reveals its mysterious contents : a standing statue of Buddha , finely carved by removing the debris through the openwork screen . The Buddha and the screen were carved from a single piece of ivory , as is proven by the unbroken root canal which runs through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hypertrophied incisor , necessarily innervated during the elephants lifetime . <p> A close study of the Ekoi head , illustrated further on , shows a human skull under the layer of antelope skin . This suggests that it dates from a period prior to the British protectorate in Nigeria ( late 19th century ) . Moreover , an anatomical study of the skull shows that teeth from a carnivorous mammal have been inserted in the upper jaw , giving the head a particularly frightening aspect as tradition demands . Lastly , an examination of the frontal sinuses reveals a magical charge , containing some metal , hidden under the bony wall of the sinuses and covered with clay and antelope hide . It is probably because the charge was completely invisible that it was not removed before the head reached the European market . <p> Terracotta Sculptures <p> Fig. 5 <p> Fig. 6 <p> Fig. 7 <p> Of all the materials examined , terracotta is the one for which the CT yields the most information on manufacturing techniques . <p> Since clay is initially soft , it keeps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing , whether it is the stand on which it was modeled , the potters fingers or tools . Because of its relatively adhesive nature , fresh clay sometimes incorporates dust or residue of varying density . These marks enable the radiologist to trace the sequence of steps in the creation of the work and to pinpoint any inconsistencies . A plausible explanation must be found for these inconsistencies , in a field where fakes are legion , as was confirmed by many of the experts recently interviewed by Thomas Fuller . <p> A CT scan of a terracotta object also permits a study of the granulometry of the metal flecks it contains as well as of its overall density . Generally speaking , both the granulometry and global density of the clay are constant in the same sculpture , as the artist theoretically shapes his work from the same stock of clay . Moreover , the CT gives information about the metal or organic supporting structures used by the artist during modeling , whether or not they survived the firing process . Lastly , it reveals the way stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes made before firing and traces of early paintwork . <p> On the other hand , when previously fired terracotta material excavated bricks , for example is cut , carved , hollowed out , assembled , scraped , sanded , painted , etc. , to produce a sculpture which looks like an original piece , a whole range of other signs are revealed by the CT which frequently prove its recent assembly . <p> According to an investigation carried out by Sheila Farr and published in the Seattle Times early in 2003 , the reconstruction of pottery objects is mainly intended to fool unsuspecting connoisseurs who have blind faith in thermoluminescence ( TL ) testing to authenticate a work . <p> It should not be forgotten that TL is used only to determine when a piece of pottery was last fired . The test is carried out on tiny samples taken by drilling . Although it will certainly establish the age of the material , it can not prove that the object had its present shape when the analyzed material was fired . <p> The question of the influence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raised . To investigate this , we worked in conjunction with ArchTolabs to scan ten objects and eleven samples of pottery which had all been age-tested by thermoluminescence . The TL tests were repeated under the same conditions , after the CT scan , although ArchTolabs was unaware of the X-ray exposure the specimens had received . The findings showed that the age determined by TL , both for the ten objects and the eleven samples , was the same as before they went through the CT . <p> This experiment therefore confirms unpublished experiments made by other laboratories indicating that CT scanning antique terracotta , under appropriate testing conditions , in no way modifies the TL results . <p> Stone Sculptures <p> Fig. 8 <p> Fig. 9 <p> Fig. 10 <p> Fig. 11 <p> No literature has yet described CT scanning of monolithic sculptures . The reason for this is probably to be found in the apparent incompatibility between the relatively low penetrating power of the X-rays used in medical CT ( compared with industrial CT ) and the high density of the stone . <p> Yet experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptures under 40 cm in diameter . A CT scan is even a valuable source of information on the inner state of the material , which can not be established with the other types of scientific analysis , because they mostly study the surface of the sculpture or samples taken from it . <p> Thus the CT can show whether a sculpture has been constructed from one block or several . If there are several , it can show whether or not they are of the same nature by analyzing their density , the direction of their veins or sedimentary strata , and the quantity of natural metals they contain . <p> If repairs have been made , separate elements such as metal rods , drill holes , cement joins and injected resin deep within the stone show up clearly . <p> Fakes can also be detected , such as a head attached to a body made of a different stone . <p> Lastly , the CT can give information about the outer crust and even find deep-lying causes for surface anomalies . Thus a crack running around the statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glued together again , but may be due to the natural erosion of an oxidized sedimentary stratum . <p> Conclusion <p> When a collector is interested in an art work , one of his primary concerns is to establish its authenticity . This is based on several subjective factors ( experience , pedigree , expert opinion ) to which are progressively added , depending on the importance of the work , criteria based on a number of scientific studies : stylistic analysis , thermoluminescence or carbon 14 dating , a dendrochronological study , spectroscopic or microscopic analysis , etc . Alongside these technical tests , which focus mainly on the visible parts of the work or on a few samples , CT scanning is an absolutely non-destructive test that has the advantage of describing the inner state of the object , examined this time as a whole . <p> - revealing its contents , - showing how it was made , - clearing up doubts about its general condition , - generalizing the findings of one-off analyses , - revealing the nature and extent of restoration work , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CT scanning is thus a valuable aid for people with various interests in art , such as collectors , dealers , art experts and historians , museum curators , anthropologists , ethnologists , paleontologists , stringed instrument makers , and scientific archivists , but it can also be of use in a wider context , in restoration workshops , auction rooms , legal offices , insurance companies , and even forensic science laboratories . <p> Bibliography <p> Farr , Sheila Test to determine age in ceramics is not foolproof or scamproof .

" Tantras ( texts ) clearly state that scripture is the necessary complement to the oral teachings one receives from the mouth of ones guru . " ( 2 ) Much of this literature contains descriptions of deities in the form of precepts for meditation and complex mythologies that served as verbal models for artists .

" ( 6 ) <p> " As Tantras philosophy is never merely abstract , it states the philosophical prepositions in terms of human and erotic symbolism which keeps them directly in touch with human experience . " ( 7 ) One focus of Tantric Hinduism is the primal emphasis on the sexual union of man and woman as symbolic of the union of earthly beings with the divine , a kind of cosmic ecstasy . The tantrika ( practitioner ) uses every possible means to achieve this goal , including art and yoga , an extra dimension of which can involve sexual intercourse but , as Pal has stated , " it is a distortion of the truth to insist that sex remains a leitmotif of all tantras. " ( 8 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimization of the sexual in art , whether it is Tantric Buddhist or Hindu , and this kind of imagery seldom appears in the Khmer world . The lyrical phrases that caress alluring young girls in the erotic poetry of certain Indian Tantric texts would have had no audience in Khmer Cambodia. ( 9 ) Little has been written about Khmer Tantric Hinduism , although tantrikas ( practitioners ) were already present in Cambodia by the medieval period . ( 10 ) Unfortunately , no Khmer liturgical texts have survived to enlighten us as to what role Khmer Tantric Hindusim may have specifically played in the Khmer world , but a few tantalizing clues have resulted in surprising revelations . <p> Royal Initiation Rituals <p> The initiation rituals used to consecrate Khmer rulers derive from Tantric Hindu texts , and the recent identification of these texts has allowed Robert Brown to propose new ideas about the role of Tantric Hinduism in the Khmer setting . ( 11 ) " Scholars have generally supposed that Shivaite Tantric texts were used to inaugurate the kings personal cult , the devaraja , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kulen ) in 802. ( 12 ) The Sdok Kak Thom stele inscription of 1052 records that new sacral rituals were used to consecrate a royal linga and proclaim Jayavarman II chakravartin ( universal monarch ) in this ceremony , traditionally considered to mark the beginning of the Angkor period . ( 13 ) Four Tantric texts ( shastras ) have been mentioned in connection with the 802 consecration , but their content was unknown . <p> The recent discovery by Teun Goudriaan of the key Tantric text used in the 802 ceremony brings considerable new evidence for the central role played by Tantric Hinduism in Khmer-royalty initiation rites and , in particular , a new understanding of the esoteric rituals surrounding the ceremony of 802. ( 14 ) Proclaiming a ruler as chakravartin ( universal monarch ) basically places him metaphorically at the center of his kingdom , creating a verbal mandala , a concept that goes back to Vedic days in India . ( 15 ) <p> fig. 1 : Mandala <p> Zhou Daquans thirteenth-century tale of the Khmer Kings nightly assignation with a nagi ( serpent princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been considered by some scholars to reflect Tantric initiation ceremonies involving ritual consorts . ( 16 ) In other words , the Khmer appear to have combined a Tantric concept with their own local indigenous pre-Indic beliefs to produce initiation rituals meaningful in a Khmer context , in which nagi were an important component . Yashovarman I built the Yashodharatajaka lake to assure that his " glory " ( yashas ) would reach the underworld inhabited by nagas and other aquatic creatures . ( 17 ) This was perhaps an earlier reflection of a Tantric concept of divine kingship that ultimately spawned the ritual noted by Zhou Daquan in his thirteenth-century report . <p> The existence behind a wall of the Elephant Terraace at Angkor of a representation of the underworld featuring nagas among its inhabitants gives further credibility to the myth . ( 18 ) Robert Brown has ably demonstrated that the bas-reliefs at Angkor Vat give visual form to an oath administered by Suryavarman II . ( 19 ) In view of a possible Tantric nature of the 802 ceremony , it is more than possible that Suryavarman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIs oath reflect a continuation of a long-held Khmer tradition of royal Tantric Hindu initiation rituals , about which very little is known . Since Tantric practices were by their nature secret , it is not surprising that references to such rituals and rites are not found in stele inscriptions . It is interesting to note that one of the ascetic figures in the Angkor Vat relief identified as an acarya carries a bell with a vajra handle , a major ritual implement associated with Tantrism. ( 21 ) <p> Khmer Tantric Hindu Art <p> fig. 2 : Chandra Mandala <p> Tantric Hindu images have been identified among the decorations of various Angkor Vat and Bayon-style temple decorations , but very little has been written about Khmer Tantric Hindu sculpture . The two mandalas included in this volume are rare examples that are undeniably Hindu rather than Buddhist ( nos. 1 , 2 ) . The earliest example dates to the Koh Ker period ( 928944 ) , and displays a standing image of Surya holding two lotus buds . Surya stands within a circle of eight lesser beings representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deities formulated by the Khmer between the seventh and thirteenth centuries ( fig. 1 , above ) . ( 22 ) The identity of the mandala figures as belonging to the Nine Devas is confirmed by the presence of Rahu sitting on his cloudbank ( no. 1b ) . Although perhaps influenced by the Indian navagraha group , the Khmer group is quite different , and includes planetary deities who are also dikpalas ( directional deities ) and are associated with the seven days of the week plus Rahu , the eclipse deity , and Ketu , the comet . ( 23 ) The other mandala is cast in the Angkor Vat style of the **30;166;TOOLONG century and displays a seated image of Chandra , the moon deity , holding two lotus-buds as its central focus ( fig. 2 , right ) . <p> fig. 3 : Dancing Shiva <p> A few Khmer images of Shiva suggest that the deity had a Tantric aspect for the Khmer , especially during the Angkor Vat period . A multi-armed Shiva image is shown in an exaggerated " dancing " ardhaparyanka pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Hevajra , when dancing on a corpse symbolizing ignorance . ( 24 ) The more common Tantric image of Shiva was Sadashiva , of which several examples apparently cast in the Phimai region were published by CoedFs. ( 25 ) According to the Sdok Kak Thom inscription , Sadashiva , Shiva in his five-headed aspect with ten arms and ten hands making the teaching gesture , represents the four Tantric texts involved in Jayavarmans 802 consecration , ( 26 ) though Sadashiva images were apparently not fashioned until the twelfth century . <p> Whether Tantrism was ever a complete and autonomous or a supplementary system has been the subject of much scholarly discussion , both today and in antiquity . ( 27 ) However Tantrism developed elsewhere in Asia , it appears to have been a supplementary system for the Khmer , not a cult separate from Vishnuism , Shivaism , and Mahayana Buddhism , and at times it was exclusively associated with royalty and the elite . With no surviving Khmer liturgical texts and the secrecy surrounding most Tantric rituals , it is has been extremely difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The recent discovery of the specific Tantric texts used in the royal consecration rituals transforming the ruler into the central focus of a mandala that symbolizes the Khmer Empire begs for further scholarly consideration .

The period of this Mongol renaissance , from the seventeen through eighteenth centuries , and its aftermath , are the concern of this exhibition . <p> Nomadic Life <p> Mongolia : The Legacy of Chinggis Khan begins with an exploration of Mongolia 's traditional nomadic way of life . In the landlocked steppe of Central Asia , the Mongols since ancient times have lived in tribal groups , enduring an extreme climate and landscape , with rugged mountains , desert in the south , and dry steppe lands and harsh winters in the north .

The first Bogdo Gegen , Zanabazar ( 1635-1723 ) , was a direct descendent of Chinggis and Khubilai Khan . Perhaps unique among world cultures , Zanabazar , a celebrated monk and statesman , was also Mongolia ' greatest artist . <p> The Bogdo Gegens , while the official rulers of Outer Mongolia , were in fact subordinate to Tibetan lamas , and to the Manchu emperors of China 's Qing dynasty .

This conversion was accomplished among a dispersed , nomadic population through different means . One was the active suppression of shamanism , the native belief system of the Mongols , which nonetheless has persisted to the present day . A more effective means of promoting Buddhism was the staging of large public festivals . Buddhist monks performed tsam ceremonies , seasonal ritual dances which were held to exorcise evil forces . The Mongolian tsam , which was inspired by the Tibetan Buddhist cham ceremonies , had among its characters both Buddhist deities and shamanistic figures converted to Buddhism .

Fourteen elaborate book covers and manuscript pages from Buddhist sutras show the high regard and artistic attention given to these books . <p> The Mongolian Pantheon <p> Tibetan Buddhism is a complex ritualistic religious with a vast array of deities . The Mongolian pantheon did not depart radically from the Tibetan one , but it did refine and emphasize certain deities to its own ends .

Just under the roof and the kapota ( cornice ) where we typically would have found a bhutagana frieze showing frolicking dwarf-like followers of Shiva in an Early Chola temple ( Figure 14 ) , we find a frieze of sculptural panels . Its subject matter can not be discerned as it is partly hidden behind the larger bracket figures of dancers and yalis or horned lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storey is octagonal and has pajaras with deities on the cardinal directions . Shiva Dakshinamurti is facing south , Vishnu facing west , and Brahma facing north ( Figure 12 ) . Miniature shrines positioned on the corners are replicas of ekatala ( one-storey ) temples and are much more elaborate than the karnakutis usually found on the corners of the roof of dvitala temples . They are square shrines with figures inside miniature pajaras , flanked by pilasters and dancers on the corners . There are no shalas or barrel-roof rectangular miniature shrines at the center , which would have been the usual structural decoration in this place . The shalas have been replaced by the large kudus housing in their turn a pajara with the sculpture of a deity . The griva or neck is round and has niches with seated figures capped with enlarged open kudus on the four directions . The round shikhara has large kudus and is capped with a metal stupa . The kapotas of this temple are ribbed . Each of the three walls of the vimana has uncommonly four levels of projecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions . All these aspects of the structure are highly unusual ( Figure 11 ) . <p> Fig. 9 <p> Fig. 10 <p> Fig. 11 <p> Fig. 12 <p> In front of the original shrine is a closed mukha mandapa , probably of a later date . And in front of this is a pillared mandapa that possibly dates to the 13th or 14th century . It is partially open to the East and the South , but is closed on the North . Projecting from the northern wall and facing south a subsidiary shrine for the consort of the presiding deity of the temple has been constructed , also probably at a later date ( Figure 5 ) . <p> Fig. 13 <p> The walls of the ardhamandapa have been used to house three deities on each side , while the sanctum has one main deity for each wall accompanied by two flanking figures . This creates a sculptural plan which is very elaborate and unusual . Altogether fifteen major figures are positioned on the walls of this relatively small shrine ( Figure 13 ) . <p> The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The structures within which the six deities on the ardhamandapa and the central deities of the garbhagriha are housed are all pajaras 7 . The pajara was already a feature of Pallava temple architecture , where it had the role of accommodating a murti on a temple wall or as abstract decoration on a roof 8 . A pajara is in a way a miniature shrine in two dimensions . Chola architects adopted the structure of the pajara during the earlier phases of the Chola period ( 910 to 970 ) as a structure to fill the space of a vimana wall without using it to house sculptures of deities 9 . <p> Fig. 14 <p> Fig. 15 <p> Fig. 16 <p> Fig. 17 <p> The structure preferred by Chola architects to accommodate sculptures of deities was the devakoshtha or niche 10 . The most obvious differences between a devakoshtha and a pajara are that the first is capped by a lintel and crowned with a makaratorana ( Figure 14 ) 11 , whereas the second is capped by a kapota or cornice crowned with a miniature ekatala or one-storied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear from the walls of Chola temples 13 . But by the end of the 11th century they have returned and have replaced the niche as the preferred structure in which to house the central murti on the walls of temples . Especially on larger structures we find combinations of pajaras and niches applied to house murtis , as can be seen on the Airavateshvara temple in Darasuram and on the walls of the gopuras of the Shiva Nataraja temple in Chidambaram ( Figure 16 ) . The pajaras of the later Chola period , especially the ones in a central position on a wall , distinguish themselves often by being capped with a shala or barrel shaped roof element , instead of a miniature ekatala 14 ( Figure 17 ) . <p> Fig. 18 <p> But the pajaras that accommodate murtis on the Amritagateshvara temple in Melakkadambur are unusual in several ways ( Figure 18 ) . They do not have a base of their own that would have made them project out from the temple wall , but are all situated on the base of the temple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure positioned in front , creating the appearance of a projection . Each of the walls of the ardhamandapa and the grabhagriha has a central figure that is housed in an exceptional pajara . These pajaras are unusual in that they each have a pair of independent octagonal pillars with lions as caryatids supporting a roof that juts out from the wall and is sculpted with a ribbed kapota ( cornice ) . The pajaras of the sanctum are lower and jut out further than the central pajaras of the ardhamandapa wall which are higher , but do not have the usual crowning feature above the kapota . The only other structure with similar pajaras , as far as I know , is the Nritta Sabha , the ratha mandapa , in the Shiva Nataraja temple in Chidambaram , where Indian sphinxes or purushamriga occupy the place of caryatids 15 ( Figure 19 ) . <p> Fig. 19 <p> Fig. 20 <p> Fig. 21 <p> The inside of the projecting roofs of the pajaras have been sculpted giving the impression of a wooden roof with beams and connecting wooden structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wooden structure , with all the detailed carving common for wood , a great achievement in a substance like granite ( Figure 20 and 21 ) . <p> Fig. 22 <p> The pajaras that house the main deities of the sanctum wall are crowned with a very unusual , huge horse-shoe shaped feature , which is actually a larger version of the kudu that crowns many regular pajaras . Inside this kudu is another pajara in which we find also a sculptured figure . The miniature ekatala crowning this in its turn accommodates another , miniature , murti ( Figure 22 ) . <p> The neighboring pajaras on the ardhamandapa wall are more standard . Two pilasters flank the niche space , which is capped with a kapota and crowned with an ekatala miniature shrine ( Figure 18 ) . Here it can be mentioned that the flanking pajaras on the Southern ardhamandapa wall are much lower then the pajaras on the northern wall ( Figure 30 ) . To adjust the wall space the ekatala shrines capping the pajaras on the Southern wall are much taller . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures flanking niches are quite common on Chola temples , but the major figures adorning the sanctum walls are remarkable . They have been given a pedestal and , although attendant on the deities in the main pajaras , they are of the same size as the directional murtis , and are obviously not intended as diminutive secondary figures . <p> Altogether 15 major murtis decorate the walls of this shrine . The major sculptures are labeled in 12th century Tamil and Grantha ( Sanskrit ) script ( Figure 24 ) and relate to the sthalapurana or foundation myth of this temple . Besides these main figures there are countless subsidiary niches , sculptures and decorations . The temple surface is decorated with exceptionally detailed miniatures , scrollwork , lions , dancers and musicians . <p> Going clockwise round the temple we find the following deities and sages placed in the pajaras and on the temple wall in the following order ( Figure 13 ) . <p> On the south wall of the ardhamandapam : ( A ) Ganapati ( B ) Ardhanari ( C ) Agastya <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( E ) Dakshinamurti ( F ) Romasa Muni <p> On the west wall of the sanctum : ( G ) Chandra ( H ) Vishnu ( K ) Surya <p> On the north wall : ( L ) Parvataraja ( M ) Brahma ( N ) Patanjali <p> On the north wall of the ardhamandapa : ( O ) Gangadhara ( P ) Alinginamurti ( R ) Durga <p> All these figures display interesting characteristics . In this article some of the more noteworthy aspects will be featured , although this temple has so much to offer the student of architecture , art and iconography , it could easily fill a book . <p> The sculptural plan as a whole is elaborate , and just as the use of pajaras , could be interpreted as , in a way , archaic . Using the typology developed by Dr.Hoekveld-Meijer 16 the ground plan and lay-out can be described as II-2-b 17 , which means it is a building with two-stories , with one protruding section and six pilasters in each wall of the garbhagriha or sanctum . The lay-out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly narrower ardhamandapa or vestibule directly connected to the garbhagriha , with one niche in each garbhagriha wall , and three in each ardhamandapa wall . <p> The most common iconographical plan for a Chola temple is one niche on each of the ardhamandapa walls , and one in each of the sanctum walls . In the clock-wise order of the circumambulation the original arrangement was Ganesha ( South ardhamandapa wall ) , Dakshinamurti ( Shiva , South sanctum wall ) ) , Vishnu ( West sanctum wall ) , Brahma ( North sanctum wall ) , and Durga ( North ardhamandapa wall ) . This order for the directions reflects the earliest phase of a Chola lay-out . Vishnu was replaced early on by Ardhanari . Soon after Lingodbhavamurti became the standard West-facing deity . Three murtis on an ardhamandapa wall became quite common during the later part of the 10th century , especially under the influence of the Chola queen Sembyan Mahadevi . But with a different iconographical program , as Shiva Nataraja was the central deity on the southern ardhamandapa wall in most of the temples build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sanctum wall in Melakkadambur are Dakshinamurti ( seated facing South ) ( Figure 18 ) , Vishnu ( seated facing West ) and Brahma ( seated facing North ) ( Figure 11 , 23 ) . Dakshinamurti is flanked by Indra on the right and Romasa Maharishi on the left . Vishnu is flanked by Surya , the Sun , on the left , and Chandra , the Moon , on the right . Brahma is flanked by Parvataraja on the right and Patanjali Maharishi on the left . Each flanking figure is depicted as worshipping a small Linga sculpted as part of the pilaster in front of him . The pilasters form a kind of blank niche around the figures . <p> Each of these attending figures is characterized by its own costume , jewelry and attributes . Unique is that each figure is also crowned as it were , by a small sculpture on a block above its head which depicts a symbol characteristic for it . <p> Fig. 23 <p> Fig. 24 <p> Fig. 25 <p> Fig. 26 <p> Indra is beardless , wears a crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jeweled belt , and wears elaborate necklaces and bracelets on his arms . He is depicted holding a rudraksha mala between his hands which are folded in Anjali mudra , the gesture of worship . The symbol above his head consist of six open spirals containing miniature depictions of his attributes ( Figure 24 ) . <p> Romasa Maharishi is bearded with a moustache and has his hair knotted on top of his head in the manner of a sage . He wears a sacred thread over his left shoulder . His hands are depicted as in the meditation , and his right hand holds a rudraksha mala . He wears a full-length dhoti . The symbol above his head is the cosmic tree . Romasa Maharishi is a mythological figure who is known as the author of an ancient astronomical work , the Romasa Siddhanta . He also plays a role in mythology as a figure with a life-span of astronomical proportions ( Figure 25 ) . <p> Chandra , the Moon is beardless , wears a short dhoti with drapes falling down the side of his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and around his neck , and a crown . His hands are folded in anjali mudra and hold a rudraksha mala . The disk of the moon is depicted behind his head like a halo . The symbol above his head is a whitewater lily ( Figure 26 ) . <p> Fig. 27 <p> Surya , the Sun , is similar to Chandra , with a short dhoti and crown , hands folded in worship and holding a mala . The sun disk is shown around and behind his head . The symbol above his head is the lotus ( Figure 23 ) . <p> Parvataraja is the personification of the Himalaya Mountains and the father of the goddess Parvati . He wears a short dhoti and holds his hands folded in anjali mudra with a mala between them . His crown represents the Himalaya Mountains . The symbol above his head is the purushamriga or human-beast , the sphinx of the Indian tradition . Here the sphinx is depicted with a lion body and a human head surrounded by extended mane 19 ( Figure 27 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the founding sages of the Shiva Nataraja temple in nearby Chidambaram . He is depicted with the lower body of a snake and with a five-headed cobra crowning him , as he is the incarnation of the cosmic snake Shesha . His palms are folded together and hold the mala . The symbol above his head is appropriately Shiva Nataraja dancing under a miniature of the golden roof of the Chit Sabha of Chidambaram ( Figure 28 ) . <p> The central murti of the southern ardhamandapa wall is Ardhanari , flanked by Ganesha on the right and the sage Agastya on the left . Ardhanari is Shiva and Parvati together in one form , with Shiva as the male principle on the right side , and Parvati as the female on the left ( Figure 29 ) . This form of Shiva occupied the Western niche of Early Chola temples for a while , and was later found among the murtis depicted on the northern ardhamandapa wall during the Sembiyan Mahadevi phase in the later 10th century . <p> Fig. 28 <p> Fig. 29 <p> Fig. 30 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central figure , flanked by Gangadhara on the right and Durga on the left . Alinganamurti is a representation of Shiva and Parvati seated together . Durga used to be the deity of choice for the northern niche whenever an ardhamandapa had only one deity depicted , but here she holds the subordinate place . <p> The Gangavataranamurti shows Shiva with four arms attending on a slightly smaller Parvati , while he almost catches the descending Ganga in the upper-left corner with his raised arm . A peculiar feature of this murti is the Apasmara , the dwarf figure under Shivas right foot . He is sitting in an upright position facing the viewer . This is characteristic for the Apasmara of the Pallava period ( Figure 30 ) . In the ekatala shrine crowning this pajara we see a small figure of Shiva as mendicant or Bhikshatana . <p> The mythology of this temple explains that Indra worshipped Shiva here to obtain the amrita or ambrosia , the heavenly drink of immortality . The temple is also described as Karakkoil , which means hidden temple or temple with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maharishi , Surya and Chandra indicate an astronomical significance . This is a subject for future research . As it has not been possible to trace a more complete version of the temples mythology which could throw a light on the meaning of this elaborate iconographical lay-out , it is not possible to draw any conclusions at this point . <p> Here ends our discussion of the iconographical plan and the characteristics of the main figures depicted around the temple wall . But these are only the most obvious sculptural features . There are miniatures on the kanthas of the base , on the pilasters , inside the kudus on the kapotas . There are dancers and prancing yalis or horned lions between the palagai and the roof . All the kapotas or cornices are ribbed . The base of the pilasters features scroll-work , within which again we find miniature figures . Many , especially on the kanthas , are narrative in nature . <p> Under the cornices we find in stone sculpture what would have been the elements of the roof structure had the temple been made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof and of the shikhara we see stone replicas of beams and connecting structures , as if the roof were made of wood ( Figure 31 , 20 , 21 ) . <p> The pilasters are octagonal with a square base . Ornamented with lions and opened lotus buds on the corners , scrollwork and dancers in the center . Miniatures are sculpted in great detail around the part called the malasthana ( Figure 9 ) . <p> Fig. 32 <p> Fig. 33 <p> Fig. 34 <p> Typically makara heads with warriors in their open mouths jut out from the corners of Chola temples ( Figure 32 ) . Here yalis with warriors on their back jump diagonally from the wall of the base ( Figure 33 , 34 ) . The structure of the roof does have the makara heads on the corners ( Figure 7 , 11 , 12 ) . <p> Another feature of earlier Chola temples that is missing is the Bhutagana freeze . Instead we find a series of sculptural panels the details of which can not be ascertained because it is hidden behind other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful and interesting of the miniatures are the various forms of Dancing Shiva found on the pilasters . The most eye-catching miniature is of Shiva dancing the Ananda Tandava or Dance of Bliss depicted with his consort Parvati on the right and Brahma playing cymbals on the left ( Figure 35 ) . Around the corner , to the left of Brahma , goddess Kali is dancing , and in the next miniature the emaciated figure of Karaikal Ammayar , the female saint , is also playing cymbals . All are focused on Shivas Cosmic Dance ( Figure 36 ) . Other dancing forms of Shiva found among the sculpture are Gajantaka , Shiva dancing on the Elephant skull ( on the pilaster to the right of Indra ) ( Figure 37 ) and Urddhva Tandava Murti ( on the pilaster to the left of Surya ) ( Figure 38 ) . <p> Fig. 35 <p> Fig. 36 <p> Fig. 37 <p> Fig. 38 <p> In striking contrast the lower most part of the base is completely bare and plain . And so are the stone wheels that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type structures are carved elaborately as for example in the Nageshvara temple in Kumbakonam ( Figure 5 ) . Also the positioning of the horses generates questions . The horses with their attendants are turned slightly diagonally away from the main wall ( Figure 2 ) . The stone beams that stick out from the wall of the ardhamandapa and seem to serve as yoke to the horse are also positioned in an unusual angle ( Figure 18 ) . Additionally this beam looks like it may have been intended originally as an axle to a stone chariot wheel 20 . All this indicates the possibility that , at some time in the past , a renovation was carried out that changed this base . <p> Indras chariot in Melakkadambur is a true master piece in every way . Additionally several features indicate an even more exiting possibility . For example the iconographical lay-out ( Vishnu facing West ) , the ground plan ( II-2-b and 1-A-3 ) , the use of pajaras to house murtis , and some of the iconographical details ( for example the upright Apasmara under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures on the walls and as bracket figures ) , all point to the possibility we have here a temple that is a replica in stone of a much earlier temple . This may very well have been a temple of brick , wood and plaster , as would be suggested by the imitation of beams and other wooden features in the sculpted roofs and cornices . It could convince us to think it may even have been a temple originally constructed during the time when the Pallava dynasty ruled this part of Southern India . The three compositions found in the Tevaram illustrate this temple was renowned already in the 7th century . The composers of these three poems , the saint-poets Appar and Tirujana Sambandhar , are known for their close relationship with Pallava kings 21 . <p> Because it is generally assumed no architecture from the early periods made of brick and wood has survived , its existence is ignored by most studies of Indian architecture . But many early stone temples such as the Rathas in Mamallapuram and others show the sculptors initially often copied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These features could be studied to improve our understanding of the evolution of South Indian architecture . <p> The possibility that the Amritagatheshvara temple in Melakkadambur is a replica in stone of an earlier , possibly even a Pallava , temple is an exiting prospect . That this is not necessarily wishful thinking is confirmed by the fact that while speaking to an elderly person present at the time of my visit , I was told the oral tradition about this temple says it was first a chariot made of wood , later reconstructed in stone . We could imagine how difficult it must have been to build such a master piece of architecture and sculpture in brick and wood . How difficult it must have been for the architects and sculptors of the 11th century to execute a replica of such a master piece in a material like granite . <p> Ratha means chariot , especially the chariot of the Aryan warriors . A shrine is generally denoted with the word vimana . The word vimana literally means measuring across and is used with the primary meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The word is today used in Hindi and other Indian languages for airplane . <p> The Tevaram is a body of devotional poetry dedicated to Shiva . It was composed by three poet-saints in the 7th and 8th CE and plays a major role in South Indian Shaivism . Each hymn contains 10 songs , thus 30 songs are dedicated to the Presiding deity of the Amritagathesvara temple in Melakkadambur . <p> Hoekveld-Meijer 1981 , p. 112 . " A panjara is part of the vimana wall and consists of two pilasters supprting a kapota on which , in its turn , a replica of a small ekatala is placed . The whole stands either on the pattika of the vimana , or on an adhisthana of its own . Occasioanlly it even rests on an upana of its own . " <p> Hoekveld-Meije , G. Koyils in the Colamandalam . Typology and Development of Early Cola temples . PhD thesis , Vrije Universiteit van Amsterdam , 1981 , p. 98 .

The floor of the niche coincides with the floor of the building , i.e. the pattika . The pilasters are also standing on this floor .

This temple is a Gajaprishtha or Elephant-back shrine . <p> An ekatala shrine a temple built with one storey , that means it consists of a sanctum capped with a shikhara.

The Tibetan word " Dropenling " means " giving back for the betterment of all sentient beings , " and Dropenling has achieved its purpose by giving back to hundreds of Tibetan craftspeople all over the Tibet Autonomous Region . Because it sells crafts made only by Tibetans , Dropenling has been popular with tourists who want to purchase authentic Tibetan crafts such as textiles , painted wood boxes and trays , stone carving , leather bags , jewelry , carpets and dolls and toys .

That analogy is often accompanied by evidence of their ' summit ' in 1956 at Picasso 's Mediterranean villa , La California , but is meant to more generally suggest the breadth of the artist 's fame , unparalleled productivity and stylistic variety , and charismatic personality.1 Unique in the mastery of historical styles dating back to the 9th Century , reintroduction of brilliant color with painterly modeling , and grand synthesis of these traditions with aspects of Euro-American Impressionism and Abstract Expressionism , Chang Dai-chien is a singular giant of Chinese painting . <p> Yet even though the artist lived half of his career in the West and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the American artworld except in the Chinese American community and among scholars . This obscurity is especially surprising in light of the high visibility afforded Asian American artists including Isamu Noguchi , Chang Dai-chien 's contemporary ( 1904-1988 ) , and contemporary artist Hung Liu . Because ink painting is segregated academically and rarely presented in American museums , there is a widespread lack of familiarity about its traditions , aesthetics and practitioners . Perhaps as few non-Chinese can read inscriptions , rapid or casual appreciation is limited for many . James Cahill has written that Chinese paintings can appear " small and flat and hard to penetrate " to Westerners , in contrast with the seeming " forcefulness and immediacy " of European paintings ; conversely , Cahill adds that Chinese painting experts sometimes complain about European painting lacking variety in brushwork.2 Chang Dai-chien felt quite differently , protesting " some people complain that Chinese landscapes are plain while the trees are flat . But this is absolutely false.3 Even though his work is resolutely rooted in Chinese painting traditions , Chang Dai-chien felt " there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " except perhaps " in the media and materials of the painter " and " in regional divergence in custom .

This exhibition also provides us with an opportunity to present a number of works created during this period which have never been exhibited or previously published . Any discussion of Chang Dai-chien 's total oeuvre requires a complex evaluation of multiple Chinese historical artists and styles and is outside the scope of this brief introduction . But the context and circumstances of Chang Dai-chien 's twenty-five year relationship to California , where the artist owned two homes and mounted more than a dozen solo shows5 , has important implications for the understanding of Chinese culture in the United States , and to the documentation of the artist 's most Western-looking artistic period . <p> After establishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West after the Communist Revolution in 1948 .

In the mid- 1960s , Chang Dai-chien and his wife Hsu Wen-po began 6 spending more time in California .

Relocation was actually necessitated by the imminent flooding of his Brazil garden estate because of a dam project , which the artist nevertheless kept developing in seeming disregard for its impermanence . In 1969 , several of Chang Dai-chien 's children joined him in Carmel , shifting the center of his art activities to California . <p> In comparison to the extravagance of the Brazil acreage with its excavated lake and five pavilions , Chang Dai-chien 's California residences seemed ' barely habitable . ' The artist and his wife initially stayed for months at a time at Thomas Chew 's Dolores Lodge in Carmel , where they occupied a special cabin with a suite of rooms . He bestowed the name ' K'e-yi Chu ' ( translated as ' barely habitable ' or ' just OK ' ) on his first Carmel house which was purchased in 1968 , and the garden pavilion ( Catalog X ) at his second home which he purchased in 197 1 . The second house was located on the exclusive Seventeen Mile Drive and had a sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a garden . The transformation of the sandy yard into an opulent garden became a daily preoccupation and passion . Chang once lost his shoes in the mud after running into an orchard to admire a tree , and caused consternation by asking if he could purchase and transplant fully grown trees from neighbors explaining that he was too old to wait for trees to grow from seedlings8 . The garden eventually included an orchard of plum trees ( metaphorically numbered at one hundred ) , scholar rocks collected in California and internationally ( sometimes displayed on redwood stands , see Catalog X ) , unusual rock-like burls and tree snags , dozens of penjing or bonsai ( see figure d ) , and a burial spot with headstone for his worn out brushes . The garden also included an outdoor gazebo , where the artist would sit at night , composing poems while watching the plums " bloom newly under the drizzle moon.9 " The artist named this home ' Huanbi An , ' or ' hut in the sticks ' and it served as a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , politics , recipes , international visitors and friends -- for the time that he lived there . <p> It should be acknowledged that Chang Dai-chien made his new home close to the Bay Area , the historical center of America 's strongest Chinese art and emigre community , where the artist was surrounded by Chinese speaking friends and intellectuals who were already aware of his work . The artist 's first California solo exhibition in 1967 at Stanford University attracted an opening reception crowd of a thousand which was so unprecedented that it frightened away the museum 's volunteer docents10 . Three thousand attended the November opening reception for the 1972 Asian Art Museum exhibition in San Francisco in spite of torrential rain , representing a tremendous community response for that institution 's first ever exhibition of a living artist . A number of those in attendance at these exhibitions had known the artist earlier in life : Michael Sullivan who organized the Stanford retrospective had met Chang Dai-chien in Chengdu in the early 1940s ( see figure e ) ; Yvon d'Argence who conceived the Asian Art Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mid 1950s ; renowned restaurateur Cecelia Chiang recalls the joy of being recognized by the artist and remembered by her Shanghai nickname at the Stanford opening , after a separation of nearly twenty years.11 <p> In addition to Michael Sullivan at Stanford and James Cahill at U.C. Berkeley , the artist 's California circle included a number of other college professors who were involved in Chinese culture . These include Pung- fi Tao from Foothill College , who traveled with the artist to Ann Arbor in 1967 to view the exhibition of a favorite Ming Dynasty literati painter Shi-tao , and many others from schools including San Jose and San Francisco State Universities . Friends from the University of the Pacific in Stockton arranged for Chang Dai-chien to be awarded an honorary doctorate in 1974 and hosted a major exhibition and related symposium there . Although Chang Dai-chien met a number of non-Chinese artists in California including Ansel Adams , his personal interaction was limited by language . He was more personally involved with Chinese-speaking artists including noted Chinese photographer Long Ching-san who had established a " second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco painter Lim Ching-yee . The late 1960s were also watershed years for alternative culture in Northern California , and Chang Daichien was welcomed as an alternative cultural icon . Hippies presented flowers to the artist on several occasions ; in 1969 Chang was suddenly surrounded by a group of young people who bestowed a lei of chrysanthemums and sat surrounding him to ask questions about Eastern philosophy.12 <p> During these years , Chang Dai-chien established his primary California gallery relationship with Carmel dealer , Les Laky . Laky intersperced exhibitions of contemporary Chinese ink painters with exhibitions of California Impressionists , and is remembered for his integrity . Although the Laky Gallery had satellite spaces in both San Francisco and Los Angeles for a time , Chang Dai-chien only exhibited at the Carmel space , but these shows were promoted state-wide via the gallery 's newsletter . The relationship with the Laky Gallery seems surprizing as it is some distance from the centers of California art collecting but the gallery played a significant role in the artist 's career : a number of works in California public collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions are especially significant because they introduced Chang Dai-chien 's work to a non-Chinese audience in a non-Chinese context , and because they featured many of the artists most extreme explorations of abstract painting . The early Laky exhibitions included several Switzerland Series paintings which have no recognizable subject matter , in contrast with the museum exhibitions of the same period which favored more classical works . Chang Dai-chien also presented several museum and gallery exhibitions in Southern California beginning in 1969 . Joan Ankrum recalls that the scarcity of available work at her Los Angeles gallery which presented two exhibitions in the 1970s was the limiting factor in sales ; many of the paintings included in her exhibitions had already been gifted to the artist 's friends . The artist 's generosity to his friends is central to the understanding of his life during this period . Many works in California collections were gifts , many of which have such wonderful circumstances that the associated stories become a significant part of the artwork . This link between artwork and circumstance is central to the Chinese literati tradition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to the production of his paintings . Examples include his Chinese New Year parties where guest threw dice and the highest scores left with new work , and the many instances where Chang Dai-chien declined selling his work to his friends - but presented gifts even years later of the same painting that had originally aroused interest . <p> In spite of his beautiful home , good friends and significant exhibitions , Chang Dai-chien 's years in California were not easy . Mao Tse-tung 's ' Cultural Revolution ' was begun in 1966 , in which the red guard changed place and street names and ransacked bookstores and private homes , destroying or carting off paintings and books ... Except briefly in 1972-1973 , traditional landscapes , birds and flowers , and Impressionist oil paintings were alike forbidden.14 <p> Chang Dai-chien 's work was specifically targeted in the Cultural Revolution ( see Catalog x ) and his family persecuted , further politicizing the artist and eventually leading to his second self-exile , from the United States , in the late 1970s . Although the artist did not make public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon 's overtures to the Peoples Republic of China , and he accepted Taiwan 's invitation to establish a home there in 1976 . He began building in Taiwan at a magnificent site at the fork of a river near the National Palace Museum in 1977 . The artist spent decreasing amounts of time in Northern California through the balance of the Seventies , and never returned after Jimmy Carter broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 . In addition , Chang Dai-chien was already in his late sixties when he relocated to California , and his eyesight was impaired by cataracts and diabetes . One of the artist 's calligraphic seals carved in 1971 reads " paints from heart to hand , " often interpreted to be underscoring the absence of eyesight in this equation . The artist attributed his late splashed ink style to his failing eyesight , although detailed work completed during and after that time mitigates that assertion . Chang Dai-chien underwent experimental eye surgery in New York in 1969 which actually worsened his eyesight in his right eye to 20/200 , and laser surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period photographs show the artist wearing eyeglasses with a darkened right lens . The surgery to remove his clouded left eye lens performed in 1972 by Emma Dong in Salinas restored 20/40 vision and the ability to see color in that eye , if only with thick eye glasses.15 Chang Dai-chien began painting a few months after these surgeries , and it is instructive to review the paintings created immediately after the trauma of these surgeries , which still evidence a strong hand and inventive sense of drawing . <p> In spite of these difficulties , Chang Dai-chien produced some of his most powerful and innovative work during this period . In 1965 , he produced a series of nearly completely non-objective paintings in his Brazil studio , some based on his trip with C.C. Wang to Switzerland ( see Catalog x ) , which were the centerpiece of his first Laky exhibition . Debatably the richest and most dramatic splashed ink paintings date from the years of 1967 to 1969 , which achieve the " forcefulness and immediacy " of the strongest Abstract Expressionist painters . These landscapes sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unprecedented in the artist 's earlier landscapes , possibly reflecting California color and inspiration , although many of these pictures continue to relie on the blue-green associated with ancient Chinese landscape painting . These ' splashed color paintings ' were often created in a traditional ' distemper ' media of mineral pigment suspended in animal collagen glue and are more durable than the frequently employed misnomer label ' watercolor ' implies . Although Chang Dai-chien reiterated that Tang Dynasty p'omo , or splashed ink , models were the inspiration for these works , there is clearly some Western influence at play . More than the often cited resemblance to concurrent international developments in Abstract Expressionism , these paintings evoke the tradition of Romanticism , and can be related to the Eighteenth Century atmospheric works of Turner and especially Victor Hugo ( see figure X ) 16 , whose ink blot drawings seem to embody Leonardo 's famous encouragement to find new compositions in random stains . The noted Japanese-American artist/teacher Saburo Hasegawa is recorded as saying that Chinese landscape paintings function as Buddhist ch'an teaching , as deeply instructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The passionate late- 1960s paintings by Chang Dai-chien seem far removed from expectations of Buddhist detachment , but perhaps say a great deal about ch'an teaching of balance in a chaotic universe and the " formlessness underlying form " described by Lao-tsu . <p> Chang Dai-chien continued to create more traditional works in the style of Shi-tao ( see Section 1 ) and others during this period , as well as huge handscrolls such as ' 10,000 Miles of the Yangzte River ' and ' View of Huangshan Mountain , ' although the larger scale and more densely pigmented works were painted in the Brazil studio during these years where the artist 's most experienced mounting assistant provided crucial help during the painting process . Several landscapes painted during and after 1967 resemble California locations the cliffs of Big Sur and the hills of the Coastal Range . In an interview published in May 1970 , Chang Dai-chien explained that he was " busily absorbing Carmel into his being and hope(d) to soon be able to paint Carmel in the Chinese manner . " 18 Although far from photographic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to California locations is an important aspect of Chang Dai- chien 's paintings after 1967 ( see Section X ) . Even the artist 's late masterpiece , ' The Panorama of Mount Lu , ' strongly recalls aspects of the granite cliffs and timberline vegetation of Yosemite and the Sierra range , which the artist visited on many occasions19 , and might be in part related to the California landscape he absorbed . Chang Dai-chien loved traveling20 and visited many other locations in the Western United States , including Grand Canyon ( which he admired but felt was not appropriate as a subject for painting21 ) and Mono Lake . The artist experimented with alternative media during his years in California , including painting on wood and fiberglass ( see Catalog x ) , working with acrylic paint , and creating two suites of lithographs ( see Catalog x ) . These dozen lithographs were printed at San Francisco 's Editions Press , as part of a project organized by collector Wil Fountain . The artist also experimented with autobiographical writing and documenting aspects of his career during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for exhibition at San Francisco 's Asian Art Museum , and a bilingual book of poems , musings , and rather technical essays about painting edited by Edward H. Hsung was published in 1975 . A major publication project with the National Museum of History of Taiwan , begun in the mid-1970s , eventually led to a seven volume set of books which included both reproductions and reprints of some of his essays . <p> The professional highlight of Chang Dai-chien 's years in Northern California was the major retrospective presented in 1972 by the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco , which was later described in one account as " the greatest exhibition in Chinese history.22 " That exhibition presented several mural scale works as part of the gathering of one work from each year of Chang Dai-chien 's professional career , and its breadth has become the model for many of the subsequent exhibitions of his work . Noted San Francisco art critic Alfred Frankenstein reviewed the exhibition , and wrote very positively about the splashed ink works which seemed to him to be " both ancient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frankenstein dismissed the artist 's more traditional works , writing " one feels that Chang Dai-chien came into his own only when he shook off the weight of the ancient dynasties he had carried for so long on his shoulders . " Frankenstein 's review reads as thoughtful and informed , but ended on a note of suspicion about the artist 's late works . He wrote that these works resemble a slightly drunken collaboration of Franz Kline and Hans Hofmann , with a few asides from Jackson Pollock and a splash or two from Adolf Gottleib ( . We ) are likely to respond with special delight because we know and appreciate the references . Perhaps , in other words , Chang Dai-chien has n't been reborn at all ; perhaps he has merely changed the field of his allusions.23 <p> More recent American press about Chang Dai-chien has been preoccupied with only one aspect of Chang Dai-chien 's career : his relationship to forgery . The excellent 1991 retrospective at the Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution organized by Fu Shen generated a host of reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1998 , the New Yorker Magazine completely erroneously labeled the artist 's 1945 original masterpiece ' Tibetan Women and Mastiff a " fake , " 24 and a 1999 article in the Washington Post Magazine entitled " The Master " Forger " quoted a description of the artist as " nefarious. " 25 Although the artist created , sold and publicly boasted about his " forgeries , " the consideration of Chang Dai-chien 's relationship to issues of identity , authorship and history is one of the most central and complex issues of his oeuvre ( see Catalog x ) , representing his " high aesthetic game . " 26 These works simultaneously function as demonstrations of Chang Dai-chien 's teaching and artistic philosophy . The myopic fixation on ' forgery ' in the American press and total disregard for the artist 's original achievement says more about our national psyche and its passion for scandal than demonstrating any understanding of the issues in Chang Dai- chien 's art . <p> Although the towns of the Monterey Peninsula have became widely known as havens for golfers , movie stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long history as an art colony . Many writers and countless visual artists were drawn to its sparking light and rugged coastal landscape . Chang Dai-chien can be related to the California Impressionists , Tonalists and f-64 photographers ( see figure f ; Catalog x ) who worked there . His work can be placed in a lineage of Asian trained painters , many of whom remain more well known in their country of ancestry than adopted homeland ; these include Chiura Obata , whose distinctive Asian American style depicting some of the same locations painted by Chang Dai-chien ( see figure g ) reminds us that both artists were influenced by the Nihonga movement ( the modernization of historical styles ) as young students in Japan . <p> Another California model for appreciating the American context for Chang Dai-chien is the artistic activity of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in California during the 1930s : their differences of language and dress similarly announced an immersion in different art historical and political pasts . Chang Dai-chien 's influence may not be as immediately evident ; indeed , few American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and California art histories include no mention of his life and work here . This erasure seems peculiar considering the art press Chang Dai-chien generated during the years he lived here27 , but can be related to the drain of most of the artist 's most important California period paintings to collections in Asia . Nevertheless it is important to acknowledge that , although he did not teach formally in America , Chang Dai-chien had many American students and disciplesv28 . Chang Dai-chien is also the most important Chinese painter of this Century to demonstrate the vitality possible in a fusion of Eastern and Western traditions and approaches to painting . His blending of elements including iconography , themes and structures from Chinese art history with innovative contemporary ideas mark him as a precursor of international Postmodernism ; yet , his emphatic Sino-centric foundation insists on the appreciation of his work within the context of Chinese art history . His career in California reminds us that a vast history of ink painters and other traditional artists enjoy a parallel audience and market in California , recorded in Chinese language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This suggests that art historians must expand the notion of California art to embrace Chinese traditional genres . The appreciation of Chang Dai-chien 's achievement requires that we educate ourselves about the Asian art history which is the foundation of his innovations , and causes us to rethink what we know about American art . Chang Dai-chien 's passion for rigorous training in drawing and pictorial composition have import for artists in any tradition , and his work appeals across the East/West " regional divergence of custom ' ' that he personally eschewed . Perhaps the current interest in contemporary Chinese artists should begin by acknowledging Chang Dai-chien 's unparalleled advancement of Chinese painting in America . <p> LONG ... <p> notes : <p> 1 Several friends of the artist from the period use the work ' charismatic ' to describe his personality , perhaps because , as Rene-Yvon Lefebvre de'Argence writes , in his 1973 ArtNews article , Chang Dai-chien lived into his seventies " with all the enthusiasm , curiosity and urge for daring experimentations that are usually associated with youth .

@@79925722 @1425722/ <p> This Tibetan offertory cover is a rare and exceptional object which has until now only been described briefly ( figs. 1-4 , below ) ( 0 ) . It is a head , skinned rather than stripped of flesh , in gilt iron with traces of colour - red for the mouth and blue for the hair ; it is 36 cm in height , 19 cm in diameter at the ears and 16 cm at the base . The information indicating that Giuseppe Tucci wrote an article on the subject has not yet been verified , his archives being sealed . However , using the information obtained in his research , we will try to support the hypothesis of the objects function in rituals , and this will lead us to India , Gandhara and Tibet . <p> Fig. 1 <p> Fig. 2 <p> Fig. 3 <p> Fig. 4 <p> In certain plates of the secret visions of the fifth Dalai-Lama ( pl. 3 , 18 ) ( 1 ) , a skull is used to contain the burnt parts of the lingam , the modelled or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the skull hidden in the ground . According to the tradition told by the inheritors of the ancient owners of this object those who made reference to studies by Tucci - it was used to cover the offerings of soma in Tantric ceremonies involving a mandala , various offerings , torma ( sacrificial cakes ) and ritual objects . <p> Soma itself is a sacred drink , which sometimes becomes the god Soma . Its composition has given rise to many interpretations . It is sometimes sarcostemma viminale or asclepias acida , and can lead to divine exhilaration , perhaps with added hallucinogenic substances such as hemp . The composition varies according to the type and place of the ritual . Some rituals require plants to be ground up during the ceremony , indicating that they were collected locally . <p> Fig. 6 <p> Certain Siva traditions consider sperm as soma . A fair number of hymn texts describe Siva or Indra ejaculating into the mouth of Agni , the god of fire . Representations of this episode are to be found , notably , on bas relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orissa ( fig. 6 , left ) . In hymn no . VI of the Rig Veda , section eight , are the lines : <p> " O Agni , the holocaust has been hurled into your mouth , as the ghrita is poured into the spoon and the soma into the sacred vase . Give us great and glorious opulence , to assure us of abundance , renown and power . " ( 2 ) <p> More explicit still , in the Siva-Svarupa : " In the sacrifice of Soma , the liquid soma is drunk by the priests . " This is just the exoteric rite corresponding to the interior rite in which the chalice of divine liqueur is itself the body of the man , and the elixir of life is absorbed to become the potion of immortality . The senses are the cups in which the divine potion can be drunk . The essence of the procreative energy is produced in the nether regions , in the south , where the ancestors live . The purified seed rises gradually to the head and is received in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , it flows to the nerve centres . And so the Soma becomes the god of the north ( of the head ) . <p> The head is like an inverted cup . The re-absorption of the semen is presented as the absorption of the potion of immortality . This process demands absolute mental control and can only be accomplished by the perfect practice of yoga techniques . Only the yogi drinks the ambrosia that the ordinary man dissipates . Siva is represented as being constantly intoxicated by this potion , of which the cup , shaped like a crescent moon , shines by his forehead . In the symbolism of the physical body , the vital energy ( prana ) is represented as a snake ( naga ) and the king of the birds , Garuda , eater of snakes , is the sperm . Only the gods , divinities of the senses , are capable of appropriating it . The soma makes them impotent , this elixir of life , shining around Indra , the celestial king , who is the essential self , the atman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends mans energy , his power to know and to act . By using this substance he destroys himself or becomes immortal . So , the seed , which is a poison for the proud , brings peace and light to the man who knows how to control his passions . Misused by those who are anti-gods , the potion becomes toxic , making them uncoordinated , and shortening their lives . Siva drinks the poisoned part of this energy and calms its flames so that the gods can drink the ambrosia . Siva is the yogi who penetrated the five vital energy centres which bar the path to reintegration . Only after passing through the five centres can the yogi master his desire and acquire the power to drink the poison and to purify the ambrosia. ( 3 ) <p> Despite the recurring sexual aspect , these rituals are diverse , and linked . Copulation is referred to in obscure and symbolic terms . The passages concerning ejaculation are the most obscure of all . What is clear is that the face of the shakti is the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woman . The many quotations produced by Jayaratha prove that a very complex and serious literature existed on this subject , and is unfortunately lost today . In a commentary on the difficult stanza on page 91 , verse 128 , Jayaratha explains that the sperm should pass first into the womans mouth and then into the mans , to be finally collected in a sacred recipient . Several stanzas from agamas are quoted to support this idea . Abhinavagupta himself discusses several different forms of ejaculation , all corroborated by the authority of the ancients . ( 4 ) <p> Tucci analyses the text of Tantraloka of Abhinavagupta , the 11th-century Hindu author who discusses Kundagolaka , an offering consisting of sperm and shonita - the feminine secretion - collected in a sacred vessel and consumed by the officiant . " Certain practices of advanced initiation of the rNin ma pa of Tibet also confirm that such a substance could have been consumed . These practices indicate the great influence of Sivaistic Tantric literature . The reason is that kundagolaka is the counterpart to cit or citta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisoned in time and space . The ceremonial ( ) reproduces the process of creation ( visarga ) and re-absorption , of reintegration of the only reality : primordial conscience , Siva , as a pure and unshakeable potential . " ( 5 ) <p> Other texts relate the consumption by a disciple of concoctions containing the sperm of their guru or the sperm of elders being consumed by novices . Giuseppe Tucci refers to an object originating in Gandhara that he studied and which would seem to be connected to this tradition . It is a three-faced pedestal representing three sculpted images , one of which is a person masturbating . On the top was a rectangular hollow , apparently used to receive the kundagolaka . Mircea Eliade took Tuccis discovery as an indication of the connection between this object and the metaphysical concept of the rites of the Akula Tantric school . Tuccis translations of the terms connected to the school Kula means Cakti , akula is Siva ; akulavira is a solitary hero ; he is all things , " he is neither Siva nor Cakti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the very old Sivaistic traditions of secret sexual practices dating back to the first century AD which already took place in rituals of which references can be found in later texts . Hiung-tsang had noticed this during his journey in India in the first half of the 7th century , as well as a considerable decline in Buddhism , particularly in Uddiyana , and an increase in Tantric practices . ( 6 ) <p> Eliade notes that the region of Gandhara was an important centre of Sivaism , a decadent philosophy belonging to the Siva cult , and that a certain number of currents resulting from it developed in Swat , the home area of Padmasambhava , who introduced Tantric forms to Tibet . At this period Matsyendranatha and Goraksanatha appeared in Uddiyana . They were apostles of Sivaistic Tantrism , creators of the Goraksanathi sect , itself derived from Kapalika . Adepts of Kapalika ( " carriers of a human skull ( as ornament ) " ) are described offering sacrifices of human flesh to the fire , becoming drunk , drinking from skulls , " dealers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rasaratnasamuccaya treatise , which is attributed to Nagarjuna , it is said : " Only those who love the truth , have vanquished temptation , worshipped the gods , are in complete self-control and are used to fasting and following a proper diet - they alone can take part in alchemy . " P.C. Ray explains that the " laboratory " had to be set up in the forest , far from any impure presence , that the disciple had to respect his master and venerate Siva , for alchemy was revealed by the god Siva himself ; he also had to erect a mercurial phallus to Siva and participate in certain erotic rituals ... ( 7 ) Ray concludes by saying that this illustrates quite clearly the symbiosis between alchemy and Tantrism . <p> Certain texts recommend the use of an occiput ( 7 ) as a recipient for transformation , the skull being the recipient of thought and intellect ; the combination skull-iron to cover a sperm-feminine secretion offering could transform the offertory cover into an athanor and transmute the offering into magic elixir . <p> Padmasambhava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practised initiation , or at the very least spent time in a region and a culture where these rituals were current , and could not have been unaware of them , probably actually being involved in them himself . He is thought to be the founder of the rNin ma pa from whom the secret visions of the fifth Dalai-Lama were derived . It is logical that the Tantric rites should have influenced Buddhism and have been present in this Buddhist school and in its rites . The offertory cover can thus be seen as an integral part of the magic spirit of the rNin ma pa . <p> If the nature of the offering that the object covered was imbued with magic , the very metal of which it was made would accentuate certain aspects and probably reinforce the virtues . The magical-religious aspects of iron have been noted in many cultures , particularly in Asia . Already in 1907 , J. Goldziher had a thick file on the qualities of iron in combating demons . ( 8 ) <p> This function of iron pertains to a very archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with figurines made of iron in the shape or with the function of bones , so that the shaman appeared like , or was seen to represent , a skeleton . Some of these observations are considerably beyond our geographical area , the Himalayas , but the connections between these shamanist rituals and certain Tibetan rituals and traditions are so numerous that they must be taken into consideration . <p> Fig. 5 <p> In some cases , during his initiation the shaman sees himself torn apart by demons armed with iron hooks who , after cleaning the bones and scraping the flesh , put the skeleton together again with pieces of iron . This dismemberment can also be carried out by a bird of prey with beak , claws , and feathers of iron . Finally , accounts recount the entry of the future shaman into a cave-matrix where he meets a blacksmith who tears up and boils the skeleton , then puts it back together with iron while re-forging the head and ornaments of his future costume . ( 9 ) <p> These accounts are fairly similar to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charnel-houses , with horns made of human femurs , to call up and confront terrible divinities in the tcheud ritual described , notably by Alexandra David-NTel. ( 10 ) These macabre rituals could also finish with a ritual dismemberment of the officiant by the dankinis or other terrifying beings . <p> All these Shamanist traditions can be compared to Vedic traditions concerning the vajva , or diamond-lightning , a weapon of Indra . When the sage Dadhici died , all the Asouras ( demonic beings in whom he inspired panic ) recovered their power and invaded the earth , holding Indra in check . The god Indra started looking for Saint Richi Dadhici , unaware of the latters death . He received the news at the same time as the information according to which his bones had the power of thunder against the Asouras . His skull was found in Lake Saryavar and forged by Tvashtri , the artisan of the sky , in the shape of vajra , or diamond-lightning , which is found in Tantric rituals , to dominate the demoniac forces . This vajra also allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dammed up . It was in smashing Vrtras skull that this water was freed . In the myth of Indras dismemberment , the chronicles tell that the body of the god , intoxicated by an excess of soma , began to flow away , " giving birth to all kinds of creatures , plants and metals . " With Indra being the master of thunder , the vajra are often said to be made of the iron from meteorites , which is certainly not always the case , but tradition often takes precedence over reality . We do not know if the offertory cover was made of this celestial iron . Nathalie Bazin of the Guimet museum ( 8 ) , said that the analyses carried out so far had not been able to confirm the truth of this tradition . <p> The perfection of the offertory cover allows the supposition that it could originate from Derdge , in eastern Tibet . When it was exhibited at Madrid , it was said to be from the 17th/18th century . Understanding the difficulty of dating such an atypical piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period when iron-working reached its apogee . <p> It may seem surprising , in dealing with an object of Tantric Buddhism , to have recourse to references of Hindu texts . There seem to be more texts and traces of Indian , rather than Tibetan , origin . In the Tibetan context , this ritual is limited to the rNin ma pa who , despite having had a definite influence at the highest religious levels , did not occupy the most important positions . The 2002 exhibition at the Guimet museum showed this . What is more , this ritual was heretical enough for its existence not to be divulged .

The deviant forms of Buddhism were rejected , the old rules of monastic discipline re-established and texts thought to be too compromising were often attributed to the Bon-po . <p> For all these reasons , the rituals and the currents of thought which could have been attached to this Tantric movement of Indian Sivaistic origin have remained secret .

@@79925730 @1425730/ <p> A variety of different coinage was in use in ancient China until the First Emperor of China unified the currency during the Qin dynasty with the banliang ( " half ounce " or four zhu ) coin , which was round with a central square hole . This standardization of coinage was part of a broader plan to consolidate political and administrative power that included standardizing weights and measures ( see cat . nos. 20 , 21 ) as well as axle widths to make countrywide communication more effective . The banliang coins typically weigh between ten and six grams . In 118 BCE a new coin type , the wuzhu ( five zhu ) coin ( cat . no. 19 ) , was introduced by the Han emperor Wudi ( r. 14187 BCE ) . The wuzhu coin weighed on average 3.5 grams and remained in circulation for over seven hundred years .

Metal molds , such as for our wuzhu coins ( cat . no. 19 ) , would have been backed with a disposable earthenware mold , which aided in gas absorption , and the two would have been secured with iron clamps along the two brackets on the back of the secondary mold .

@@79925731 @1425731/ <p> This is the largest early Tibetan thanka known to survive , an exemplar of the size and majesty that these paintings could achieve . The basic format of the picture is typical : a large main figure flanked by two willowy standing bodhisattvas-in this case Padmapani to the right and Avalokiteshvara to the left--and a chorus of seated figures above them . Above the head of the Buddha are three lamas , probably Atisha ( in the center ) flanked by two abbots , both of whom wear monastic robes . Below the main figure is a row of five deities ; four of them are seated against throne backs with the typical double upper rails surmounted by foliate scrolls . At the far right is a seated Green Tara in lalitasana ( a posture of ease ) . To her right are two four-armed seated deities . The first is Shadakshari Lokeshvara flanked by two diminutive attendants : Manidhara ( to his right ) and Shakadakshari Mahavidya ( to his left ) ; 1 the second is possibly a four-armed yellow Manjushri . The fourth figure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne . He too is flanked by two small attendants , a ferocious kneeling red deity and perhaps another depiction of Shakadakshari Lokeshvara . Lastly , at the far left is a horrific standing figure of Mahakala trampling on a prostrate Ganesha ( the elephant-headed son of Shiva ) . He is attended by a small kneeling donor figure wearing a simple monastic robe and assuming anjali mudra , the gesture of adoration , toward him . <p> Several features of the painting point to an early date . If the group of lamas above the Buddha is understood as an incipient lineage , like that seen in the Ford Tara ( cat . no , 3 ) , this would seem to indicate a date of about 1100 . The form of the Buddha 's double lotus seat and the unusually tall and narrow nimbus are very close to those of the Kronos Amoghasiddhi ( cat . no. 4 ) , although the Buddha 's halo is more ovoid . The standing attendant bodhisattvas , although much more attenuated , are closer to that early prototype--particularly in the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened and stylized . The chorus of ten listeners is also like in number to that seen in the Kronos painting : most later ones depict six or eight . It is interesting that the outer figures in the lower tier , although crowned , have neither an ushnisha , the cranial protuberance indicative of transcendent wisdom , nor the tall chignon usually associated with bodhisattvas ( see also cat . nos. 1 , 4 ) . This difference would seem to indicate that the chorus was composed of a variety of divine beings ( also , perhaps , bodhisattvas , in different states of progress toward enlightenment ) . Despite these connections , the Buddha lacks the spatial coherence of the earlier picture and points the way to later derivations of the eastern Indian style . The central position of Atisha and the two flanking monks would seem to justify an attribution to a Kadampa monastery . SMK

Since the early 1980s , Tibetans have been allowed to reactivate and repair surviving monasteries--but far too often the repairs are shoddy and damage the traditional character of these venerable buildings . Our goal is to save some of the last intact monasteries on the eastern plateau . Internationally known experts are teaching Tibetans how to repair traditional buildings while retaining as much original material as possible . We are also educating Tibetans in the techniques of mural conservation , so that they can preserve their own priceless artistic heritage . <p> Background <p> Map showing location of project sites . <p> Tibetans are often cited as the most religious people in the world . Their Buddhist beliefs have inspired them , over the centuries , to construct immense and spectacular monasteries which rank among the most important architectural achievements in Asia . The buildings are focal points for a faith that teaches peace , compassion , and respect for all living things , and are inhabited by monks who make the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tibet , like most other religious sites of China , sustained heavy losses during the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution . Luckily some obscure and difficult-to-reach monasteries survived ; however the buildings have been poorly maintained , and moreover have suffered the effects of weather and natural disasters such as earthquakes . Nowadays in China religious practice is not only permitted , but is undergoing a great revival . All over the Tibetan plateau , ( which extends far beyond the boundaries of Tibet Autonomous Region into the provinces of Qinghai , Sichuan , and Yunnan ) monasteries are again opening their doors to prospective students . Coincident with this boom is a frenzy of rebuilding as monasteries reopen their doors to huge numbers of aspiring students . <p> Conservation team travels by horse caravan from Baiya to Palpung . <p> Ironically , it 's this very rebuilding effort that places Tibet 's finest architectural achievements in great danger . Because Tibetans are so eager to get monasteries up and running again , old structures are gutted and rebuilt using non-traditional materials and shoddy technique . Many outstanding examples of Tibetan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The reason for this is simple : Tibetans lack knowledge of modern conservation techniques . They do not know how to , for example , splice good wood into a partially rotten timber , or how to detach murals before rebuilding a wall . Teaching these skills is one major purpose of our program . The other is to restore some of Tibet 's most notable architectural achievements before they are lost for all time . <p> Conservation Training Sites : Palpung and Baiya Monasteries <p> Mural painting in informal style . <p> With support from the Getty Grant Program , in 1991 the China Exploration and Research Society conducted a survey of 18 monasteries in western Sichuan province , documenting their history , architectural design , and current condition . The expedition focused on western Sichuan Province , Ganzi Prefecture , which has many architecturally significant monasteries . As a result , two outstanding candidates were selected for restoration . <p> Ornate ceiling of Situ Rinpoche 's quarters in Palpung . <p> The first monastery selected is Palpung Gonpa . Palpung 's main building is remarkable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid that it has been called the " Little Potala Palace " after the Dalai Lama 's famous ( former ) home in the Tibetan capital . Palpung ( " Babang " in Chinese ) is traditionally a major teaching center for the Karma Kagyu sect , each year receiving many young scholars . Located in a forested valley six horseback-hours from the nearest motorable road , Palpung has suffered both from neglect during the Cultural Revolution and an earthquake that struck in 1993 , bringing portions of the building to the verge of collapse . Repair of Palpung Monastery is a complex and expensive engineering project that is well beyond the capacity of local resources , yet if the work is not done soon the building will have to be abandoned--this would mean the loss of an architectural masterpiece . <p> Northeast courtyard of Palpung shows movement of major structures . <p> Four hours ' travel from Palpung lies our second target : tiny Baiya Gonpa . This Sakya sect monastery is famous for its numerous finely-done and historically significant murals , which are in serious danger as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are one of the few remaining examples of a style developed in the Dege Kingdom ( now county ) over the last few centuries . Besides showing images of Buddhist deities , they also depict the court of King Dengba Tsering , who once ruled twenty-five tribes on the eastern plateau . The masterful technique displayed in these murals is far superior to modern works ; conservation of Baiya 's murals and building will allow them to be studied and enjoyed by future generations . <p> Program Impact Beyond the Initial Sites <p> The impact of our conservation work will spread far beyond Palpung and Baiya , for well-trained engineers and conservators will find their skills in demand all over the Tibetan plateau . Moreover , some of their skills will be applicable to ordinary Tibetan homes . Tibetan architecture in general has several design deficiencies that we plan to address , most notably resistance against earthquakes . Also , leaking roofs and poor interior ventilation are health hazards that can be remedied using inexpensive materials and only minor changes of design . Thus , not only will this project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quality of life for ordinary Tibetans . <p> Another effect of the program will be to instill in Tibetans an appreciation for their past . Already more educated Tibetans realize the value of preservation , but rural people ( whose sons represent the majority of the monk population ) tend to consider mural paintings as offerings , not as treasures to be cherished and preserved . A large scale--and expensive--conservation project will spread the word to ordinary farmers and herdsmen that their cultural legacy is indeed valuable--not only to them , but to the world at large . <p> Work Completed So Far <p> In 1991 , with funding from the Getty Grant Program , the China Exploration and Research Society surveyed eighteen monasteries , producing a report that contained never-before-documented building plans , histories , economic data . As a result , Palpung and Baiya were identified as outstanding candidates for conservation . Based on this work the project was selected by Rolex for an Honorary Award for Enterprise . <p> In 1994 two expeditions were fielded to further document the condition of the most important targets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Palpung and Baiya , and decided what other conservation expertise is needed . Funds were provided to both monasteries for timber acquisition in preparation for future work . <p> In 1996 extensive restoration work is slated to begin at both Baiya and Palpung Monasteries . Although the groundwork has been laid for participation of conservation expert John Sanday to lead the construction effort , as yet not enough funds have been raised to pay for his return journey to Dege County . The leaders of both monasteries have decided that they can not wait any longer ; therefore traditional methods of repair will be used for the initial work . <p> A field team visiting Palpung in May , 1996 found that rotten timbers were being torn out and a part of the roof replaced , but no innovative technologies had been incorporated due to lack of expert guidance . At Baiya , work is scheduled to begin in autumn .

@@79925747 @1425747/ <p> Criss-crossed by trade routes since time immemorial , the earliest historic records of Tibet in the 7th century describe a flourishing kingdom actively engaged in political and matrimonial alliances with rival tribes and foreign powers . This was a period of intense economic and cultural exchange coinciding with the political consolidation and extension of Tibetan territory which lasted until mid-9th century . Exposed to Buddhism and Buddhist art by their conquests , the Tibetans maintained a distinctive religion centered around their Emperor , the Tsenpo , the mightiest warrior whose sacred character and burial rites were linked to a cult of mountain deities . The earliest Tibetan sculptures known are related to this religion , for example stone lion statues 1 meter high to guard the royal tombs , small horses with elaborate saddle and tack in hammered gold with granulation discovered in central Tibet , as well as a gilt silver deer excavated from a tomb in Dulan ( Qinghai ) 1 . A gilt silver reliquary excavated from the same tomb indicates that already by mid-8th century , the Tibetans had developed a syncretic burial cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rites . 2 The introduction of Buddhism and Buddhist art was part of a complex interaction economic , cultural and political which was progressively transforming Tibetan society from the mid-7th to mid-9th century . To appreciate how the Tibetans developed their distinctive fusion and adaptation of foreign styles and techniques , we will examine here the multiple influences inspired by the arts of Central Asia and China , as well as of India and the Kashmiri and Nepalese schools . Indeed , just as the Tibetan priests had created eclectic burial cults by accumulation of diverse elements , it became the hallmark of great Tibetan artists to observe regional styles and absorb them by accommodating them , by blending them into a new mode sometimes several simultaneously . We will first examine the esthetic characteristics of the most ancient metalwork to see how this process of fusion and adaptation of foreign influences was accomplished , and subsequently we will examine these tendencies in the sculptures which the Tibetans made to honor the Buddhist religion . <p> Metalwork of the Tibetan Empire <p> Since the imperial period , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills for fine and base metal . In base metal , military objectives led to the development of sophisticated technology of suspension chain-link bridges and scale armor during the Tibetan empire . 3 <p> Fig. 1 <p> The earliest traces of Tibetan sculpture in metal are gold artifacts found in central Tibet attributed by archeologists to the 7th to 8th century . The 7th century Tibetan goldsmiths were frequently cited by the Tang Annals for remarkable objects used in ceremonies , such as a fabulous golden ewer , shaped like a goose more than 2 meters high . 4 Ancient Tibetan historical sources describe silver jugs shaped like birds 5 , or a finial of a bird or camel head at the top of an ewer . In fact , a spectacular hammered and gilt silver jug attributed to 8th to 9th century Tibetan workmanship has been conserved in the Lhasa Jokhang since the 17th century : 80 cm high , it holds 35 litres of liquid , with gilded designs in raised scrolling for heart medallions and three scenes of central Asian dancers and men in drunken revelry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Central Asian neighbours whose crowns , facial features and long curly hair were all very different from their own appearance . The nape of the jug has a motif of stylized Tang coins , while the animal head belongs to a mythical animal , a one-horned deer , known in Chinese as the qilin . This accumulation of discrete elements has led to an unusual form of ewer which harmonizes the diverse elements . Another remarkable ancient Tibetan silver object is a cast silver vase with parcel gilding in the recess of the floral designs ; it bears an inscription in Tibetan letters written in the distinctive form of punctuation and spelling used during the Tibetan empire . ( Fig.1 ) . The shape and proportions of this vase are those of the classical Indian kalasha however the principal designs represent fantastic creatures , such as a part-bird , part horse hybrid among elaborate vines and foliage . While the vine scrolls and flowers may have been introduced to China from the west during the Tang , the hybrid creatures are far from sinicized stylistic conventions of fantasy animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocabularies , the vase represents a totally new and ingenious mode of creation . Technically , however , the vase is cast in a traditional Nepalese manner similar cast and embossed vases are made even to this day by the Newar craftsmen of Kathmandu . This indicates assimilation of technique as well as esthetic elements . Both the silver jug in the Jokhang and the silver vase in the Pritzker collection corroborate the high quality of Tibetan skills in metalwork as described in the ancient historical sources simultaneously they reveal and demonstrate this exceptional creative process which integrated multi-cultural elements to form a new idiom . While Sassanian Iran and Sogdian central asia may be the ultimate source of the art of hammered gold and silver and the inspiration of many floral and medallion designs circulating in Tibet and China during this period , it may be argued that the Tibetans fused diverse Central Asian and Chinese design motifs and substituted other metallurgical techniques in the creation of their metal objects . <p> The Earliest Buddhist sculptures in Tibet <p> According to the Tibetan Annals , the principal tribute received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast quantity of Buddhist sculptures of many countries from this period which remained in Tibet obliges us to recognize that the Tibetans may have been the earliest collectors of Buddhist art on earth ! <p> Fig. 2 <p> To understand the Buddhist sculpture which reached Tibet , it is essential to review the multitude of styles the Tibetans encountered by their conquests and their expansionist campaigns in all directions , from the Silk Route to the Himalayas . The powerful empire of the Tuyuhun , based near Kokonor , was the first foreign conquest by Tibet , ca. 637 , immediately followed by the subjugation of the nearby Tangut and Sumpa tribes . This led the Tibetan troops to raid the Chinese border , a threat which was concluded by a marriage alliance between China and Tibet . The young Chinese princess left Xian for Tibet in 641 , inaugurating a period of lively cultural exchange . Chinese literature and silks reached Tibet with the princess . Did she introduce Buddhism to Tibet ? This is unlikely , due to her youth . However later traditions attribute this role to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even small sculptures reached Tibet during this period ( see show : item No 21 . N.Wei Buddha ) . 7 In the following decades , Tibetan conquests along the Silk Route , from Khotan , to Kashgar , Kucha and eventually Dunhuang , amply exposed them to many schools of Buddhism and Buddhist art of Central Asia and China . To the south , in 648 Tibetan troops assured protection of a Chinese pilgrim en route to India via Nepal . Tibetan involvement in Nepalese politics began ca. 624 when a break in the succession of the Licchavi dynasty led the Licchavi king Narendradeva to seek asylum in Tibet . He is understood to have been present in Lhasa with his court . Assisted by Tibetan support , he returned to Nepal in 643 where he was victorious in his quest for power . Narendradevas presence in Lhasa may be linked to the activity of Nepalese artists in Tibet since these earliest historical political relations in mid-seventh century . Although there is a famous description by a 7th century Chinese pilgrim of the Nepalese king on official visits " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole the Licchavi kings were Hindus who showed reverence to Buddhism . 8 This is reflected by earliest dated sculpture in the Kathmandu valley , the royal sculptural commission of a colossal recumbent Vishnu lying on the naga serpents ( length 7 meters ) carved in 641 in a pond north of Kathmandu ( Fig. 2 ) 9 . The esthetics of Licchavi Nepal were directly inspired by late Gupta India for both Hindu and Buddhist art . The very smooth still body of Vishnu lies poised above the coils of the naga sensually winding in the water beneath the god . The Licchavi sculptors excelled in smooth modeling with simple and naturalistic treatment of garments . In Tibet , the impact in Lhasa of the presence of Narendradeva may be seen in the carvings in wood of the Lhasa Jokhang , traditionally believed to be the earliest Buddhist sanctuary in Lhasa . ( Fig. 3 , below ) . Here one will find a peacock beside the amorous couple cavorting on the lintels , their garments and distinctive earrings directly inspired by Licchavi models such as this female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupa in Kathmandu . ( Fig. 4 , below ) The slender body with tubular legs and arms and the spiritual expression of her face characterize Licchavi sculpture as does the peculiar way of aligning the toes , heels and legs to form an unbroken line . 10 It was not only in the vicinity of Lhasa where this esthetic was appreciated for in a rock sculpture carved in Eastern Tibet , the Buddha Vairocana exhibits similar body proportions and the distinctive alignment ( Fig. 5 , below ) . This sculpture is dated by inscription to 816 AD . It is remarkable for the bodies of the Buddha and his bodhisattva attendants all display the similar body proportions . The Chinese stylistic conventions to portray Buddha in voluminous folds of monastic robes have not been followed , and upon closer inspection , an Indian dhoti would probably be visible at the thighs . The legs and feet are presented in full lotus position ( vajra paryanka asana ) . The lotus pedestal is composed in two levels . The upper section has one layer of large , rounded petals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat petals , symmetrically aligned about the circular medallion at the top of the thick lotus stem . In these aspects , Nepalese esthetics have inspired the sculptors . However , the canopy above the Buddha and Bodhisattva is a canopy inspired by paintings and sculptures in Dunhuang , typical of Chinese Buddhist art along the Silk Route , while the lions beneath the thone recall those carved to guard the Tibetan tombs . <p> Fig. 3 <p> Fig. 4 <p> Fig. 5 <p> Indeed , the impact of the Tibetan occupation of the city-oases of the Silk Route , intermittently from mid-seventh century until 850 AD , had been contact with the Indo-Hellenic cultures prevalent in Central Asia as well as the Confucian , Taoist and Buddhist traditions of China . During the same period , and with fluctuating success , Tibet controlled or exacted tribute in the Pamirs , notably from 720-740 the kingdom of Bolor ( now Gilgit ) . In 740 , a Tibetan princess was sent to cement the alliance with the Gilgit royalty . Earlier , a mission from Gilgit had presented tribute in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tibetans to the canons of Buddhist art then prevailing in Gilgit , which was strongly influenced by neighbouring Kashmir . The plump oval face with low spherical usnisa , widows peak hairline , elongated almond eyes , narrow arched eyebrows , straight pointed nose , small lips , narrow chin and fleshy neck are the typical features of the Buddhas sculpted in both regions , whose garments clinging to the body in rippled folds . The mid-7th century standing Buddha from Kashmir ( Cat . No. 81 ) already presents these characteristics ; their persistence may be seen in the seated Buddha from Gilgit now conserved in the Potala ( Cat . No. 80 ) . The Tibetans occupied Khotan from the late 7th century , and in Domoko , Khotan , where Tibetan documents were found , so were small clay votive plaques ( tsa tsa ) and a cast sculpture of a seated Buddha , probably from Gilgit ca. late 7th to early 8th century . 11 This sculpture bears great resemblance to the seated Gilgit Buddha of the Potala . Indeed , Tibetans encountered the Buddhist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their occupation of the oases along the Silk Route . Quite possibly the Gilgit Buddha now in the Potala was brought into Tibet directly from Gilgit shortly after its creation as this sculpture chronologically corresponds to the period of Tibetan occupation of Gilgit as well as the period when Gilgit presented tribute in central Tibet . <p> The seated Buddha from Gilgit has a fabric cushion with the inlay of copper and silver forming the patterns of roundel motifs which was also a characteristic of their esthetic grammar . The pearl roundel designs of Sassanian and Sogdian fabrics and coins traded from Persia and Samarkand during the sixth to 7th centuries made a long-lasting impact on Buddhist art throughout Asia due to the trade along the Silk Route and ancillary routes leading to India . 12 These designs showed a pearl medallion centered around a bird or animal , or confronted creatires . Roundel motifs reached Tibet via actual textiles imported to Tibet from China and Central Asia as well as the representations of these textiles in Buddhist sculpture . Similar designs were used in Licchavi coins , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins led the Tibetans to carve the roundel pattern with an elephant at center at the erected for the foundation of a 9th century Buddhist temple . 13 The roundel remained fashionable , for in Nepal , ca. 10th-11th century , it was adopted as a textile pattern for cushions beneath Vasudhara ( see Cat . No. 58 ) , where the roundel is cast in copper with traces of gilding , following Nepalese taste , rather than the inlay work of Kashmir or Gilgit . We will discuss below its presence in 11th century Tibet . <p> Fig. 6 <p> The clay sculptures of standing Bodhisattva in early ninth century sanctuaries in central Tibet display a clear influence of Buddhist art from along the Silk Route encountered through the occupations from Khotan to Dunhuang. 14 In addition to the art observed in occupied oases of the Silk Route , the Tibetans were exposed to Buddhist sculptures and illuminated manuscripts brought to Tibet by Indian , Kashmiri and Nepalese teachers in this period . Chinese and Korean monks were also present in Tibet . Translation programs began in earnest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first Buddhist monastery founded in 779 , historical sources inform us that clay Bodhisattva were modeled based on the physiognomy of local Tibetan people , by a miraculous Nepalese artist . The potential styles to be used were Indian , Nepalese , Chinese or Tibetan , reflecting the esthetic models the Tibetans then knew best . 15 Near Samye , the standing Bodhisattva and royalty attributed to early ninth century are also sculpted in clay on a wooden armature ( Fig. 6 ) . The elongated bodies are draped in garments reminiscent of Indian scarves and dhoti . These are not clinging to the body as Indian garments would tend to do , and the stiff bodies are far from the relaxed and sensual contours of Indian sculpture . The rigidity of the garments and the body postures reflects the esthetics of Buddhist art from the Silk Route . The high thin arched brows and almond eyes distantly recall those of the Gilgit Buddha , yet the broad face and full cheekbones reflect an admixture of Licchavi esthetics such as seen in the 816 Buddha carved in Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements characterizes the Tibetan sculpture . <p> The Flourishing of Buddhism 10th-14th century <p> Fig. 7 <p> By mid-tenth century , in the aftermath of the distintegration of the Tibetan Empire , the scions of the royal line had migrated west of central Tibet to the region of Guge , stretching from the Kailash to portions of what is now Ladakh . They proclaimed their commitment to Buddhism and sent envoys south to the great monastic universities in northeastern India and also to Kashmir to invite Buddhist masters and to bring orthodox teachings to their kingdom . Their program of mass translation was accompanied by the foundation of monasteries in Toling and nearby Tabo , where the original sculptures and paintings may still be admired today . The clay sculpture distinctly reflects Kashmiri esthetic influence by an emphasis on robust bodies with a strong physique : broad shoulders , powerful chest and abdominal muscles . There is a persistence of the facial features of the earlier phase : the high arched brows , elongated eyes and tiny lips . The kings of Guge had sent the monk Rinchen bzangpo as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate as well as sculptures acquired in Kashmir , and he was accompanied by numerous Kashmiri artists . In 996 , the royal family commissioned the casting of a special sculpture for the foundation of a sanctuary at Khojarnath . Contemporary documents describe it as " the Great Silver Image " which brings to mind literary accounts of massive sculptures in Kashmir , cast in gold , silver and copper described by the 12th century Kashmiri historian Kalhana. 16 However , later authors describe the Khojarnath sculpture as a collaborative work by two sculptors , the Kashmiri Wangula and the Nepalese Ashvadharma . While only their names have come down in history , the fame of the shrine at Khojarnath had wide renown . The Khojarnath " Great Silver Image " was destined to become one of the " cult " sculptures of Tibet , an image of which copies were made to emulate its sacred presence . 17 One such sculpture is a Padmapani now conserved in the Pritzker collection ( Fig. 7 ) . 18 This statue may well represent the epitome of Kashmiri esthetics as understood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest and abdomen , the inlay of silver eyes and copper stripes in the dhoti and the distinctive crown with crescent above a row of pearls were all frequent characteristics used by Kashmiri artists . Yet , the enlarged scale of the image , its largely unfinished back and Tibetan consecration prayers inserted in the sculpture all tend to indicate production in western Tibet , rather than in Kashmir . The silver eyes and copper stripes of the dhoti may be observed in the Western Tibetan sculpture of Vajrasattva and Varjadhatvisvari ( Cat . No. 11 ) . A slightly later sculpture strongly influenced by Kashmir but probably produced in Tibet is another aspect of Avalokiteshvara ( Cat . No. 33 ) where the back of the sculpture is fully finished but the attenuated facial features and certain variations in the mudra of the six hands tend to suggest production in Tibet , whether by Kashmiri artists working in Tibet or Tibetan artists working in Kashmiri style . Returning to the Pritzker Padmapani , one important feature is the appearance of a second earring in the upper ear lobe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ajanta for lay aristocratic females , as well as later Pala sculptures . 19 Although one example has been found in Kashmir , a 4th century sculpture of a goddess , this is infrequent in Kashmir and common in Gupta India and in Pala India . 20 It is however male bodhisattva who wear this earring in Tabo while it is worn by both male and female deities Alchi . Possibly this feature is the trace of an Indian artist from Magadha who was working in Toling around 1000 AD or possibly , it is the trace of Ashvadharma , the Nepalese sculptor traditionally renowned for his collaboration on the Khojarnath image . 21 Due to their constant commercial and cultural exchange with Pala India , the Nepalese artists were totally familiar with the Pala esthetic models which they had largely adapted to their patrons ' taste . <p> Fig. 8 <p> During this period , the kings of Guge invited the Buddhist master Atisha , one of the foremost scholars of Vikramasila monastery in the heartland of the Indian Pala kingdom . Atisha is credited with the introduction a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 23 ) , which is the Mahaparinirvana stupa found as finial on the Mahabodhi shrine in Bodhgaya ( see Cat . No. 22 ) . 22 As didactic tools , Atisha brought numerous manuscripts with him to translate as he traveled , he composed many texts himself and in daily rituals he made small clay sculptures ( tsha tsha ) such as the Avalokiteshvara ( Cat . No. 104-d ) . In addition to the introduction of the Buddhist texts then practiced in the monastic universities of Bihar , inevitably the artistic models of Pala India were conveyed by the illuminations in the texts themselves ( such as the Prajnaparamita manuscript Cat . No. 26 ) as well as the small sculptures , whether cast , or carved in stone or in perishable materials . Pala sculpture may be characterized by voluptuous seated or standing postures , curvaceous bodies with garments and strands of jewelry which cling to the body , elegant body proportions , oval faces , piled locks of hair combed into large chignons ; in cast sculptures , there may be ornamentation with inset gems as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lotus pedestal is often tiered , at least two layers of petals , carefully aligned , with beading on upper and lower edges of the pedestal . 23 ( see Fig. 8 Pala stone Tara , and Cat . No. 32 , Maitreya and Cat . No. 51 , Heruka ) . The small stone Tara is an exquisite portable shrine in miniature , probably made in India for a Tibetan pilgrim . The back of the sculpture has the typical " window " to reveal Taras chignon , a necklace at the nape of her neck , and the intricate strands of beads of her belt . Behind the lotus pedestal , there is very skilled carving of an inscription in Tibetan letters which probably was made by the sculptor due to the mastery of the carving technique . 23a Whether this sculpture was actually produced in India for the Tibetans who traveled there as pilgrims or whether it was conveyed to Tibet by masters such as Atisha , there is no doubt that many Pala sculptures reached Tibet long ago , as there is no corrosion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 24 The accurate attribution of provenance of Pala sculpture is further complicated by evidence of a practice of casting copies of especially sacred Indian images , such as the enshrined Buddha of Bodh gaya , which has been recognized as a Tibetan practice . 25 We will return to this topic below , in discussion of antiquarian taste in Tibet in 14-15-16th century . For the some of the Pala sculptures of 11th to 12th century , it is virtually impossible to determine whether these may have been made in India or in Tibet , whether they are contemporary or later copies , and the nationality of the sculptor remains uncertain . <p> Fig. 9 <p> Due to Atishas Indian nationality , he may be regarded as one of many Indians who introduced the Tibetans to Indian esthetics , yet Atisha may also be partially responsible for an influx of Nepalese artists to Tibet . As he left Vikramasila , he journeyed to west Tibet via the Kathmandu valley where he remained at least a year . Atishas biography informs us that he was skilled as an artist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biography also informs us that he met Indian artists there and that he made sandalwood self-portrait 26 . Undoubtedly he encountered Nepalese artists eager to study and emulate the Indian models thus Atisha may also be understood as one of the many conduits which lead to the introduction of Nepalese artists and their esthetics to Tibet in the 11th century , as described above in the Great Silver Image commissioned by the Kings of Guge in 996 . Nepalese Buddhist masters were frequently described in Tibetan historical literature from the 11th century onwards , active in West Tibet and in Central Tibet , while since this period , Tibetans are recorded as students in the Kathmandu valley . 27 In addition to individual deities cast in copper alloy , the intricate scrolled gilt copper repoussT work of the aureole of the deites and the throne back is a significant factor in Nepalese sculpture . This may be observed in 11th-12th century Nepalese sculptures conserved in Tibet where the gilt copper repoussT aureole is decorated with foliate scrollwork of a winding plant , 28 Elaborate foliate scrollwork is also found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll work of the prabhamandala behind the Buddha and Bodhisattva sculptures in the sanctuaries of rKyang bu and Zho-nang ( Fig. 9 ) . 29 Similar scrollwork for the prabhamandala may be observed today in Shalu on clay sculptures modeled in 2004 according to archival photographs from 1960 which faithfully document the 11th century sculptures of Shalus Yum chen mo chapel , the consecration of which is attributed to Atisha . <p> The 11th to 12th century clay sculptures from Shalu and rKyang bu are eclectic . The body proportions correspond neither to the elongated tubular Nepalese limbs nor the sensual fleshy curves of the Indian bodies although these sculptures are enthroned inside prabhamandala of Indo-Nepalese origin . The massive bodies of the sculptures are hidden by the garments , whether robes or dhoti and sash , which are often embellished in relief with the roundel textile motifs previously discussed . The esthetic features of this school of Tibetan clay sculpture borrow specific aspects from multiple styles and bring these discrete elements together in such a way that the " origins " are concealed . Among these clay sculptures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific hook which is typical of Korean and Chinese monks robes . 30 The facial features show Pala influence for the square forehead , the dip of the upper eyelid , the thin pointed nose , but the pursed lips and pronounced chin do not follow Pala prototypes . The clay sculpture in Tibet allows ample appreciation of the Tibetan capacity to transpose esthetic elements from one style to another and create a unique synthesis . <p> During the 12th to 13th century , many Nepalese artists came to work in Tibet . The most famous is a young Nepalese sculptor , Aniko , who came to work at Sa skya monastery ca. 1251 . In the wake of Sa skya involvement with the emergent Yuan dynasty , Aniko traveled to the new capital in the entourage of the Sa skya monks serving as teachers to the Yuan emperor Kubilai . The 1292 stone Makakala sculpture is an excellent example of the Nepalese esthetics during the reign of Kubilai ( see plate in Stoddard Essay ) . The dragons on the lower level of the stone sculpture belie a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned for an icon of Tibetan Buddhism . The donation inscription mentions a high-level administrator in eastern Tibet during Kubilais reign whose nationality is uncertain and the artist dKon mchog skyabs is credited for the sculpture . 31 Certainly the temptation to attribute this sculpture to Aniko is great . 32 However , in view of the sculptors name , it is more likely to attribute this work to the school of Aniko , the extremely fine workmanship reflects the Nepalese esthetic associated with Aniko or his atelier , characterized by scrupulous attention to proportions and iconography and highly expressive features . 33 The face of the Mahakala almost sparks with flames from the eyebrows and moustaches ! ( see also Cat . No. 64 ) . In view of the workplace of the donor of the 1292 Mahakala , this sculpture is the oldest dated example known today of a work made in Tibet , according to Tibetan Buddhist iconographic stipulations , in the most pure Nepalese esthetic style . It is both an extraordinary sculpture and an historical document . <p> Fig. 10 <p> While Aniko left Tibet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other Nepalese artists settled in Tibet , working at Sa skya and other monasteries affiliated with Sa skya such as Shalu in central Tibet . In Western Tibet , the Brigung monastic order took control of Khojarnath and founded several sanctuaries in the Kailash area . The life-size Great Silver Statue of Khojarnath was given two bodhisattva attendants as well as a full torana and base ca. 1220 , and henceforth known as the Three Silver Brothers . A unique triad in the Pritzker collection represents the Three Silver Brothers ( Fig.10 , Three Silver Brothers ) . A Tibetan dedication inscription describes the donor , a Tibetan lama named Nam mkha grags , whose historical identification remains elusive . Thermoluminescence tests confirm that it dates from ca. 12 - 13th century . Metallurgical analysis further revealed that the central statue of Avalokiteshvara has a torso cast in pure silver , his dhoti of brass with inlay in silver and copper in elaborate patterns , while the two other bodhisattva are cast in an alloy with a high percentage of tin . The elaborate composition of the Pritzker triad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base all reflect Nepalese esthetics of the period , the exceptional inlay of the dhoti is a reminder of the Kashmiri style which was so popular in Western Tibet when the Great Silver Statue was made . It remains to be determined what relationship this triad has with the life-size Three Silver Brothers of Khojarnath . Even so , it is an eloquent testimony to the consummate taste of Nam mkha grags : it is a Tibetan sculpture which is a most elegant fusion of discrete esthetic styles and metallurgical techniques . <p> Fig. 11 <p> During this period of Brigung control of Khojarnath in 13th-14th century , they found patronage in the Buddhist rulers of the Khas Malla kingdom in Western Nepal . The Khas Malla developed a distinctive style of Buddhist sculpture , amalgamating the esthetics of the Kathmandu valley with influences from Pala India due to their contacts with the Pala kingdom , including military incursions in Bodhgaya. 34 The beading of the Pala lotus pedestals is frequent in the Khas Malla sculpture characterized by distinctive crown and earring models , with double or triple strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as emphasis on the articulations of hands and feet , and less slender bodies . 35 These sculptures were destined for the Buddhist monasteries of Western Himalaya as well as Tibetan sanctuaries where the Khasa Malla kings were patrons , such as Brigung and the Lhasa Jokhang. 36 In the Densatil monastery which during 13th to 14th century was a dependency of Brigung , there were many gilt repoussT reliquaries of the past lineage-holders of Densatil . According to inscriptions copied by Tucci during his visit there , these were carved according to the models of Nepalese art . 37 While the Nepalese models are the inspiration , the figures and deities in the Densatil gilt copper repoussT bas-reliefs and cast sculptures are characterized by energetic dynamic postures and exuberant use of beading to decorate their garments , as well as lavish inlay with semi-precious stones . In the sculpture of the goddess Mahamayuri ( Fig. 11 , Densatil Goddess ) , her alidha posture is most striking - the sculptor has utilized the outstretched skirt as a field of jewels of all colors , set in-between beaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smooth modeling of the midriff , while the bodice is again adorned in smaller scale stripes of beads and jewels . The dancer exhibits the adaptation of certain jewelry and beading of the Khas Malla sculptures , as well as their more massive body proportions rather than the more relaxed and spiritual poses of the Kathmandu valley . The degree of animation and motion is probably to be understood as an adaption to Tibetan taste . In the opinion of Tucci , the sculptures of the Densatil sanctuary quite probably was the joint collaboration of Tibetan and Nepalese artisans . 39 <p> Fig. 12 <p> From 1403-1424 , the Yunglo Emperor was a keen sponsor of Tibetan Buddhism and gave many sculptures in tribute to his Tibetan teachers . The Yung-lo sculptures constitute an esthetic idiom which combines certain specifically Chinese conventions with the evolution of the Nepalese esthetics imported to Beijing by Aniko and his successors in the Imperial ateliers during the Yuan dynasty . The heavy gilding and strands of beads so characteristic reflect Nepal while the Chinese contribution is the voluminous garments , the three ovoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 37 , Yunglo Padmapani . When the Chapel of the Dharma Kings in the Gyantse monastery was constructed beginning 1424 , many Yunglo sculptures had been presented to lamas living in Tibet . It is therefore not surprising to see the influence of the Yunglo esthetic in the treatment of the heavy textiles and folds of the garments of the Dharma kings ( see Fig. 12 , Gyantse photo ) . The influence of the Yung lo style is also revealed by the realistic features of certain clay sculptures of Gyantse , as well as the style of the thrones . 40 Due to inscriptions , the names of many painters and sculptors working in Gyantse are recorded for posterity , thus it is sure that the Tibetan sculptor Nam mkha bzang po , from Lha rtse , modeled the Chinese style throne as well as the portraits of the Kashmiri and Tibetan Buddhist lamas in the chapel devoted to the Masters of the " second diffusion " . <p> Fig. 13 <p> During the Yung lo period , in addition to the sculptures of deities and Buddhist masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which probably was brought to Tibet as a present . The Mandala of Vajrabhairava ( Cat . No. 71 ) is a virtually perfect copy of the original in terms of carving , yet in terms of metallurgical technique , the Pala model quite probably was not gilded , nor did it have the Yung lo reign mark ! In Chinese Buddhist art during the Yunglo period and throughout the Ming dynasty , such sculptures may be perfect replicas , while during the Ching dynasty , the taste developed for sculptures which were copies which emulate the original but adapt certain features , for example , a copy of an ancient Kashmiri Buddha seated on a cushion of roundel fabrics ( see above and Cat . No. 80 ) , yet in the 18th century copy , a dragon in relief is the center of the roundel rather than copper or silver inlay as the original statue . 41 In Tibet , we have already examined the principle of copies of certain sacred images . There was also , as of the 14th century , evidence of antiquarian taste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style as a memorial to his wife in 1359. 42 This is also exemplified by Taranatha , a Tibetan historian of the 16th century , who commissioned a sculpture of Jambhala , the god of wealth , in the Pala style from a Newar sculptor in Tibet . 43 The differentiation of the work of Tibetan and Newar sculptors in Tibet is complex . Certains factors are generally recognized as Nepalese stylistic traits , for example , gilt copper alloys rather than non-gilt brass alloys , use of glass and semi-precious stones rather than turquoise . A distinctive factor is the casting of sculptures in silver , which we have observed in the Three Silver Brothers , a sculpture which exhibits Nepalese esthetic features yet it is cast in silver , and silver was not used in Kathmandu valley works of art . 44 A silver portrait of a lama ( Fig. 13 , Silver Lama ) , created in 1476 for a monastery near Lhasa , may be related to Nepalese taste due to the heavy beaded edge of the garment and the gentle play with the folds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a Tibetan lama . 45 If indeed it was made by a Nepalese working in Tibet , as such , it indicates the flexibility of Nepalese artists who adapted their metallurigical techniques and alloys to work with silver which corresponded to Tibetan taste . Alternatively , it may be a sculpture made by a Tibetan sculptor who emulated the Nepalese esthetic paradigms in his portrait . <p> Thus far we have examined esthetic developments and fusion in Tibetan sculpture from the 7th to the 15th century . In the following centuries , on the whole , the Tibetan sculptors further refined their skills and persisted in the stylistic models reflecting diverse degrees of influence from different regions . Certain individual sculptors so esteemed ancient sculptures that their own sculptures reinterpret the ancient styles . The Tenth Karma pa ( 1604-1674 ) was an exceptional artist who was so inspired by the sculptures of 7th century Swat that he revived this style . 46 Tibetan appreciation of the ancient workmanship lead to the vast accumulation of sculptures in the monasteries , while simultaneously , the desire to generate positive karma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last example , to consider a different manner of esthetic adaptation of foreign elements , we may examine this sculpture of a Buddha and its prabhamandala . ( Fig. 14 , Reconsecrated Statue ) . At first , the viewer apprehends a ca.8th-9th century Kashmiri or Gilgit sculpture of a seated Buddha on his throne . The Buddha is represented according to the classical esthetic mode of this period , yet the face has the gold paint and pigments indicative of Tibetan consecration practices . Further observation reveals that the prabhamandala is finely worked in gilt copper repoussT and corresponds to Nepalese models with a garuda at the apex . At the base of the throne , there is a carefully carved inscription in Tibetan letters . Indeed the inscription informs us that in 1663-64 , to commemorate the death of the Mustang Raja Amgon Bsam grub rab brtan , his grand-daughter commissioned the Nepalese sculptor Suryajyoti to sculpt the exquisite torana to adorn this most precious statue of the Buddha as it was reconsecrated for the benefit of all sentient beings . 47 This sculpture , therefore , represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient statue and renew its spirituality . Simultaneously , this unusual marriage of Kashmiri and Nepalese esthetic models allows us to understand the Tibetan appreciation of each and their culmination as a new esthetic form , an expression of the unique eclecticism which is characteristic of Tibetan sculpture . <p> 7 . Richardson , Hugh E. , 1998 : Two Chinese Princesses in Tibet , in : High Peaks , Pure Earth , Collected Writings on Tibetan History and Culture , Hg. : Richardson , H.E. , with an introduction by Michael Aris. , 207-215 , Serindia , London , U.K. , p.208-209 , discusses the 7th century Chinese princess , the later weaving of legends about her introduction of Buddhism and construction of temples . He concludes that much of what is attributed to her is more likely to be the activities of the 8th century Chinese princess Kong Jo who was also sent to marry a Tibetan emperor . <p> 24 . Schroeder 1981 , 248 details the Muslim raids in India of 11th and 12th century which led the monks to bury images . Huntington/ Huntington 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , they concluded that there was " no detectable wave of artistic influence " after Muslim raids and rather that " the Pala artistic idioms were already so thoroughly integrated into Tibetan culture , and Tibetan knowledge of the Pala idioms was so current , that even a new wave of TmigrTs did not visibly alter the artistic direction " . However , Tibetan historical sources do not document the constant presence of Indian artists in Tibet . Sporadic references of one or two individual masters are found , but the numerous works attributed to Indian production in Tibet presuppose the existence of several ateliers of Indian artists in Tibet during 12th-13th century , and these are not yet historically documented . Is it not possible that much of the production was by Nepalese artists in Tibet emulating Indian styles ? While no evidence of Indian artists settled with ateliers at that time in Tibet is documented at present , there were possibly areas in Bangladesh and E India which were less dismantled than the main areas destroyed further East ( to Bihar and Bengal ) and in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly sculptures might still have been cast .

@@79925750 @1425750/ <h> A Dozen articles on Asian Arts <h> Introduction <p> Here , I present a dozen short essays on Asian Arts , History and Culture . They show facts , opinions , as well as my own theories . I hope you will find this information of interest . <h> 1 . The oldest molded gourd . <p> In the autumn of 1996 , an exhibition entitled " Imperial treasures from Ho-ryu-ji " was held at the Tokyo National Museum . Among the treasures was exhibited a gourd jar , decorated with 9 figures ( and Chinese characters ) by molding ( H. 16.5cm ) . The lid is a decorated gourd ( floral patterns ) , too . This jar was made of gourd which grew in a mold ( hardwood or ceramic ) . This presumably was made in China , because the Japanese have little history of decorated gourds . Also , the style of the decoration is Chinese . <p> There are two types of mold to cast gourd . The first type of mold is wooden negative . It is curved directly by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second type of mold is a wooden positive model . It consists of several parts . The craftsmen cover it with clay and then remove it partly . They dry/fire the clay to make a clay mold . Thanks to this method , many clay molds could be made from a single model and thus enabled commercial production of decorated gourd . Hobei province was the center of this technique . Casting a gourd is not easy . Shipping gourd items were said to be 1 per cent among products from a farm . Another experiment informed about 2000 decorated gourd were produced in one mu farm ( 1/6 acre ) . This may depend on quality control and pest control . products from a farm . <p> During the Ching dynasty , decorated gourds were often used for cricket cages .

Mold and the Silk road <p> Mould disaster might support glory of the central Asian silk road . <p> This silk is a replica of an 8th Century Tang style cloth . <p> I think sea transportation would be more profitable than camel caravan transportations , even in A.D. 5th Century . A single ship is able to carry a large amount of parcels and can reduce stopping site : it means the number of customs . Indeed marine wreckage was popular , but desert wreckage as well as desert bandits were , too . Indeed , muslim customs and merchants got a lot on commissions , an economical principle ruled the rate . If the silk price by sea was higher than the one by desert in the consumer markets ( Byzantium , Cairo , Baghdad , Paris , etc ) , it should force the commission low . <p> Why did the desert route survive after the indirect sea route began to transfer parcels to the West ? <p> I think one of the reasons should be the deterioration of cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In ref.1 , Doctor of Science : Torao Ohtsuki talked " When exporting silk thread to Europe , we struggled mould disaster . Now , we carefully prevent it . To shut off from humidity , we seal silk threads in metal boxes and ship . Without sealing , mould eat silk in the Indian Ocean . " . I think this should be the reason to support the desert route . In desert , mould ca n't grow . In Astana and Tunghuan , many beautiful silk fragments were unearthed with incredible condition . I show a pair of silk brocade shoes unearthed in Astana . <p> In Tang dynasty , documents recorded stopping in tropical ports to wait season wind for some months . It should be often that mould disaster happened to silk at that time . <p> Recently , French wines are transferred in REFER CONTAINER to Japan .

Harpy in Tang Empire <p> I was surprised that in early 8th century , at the court of Tang Empire , a very occidental monster : harpy might be popular . At least this example of Harpy with two faces in A.D. 701-750 in China , I can appreciate . I kindly request iconographic assistance concerning this image from Western scholars . <p> This is a ceil ornament of nitch limestone which contains a Buddha and two bodhisatovas . Entire panel size is about 100cm high . The main part seems rather banal , but the ceil seems extravagant . Left face was destroyed , but many scholars guess it had two faces . It is irregular that two immortals with cranes donate something . Usually buddhist canonical aprasas donate . But some examples are in Japanese ancient buddhist collections . Left part of this stone panel was damaged and repaired with stucco . Fortunately , the harpy and the right immortal with crane are original . Left part of left crane and left crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root of the cap like ENAN ( later middle age cap of a lady , in France , Flandre , etc ) of the harpy . The style looks Western . <p> This panel is one of 29 panels from Baoquin temple in Xsian , Shensi province . 19 panels are in Tokyo National Museum , 2 in Freer Gallery , 1 in Boston Museum . Engraved scriptions show these panels were supervised and donated by eunuchs in Tang Empire Court around A.D. 701-750 . Others do n't show such irregular ornament . They have ordinary ornaments : aprasas , saint trees , or decorated canopies . <p> During Tang dynasty , many religions have temples in the capitol including Nestorian Christians . I feel one of them brought this harpy iconography ? <h> 4 . Viking with a Buddha <p> In July , 1954 , a small bronze buddha was unearthed in Helg in Eker Island in Lake MSlaren in Sweden , when archeologists were searching and digging a Viking ruin . Now , in National Historical Museum , Stockholm . Prof. Namio Egami : a famous japanese archeologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descovery . <p> I quote a long scription from the original report . " The face is finely drawn with elbows and mouth inlaid with dark substance : eyes inlaid with turquoise ( ? ) and on the right eye an irregular red colour ; caste-mark of gold in the middle of the forehead ; the ears have much drawn down lobes ; the hair is ring punched and at the very top a small semi-globular calotte is placed ; the neck has two parallel furrows ( fat calluses ) ... The back has been more summarily modeled . An extra plate with holes at the neck . an indication of a tap between the shoulders and a riveting hole at the foot of the back of the lotus throne indicate that the figure has leant against a decorated backpiece . At both elbows there are extra applied square bronze plates ( repairs ? ) . At the discovery , there was round the neck and round the wrist a leather-strap 0.06 cm W. with folded and bent borders . Measures H. 8.4 , greatest W. ( the Throne ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather strap shows that the owner ( a Viking ) regarded this bronze a talisman/amulet . The repairs are unskilled . Maybe done by foreign craftsmen ( Russian ? ) . On the style this buddha may be made in Swat or Kasimir : both are neighbours , but Swat is in Pakistan and Kasimir in India . Scholars think its date A.D. 8-9th century . The route to scandinavia is said " Amber route " , which transport amber from north and silk and others to north through Russian rivers and stepps . I guess river transportation should have been important . <p> I imagine over 5,000 km voyage of a Viking with a buddha with some fancy . <h> 5 . Jade and Dead preserved <p> In ancient China , people believed that jade should preserve dead body unrotten in coffin . This funeral jade garment was made for the belief during B.C 1st century . <p> What made this superstition ? <p> I think dead with many jades should be often well preserved . People should think jade preserve such body , I think . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built and sealed from air . For a long funeral ceremony , some antiseptic procedure must be undertaken to the body . We know two examples of fresh body who died about B.C 150 or 300 in Hunan province ( unearthed in 1972 ) and Hupei province ( unearthed in 1975 ) . At that time , for tens years , many lord bodies may be preserved fresh in their coffin . Graveyard robbers saw such bodies . Many stories show robbers discovered fresh body in the coffin . Destructers of the royal tombs also saw them , when a dynasty had fallen . <p> When was the superstition established ? <p> In B.C. 20th-25th century , in Liangshou Culture of Southern China , a lot of jades were packed in high-class coffin . I show a small example of neolithic jade unearthed , about 4cm wide . Since too many heavy jades were packed , I mind the body should have been crashed . Jade mask from about 7th century was discovered in San-men-sha , Shansi province . Consequently , between B.C.25th century and B.C.7th century , this superstition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painting without sky <p> Most Chinese paintings after the 13th century do n't have any sky . The sky is often blank . <p> One see much cloud , but cloud is under the summit of mountains , and it is n't on the sky . It move in valleys . I show an album leaf by Kung-Shien ( ca. 1619-1689 ) , from an old colotype reproduction , 22.1x44.7cm . It is now in Nelson and Atkins Gallery , Kansas-city , USA . <p> In 17th century Holland , Johannes Vermeer painted a beautiful sky in his masterpiece : Landscape of DELFT ( Haag ) . In early 16th century van Eyks ? painted some too modern sky in a page of " Hours of Turin " ( 1904 burned ) . Jan van Eyk 's " Madonna and Christ with chancellor Rollin " ( Louvre ) has a beautiful sky with cloud . I think northern Europeans should discover beauty of sky . <p> Exceptional examples are taoists or Buddhists paintings . Some draw cloud with deities . This example is an album leaf in Beijing Palace Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relation of religional themes and cloud . After the 13th century , literati class ruled landscape painting 's style . Then Chinese painting parted from religion . It is a reason that Chinese paintings seldom draw sky representation . In " Landscape on the lute " ( 8th century in Sho-so -IN collection , Japan ) , I saw some clouds on the sky . Thus I feel Chinese landscape paintings might have sky in Tang dynasty . " Fu-shun mountains Handscroll " : " Monumental work " by Huang Kung-Wang(1269-1354) does n't show any sky throughout this long handscroll ( National Palace Museum , Taipei ) . <h> 7 . Silk Export in B.C. 5th century . <p> Both embroidries unearthed show silk trade through step route silkroad in B.C. 5th century , and production in southen china for export . <p> In 1949 , S.I.Redenko excavated frozen kurugan No.5 in Pazyryk , Altai-Mountains , upper-Obi river . It is on a hill 1800m high above sea level . Pazyryk excavation was carried out in 1929 by M.P . Glaznov and S.I.Redenko , and between 1947 and 1949 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rag , cloth , and horse from the outer part of the loooted large tomb . Ironically , ancient looting introduced the tomb water and froze it . This is microclimate and lense shape frozen area were produced . Especially this saddle cover is excellent . An editor of the catalog ( ref.1 ) regard it the oldest chinese silk:B.C.4-5th century . Approx. 60cm widith . About 50 threads per cm . Left fig . <p> In 1982 , chinese archeologists excavated a small tomb of a lady in Chu kingdom ( about late 5th century ) , Mashan , Hubei Province , southern china . They found it a miracle box . This preserved a lot of cloth with incredible condition in semi tropical environment . I show a reconstructed pattern ( upper right fig. ) and a real detail of the embroidry which is part of a gaun . Famous ancient silks from Mawandou tomb No.1 in Changsha , Hunan Province ( about B.C.170 ) do n't contain such pattern . This might be a trend in the former age . This silk has 80-120 threads per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloths , I think a same design concept should make them ; square components , bird and tree arrangement , and characreter of curves . In 1975 , the editor ca n't see Mashan cloths . We are able to compare real cloths . <p> Two cloths are different on its technic . Pazyryk cloth is rough and free . Mashan cloth is fine and rigorous . Threads/cm is distinct . I think Pazyryk cloth should be an export silk at that time . From 13th century , chinese ceramic firms producted exportwares for foreign market . These exportwares are different from ceramics for domestic demand . Some are rough , some have pattern for foreigners , some are very large for muslim banquet , and some are mostly western on shape and pattern . Similar production for export should do in Chu kingdom in B.C.4-5th century . In that time , it should be difficult to trade directly between Chu kingdom ( on Yantze river ) and nothern nomads . Several kingdoms separated them . International marchants perhaps did such trade . <p> I 've concluded Chu kingdom produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from domestic use on quality . <p> MET and L.A.County Museum , From the Land of the Scythians , 1975 , New York <h> 8 . The origin of Sesshu Calligraphy <p> Sesshu is a famous painter in 15th century Japan . Left is detail of his inscription at upper part of his ink painting ( entire size 149 x33cm including painting , painter 's inscription , and contemporaries inscriptions ) , in Tokyo National Musem . It contains " By Sesshu , 1495 at seventy-six " . All scholars regard it autograph . He gave it to his disciple . He wrote his history and thought about paintongs . This is a certificate for the disciple . <p> The entire work without additional colophons , I show . <p> Upper right figure is a rubbing of a calligraphy by Yen chen-ching(A.D.708-785) , calligrapher and statesman in china . This is a letter draft to a minister to keep hierarchy in Tang Empire government written in November , A.D 764 . This so called " cheng-tso-wei-tieh " has been popular as a classical calligraphy from 11th century . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times from 11th century . Many rubbings were supplied for students and scholars at that time . <p> Both running script styles are apparently alike . <p> Sesshu is not only a painter but also a monk of Zen buddhism . Leading cultural centers were Zen buddhism temples at that time Japan . He traveled to china as a member of official trade mission and a monk painter in 1468-1469 . <p> I guess he got one rubbing of " cheng-tso-wei-tieh " in china . In that time china , the rubbings was popular . " Ko-ku-yao-lun " is a manual for the literati class to appreciate antiquities and utencils for scholars . It was revised in 1459 . The revised edition lists the calligraphy as a fine one and two sorts of rubbings . <p> Another possibility , I 'm guessing , is that he learned after a monk who had mastered " cheng-tso-wei-tieh " style . Among Zen monks , this style was sometimes learned , however , this inscription is much faithfull to Yen chen-ching style at that time Japan . I 'd like to think Sesshu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a calligraphy by Sesshu should be a good example for acceptance of Yen chen-ching style in late 15th century , Japan . <p> I show 3 figures in a plate . Highest is 8.6cm(ref.1) . I feel them cute . <p> When firing , much smoke from deoxidized fire makes the surface black . Then potters polish the surface . These fugurines are funeral objects in tombs . They are said unearthed in Hui-chien , Honan province . Many scholars thought them pre-Han , perhaps B.C. 4th century . <p> An opinion spread ; most or all figurines must be fakes . A rumour said one knows who made them . Report of an excavation in Hui-chien shows no black pottery , After WWII , many excavations of warring states period sites lacked such black figurinres . These facts support the doubt . They are rumours . Unfortunately , I ca n't know the definite opinion , however most think " All are fakes. there is no black funeral pottery in warring state period " . <p> In 1965 , Fujio Koyama ( japanese scholar and potter ) visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potteries unearthed in Hui-chien . It becomes sure that there are black funeral potteries with archeological Hui-chien excavations .

Western taste destroyed chinese buddhist caves ? <p> Between 1900 and 1949 , many chinese buddhist scultupures in cave temples were destroyed , sacked , looted for the world antique market .

Sui dynasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made such heads , Persecutions(A.D.845) did , and several are unearthed as broken heads and bodies , but robbers did many between A.D. 1900 and A.D.1949 . <p> Even a great marchant and a sort of accomplice : C.T . Loo wrote in PREFACE of ref.1 , <p> " In Making This Catalogue I feel that it is more of a final inventory as I think the collecting of Chinese sculptures is nearly at its end . We must acknowledge , unfortunately , many accesible monuments have been damaged and fragments taken out to China ... cut ... Four hundred years of devotion and inspiration , while only some forty years of unfortunate circumstances has consumated the removal and partial destruction of smome of the famous Buddhist sancturies .

Since they praized engraved scriptions ( especially its date ) on steles and stones , many buddhist fragments which has date inscrption were recorded in their collection catalogue .

Some collectors did n't collect buddhist images , since they are objects for brief for them . In middle ages , a beutiful bronze head ( early 8th century ) was hidden under a pavillon in Ko-fu-Ku-JI : Nara Big Temple . There was no sense to appreciate it . <p> In Europe , from italian renessance , many have appreciated greco-roman stone fragments . Bust style sculptures are , too .

@@79925754 @1425754/ <p> Masters of Bamboo : Japanese Baskets and Sculpture in the Cotsen Collection is an exhibition that draws on the richness and breadth of the approximately nine hundred works Mr. Lloyd L. Cotsen generously donated to the Asian Art Museum in 2001 . These works comprise the largest public collection of Japanese bamboo art in the world . A variety of baskets from the Cotsen Collection is regularly on view in the museums Japanese galleries ( second floor ) , with the selection changing twice a year . Masters of Bamboo , however , approaches the collections masterworks in an entirely new way ; the exhibition is organized around the network of master- disciple relationships through which makers of these baskets are interconnected . On view in the museums Hambrecht Gallery through May 6 , 2007 , Masters of Bamboo features one artwork each by 76 bamboo artists representing most of the major lineages in the three key geographic regionsWestern Japan , focused in Osaka and Kyoto ; Eastern Japan , focused mainly in Tochigi , Niigata , and Tokyo prefectures ; and Kyushu , focused primarily in Oita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the exhibition are on view publicly for the first time . <p> Masters of Bamboo was organized by the Asian Art Museum , and curated by Melissa Rinne , the museums assistant curator of Japanese art . The exhibition is accompanied by a 128-page publication in which Ms. Rinne , in collaboration with bamboo specialist Koichiro Okada , provides an overview of this intriguing art form . She also traces the network of master-disciple influences that constitute the major lineages , or lines of artistic transmission , in bamboo art , from the nineteenth century through artists who are active today . These lineages have never before been described in a systematic way , and they provide a means of comprehending Japanese bamboo work from a global perspective . <p> In comparison with Japans other decorative and applied arts , such as ceramics or textiles , bamboo basketry is a relatively small-scale art form that requires decades to learn ; most members of the younger generation of recognized bamboo artists are in their forties and fifties , following years of training and development . Another unique aspect of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production is accomplished by a single person : Bamboo work requires a sensitive and individualistic approach to the material , which does not lend itself to division of labor within a local industry and can not rely on the forces of nature . As artist Fujinuma Noboru ( b. 1945 ) says , " Unlike the ceramist , for whom the fires of the kiln play an important role in the outcome , the bamboo artist bears full responsibility for every step of the creative process . Without splitting the bamboo and working through each of the various steps oneself , one can not get the feel of each individual bamboo culm and thus know for what kind of piece it will be best suited . And there are no shortcuts in bamboothere is no way to mechanize the process " ( personal communication with the curator , October 2005 ) . Because of these qualities , it is very difficult to achieve technical mastery of the bamboo medium without spending the initial years of ones training under the guidance of someone already skilled at working with bamboo as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time in their careers most major bamboo artists have been formally or informally associated with one of a handful of artistic lineages that have served as the centers of artistic bamboo training for generation after generation . Most of these lineages are based in three regions : Western Japan ; Eastern Japan ; and Kyushu . While artists must learn a full corpus of techniques , regional characteristics or aesthetic tendencies emblematic of certain lineages appear in the output of the artists in those lineages . <p> In a traditional arrangement a senior artist has a number of live-in students who work very closely with the teacher , assisting with works produced in quantity while learning by observation the signature techniques used by the master to make his one-of-a kind pieces for competitive juried exhibitions . Often the secrets of how to successfully produce a given effect are known only to members of a lineage , and are reproduced and expanded upon by future generations . While hierarchical succession is not the only way in which artistic techniques have been disseminated ( there has also been much lateral influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions ) , the master-disciple relationship forms the technical and often aesthetic foundation from which a young bamboo artist begins a careera foundation that in many cases suffuses his or her art for a lifetime . <p> The artists featured in Masters of Bamboo , living from the early 1800s through the present , have transformed bamboo work from a sophisticated skill-driven artisanal occupation into a highly innovative art form . While every work in the exhibition has been chosen for its artistic merit and for its demonstration of the makers abilities , it will become evident to museum visitors that nineteenth- and early twentieth-century bamboo artists were more involved than their later counterparts with reproducing Chinese models or medieval Japanese-style baskets for practitioners of the sencha ( steeped green tea ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) tea ceremonies , as well as with making baskets that , though of superior artistic sensibility , had primarily utilitarian uses . In contrast the artworks in this exhibition made in the late-twentieth and early twenty-first centuries bespeak the blossoming of bamboo craft into a highly creative and often sculptural means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its remarkable scope , is perhaps the only collection anywhere from whose contents an exhibition such as Masters of Bamboo could be organized . For example , the exhibition includes : <p> baskets by all five generations of the Hayakawa Shokosai lineage , considered to be the progenitor of bamboo work as an art : Hayakawa Shokosai I ( 18151897 ) is said to have been the first bamboo artist to sign his baskets , and Hayakawa Shokosai V ( b. 1932 ) is one of the five artists in the bamboo art genre to have been designated Living National Treasures by the Japanese government . ( Masters of Bamboo features works by all five Living National Treasures. ) the work of Wada Waichisai I ( 18151909 ) of Osaka prefecture as well as works by nineteen artists from the various lineages that developed out of his formal or informal tutelage , including four generations of the Tanabe Chikuunsai lineage based in Sakai , Osaka . baskets by Iizuka Hosai I ( 18511915 ) and ten of his direct and indirect artistic descendents. a piece by legendary teacher Iwao Kounsai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as nine works from the generations of successors who benefited directly or indirectly from his teachings . One of these is by Kajiwara Aya , the first female artist to be officially admitted into one of the two major bamboo artist associations . <p> In addition to breadth , the Cotsen Collection boasts superb quality . Many of the pieces selected for the exhibition are renowned masterworks , representing the height of the artists oeuvres . The remarkable susudake bamboo flower basket by Sakaguchi Sounsai ( 18991967 ) seems as strikingly original today as it did when it was made . Shimmering of Heated Air by Shono Shounsai , the first bamboo artist to be named by the Japanese government as a Living National Treasure , and Core by Tanabe Chikuunsai III expand the realm of the traditional flower basket to new sculptural heights , while artist Yako Hodo dispenses with the vessel form altogether in his extraordinary spherical masterwork My UFO . <p> On the occasion of the Masters of Bamboo exhibition , the Asian Art Museum has received seven new bamboo works by important artists not previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The generous donation from the artists of these works not only enriches the range of bamboo artistry in this already extraordinary collection but also serves to reinforce the Asian Art Museums commitment to it . <p> Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Bamboo Basket Collection Many friends of the Asian Art Museum may already be familiar with Mr. Cotsens Japanese baskets . In the year 2000 the museum hosted the critically acclaimed traveling exhibition Bamboo Masterworks : Japanese Baskets from the Lloyd Cotsen Collection , which featured more than 100 baskets and offered visitors a rare opportunity to view the extraordinary beauty and intricate craftsmanship as well as the historical and cultural importance of this unique art form . Mr. Cotsen , a resident of Los Angeles and the former CEO and chairman of the Neutrogena Corporation , assembled his collection during the course of what he calls a " forty-year love affair " with Japanese bamboo baskets . In explaining their appeal , he says , " I was attracted by the tensions created by the balancing of forces : of cohesion and chaos , structure and nature , refinement and exuberance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nearly 900 baskets in the collection range in date from the Edo period ( 16151868 ) to the present . The techniques of weaving bamboo in strips vary with each basket , which may include such materials as old bamboo arrow shafts , driftwood , cloud-pattern bamboo ( named for its intermittent mottling ) , and smoke bamboo ( taken from the rafters of old country cottages exposed to smoke for more than 100 years ) . Many of the baskets were originally made for the tea ceremony or for flower arranging , activities with profound artistic and philosophical meanings in Japanese culture . And many were created by artists who represent basket-making lineages and by others who have been designated in Japan as " Living National Treasures " in recognition of their mastery . <p> Exhibition publication : Masters of Bamboo : Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection .

To quote the Huntington catalogue : " Of i.e. , given by the Chamviv(r)a the saint staying at Pam or the saint belonging to ( a sect called ) Pamstha ? . " As read correctly by G. Bhattacharya ( see appendix ) , the inscription simply states that this was the gift of the learned , elderly Buddhist monk Sadhurakshita .

@@79925762 @1425762/ <p> For centuries , metal has been a highly preferred material of Asian sculptors for the depiction of their gods . The selection of bronze sacred images in the exhibition Cast for Eternity represents an important reflection of the cultural heritage of India , Sri Lanka , the Himalayas , and China ( via Tibet ) , countries and regions which have occupied their own significant places in the art history of the world for over 2000 years . The sensuality , spirituality and beauty of these images are emphasized by the highly technical development and skilful exploitation of bronze casting techniques . As if they have been created for eternity , the bronzes radiate a sense of immortality and reflect the fascination and mystery of the ancient cultures of Buddhism , Jainism and Hinduism . These visual interpretations of celestial beings are dedicated to the transcendence of the human condition through stages that lead to spiritual enlightenment . Therefore they can not only be regarded as works of art , even though they are now isolated from their original surroundings , the sacred shrines and temples where man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and variety of Indian texts have been written over a period of 2000 years . Though largely philosophical and religious , they contain numerous references to metal objects . With the various forms of religions spreading from India all over Asia , many of their metal casting techniques were also adopted by the cultures coming under these influences . These techniques set the standard for the making of temple sculpture . The observation of proportion and conformity during the creation of sacred images played a crucial role in the development and evolution of Asian bronze culture . Such observations were closely followed and were committed in writing to guide the artist-craftsman . Techniques similar to those of the Indian tradition were employed in the Himalayan regions , as can be seen by comparative examinations of the images . In spite of similar rules regarding proportion and iconography , the stylistic differences in the art of these various regions is apparent , since there was a different interpretation of style and modelling . <p> BRONZE CASTING TECHNIQUES <p> Bronze casting techniques fall into three categories , according to the periods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lost forms . The bronzes in this exhibition originate from India , China , Sri Lanka and the Himalayan regions and most of them were exclusively created by the lost form method ( lost wax ) , a process of casting metal images that is known in the West as cire perdue . The shape of the object was initially sculpted in hard wax , often based on a clay core , and then covered with successive layers of clay , except for the mouth of the pouring channel , till a fairly thick and solid coat was obtained . Once the clay mould had dried , it was heated in an oven to allow the melted wax to drain away through vent holes . Molten metal was poured through channels into the cavity of the mould to take the place of the wax . After the metal was sufficiently cooled , the outer shell of clay was broken off to reveal the metal image . The inner clay core was often removed to accommodate consecrated materials . The main difference of the cire perdue technique and other casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it was lost ( broken ) in the course of casting . It implies that each image was modelled and cast individually and was therefore a unique artefact . <p> The lost wax method of casting images in metal has a long history of tradition and growth . The earliest examples of images produced by this method have been unearthed in the excavations at Mohenjodaro and Harappa in the Indus Valley . Some of these early metal images which were produced nearly 5000 years ago , evoke wonder not only for their perfection of form but also as works of art of exquisite expression and elegance . Similar bronze techniques had parallel developments in various parts of the world , as early man observed that metal possessed certain unique properties . He discovered that it is hard in its natural state , ductile when heated , melts at a high temperature and solidifies when cooled . Different metals could be combined to form an alloy that was even harder than the parent metals . <p> A small number of the images illustrated in this catalogue ( cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different technique , known as repoussT . The shaping of metal by hammering can be dated back to as early as the sixth century CE . It is a technique of embossing for which only soft and malleable metals such as gold , silver and copper are suitable . In China and the Himalayan regions it was used to produce large temple images and architectural decorations such as toranas . RepoussT objects are usually hammered out of sheets of copper and subsequently gilded . A number of religious images were made from different components , some elements , such as the face and hands , being cast and the rest being created by the repoussT technique . In a number of cases , particularly during the period of the Malla kingdom in Nepal , only the pedestals and thrones were made in this way and assembled with the cast image . This fine metal technique was used by Newar craftsmen for centuries , resulting in the depiction of superbly created religious images that reveal an unprecedented technical and aesthetic level . <p> The delicate and complex process of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by specialist artisans who should have achieved the necessary level of technical skills in relation to their individual ability and qualification . Another important factor is that the artist had to have a correct visualization of the deity to be created in order to gain a clear vision of the images shape . This explains why some craftsmen in the Himalayan regions would only create and cast at night , when the highest level of concentration and inspiration could be obtained . The iconographic knowledge would consist of the iconometry as well as the detailing of ornaments , headdresses , garments , attributes , pedestals , prabhas , etc. , all according to their contemporary religious rules , taste and local traditions . The artists could also seek the advice of the priests who possessed the relevant iconographical knowledge and texts . <p> The beeswax employed in the modelling of the image was modified with admixtures of various kinds , including enrichment with sila , the resin of a certain tree , or other oily substances , to increase the flexibility of the wax . The admixtures would vary with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary consistency of the wax . The tools that were used in the image-making process were of metal and horn . For the actual modelling of the image , the craftsmen applied heat to the wax , which was cut roughly into shape with a knife , then carefully and patiently modelled , down to the most precise and minute details . To prevent the tools sticking to the wax they were moistened at regular intervals , and to increase the malleability of the wax heat was carefully applied by means of a small lamp whenever required . In the hollow casting process , the thickness of the model had to be related to the type of alloy that was to be used : the softer the metal , the stronger and thicker must be the wax model . <p> In some complicated forms like the multiple armed and headed figures , different parts of the image were individually and separately modelled in wax , and then assembled into a single sculpture . Very large statues required not only separate modeling but separate casting too , as they were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only assembled after the finishing work had been carried out on the various bronze parts . <p> Once the wax model was completed , the preparatory steps for covering it with clay began . Wax pipes had to be attached for the funnelling of the molten metal as well as for the circulation of air inside the model . Hollow cast images had the problem of fixation of the core in relation to the mould . This was solved by core nails that were hammered into the wax model . Once the wax was melted out of the mould , these nails were the only means by which the position of the core in relation to the mould was stabilized . Points of these nails can still be seen inside the images . <p> After the clay coatings had been applied and the casting mould had been dried , the image could be cast . The preheating of the mould was necessary to change the air-dried clay into fireproof terracotta which was strong enough to take the molten metal . It also slowed down the solidification of the poured metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every part of the mould . Large amounts of wood and coal were needed to reach the high temperature necessary for smeltingaround 1100 degrees centigrade for copper . <p> After the removal of the clay mould , the core , and the circulation pipes , the metal cast image was ready for the finishing work . In some cases the artist had to correct casting errors and the next step was the polishing and engraving of the piece . In addition , according to local style and use , the bronze image would be gilded , painted and/or inlaid with metal or ( precious ) stones . The most common method of gilding was fire gilding and was applied with the help of mercury . An amalgam of powdered gold and mercury was brushed onto the object after its surface had been carefully cleaned . The coated image was then held over a fire and as soon as the temperature had reached 360 degrees centigrade it caused the mercury to evaporate , leaving the gold evenly coating the surface of the metal . The brilliance and quality of fire gilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Gilding with mercury is durable and could be successfully applied to most basic metal alloys . <p> Among Tibetan and Chinese Buddhists it has been the custom to paint the face and uncovered parts of the neck , hands , and feet belonging to a number of religious images with a cold gold paint . The fragility of this gilding requires it to be renewed from time to time . The faces of other images often have a shiny surface acquired after centuries of ritual touching and sometimes have metal inlay . Eyes , lips and fingernails as well as some ornaments can be inlaid with silver or copper alloys , forming a fine contrast to the actual bronze alloy of the piece itself . Additional colour pigments can be traced in the headdress of many of the figures illustrated ; the type of colour can be seen as an iconographic indicator . In Tibetan sacred images the hollow inner space was filled with consecrated materials , after which the piece was sealed . These materials might consist of prayer rolls , Buddhist sacred texts , small terracotta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , or other personal elements connected to a historical individual , often a highly-ranked priest , and his relationship with the depicted figure ( see cat . no. 56 ) . <p> In south India metal temple images were invariably cast in solid metal to emphasize the immortality of the divinity portrayedthis in contrast to the Himalayan regions , where copper-gilt figures were in principle hollow cast . In larger bronze statues , a central core of a lighter material was often used when creating the figure in wax . This remained in the metal image in order to reduce the weight . Metal workers in northern India and large parts of Tibet generally used an alloy blended of eight metals , sometimes with a small percentage of silver and even gold . The bronze figures in south India and Nepal as well as some southern parts of Tibet were invariably cast with a high copper alloy containing some brass and white lead . The exact proportions varied according to the different periods and art schools . In later periods copper predominated in the amalgam . <p> The exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are closely related to the Tibetan styles and iconography ( cat . nos. 75-81 ) . Of the outstanding bronze sculptures of the Yongle period ( 1403-1424 ) many bear the imperial inscriptions . They were produced in government workshops and are among the great examples of finely executed Asian bronzes . The bronze alloy and gilding used for the creation of such images are of a different and very consistent type , a fine metal mixture complemented with superb lively gilding . The identifying of technology and metal alloys , as well as stylistic analysis , play an important role in the classifying and dating of metal images . <p> CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE <p> The importance and function of Asian bronze statues is to serve as an aid in meditation . A practitioner will be able to understand the meaning and significance of such an image to the extent that his knowledge and his level of perception and meditation allows . During meditation the practitioner will perform mudras and repeat mantras and visualize a particular deity to bring about a meditative state in order to achieve a desired state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a sacred statue which should convey a meditation experience to a level that those who observe the statue can share in the same experience . These visual metal images are therefore internal experiences in meditation , as well as an attempt to guide others towards the same experiences . <p> Images cast in metal were considered to yield the greatest religious merits . The commissioning and donation of bronze statues to a monastery was considered an important meritorious act . A practitioner could gain spiritual merit by serving as the patron for the making and consecrating of religious images . This was considered of great importance for its influences in the matter of an individuals birth , future , and attainment of enlightenment . Some statues were donated in the name of a loved one to acquire the merits for that person . In other cases the statue was commissioned in the hope that the patron would attain more worldly fortune . Bronze statues served as a focus for the expression of religious devotion , they served to instruct and confirm the experiences of advanced practitioners . Their iconographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liturgical and meditational practices . Artists were bound by faith , tradition and religion , and needed to concentrate and form a mental picture of the god before fashioning the figure , which had to inspire a devotee to worship the deity . The sculptor was instructed to adhere rigidly to the canons laid down in the sacred texts . The religious rules , precise measurements , and artistic curves were indications leading to the creation of metal images in a natural pose with exquisite balance . It was ordained that in addition to being well proportioned the divine images should be also beautiful to look at . Among the various curves are samabhanga , which has no bends and is expressive of tranquillity and repose ; abhanga , an elegant and delicate posture with the body weight resting on one leg and the other slightly bent ; tribhanga , or thrice-bent , used for Taras and female bodhisattvas ; and atibhanga , greatly bent , seen among images of Devi , dance poses of Shiva and Buddhist protector deities . <p> The stylized position of arms , hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal images an aesthetic excellence . Discussing these icons , the sculptor Auguste Rodin wrote : The image of Nataraja can well contest for superiority in gracefulness with the gestures of Venus de Medici , who defends her charm by the arm , whilst Shiva does the same by an ingenious gesture ( see cat . no. 6 ) . The position of the fingers is such that each takes its own elegant place in space , and attributes are poised playfully between them . The gestures are significant with wonderful articulate symbolism , grace , and tenderness , which is entirely spiritual . Some of them have been adopted from dance gestures , while others have been evolved by the artists to serve the religious context . As revealed by the selection of sacred bronze images in this exhibition catalogue , these unique bronzes were originally created to achieve a spiritual effect , conveying a deeper meaning beyond the physical sculpture itself . <p> Most of the images in this exhibition were created for domestic shrines . A number of larger bronze statues and in particular south Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike many bronzes made in the north of India , these processional images were invariably modelled in the round so that they could be seen from all sides . The image was placed on a vahana , and often decked with flowers and ornaments . The circular holes made in the throne or the rings attached to the thrones would originally accommodate the rods necessary to keep the image in place on his vahana. ( see cat . nos. 3-13 ) . This kind of figure was often fully clothed and originally kept in a temple hall . <p> AESTHETIC APPRECIATION <p> Although beauty was important it was not the artists first consideration when creating a sacred image in bronze . As these were produced for a religious purpose , the expressive effect of their iconographical meaning was considered to be more important . The image that was part of a temple interior was to convey to the beholder his religion as the highest goal . The aesthetic success was the result of an intensive religious devotion to the intention of creating a sacred image . To reveal the diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression are necessary , forms that go beyond the physical sculptural appearance only . Many of the bronze images of Buddhas , bodhisattvas , lamas as well as devis and devas of the Hindu pantheon illustrated in this exhibition catalogue ( cat . nos. 19 , 24 , 29-36 , 39 , 40 , 43-50 52 , 58 , C , D and so on ) , express an inner happiness , for they have achieved the spiritual state of enlightenment , the highest level of evolutionary perfection . Their majestic appearance is rather of a focused form , as they are embodiments of wisdom and compassion . With subtle tensions , fine postures , pure lines and volumes , they reveal a sense of human nobility . These bronzes have serene expressions , as they are depicted in deep meditation and radiate a peace of mind ; divine images with a meditative and introvert character . They form a strong contrast to the protector deities , who often are depicted with terrifying expressions , vigorous movements , and with more extrovert characters . Their task is to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as to preserve the integrity of its teachings . A number of them are depicted in sexual embrace with their shakti , a fusion between the male and female energies into one dynamic super-deity . The exhibition displays a number of these images ( cat . nos. 20 , 37 , 38 , 41 , 42 , 51 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 72 , 73 , 76 and 80 ) which are wonderful examples of such bronze protector groups . These inspired compositions of couples manifested in a united and harmoniously balanced form , are mesmerizing from several angles . The various positions and striking movements create a sense of organic rhythm and dynamic force , revealing their physical inseparability and strong emotional interrelationship . The many arms , legs and heads express the multidimensionality of the gods awareness . They symbolize his extensive power , the means necessary to destroy evil forces and to help protect against the suffering of samsara , the egocentric existence . In addition these complex sculptures achieve a sculptural expressive effect , as if they create their own volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consort , Uma . They sit together , yet each with their own space and they are shown in a more relaxed pose . Catalogue number 34 is an image of Vishnu with his consort Lakshmi , here united in a single supernatural form . Many of the bronzes are extremely impressive and often have a monumental radiance . The aesthetic qualities seem to be independent of size , as the impact of these bronzes , which are relatively small , can be compared to that of large stone sculptures . <p> The bronzes in this catalogue are multidimensional , which makes them fascinating to observe as they create their own aura and seem to take on a particular life of their own . They are unsurpassed in their majestic beauty and spiritual presence . Skilfully modelled , they contain a consistent quality of powerful rhythmic movements , beautiful volumes , pure lines , and finely delineated features . The natural patinas , gilding and polychromes complement their aesthetic beauty , and additional aesthetic elements are to be found in the finely executed thrones and nimbuses . The appearance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles and the least change of lighting , time or setting , makes a subtle difference in the way they appear to the viewer . The aesthetic pleasure and strongly emotional aura these images convey seem to attune our consciousness to their deep religious significance . This communication is most meaningful as the audience is the crucial third part of the experience of art , which consists of the artist , the subject matter and the viewer . These bronze temple images seem to have been cast for eternity , and are an important and worthy representation of Asian sacred culture , a world which still contains many secrets .

The prescribed materials for making these accessories were gold , feathers , jade , and gems . Among the many ornaments on view in the exhibition is a brightly colored crown ornament consisting of a heart-shaped amber pendant flanked by two three-clawed gold dragons.

@@79925764 @1425764/ <p> In The Newark Museum collection is a small ivory figure representing a form of Avalokites'vara of a type that has long puzzled historians of Himalayan art ( Fig. 1 ) . Figures displaying the stylistic eccentricities of this bodhisattva are , as evidenced here , relatively common . These stylistic eccentricities can be briefly catalogued as : a high three-lobed crown of rather simple design ; the hair in an elaborate chignon which spills in two long buns on either side of the head and crown , and bell-like earrings . The images also show a remarkable lack of ornamentation ; they stand on a small , square base in a relatively stiff pose , with , when complete , the right hand in varada mudra ( gesture of bestowal ) and the left close to the thigh in a gesture of holding a ( missing ) lotus . <p> Figures of this distinctive type can be found in many private and museum collections and almost every broad-based collection of Himalayan art has an example . Several of these figures are illustrated here and it is worthwhile examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unusual in that it is made of ivory , it is not the only ivory example known . A larger figure in the Victoria and Albert Museum ( Fig. 2 ) has many characteristics in common with the Newark version .

Spink &amp; Son in London also has a figure of ivory with a face that appears to have been slightly recut ( Fig. 3 ) . <p> More common are figures in wood . One of the most complete , where all the deity 's iconographic characteristics are displayed , is in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ( Fig. 4 ) . Here the right arm in varada mudra , missing in the Newark and Victoria and Albert examples , is present . The Los Angeles version also has what would appear to be a standing Buddha or bodhisattva in the central lobe of the crown , the smaller figure 's hand gestures mirroring those of the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ' cold-gold ' technique , in which a mixture of powdered gold and size is applied , a reliable indicator of the figure 's Tibetan provenance ( if not necessarily origin ) . <p> Other wooden examples include a complete and well-preserved figure strikingly painted in gold in the collection of Wesley and Carolyn Halpert in New York ( Fig. 5 ) ; a figure in the MusTe Guimet ( Fig. 6 ) , a painted wooden figure at Spink &amp; Son ( Fig. 7 ) and a particularly elegant piece in a private collection ( Fig. 8 ) . The Zimmerman Collection in New York contains a torso of the same bodhisattva , unusual for its unadorned crown and worn appearance , suggesting an age greater than the examples already noted ( Fig. 9 ) . <p> Although wood is the most popular material for the manufacture of these images , metal figures are not unknown . The Pritzker Collection in Chicago has a fine example , of a heavy cast copper alloy ( Fig. 10 ) , and another , seemingly of later manufacture but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kathmandu , Nepal ( Fig. 11 ) . The latter is notable in that , unlike the other figures , it has a seated figure of Amitabha in the crown rather than a standing Buddha . <p> Other examples have been published elsewhere - one in The Art of Nepal by Stella Kramrisch ( no. 73 ) ; another from the Pan-Asian Collection in a Christie 's sale catalogue ( New York , 1 December 1982 , lot 60 ) , and two others in the catalogue Arte Himalaya produced by Eskenazi . <p> Because very similar images have been found over a wide geographical area and their archaic style is often accompanied by a condition and technique of carving that would suggest later manufacture , their origin and date have long remained a matter of conjecture . Study of the evidence suggests that all these figures must be patterned after a single ' ancient type ' , as noted by Kramrisch in her catalogue entry in The Art of Nepal , or a single image rather than a type . The question is : which image or which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the figures illustrated here , the question of origin has elicited varying answers , the most favoured being either Nepal or Tibet ( Pratapaditya Pal , noting certain Nepalese characteristics , included the Los Angeles example in his Art of Tibet , S 14 ) , while estimates of dates have ranged over the entire spectrum of Himalayan chronology . <p> The possibility that all the known examples were patterned after a single , particularly sacred image is strongly suggested by the fact that certain peculiarities have been reproduced almost exactly in images of divergent materials and levels of craftsmanship . Such patterning after a physical ( rather than theoretical ) original is not common in Himalayan art , but there is at least one other known example of such a custom . The sacred image of Avalokites'vara popularly known as Bumga dyah of Bungamati and Patan in the Kathmandu valley has often been copied in various materials for household altars and shrines . The peculiar mask-like visage of this figure ( Fig. 12 ) and the related Avalokites'vara image of Jambaha dyah of Janbahal in Kathmandu ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 14 ; see also Slusser , Nepal Mandala . Fig. 596 ) . It is not entirely coincidental that these images share similar inconographic peculiarities with the others under discussion , notably the mudras , as well as stylistic peculiarities , such as the unusual head-dresses , lack of ornamentation , and small , square or rectangular bases . <p> 0n a trip to Tibet in the summer of 1986 , this author encountered similar bodhisattva figures in many of the major monasteries in the Lhasa valley , including Drepung ( ' Bras spungs ) , Sera ( Se-ra ) and various 1hakhangs ( shrines ) in the Potala Palace . The answer to the riddle became clearer when a monk attending one of the 1hakhangs in Sera provided the information that an image on display in that lhakhang was known as ' Potala Lokes'vara ' . A visit to the Potala appeared to confirm that the central image of Avalokites'vara known as ' Phagpa Lokes'vara ' ( ' Phags-pa Lo-ke-svara , Sanskrit : , ' Arya Lokes'vara ' ; ' Noble Lord of the World ' ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Potala shrines ( Fig. 15 ) , is the original of which all the known examples are copies . <p> This deduction might have been obvious to the first visitor with an interest in art history to the Phagpa Lhakhang were it not for the Tibetan custom of draping and decorating images , particularly sacred images , to the point of entirely obscuring everything but the face ; in this case even the figure 's peculiar earrings were concealed . Unfortunately , according to Gyatso , the monk attending the lhakhang , the vestments and late repoussT crown are never removed from the image of Phagpa Lokes'vara except when the image is to be repainted , an event that occurs only when a donor comes forward with the requisite gold and an artist to perform the repainting ; this was subsequently confirmed by the scholar Lobsang Lhalungpa , who worked in a nearby office in the Potala in the mid-1940s and remembers this ceremony . Although it was impossible to view or photograph the image unencumbered , parts of the high-peaked crown and unique hair-style were still visible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrobed , does very closely resemble several reproductions kept in the same lhakhang ( Figs 16 and 17 ) and in other shrines in the Potala , including an ivory figure in the Dukhor ( Dus-'khor ) Lhakhang . Copies of the Phagpa Lokes'vara are in fact widespread throughout the Tibetan cultural domain and not confined to the Lhasa valley ; two examples have been found on an altar in Chemre ( ICe-'bre ) monastery in Ladakh ( Fig. 18 ) and another was photographed at Nako monastery near Tabo in an area culturally part of western Tibet ( Fig. 19 ) . <p> Who is Phagpa Lokes'vara ? How old is his image and where was it made ? For the answer to the first question we must turn to Tibetan religious history ; for answers to the other two , we must attempt a stylistic analysis without , alas , a direct view of the figure itself , working only with the shadows left by countless pious copyists . ( Indeed , until we have a clear view of the Potala Phagpa Lokes'vara , the authenticity of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1959 many important images have been destroyed or lost and replaced in latter years by reproductions . ) <p> The Gyalrab Salwai Melong ( rgyal rabs gsal ba'i me long , The Clear Mirror of the Royal Genealogies , probably written by Sakyapa Sonam Gyaltsen Sa-skya-pa Bsod-nams-rgyal-mtshan ; 1312-75 , although some authorities consider the work fifteenth century ) recounts the histories of various sacred images , including that of Phagpa Lokes'vara . The following account is taken from the eleventh chapter of this work as translated by Mimi Church . <p> During his reign , the great Tibetan emperor Songtsen Gampo ( Srong-btsan sGam-po ; c. 617-47 ) decided that he must ' construct a tutelary deity to work on behalf of the sentient beings ' in his snowy realm . In meditation buddhas and bodhisattvas revealed to him that in southern India there existed a ' self-originated ' Avalokites'vara of sandalwood who was the emperor 's tutelary deity . From the hair between the emperor 's eyebrows there emanated a mendicant on whose head the Buddha Amitabha dwelt . The mendicant , who was sent to fetch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eleven-headed Avalokites'vara which he brought back to Tibet and presented to the king who was very pleased . Immediately thereafter the king reflected that : <p> ' At present , in the southern part of Nepal , there is yet another hidden emanated form . It will be an astonishing support for the benefit of later generations of sentient beings . ' <p> He beseeched the tutelary deity , and from the breast of the self-originated one a light ray emerged . The king turned towards it and followed it with his eye . In a large dense forest on the border of Nepal and India , he saw a tree of white sandalwood . It emitted light rays to the ten directions and in it the four self-originated brothers appeared . The emanated mendicant was sent to bring these supports . <p> After several adventures the mendicant found the sandalwood tree : <p> He chopped the tree with a hatchet . <p> The four images spoke . The upper said ' cut slowly . I will go to the settlement of Mang-yul . ' When the voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cut , that called the noble Wa-ti appeared . <p> A sound emerged from that which was under him . ' Cut slowly . I will go to the city of Yam-bu or Yam-bha Ya-'gal . ' When the voice that said this was heard from within that which was being cut , that called the noble dBu-gang appeared . <p> A sound emerged from that which was under him . ' Cut slowly . I will go to the border of India and Nepal . ' A voice saying this arose , and from within that which had been cut that called the noble IJa-ma-li or IJang-ma-li appeared . <p> A sound emerged from that which was under him . ' Cut slowly . I will go to the snowy kingdom of Tibet as King Srong-bstan sGam-po 's tutelary deity . ' A voice saying this arose . <p> After that , the noble Wa-ti dwelt in the city of Mang-yul . The noble dBu-gang dwelt in the city of Yam-bu Ya-'gal . The noble lJa-ma-li dwelt on the border of India and Nepal . Through the blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the settlements are freed from the fear of various untimely deaths . <p> The emanated mendicant invited this noble Lo-gi-s'va-ra , the Kha-rsa-pa-ni that now dwells at the top of the Po-ta-la . Going to the country of Tibet , the mendicant presented it to the religious king Srong-bstan-sGam-po , who was quite pleased . Having met the tutelary deity , he thought , ' Now there is no difficulty in acting on behalf of sentient beings . ' ( Church translation , pp. 87-88 from the Lhasa edition edited by Kuznetzov , 1966 ) <p> This story of the ' four brothers ' , found with variations in many Tibetan histories , is a fascinating glimpse into the legend/history of the origins of Buddhism in the Himalayas . Two of the other figures are relatively easy to identify . The noble ' dBu-gang ' is Bumga dyah/Karunamaya/Rato Macchendranath of Bungamati/Patan , a figure which has been copied in much the same way as Phagpa Lokes'vara ; the noble IJa-ma-li ' is Jambaha dyah , the so-called ' White Macchendranath ' of Janbahal in Kathmandu , who in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point and carried away by a rival king , perhaps to the ' India-Nepal border ' mentioned in the story , before being returned to Kathmandu . One Tibetan version of the four brothers ' story places IJa-ma-li in the temple of Khojarnath , on the Karnali river at the western border of Nepal and India ( Wylie , p. 14 , n. 20 ) . It may have been to here that IJa-ma-li was temporarily taken from his home in Kathmandu , perhaps by one of the audacious Malla kings of medieval western Nepal/western Tibet . <p> Bumga dyah and Jambaha dyah are the two most important representations of Avalokites'vara in the Kathmandu valley . In a process typical of Newar culture , their identities have become obscured over time with the accretion of non-Buddhist elements . Both are known popularly by Newari names - Bumga dyah and Jambaha dyah - which do no more than locate them within the valley : ' the god of Bumga ' ( the town of Bungamati ) and ' the god of Janbahal ' ( a monastery in Kathmandu ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one home in Bungamati to a second in Patan , is also often called Karunamaya , a Sanskrit epithet for Avalokites'vara meaning ' full of compassion ' . Both gods have also been revered for several centuries by the non-Newar Hindu population of the valley as images of the great siddha ( perfected being ) Macchendranath or Matsyendranath , Bumga dyah as ' Rato ' ( ' Red ' ) Macchendranath , and Jambaha dyah as ' Seto ' ( ' White ' ) Macchendranath . It is ironic that these names have become the standard appellations used by those unfamiliar with the actual Newar Buddhist cults of these two gods , and they are found in countless popular interpretations of Nepalese culture and tourist guidebooks . <p> The ' noble Wa-ti ' of Mang-yul , is , according to the Tibetan scholar Lobsang Lhalungpa , the Avalokites'vara of the Kyirong Samten Ling ( **26;198;TOOLONG ) in Kyirong ( skyidrong ; the central town of the region referred to as ' Mang-yul ' ) near the Nepal-Tibet border , referred to by Wylie 's sources as ' skyid-rong-jo-bo-wa-ti ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story , by G. Childs for further information ) <p> This story links several of the most important Buddhist icons of both Tibet and Nepal - the Phagpa Lokes'vara of the Potala , the great Bumga dyah and the related Jambaha dyah of the Kathmandu valley . There is a parallel between the story of the bringing of Phagpa Lokes'vara by Songtsen Gampo aided by the mendicant and the Newari tale of the bringing of Bumga Dyah by the Nepalese king Narendradeva and his priest , the Vajracarya ( ' vajra master ' ) Bandhudatta . It is possible that these stories reveal a profound truth about the history of Buddhism and the blossoming of the Avalokites'vara cults in Nepal and Tibet during the time of these two great kings . <p> Songtsen Gampo and Narendradeva have often been linked and it is known that they were contemporaries . Some historical sources suggest that Narendradeva was helped by Tibetan forces to reclaim his usurped throne , and that Nepal entered a period of vassalage to Tibet during his time . The Clear Mirror of the Royal Genealogies recounts the well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Songtsen Gampo . If this story is true - and there is no overwhelming reason to believe it is not - the most likely father of the bride is considered by some historians to have been Narendradeva . Certainly , the Nepalese king ' De-ba-lha ' of The Clear Mirror of the Royal Genealogies could be Narendradeva ( ' de-ba ' is the Tibetan transliteration of the Sanskrit ' deva ' , meaning ' god ' added to the Tibetan ' 1ha ' , also meaning ' god ' ; thus ' de-ba-lha ' is equivalent to ' narendra ' , which is Sanskrit for ' lord of men ' , added to ' deva ' ) . Moreover , as we have seen , religious tradition links the figures by assigning to them similar deeds : Narendradeva bringing Bumga dyah to Nepal , Songtsen Gampo bringing Phagpa Lokes'vara to Tibet , thus introducing two of the most widely revered manifestations of the central Mahayana bodhisattva to the Himalayan stage , probably at the same time . The story of the four brothers may commemorate the installation of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various centres of Himalayan Buddhism at about the same time . If the story does in part reflect the historical facts , it must be accepted that the original images of Phagpa Lokes'vara and Bumga dyah date from the time of Songtsen Gampo and Narendradeva , and that all the images of the story are of Nepalese ( ' Nepal-India border ' ) origin . Do the stylistic characteristics of the Phagpa Lokes'vara support such a conclusion ? <p> There is no doubt that , as Kramrisch pointed out , the copies of Phagpa Lokes'vara examined here ' adhere to an ancient type ' . There is no telling argument why we should reject , on stylistic grounds , a seventh-century date for the Phagpa type ( until there is an opportunity to view the image uncovered we must refer to the ' type ' ' rather than the image itself ) . Certainly the simplicity of the figure , similar in many respects to the earliest known figures of the standing bodhisattva , would suggest such a date . An examination of South Asian sculpture from this period clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Nepalese . One of the earliest known bodhisattva figures from Nepal , a seventh-century bronze Vajrapani in The Metropolitan Museum of Art ( Fig. 20 ) , exhibits a similar simplicity of design ( Lerner , Fig. 16 ) . <p> The stylistic peculiarities already mentioned seem so archaic as to further support an early date , for often in images that predate the formation of a mature tradition experimental features are found . As examples of such experimentation we may cite the mitre-type crown on the seventh-century figure of Vajrapani noted above ; another unusual crown on a sixth-century stone figure of Avalokites'vara ( Fig. 21 ) near Gana Bahal in Kathmandu ( this image also displays the simplicity and lack of ornamentation that bespeak its considerable antiquity , and has the same Buddha figure found in the crown of Jambaha dyah ) , and the elegant and unique hair-style displayed by a small , early image of Vajrapani ( Slusser , vol. 2 , Fig. 464 ) . The mitre-like crown appears to be characteristic of Bumga dyah and a modified , three-lobed version appears on Jambaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very different . Mary Slusser notes the occurrence of this mitre-like crown , which she mentions was normally reserved for Indra , on several later Nepalese portrayals of Avalokites'vara , and it may well be that these were patterned after the crown-type of Bumga dyah ( see Slusser , vol. 2 , Figs 462 and 463 ) . <p> The location of Phagpa Lokes'vara is consonant with an early date for , although the present Potala Palace was not built until the time of the Great Fifth Dalai Lama ( 1617-82 ) , there is little doubt that certain parts of the site are far older , including both the Phagpa Lhakhang and the cave containing images of the great emperor and his two queens . When The Clear Mirror of the Royal Genealogies was written , the Phagpa Lhakhang may well have been situated ' at the top of the Po-ta-la ' . <p> If we do accept a seventh-century date for the original Phagpa Lokes'vara , this does not mean that the numerous , widely dispersed copies are of this early date . Any attempt to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exercise in futility . It is also evident that , although the original Phagpa Lokes'vara may well be of Nepalese origin , the majority of the copies would logically be Tibetan , a dichotomy which has added considerably to the confusion surrounding these figures . <p> This article has been little more than a brief introduction to a subject rich in unexplored possibilities . There are still many questions regarding the Phagpa Lokes'vara , including the implications of his specific iconographical identity as Khasarpana , a youthful form of Avalokites'vara ( the authoritative Sadhanamala notes that Khasarpana ' resides in the womb of Mount Potalaka ' ; Bhattacarya , p. 129 ) . His relationship to the two figures on either side of him in the lhakhang is also mysterious . ( According to Lobsang Lhalungpa , the three together are known as " phags-pa-sku-mched-gsum ' ' three noble brothers ' , somewhat confusing the story of four brothers found in The Clear Mirror of the Royal Genealogies ) . <p> His relationship to the two great Lokes'varas of the Kathmandu valley is also unclear , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bumga dyah is considerably complicated by its present almost amorphous shape ; even the material of the image and its weight are highly controversial , although the thirteenth-century Tibetan traveller Dharasvamin claimed that the image is definitely of sandal-wood , and the related Jambaha dyah is also said by his attendants to be of wood ( cf. , Slusser , p. 377 , ff . ) . The Nepalese tale describes Bumga dyah being brought from Kamarupa , which corresponds to the present state of Assam in India , adding a further geographical canard to the story , although the story recounts that the god was brought in the form of a bee , from which he was transferred to an image , implying that the image was already in place . In addition , the cult of Bumga dyah is probably syncretic , representing an amalgam of an ancient indigenous deity with the bodhisattva brought by Narendradeva . The figure of Jambaha dyah also raises questions . Nepalese stories link his origins with the early medieval king Gunakamadeva , and most historians agree that the evidence suggests the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Slusser , p. 380 ) . There is insufficient historical information to definitively corroborate or disprove Jambaha dyah 's inclusion among the seventh-century four brothers . As for the last of the brothers , ' skyid-rong-jo-bo-wa-ti ' , he remains an enigma . ( Please see accompanying appendix , Pagpawati 's Jowo Rescue Story , by G. Childs for further information ) <p> In spite of the mystery which shrouds these figures , the legend and history surrounding Phagpa Lokes'vara and the available stylistic evidence suggest that Phagpa Lokes'vara , and at least one of his brothers in Nepal , are indeed precious relics of the early years of Mahayana Buddhism in the Himalayas . These two at least share characteristics unique to their cults : stories of royal introduction , peculiarities of iconography and style , and the otherwise unknown custom of manufacturing copies not of an iconographical type but rather a specific sacred image . <p> has published extensively on the cultural history of Nepal and is currently working on a lexicon of classical Newari . <p> The author would like to thank Mimi Church for supplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Royal Genealogies.

I worked alongside Ravindra Jyapu , a well known teacher at the Fine Arts College in Kathmandu and his son Rajendra .

They have trained themselves exquisitely in the complex and daunting process of lost wax bronze casting . <p> Fig. 2 <p> The clay we used for sculpting was collected from outlying areas around the valley and pounded by hand into a smooth consistency .

Here in Kathmandu , artists are admirably accustomed to working with various people specializing in different stages of the process .

My intent was for it to reflect not only the physical likeness and humanity of Rudi , but equally as important his energy . My vision was difficult to convey to Ravindra with his more classical approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the head and he worked on the torso - and through our steadfast joint efforts together we produced a cohesive and powerful piece . <p> After the sculpture was completed in clay , we created a die , a relief copy of the statue made out of plaster . The die is known as the " mother mold " that enables the caster to make more than one copy of the statue . Because of the very large size of the statue , over 4 feet tall , we had to partition the statue into sections by inserting thin metal dividers into the clay . These dividers also acted as small walls , effectively holding the plaster that had been brushed onto the surface of the clay . After curing , the plaster sections were carefully lifted off of the statue , cleaned then checked for accuracy . The clay statue was then destroyed , and the clay reconstituted for future use on other projects . <p> Fig. 3 <p> The next stage of the lost wax process is the preparation of a wax model , identical to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , vegetable oil is brushed onto the sections of the plaster die as a resist , which prevents the wax from sticking to the plaster and allows for easy removal of the wax later . Layers of melted beeswax approximately one inch thick are brushed on top . The thickness of the wax is important , since it determines the thickness the metal will be afterwards . If it is too thin , it will lose strength and cracking or breaks will occur . If it is too thick , it results in a heavy and more costly statue . <p> After the wax hardens , it is carefully pulled out of the plaster molds , cleaned and joined again as a single unit . When the statue is finally intact , this time in wax , it is again thoroughly checked for accuracy and imperfections in terms of both its surface texture as well as its form . <p> Fig. 4 <p> In re-creating the statue in wax , we had ongoing battles against the wilting and sinking of the wax from the constant summer heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in towels that had been soaked in cool water , and supported the arms and torso by stringing them to the roof beams with ropes . ( fig. 4 ) This was not enough . Due to unforeseen delays in casting , the wax statue became so disfigured that the whole process was undertaken again a year later with Ravindras son , Rajendra , heading up the Newar team . <p> With the second round of wax modeling I was able to further perfect the statue . Working with Rajendra now , and with the help of one of Ravindras top students , Vijay Maharjan , the second version was even finer than the first . Rajendra developed his own techniques to mitigate the problems caused by the weather . He coated the inside walls of the wax with a few thin coats of plaster which enabled the wax to keep it 's shape despite the heat . This was quite a successful innovation in the traditional field of casting in Nepal . <p> In order to cast such a large statue in bronze , we again had to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it in surprisingly few parts : head , torso , two arms , legs and the base . <p> Fig. 5 <p> The next step was to encase the wax in the mold which would be used for casting . First we coated the wax statue in a slurry of fine yellow clay mixed with cow dung and dried it slowly in the shade . Several layers of clay were carefully applied , as the uniformity of the application determines the quality of the surface of the finished statue . The clay covered wax image was then coated again this time with several thick layers of a mixture of coarse clay and rice husks . Small openings were left in the clay providing a way by which the melted wax could escape in the first step of the casting process . ( fig 5 ) When the mold was completely dry , it was heated in a special brick oven built specifically for the piece . The liquid wax poured out and was collected for use on the next project . During this process , the original wax model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term , " lost wax " ) . <p> Next came the casting . ( see figs 6 , 7 ) The Rudi statue was cast using the five-metal combination known as Pancha Dhatu ( five metals ) . We chose it because it is traditionally used in some Indian traditions to create sacred images 5 . It combines gold , silver , copper , zinc and tin , each of which correlate vibrationally to planetary energies , similar to the way gemstones are used in the Vedic system . <p> Fig. 6 <p> Fig. 7 <p> Fig. 8 <p> During casting , this esoteric combination of molten bronze was poured into the mold . The consistency of the heat of the metal and the smoothness of its filling is crucial . Variations in heat or timing can drastically impact the statue leaving holes , marks or other more disastrous problems . Achieving this is particularly difficult given the conditions we were working in . The homemade oven , complete with half-baked bricks that would occasionally explode from the fire , miraculously held the heat evenly and steadily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal the sections of the bronze statue inside. ( fig 8 ) Because each mold has to be broken to release the statue , every statue made using this process is one of a kind . <p> Fig. 9 <p> Once the sections of the statue , now in metal form , were carefully joined together to form a whole , its surface was cleaned by hand using sandpaper , hammers , chisels , and files . ( fig 9 ) Electric dremels were used for the larger , rougher areas . A cold forging specialist was brought in to work on some more delicate areas of the statue such as the face . This is an extraordinary technique that involves carefully pounding out the metal with specially shaped tools to eliminate surface imperfections and make subtle changes in texture . 6 <p> Fig. 10 <p> The statue was now ready for a patina. ( fig. 10 ) For this we brought in color specialists from Patan 's Mahaboudha stupa area . 7 Our goal was to create a chocolat-ey colored patina , with the intention of duplicating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was a difficult task for everyone because of the size of the piece and the unusual mix of metals . Most large statues in Nepal get covered in gold or a very dense opaque dark patina . This hides the color and surface imperfections that are a result of the extensive joining which is inevitable in the production of large pieces . <p> Rajendra accommodated our desire for a more natural final patina by using Pancha Dhatu for joining and touch ups on the statue . This was innovative as brass is commonly used for welding , with small exceptions of the more traditional wiring methods of silver or copper . Pancha Dhatu is harder to work with but the result was far superior because of it . <p> Fig. 11 <p> In the end our patina efforts with the specialists from Patan did n't  yield the results we were looking for . In the face of yet another challenge , the inspiration came to me that in order to reproduce a naturally occurring patina , we needed to look again to the past . These beautiful patinas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunlight and the oily smoke from butter lamps . In an effort to recreate that environment we covered the entire sculpture with mustard oil stolen from Rajendras kitchen , and slowly heated the statue with fire from blowtorches . The result was wonderful and very close to what we were looking for . Over time the statue will continue to develop depth and richness of color , just as the old statues have .

@@79925771 @1425771/ <p> At the start not just of a new century but of a new millennium , there is a certain poignancy in being presented with the outcome of a single individual 's journey through five thousand years of one of the great ceramic cultures of the world . Jeffrey Montgomery has built up his collection over a long period of time , sifting and distilling from the many thousands of works he has encountered a highly personal selection that reflects a particular and deeply felt aesthetic . Each piece , one knows , has been carefully and lovingly chosen . It has spent months or years interacting with and defining the private spaces of his everyday life , being repeatedly put away , taken out , redisplayed , and reassessed . <p> Collecting is an act of creative dislocation , a removal of an object from the context or contexts in which it has hitherto functioned , followed by its recasting according to the passions and enthusiasms of its new owner . For a collector to commit their collection to public scrutiny is a subsequent and different act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifacts selected by outside curators and other third parties . Some collectors revel in the spotlight that is brought to bear on them as a result of making their collections available in this way . Others are more hesitant , wary of the intrusion into their privacy-fearful even of the threat of their collection being somehow defiled-that public exposure can be felt to bring . <p> While Jeffrey Montgomery has now come to terms with , and indeed takes increasing pleasure in , being known as the owner of what is probably the most important collection of Japanese folk art outside Japan , it is revealing of his modesty and caution that he chose to remain anonymous when the Japan Society , New York , organized the exhibition Japanese Folk Craft : A Triumph of Simplicity in 1992 . The introduction to the exhibition catalogue observes how he acquired his first work of Japanese folk art not because he knew it was folk art , nor indeed that it was Japanese , but because it appealed to him for the immediacy of its sculptural dynamism. 1 In this respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a compelling focus of concern , he was moved by what struck him as the timeless quality of an anonymous product of an unknown culture . In contrast to the curators who have worked with him on various exhibition projects in recent years , he did not come to Japanese folk art through knowledge of Yanagi Soetsu ( 1889-1961 ) and the Japanese Mingei or Folk Craft movement . He came to it viscerally and critically unencumbered . This being said , his involvement in what has now grown into quite a busy exhibition program has focused his collecting activity into areas that by and large fall within the parameters of Yanagi 's folk craft concept . While this may have resulted in a synonymy between the term " mingei " and the name of Jeffrey Montgomery , it is important to bear in mind the route by which he came to the field of his choosing . <p> The purpose of this essay is not to examine the ceramics in the Montgomery collection , for this is done more than adequately by Robert Moes in his text , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forces that have shaped the development of studio ceramics in modern Japan . Japan is frequently described as a ceramists ' mecca , an enchanted land where anything and everything is possible , where potters enjoy the status of fine artists and are rewarded handsomely for their efforts . It is certainly the case that potters in Japan generally occupy a higher position in the artistic hierarchy than they do elsewhere . It is also true that the making of ceramics can be a very lucrative business-the term used to describe artists in the sense of " one who creates , " sakka , also has the meaning , as Japanese potters jokingly relate , of " one who builds a house . " It is not true , on the other hand , that anything and everything goes . The development of Japanese studio ceramics since the 1920s has been subject , as has indeed been the case in all other areas of artistic endeavor , to the broader forces of history . The emphases one finds are the result of particular preoccupations , the background to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made . <p> The Japanese Folk Craft movement is an apposite starting point : its philosophy was the product of a certain set of circumstances prevailing in Japan in the early decades of the twentieth century . Yanagi 's thinking comprised two main elements . One derived from the social and moral concerns expressed in the writings of William Morris and other proponents of the British Arts and Crafts movement . The other , an essentially mystical attitude towards perception and aesthetic appraisal , derived from his extensive reading of western and eastern philosophy . Like its British counterpart , the Japanese Folk Craft movement evolved in reaction to the problems of rapid industrialization and urbanization . It was also , in its search for a uniquely Asian mode of life and production , an outcome of Japan 's negotiation with modernity and of the need for Japan to articulate , in the face of a domineering and potentially overwhelming West , a sense of its own cultural identity . <p> The Japanese Folk Craft movement was formulated as an instrument of social and artistic reform that looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the one hand it sought out , documented and collected historical artifacts made and used by the common people . The legacy of these activities is the exceptional collection of Japanese , Korean , and Okinawan crafts preserved in the Japan Folk Craft Museum ( Nihon Mingeikan ) founded by Yanagi in Tokyo in 1936 . The beauty of these objects was seen to derive from their having been created by craftsmen working close to nature , using simple techniques and traditional styles , and living within small and harmonious rural communities without concern for capitalistic gain and the assertion of individuality . A clear distinction was made with mass-produced objects , whereby the maker was felt to be too far removed from the making process to be able to infuse an object with any kind of inner life . A differentiation from elite crafts was also made . These , it was felt , were flawed because of the way they functioned primarily as decorative rather than utilitarian objects and , more profoundly , because they were the outcome of processes driven by the consciously directed ambitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese Folk Craft movement proposed that contemporary makers should adopt these notions of what constituted or led to true beauty as the starting point for how they lived and worked . The principle , encapsulated in the idea of the " ethical pot " proposed by Oliver Watson in his discussion of British studio ceramics , was that a proper lifestyle would lead naturally and spontaneously to the creation of proper work. 2 Although there were many who were prepared to abide unquestioningly by Yanagi 's teachings , believing in the ideal of self-negation through immersion in tradition , those in pursuit of artistic originality were faced with the contradictions that inevitably arose when trying to operate within a system that prized innocence and anonymity over individualism . It was the tension resulting from such contradictions that led to the rift between Yanagi and Tomimoto Kenkichi ( 1886-1963 ) , who , along with his fellow potters Hamada Shoji ( 1894-1978 ; nos. 85-86 ) , Kawai Kanjiro ( 1890-1966 ; no. 87 ) and Bernard Leach ( 1887-1979 ; nos. 88-89 ) , was one of the founding members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked Yanagi 's relations with younger members of the Japanese Folk Craft movement such as the textile artist Serizawa Keisuke ( 1895-1984 ) , the woodwork and lacquer artist Kuroda Tatsuaki ( 1904-1982 ) , and the woodblock print artist Munakata Shiko ( 1903-1975 ) . If Yanagi found it difficult to reconcile himself to the individualism of these practitioners , his underlying admiration for their work and his willingness to support them led to criticism from mingei purists , who felt he was in breach of the principles set out in his key writings of the late 1920s . One of the more dramatic outcomes of this was the breaking away of Miyake Chuichi and his followers to set up , in 1953 , the independent Japan Craft Cooperative ( Nihon Kogei Kyodan ) . A more recent occurrence in the uneasy history of the Japanese Folk Craft movement was the decision taken by Shimaoka Tatsuzo ( b.1919 ; nos. 90-91 ) in 1991 to withdraw from the Japan Art Association ( Kokugakai ) , one of the main organs of the official mingei machinery . As Hamada 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan 's leading folk craft potter . His break with the Kokugakai can be taken , if one chooses to interpret it in this way , as a comment about the impossibility and perhaps even the undesirability of trying to apply mingei principles to contemporary ceramic and other craft practice . <p> Although the Japanese Folk Craft movement may no longer be the lively instigator of activity it once was , Yanagi 's legacy in terms of his concern to define and promote that which is uniquely Japanese or , more broadly , Asian has been an enduring one . In this respect he resembled Okakura Kakuzo ( 1862-1913 ) , the polemical style of whose later writings made him one of the more notable players in the game of cultural nationalism sparked off and fueled by Japan 's encounter with the West . Yanagi sought the essence of the East in the everyday utensils of the common people , getemono-or at least what he and his followers classified , sometimes mistakenly , as such . Okakura , by contrast , looked to the higher arts that he , Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endowed with the supreme status they enjoy today . Very different though their interests and beliefs may have been , Yanagi and Okakura were both caught up in the same swirl of identity politics that is nowadays termed " discourse on Japaneseness , " or Nihonjinron . <p> A crucial aspect of Okakura 's championing of Asian values was the attention he focused on the tea ceremony ( chanoyu ) . One result of this was the publication in 1906 of his short but celebrated The Book of Tea . 3 Inasmuch as this was first published in English , it was outwardly directed . Nevertheless , as Christine Guth has shown in her study of the activities of the business magnate and tea devotee Masuda Takashi ( 1848-1938 ) , the tea ceremony functioned at the heart of the process by which Japan established a set of canons for the appreciation of its artistic heritage during the closing years of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth . 4 Many of the great collections found in Japan 's most famous museums were formed by industrialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century and is still a pervasive feature of Japanese art collecting . <p> For early-twentieth-century Japanese potters looking to find ways forward from what they saw as the stultifying legacy of the Meiji government 's promotion of export crafts , the types of tea ceramics exchanging hands in the art market , and becoming known about through the publicity this generated , presented themselves as a new and exciting source of inspiration . The 1920s and 1930s were also a time when archaeological investigations of regional kiln sites began to get under way , much of the early work being conducted by local groups of potters . This combination of factors resulted in what is sometimes referred to as the Momoyama revival-a surge of interest in , and the attempt to reproduce and reinterpret , the varieties of tea ceramics made at Japanese kilns during the Momoyama period ( 1568-1615 ) . The tea ceremony , through the efforts of Okakura and others , had become a powerful metonym for traditional Japanese culture . Added to this was the way in which the Momoyama period , as reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was coming to be seen as one of the great highpoints in Japan 's artistic past . Whether they were conscious of it or not , therefore , those pioneering potters in Seto , Mino , Bizen , Karatsu , Hagi , and elsewhere were responsible for the formulation of ceramic vocabularies as loaded with overtones of Nihonjinron as those deriving from Yanagi 's championing of folk craft getemono . <p> In the 1950s , when the Japanese government established the system of Living National Treasures ( more properly called Important Intangible Cultural Properties ) and the associated Traditional Crafts Exhibition , Momoyama tea ceramic revivalism and mingei regionalism were two important components of what went into determining the boundaries of permissible activity . The first ceramist Living National Treasure appointees were Tomimoto Kenkichi ( appointed 1955 for overglaze enamel decorated porcelain ) , Ishiguro Munemaro ( 1893-1968 ; appointed 1955 for iron-decorated stoneware ) , Arakawa Toyozo ( 1894-1985 ; appointed 1955 for Shino and Black Seto wares ) , Hamada Shoji ( appointed 1955 for mingei ceramics ) and Kaneshige Toyo ( 1896-1967 ; appointed 1956 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by more recent Living National Treasure appointees and other subscribers to the traditional crafts movement constitute an astonishing series of attempts to engage with and explore the culturally autochthonous . The use of this term may seem inappropriate for work based on Chinese and Korean prototypes , but if one looks at the varieties of non-Japanese ceramics that have been used as models for contemporary work , they have been , to a large extent , types that have a history of having been collected and appreciated in Japan . They are , in other words , indigenized varieties of nonindigenous ceramics charged with specifically local , that is to say Japanese , cultural resonances . <p> Governmental institutionalization of the traditional crafts and other artistic practices during the 1950s was a response , it can be argued , to the turmoil that followed Japan 's defeat in the Second World War . The Americanization of Japanese culture was a concern , just as there was a need to forge a sense of cultural unity to assist the process of national recovery . There were also worries about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrialization and urbanization . The conditions were similar in nature , if more pressing and immediate , to those which Yanagi , Okakura , and their generation had previously responded to in their different ways . Thus , even though there was a conscious rejection of the prewar nationalist agenda and the excesses in which it had resulted , the underlying search for the essence of Japaneseness remained very much the same . <p> The 1950s also saw the maturation of an avant-garde ceramics movement at the hands of a growing body of practitioners tired with traditional crafts establishmentarianism . Makers belonging to the Kyoto-based Shikokai and Sodeisha , two ceramist groups established in 1947 and 1948 respectively , set out to challenge the primacy of the ceramic vessel and to question received assumptions about utility and function . The result , as evidenced by the extraordinary blossoming of abstract sculptural ceramics in late-twentieth-century Japan , was the opening up of a whole new world of creative experimentation . <p> An early and seminal event in the history of Japanese avant-garde ceramics was the Shikokai 's sponsoring in 1950 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The primitivism of the works shown in this and a second exhibition held in 1952 struck a deep chord among young Japanese makers . Noguchi 's example encouraged them to look to prehistoric Japanese ceramics , particularly those of the Jomon ( 10,500-300 B.C. ; nos. 1-2 ) but also those of the Yayoi ( 300 B.C.-A.D.300 ; no. 3 ) and Tumulus ( A.D. ca. 300-646 ; no. 4 ) periods , as a parallel source of inspiration to the avant-garde works of influential European and American artists being introduced to Japan at the time . <p> Prehistoric Japanese ceramics have by no means been the only source of inspiration for avant-garde experimentation , but they have been a particularly potent one . They have come to be known about through archaeological excavations , the number of which reached exponential figures during the economic boom years of the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s . As with historical kiln sites , many of these excavations have been carried out as a result of Japan 's stringent cultural property laws , which oblige property developers and civil engineers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excavated before building or rebuilding work can proceed . The more dramatic findings from these archaeological investigations have fuelled a popular imagination obsessed , in the immutable spirit of Nihonjinron , with trying to describe the Japanese national character in terms of quasiscientifically defined Jomon and Yayoi archetypes . In this respect the term identity politics can be attached to makers who explore the primitive and numinous through reference to prehistoric Japanese models as readily as it can be to Momoyama tea ceramic revivalists and folk pottery resurrectionists . <p> To analyze is not to criticize . It is to try to understand and explain . It is too easy to look at what there is and to think that things could not have been otherwise . This essay does not pretend to address the full complexity of what has shaped the development of Japanese studio ceramics since their emergence in the early twentieth century . What it does propose , however , is that there has been an ongoing process of selection and institutionalization of certain key forms , and that this process has been informed by the politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern world . A critical aspect of this has been , furthermore , the way in which archaeology has provided whole new vocabularies through which contemporary makers are able to explore issues of cultural identity . <p> At the beginning of this essay it was suggested that collecting and exhibiting were acts of dislocation that removed objects from their original contexts and recast them according to the enthusiasms and agendas of collectors , curators , and other third parties . In concluding , it is hoped that the act of dislocation which this essay represents will have helped to position the ceramics so beautifully illustrated in this catalogue not just as the products of certain moments of history , nor simply as reflectors of Jeffrey Montgomery 's particular aesthetic , but also as living artifacts that sit at the heart of a continually evolving dialogue between past and present . <p> One hundred extraordinary ceramics from one of the world ? s premier collections of Japanese folk art will go on view March 27 , 2003 , at the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts , Design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEAUTY : Fifty Centuries of Japanese Folk Ceramics from the Montgomery Collection ? explores the near-perfect combination of form , color , texture , gesture , and sense of spiritual harmony embodied in Japanese folk ceramics made between 3000 B.C. and 1985 .

Chakrasamvara and his consort dominate the later composition , as they are larger in height and width than in this work ; they are also proportionally larger than their attendant deities , who are almost uniformly diminutive . The dominance of Chakrasamvara and Vajravarahi in the later work contrasts with that in the work under consideration , wherein less of the composition 's area is given to Chakrasamvara and Vajravarahi , and the size of the attendant figures increases as one moves toward the bottom of the painting .

@@79925780 @1425780/ <h> Introduction <p> The state of Orissa in northeast India has a long tradition in various arts , including dance , architecture , and painting . Among the painting traditions , the devotional art of the pata-chitras , 1 or paintings on cloth , is a folk or popular style that centers around the worship of the god Jagannath ( or Jagannatha ) but that depicts many other religious themes as well , using the strong line and brilliant color that are typical of Orissan folk painting . <p> This article presents a collection of pata-chitras , organized around a series of general themes , in order to highlight various formats and particular thematic subjects used in the tradition . So that the paintings might be understood within a context , introductory information is provided on the god Jagannath , on the Jagannath temple in Puri and its rituals , and on pata-chitra painters and their work . Subsequent sections illustrate paintings related to the god Jagannath , scenes from the epic stories , pictures of deities , a picture with a folklore theme , and a picture with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the particular images , identifies some of the iconography used in the images , or recounts some stories related to those images . <p> 1 . The Jagannath triad <p> Jagannath is a deity widely worshiped in Orissa ( and elsewhere in India ) . The god 's Sanskrit name means " Lord of the world " ( from jagan , world , and natha , lord ) . However , some scholars have suggested that the word is a sanskritization of a tribal word 2 and have presented arguments related to the god 's possible tribal origins.3 Nevertheless , by the devotees who come to see their Lord at the temple , he is typically identified with Krishna . The most famous of the god 's many shrines is his temple in Puri . In this temple , Jagannath is not installed alone , but is part of a triad of deities that also includes his brother Balabhadra and his sister Subhadra . Of these , Balabhadra is identified with Balarama , the brother of Krishna , and Subhadra is said to be the goddess Bhubaneshwari . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 . The Jagannath temple in Puri <p> Orissa is justly famous for its many beautiful temples . The classical period of Orissan temple building was from approximately the beginning of the eighth century to around the middle of the thirteenth century . Temples were constructed to various deities , but the temples to Jagannath in the towns and villages of Orissa are most relevant to the pata-chitra tradition . As mentioned above , the most famous of these is the temple to Jagannath in Puri , which is a seaside pilgrimage city on the Bay of Bengal . This temple was built in approximately 1135-1150 by Codaganga , a king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.4 The temple became a great center of pilgrimage and , in recent centuries at least , pilgrims who came to the temple for a darshan ( viewing ) of the deity frequently purchased a pata-chitra painting as a memento of their visit or as a gift for friends or family back home . This practice continues today . Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ( below ) present some views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateway , the so-called lion gate . <p> The artists who paint pata-chitras are known as chitrakaras . Often , a whole family is engaged in the work of preparing pata-chitras , under the supervision of the master painter in the family . Sometimes , a master artist will operate a studio in which apprentices and other artists of varying levels of skill work under his direction . As the products of the chitrakaras ' work are intended for a pilgrim audience , the chitrakaras typically live in the vicinities of temples , such as the Jagannath temple in Puri . Chitrakaras are also concentrated in the village of Raghurajpur , just outside Puri . <p> Besides painting pata-chitras , the chitrakaras have other artistic duties , often related to the yearly cycle of festivals around the Jagannath temple . For example , chitrakaras paint anasara patis , which are paintings that temporarily replace the principal images of the three deities while those deities are considered " i 'll " and are unavailable for viewing by the faithful.5 <p> The chitrakaras of Puri also have several painting duties on the cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Subhadra ride during the annual ratha yatra ( car festival ) each summer . In this festival , each of the three deities rides in a large chariot ( Jagannath 's is 45 feet high ) from their home in the Jagannath temple , along Puri 's wide Grand Road to the Gundica temple about three kilometers away , and then back again . Figure 4 shows a view of Grand Road , looking away from the Jagannath temple.6 <p> Chitrakaras paint the walls of a small temple next to the Narendra reservoir during the chandana yatra ( sandalwood festival ) , a festival during which images of Krishna , Lakshmi , and Sarasvati are rowed in boats in the reservoir . The painters also paint pedi , or dowry boxes , that are given to the bride at the time of marriage.7 An illustration of a painting on a dowry box is included below in the discussion of the kanchi avijana episode in the mythology of Jagannath . <p> 4 . Techniques of pata painting <p> The process of producing pata-chitras has been documented elsewhere , 8 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins with a sheet of cotton cloth being laid out on the ground . To this cloth is applied a coat of gum or glue made from tamarind seed . Then a second cloth is laid on top of this and another layer of tamarind glue is applied . The cloths are then left to dry in the sun . When the layered cloth is dry , it is cut to the desired sizes of finished pages and burnished on both sides , first with a coarse stone and finally with a smooth pebble . The design is sketched and the outlined areas of the sketch are filled in with primary colors , traditionally from vegetable or mineral pigments , but in recent years from store-bought colors also . Large areas of color are applied first and the details are then painted in these areas of solid color . When the painting is completed , it may be covered with a coat of lacquer . <p> 5 . Themes depicted in pata-chitras <p> It is possible to categorize the themes of pata-chitras in various ways . But for the purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by Mohanty ( 1984 , p.9 ) . He identifies the following themes : <p> Jagannath and the triad of deities <p> episodes from the Hindu epics <p> themes related to the worship of various gods and goddesses <p> themes from folklore <p> erotic themes <p> Mohanty actually lists a sixth theme , that of animals and birds . However , these paintings will not be illustrated in this article . For the first of the themes , we will look at some examples of paintings that involve Jagannath and the other deities of the triad in their roles at the Puri temple , that show scenes from the mythology of Jagannath , and that provide a schematic diagram of the Puri temple . We will deviate a little bit from the focus on pata-chitras to show related wood carvings of the Puri triad . Next , episodes from two of the epics ( or puranas ) , the Bhagavata Purana and the Ramayana , will be illustrated . Related to pata-chitras that portray puranic episodes is a more modern type of painting in which multiple scenes surround a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss pictures of various deities , the folklore theme of navagunjara , and the kandarpa ratha , a picture with erotic connotations . <p> In pata-chitras on these various themes , the images depicted are often based on dhyanas ( Mohanty , 1980 , p.12 ) . Sanskrit texts ( puranas , tantras , and other texts ) commonly contain passages describing a deity in a way that allows the god or goddess to be clearly imagined in meditation . Such a description is called a dhyana ( meaning " meditation " ) .9 A dhyana , for example , may be an image of Sarasvati standing with her vina in hand , or Krishna playing his flute while embracing Radha . <p> Before proceeding to the illustrations of pata-chitras , let us note some common ( but not necessarily universal ) characteristics of the pata paintings that are presented . 10 <p> the use of red as a background color Studies in the 1980s reported red to be very common in recent pata paintings , noting that it had been a traditional background color since the 19th century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found many paintings , perhaps a majority of paintings , from Raghurajpur and Puri that had background colors other than red , with white being a common background color , as well as peach and a pinkish color . <p> the use of a standard palette of colors , typically including red , blue , yellow , green , black , white , and pink <p> a particular style of drawing faces in which noses are extended , chins jut out somewhat from the face , and the eyes are elongated <p> the drawing of faces in profile <p> the drawing of fine details in clothing <p> the inclusion of a double border The inner border often uses a sort of leaf-and-scroll motif and is narrower in width than the outer border , which often uses a floral motif . <p> the practice of filling in much of the background space with stylized forms <p> Besides these common characteristics , there are also many typical iconographic details in pata-chitras , such as the following : <p> the use of blue for Krishna 's body <p> the use of white for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body and for the bodies of other gopis ( cowherd girls ) <p> the use of green for Rama 's body <p> Figures are typically shown with a frontal view of the body but a profile view of the head . Figures do not usually overlap ; that is , one character in a painting will not be shown in front of another . Sages are depicted with matted hair . Characters often wear jewelry . Noted personages wear crowns , such as the crown with the tilted plumes that Krishna wears and the crown with a mango-shaped ( similar to paisley ) crest worn by queens.11 Colors are applied flat within outlined areas of pata-chitras ; that is , shading is not used . There is no attempt to convey a sense of volume to the figures . Perspective is absent and the chitrakaras do not strive for realism in their portrayal of people or the natural world . <p> 1 In this article , Sanskrit words , not including proper names ( such as Jagannath ) will generally be italicized .

After this bath , they are brought back into the temple . However , the bath has discolored the painted wooden statues . Thus , the deities are considered to be " i 'll " for fifteen days and are not to be viewed by the public . This period of illness is called anasara ( or anavasara ) .

@@79925783 @1425783/ <p> ( click on small images for large images with captions and descriptions ) <p> Very little is known about the history , technical aspects and artistic features of ivory sculpture in Myanmar ( Burma ) . Kunz devotes one paragraph and St. Aubyn1 does not even mention Myanmar in their seminal reviews of ivory art around the world . This paper aims to help fill this gap in our knowledge of Southeast Asian art by presenting the results of six weeks of research in 2002 with ivory carvers in Mandalay , Myanmar , sponsored by the National Geographic Society . <p> The research stems from previous investigations carried out by the author in 2001 on the ivory trade.2 Elephant poaching is still a serious problem in Asia , as it is in Africa . Elephants are killed primarily for their ivory . There is worldwide pressure to stop all trade in ivory , thus it is important to document details of ivory carving before the craft disappears .

In spite of the fact that ancient Burma was a land filled with elephants , there is no evidence that ivory was used during the Pagan Kingdom ( 1044-1287 ) in the north or during the Toungoo Dynasty ( 1540-1752 ) , which ruled present day Myanmar with the assistance of Portuguese entrepreneurs , first from Toungoo , then Pegu ( Bago ) in the south , and then from Ava in central Burma from 1635 . Toungoo , in the Pegu Yoma highlands , is even today a major center of the teak timber industry , in which thousands of trained elephants are used in extracting logs from the forest . In 1586 Ralph Finch , probably the first Englishman to visit Burma , counted over 5,000 trained elephants owned by the king of Bago alone.4 No doubt it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . In the 16th century Zhangzhou on the Fujian coast of China became a center for carving Catholic statuettes ( the Madonna , Christ on the cross , etc. ) in ivory for the Spanish and Portuguese5 , and Burma might well have been a source of some of the ivory . <p> The Konbaung Dynasty succeeded the Toungoo and King Alaungpaya established its capital at Ava in 1752 , near present day Mandalay . In 1755 he conquered Lower Burma and built Yangon ( " End of Strife " ) , though nearby Pegu ( Bago ) became the administrative center . In two wars in 1824-26 and 1852 the British took over Lower Burma and annexed it to the Raj , leaving King Mindon to rule only the northern half . Pegu became the British administrative city . The British knew very little about the Court of Ava in Upper Burma and decided to send a British diplomatic mission there in 1855 . The large mission spent six weeks in Upper Burma and recorded an extraordinary amount of detail about the geography , natural resources , commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burmese life.6 They made only two mentions of ivory . The first was that ivory was produced in two remote tribal areas in Kachin State in the north , and the second was the description of an implement like a small paper-knife used by the nobility to squeeze on ceremonial headdresses and tuck away hair . Ivory had obviously not yet begun to serve as a familiar raw material in carving , though jewelry and sculpture employing gold , silver , bronze , stone and wood were common . <p> In 1857 King Mindon had Mandalay built and he moved the capital there . The walled palace is still a tourist attraction today . In 1885 the British completed the annexation of Burma and took Upper Burma by force , exiling King Thibaw , Mindon 's son . They made Yangon the capital of the colony and corrupted the name to Rangoon . <p> The earliest dated object made from ivory in the National Museum collections in Yangon today is an ivory chair crafted for King Thibaw in 1878 , the year he succeeded his father to the throne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscripts of Buddhist scripture written on ivory plaques from the 19th century . The earliest use of ivory in Myanmar is therefore associated with the nobility and the Sangha , the Buddhist church . The museums in Yangon and Mandalay contain stone and wood religious sculpture , but none of ivory . <p> Using reconstructed genealogies and oral histories from informants , it appears most likely that Burmese ivory carving began in the 1860s in the court of King Mindon with U Oh and U Hmyin , who were brothers , and U Maun . They may not have been the only ivory craftsmen in Mandalay at the time , but no one in the ivory industry today remembers others . Informants do remember a famous carver in Rangoon , also beginning around the 1860s , called U Saya Ohn , the Master . He is generally credited with training the Rangoon and other Lower Burma first generation ivory carvers . The three best master carvers in Mandalay , and thus the country , today trace their carving heritage back to him . <p> Ivory carving ( sinswe pan pu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , woodcarving , which is one of the pan sai myo , or " ten arts " .7It is most likely that U Saya Ohn and the U Hmyin and U Oh brothers began life as woodcarvers , then received commissions to carve certain objects in ivory from the court and from Buddhist pagoda monks . Lower Burma ivory carving was probably stimulated by the presence of the British and Indian merchants and administrators . Ivory became a popular material for a great variety of items in Europe in the 19th century8and wealthy Indians had been using ivory in religious and decorative sculpture for centuries.9 According to informants , the British wanted mainly utilitarian ivory items such as combs , cigarette holders and cases , shoe-horns , paper-knives and so on while the Indians desired bangles , combs and hair pins for their wives and statuettes of gods and goddesses such as Ganesha , Krishna and Sarasvati . Upper Burma ivory carving developed in the Court of Ava in the 1860s with occasional royal paraphernalia , but there were no pieces that might require refined carving skills . <p> Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory carvers no longer enjoyed royal patronage . U Hymin and U Oh carried on in Mandalay , however , carving pieces mainly for the British and Indians who now moved there . Moulmein ( Mawlamyine ) and Pyinmana in the south also had ivory carving workshops in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . U Maung Nyaing of Moulmein was a noted master carver in the 1890s , but he only used from eight to twelve pairs of tusks a year , crafting items such as medicine and jewelry boxes , picture frames , utensil handles , paper-knives , chessmen and chairs.10In general , Burmese ivory craftsmanship at this time was not ranked very highly and the industry as a whole was not flourishing.11 <p> Two second generation carvers in Yangon , both students of Saya Ohn , were U Tun Yin and U Tun . In Mandalay , U Kyee ( right ) carried on the family tradition of ivory carving for U Hymin and U Oh , though he was only a nephew .

Three other remembered second generation ivory carvers in Mandalay were the brothers U Oh ( no relation to the first generation U Oh ) and U Toe and U Thet Pyin . U Thet Pyin was the son of first generation carver U Maun . U Kyee 's son U Ba Khin , thus third generation , carved ivory from about 1920-35 , but he died prematurely . All of these carvers worked from about the early 1900s to the Second World War , when Japan invaded Burma at the end of 1941 . <p> Rather than damage the ivory business , the Japanese occupation in Mandalay stimulated it . During the occupation there were an estimated 56 ivory craftsmen in eight businesses in Mandalay.12The Japanese soldiers bought large quantities of ivory chopsticks , combs , cigarette holders and cases and name seals ( hankos ) .

He learned the craft from his father and from the U Oh-U Toe brothers . He set up one of the first ivory shops in the Zegyo Market in about 1940 . In the 1980s he had the largest ivory shop in the Zegyo and employed 20 carvers . The 1988 and 1990 disturbances forced him to close his shop , but in 1994 he opened a smaller one near the Maha Muni Pagoda .

U Tin Aung established an ivory shop in the Zegyo Market in 1946 and carved ivory from his home on 80th Street , where he still lives and carves today ( right ) .13He became well known when in 1961-62 , working in collaboration with Dr. U San Baw , he carved the head and neck of an ivory human femur ( fig 7 below ) that was used in a hip transplant for the Buddhist nun Daw Pounnya.14 Some 600 of these ivory femora were eventually used in hip transplants .

As more tourists visited Myanmar in the 1980s many more carvers got into the business and took clients from Tin Aung . In the 1980s his carvers were down to 7-8 . After the riots of 1988 he had to close both shops . The Zegyo shop is still closed , but he reopened his house shop in 1990 . Today he uses three part-time carvers and a nephew apprentice . The brother U Tin Maung set up his own ivory business , but after his death in 1991 no one has carried it on .

Today he is a specialist in human figurine carving and in staining to " antique " a piece , having his own secret recipe . He works independently and carves on commission for several shops , and overseas visitors and shops in Yangon buy from him . In Yangon he trained a young apprentice from Rakhine in the southwest named Ba Pe who , though unmarried and only in his early 30s at the time , earned the honorific address " U " because of his carving skill and business acumen . U Ba Pe moved to Mandalay with U Win Maung and today at 37 he is considered the best master carver in Myanmar . He also employs the most carvers with 17 working in his workshop . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyunt ( left ) , Win Maung 's nephew . U Ohn Nyunt 's grandfather , U Tun , was an ivory carver in the 1920s to 1940s and was a student of U Saya Ohn . According to Ohn Nyunt he also held a position within the British colonial regime with authority over all ivory and wood carvers . U Tun trained his son , Ohn Nyunt 's father , U Hla Pe to carry on in ivory , but he died in 1966 when Ohn Nyunt was only one year old . Ohn Nyunt learned his craft from two other Yangon ivory carvers ( Fig. 1 ) . In 1996 he won a government sponsored competition as the best ivory carver in Myanmar . He employs four carvers today . <p> The first known retail ivory outlets in Mandalay started near the north gate of the Maha Muni Pagoda in 1929-30 ( Table 1 ) . One of these , called Nai Myo Zin today , moved nearby on 81st Street in 1942 and is still there today ( fig. 10 , 11 , above ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its carved pieces from U Ba Pe 's workshop . The other two shops are still open near the north gate , but today they sell no ivory . U San Tint opened the first ivory shop in the Zegyo Market near the center of town around 1940 . The Zegyo Market has been the main market for manufactured goods in Mandalay since the late 19th century . This shop closed in 1990 after the 1988 and 1990 political disturbances . San Tint 's son U Myint Kyaw Than opened an ivory and antique crafts shop on 29th Street in 1994 called Nan Myint ( " Royal Watchtower " ) , which still operates successfully ( fig.12 , above ) . He also sends various ivory items such as chopsticks and seals to Ruili in the Yunnan Province of China to be sold . The east gate of the Maha Muni Pagoda today has eleven shops that sell ivory ( fig 13 , below ) . No ivory is sold today in the New Zegyo Market . Traders also buy worked ivory to take to Shweli ( China border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are no ivory carvers in Yangon today with family carving histories . The best self-proclaimed master carver is 54-year old U Thape Wam , an ethnic Chinese who learned carving on wood from his secondary school art teacher . There are only about seven ivory carvers left in Yangon , the rest having retired , shifted to wood or moved to Mandalay . Although there are 34 shops selling ivory today in Yangon , mostly in the south entrance of the Shwedagon Pagoda and in the New Bogyoke Market , obtaining raw ivory is too difficult to sustain more carvers . Most of the tusks in Myanmar go to Mandalay , Thailand or China . <p> Carver training " Only males are taught to carve , as the carvers believe that females do not have the necessary strength . Unlike in most parts of the world today , all ivory carving is done by hand ; electric tools are not used , except rarely for buffing . Boys become apprentices in a workshop at the age of 10-12 . They begin by performing menial tasks such as making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chance , in which an ivory die with an animal on each of four sides is spun like a top on the 6-7 cm stick ( fig 14 , 15 , below ) , or they wash and polish ivory bracelets or beads . They also watch how the cutting , sketching and carving of pieces is done and begin practicing carving on softwoods when they reach 14-15 years old . If they demonstrate proficiency on wood , they might be given their first simple ivory piece to start on at age 17-18 ; usually the first stage of carving in which the crude roughout of the design is done with hammer and chisel . A trained carver will take over to complete the fine carving . Only the better craftsmen will graduate beyond this level to begin the detailed carving using fine chisels , awls and burins . Men older than 60 rarely carry on fine-carving . Their eyesight and steadiness of hand are not up to it . With their experience and knowledge they are often the ones who measure and cut the tusk into the requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has decided to make.16In the 1970s-80s when the ivory industry was growing , many woodcarvers turned to ivory , though ivory is considered to be a more challenging raw material . <p> gender " male tusks are larger , and about one-third of the length at the base is hollow and the outer layer is thin . Female tusks are smaller , sometimes no more than 10 cm tushes , straighter , with less hollow at the base , and with a thicker outer layer . Often a female tusk will be filed down to remove the rough outer skin . Male tusks are considered preferable for carving most items . Some female Asian elephants have no tusks . <p> grain " a smooth , fine grain with even , concentric growth rings is desired . For this reason fresh wild elephant ivory is preferred to timber elephant , as timber elephant tusks are often damaged or diseased from work . Wild elephant tusks are sometimes flawed by burial or exposure , buried either intentionally by poachers or exposed by accident after dying in the forest ( fig 16 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceased temple elephants . <p> color " consistency of color with no blemishes or hue changes is highly desired . Burmese ivory is usually white , unlike African forest ( " hard " ) elephant ivory that is often tinged yellow or pink . ( African savanna elephant ivory is considered to be " soft " ) . <p> 1 . If the outer layer of the tusk is thick or damaged it will be filed away using a metal file ( thazin ) to remove any roughness , cracks or fissures . The traditional method of carving is to work only on the duramen or inner core of the tusk , but with the rise in ivory prices over the years some carvers start directly on the outer layer so as not to waste ivory . <p> 2 . Measure " Usually several pieces will be made from one piece/tusk so the carver has to measure the parts for each and mark in pencil ( fig 18 , below ) . <p> 3 . Cutting - the tusk is cut into pieces using a saw ( roy , pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from imported steel ( fig 19 , below ) . <p> 4 . For smaller pieces , the two ends of the tusk section are filed to make them smooth and flat so that the piece will fit in stable fashion in the vice . Larger pieces will often be steadied by the carver 's feet . <p> 5 . Drawing - the outline of the subject to be carved is drawn in pencil on the surface of the ivory ( fig 20 , above ) . <p> 6 . Roughout - chisel a rough outline following the pencil sketch using gouges and chisels tapping with a piece of metal ( ley yat ) , wood or a carpenter 's hammer . Care is taken not to waste ivory and not to crack or break the piece . ( fig 21 - 23 , below ) <p> 7 . Fine carving " This stage is only done by the best carvers . They will study the roughout carefully before beginning . They use a chisel ( apya ) , awl ( chun ) , gouge ( gaw ) , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes a hand drill if holes are required . Tapping is done with a flat metal piece . The most skillful carvers can remove blemishes and cracks leaving not a trace . ( fig 24 - 26 , below ) <p> 8 . Finishing - The finished piece is smoothed and polished using the culm sheath ( wa bo ) of the giant bamboo ( Dendrocalamus brandisii ) soaked in water and sometimes it is scrubbed with the stringy mass of fiber from the dried fruit of the sponge gourd ( Luffa pentandra ) . U Tin Aung 's workshop has an electric buffer to polish pieces . The piece is then wiped dry with a clean cotton cloth . ( fig 27 , below ) <p> 9 . Support " Most statuettes , some carved or polished tusks and all lamps made from hollow tusk base-sections will be mounted onto wood bases with screws . ( fig 28 , below ) <p> Antiquing " Many pieces are stained to make them appear older than they are . Pieces with fissures or chips are usually " antiqued " . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water for 20 minutes to two hours.20 The worked ivory piece , and on occasion carved bone , is submerged in the cooled concoction for one to four weeks , depending on the darkness of hue desired . These pieces are shamelessly sold as coming from King Thibaw 's time or as being " a century old " . ( fig 29-30 , below ) <p> Forms " A craftsman traditionally must master five forms to become an expert carver : ( 1 ) hathi , the shaping of an animal , usually the elephant ; ( fig 31 , below ) ( 2 ) gumbi , the ogres that figure in Burmese mythology ; 17(3) na yi , the woman ; ( fig 32 , below ) ( 4 ) ka noke , ( fig 33 , below ) the convoluted style of depicting lotus stems , buds and flowers that are seen on Buddhas or Jataka story carvings ; and ( 5 ) the Buddha in his various mudra ( positions ) . ( fig 34 , below ) Other carving motifs of note are the yeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs and flowing branches seen most often at the base of elephant bridges that symbolize the forest , and the rare kun char , ( fig 36 , below ) a filigreed outer layer with a carved figure within . <p> Lesser carvers who can not master the five forms , or who do not want to , specialize in only one or two of them18or they concentrate on simpler jewelry pieces , cigarette holders , chopsticks or signature seals . <p> Style " Some carvers and knowledgeable ivory merchants recognize two carving styles , the formal , aesthetic style and the informal , naturalistic style . The first is used with religious ( Buddha , bodhisattvas , nats or nats holding up Buddha , Chinese Taoist immortals and sages ) or historical figures ( kings , hero generals ) to achieve a sense of serenity and reverence ( fig. 37 , above ) . The pieces usually include symbolic motifs that identify the subject or story being portrayed . The naturalistic style is used with subjects of traditional Burmese life such as cane-ball players , ( fig. 38 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetching water , a man and woman in a romantic dance ( hna paa thwar ) , a drama troupe performing ( dho bat ) and so on . The naturalistic style is also commonly used with the Laughing or Fat Buddha , ( fig. 40 , below ) the Chinese representation of Maitreya , and with animal subjects . <p> Subjects " It has always been the clients and not the carvers who have had the stronger voice in determining what subjects are crafted . This is not to say that the craftsmen have not influenced demand , however . The more adventuresome have experimented with introducing subjects they have seen or heard of being produced elsewhere , or which are related to pieces that were carved at the time . The naturalistic style and corpus of subjects grew in this way . Fishermen were probably the first naturalistic style subjects carved , as this theme has been the subject of ivory carving for centuries in China and the Burmese replicas strongly resemble them . In Yangon in the 1960s , when Burma became friendly with China , U @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fisherman and was shown a Chinese example . Today he is an expert fisherman carver and the subject sells well . But he and U Ba Pe 's workshop have branched out into an entire range of subjects of Burmese traditional life using the naturalistic style , enumerated above . <p> In general , worked subjects have progressed from simple utilitarian items such as chairs ( using plaques nailed onto wood ) and sword hilts for royalty and plaques used to write Buddhist scripture on and monk 's fans in the 19th century to intricate , delicate and refined statuettes and carved tusks today . Previous ivory trade studies have assumed that Burmese ivory carving has deteriorated over time , 19but the opposite is the case . The figures represented in the statuettes deserve additional attention : <p> Burmese subjects " The most common ones are the Buddha , either standing , reclining or sitting in the lotus position , or several sitting Buddhas on a carved tusk , ( fig. 41 , above ) Jataka stories ( fig. 42 , below ) ( Buddha 's life ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revered Buddhist monk who reached spiritual perfection ) , dancing nats or nats holding up Buddha , the " King riding an elephant " ( fig. 43 , below ) ( Min see sin ) motif , 21GeneralPanDuHla ( he defeated the Thais in a 19th century battle ) , ( fig. 44 , below ) royal figures , ogres ( fig. 45 , below ) and the naturalistic figures from traditional Burmese life . Animals , other than elephant trains on tusks , are not serious subjects in Myanmar.22 <p> Chinese subjects " These are the common religious ones seen in China , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries that have Chinese populations . The buyers are almost all local or visiting Chinese and the high proportion of statuettes of these types seen in the shops ( 40-50% ) indicates how important the Chinese are as ivory buyers . The most common subjects are Kwan Yin ( goddess or bodhisattva of compassion ) , 23 ( figs.46-47 , below ) Maitreya ( Budaifu in China , the Laughing or Fat Buddha , often draped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , perversely for Buddhist thought , has led to prosperity ) , the Taoist trio of Immortals Fu ( money ) , L+ ( luck ) and S+ ( long life ) , ( figs. 48-49 , below ) , Long Life on his own , Zhongli Kwan ( an Immortal who carries a fan he uses to revive the souls of the dead ) , Li Tiekwai ( a Confucius sage depicted as a beggar clutching a crutch and pilgrim 's gourd ) and various other Taoist Immortals with staffs and gourds and Confucius sages . The Kwan Yins and Long Lifes can be quite large , up to 60-70 cm , and the larger Laughing Buddhas can only be made on the largest of tusks because of their girth . <p> Erotic subjects " These are recent and are usually ordered by French or Thai clients . U Win Maung and Myint Tan , who carves for the Nan Myint shop , have carved erotic sculptures . They are usually copies of pieces brought by the customer and involve a phallic object in some way . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 the Myanmar government supported sinswe pan pu , the art of ivory carving , as it did the other main arts of the country . In fact , in 1995 the owner of the Nan Myint shop thanked the State for its assistance to the traditional art of ivory carving through the Myanmar Artists and Artisans Association . In addition , he said , " Myanmar traditional art of ivory sculpture , having come as it has through generations past , is part of our cultural heritage . Preserving and safeguarding it from decadence and extinction is tantamount to holding our national prestige and integrity , and should be our paramount duty " .24 That same year the government held an auction of state-owned ivory . In 1996 the government sponsored a nation-wide ivory carving competition during the " Visit Myanmar Year " 25tostimulate ivory sales with tourists , seeminglyunaware that there was a global ban on the international trade in ivory . Myanmar did not belong to CITES in 1996 and therefore technically it was not illegal for them to export ivory . Over 200,000 foreign tourists did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the government was actively encouraging ivory sales . International criticism followed and the government withdrew its support to the ivory industry . In 1997 Myanmar joined CITES . To date , the government has not held another ivory auction nor has it sponsored another ivory carving competition . The government has also cracked down on all illegal wildlife trade in an attempt to improve its image . Informants knew of many arrests of ivory and other wildlife traders and seizures of illegal ivory , particularly of tusks coming from India . Some wildlife traders had quit the business . It is still legal , however , to buy the tusks of deceased privately owned elephants , and those trimmed from living elephants , and to work and sell ivory . <p> In 1960 in Myanmar there were a maximum of 9,000 wild elephants , in 1990 6,000 and in 2000 about 5,000 . There were 6,000 to 7,000 domesticated elephants in the country in 2000.26 The level of worked ivory demand within Myanmar is at about the same level it was in 1995 , but raw ivory demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The decrease in supply with increase in demand has caused the local price of ivory for a good &gt;5 kg tusk to surge between 1991 and 2002 from 15,000 kyat/kg to 200,000 kyat/kg.27 <p> In spite of loss of government support and the difficulty and expense of obtaining raw ivory , most ivory carvers and retailers interviewed still thought that the ivory craft would carry on in future . Most were not worried about the extinction of the elephant and thought that there would always be enough ivory to satisfy demand.28 A minority , arguably better informed and aware of the outside world , had already or were planning to shift out of ivory and into more sustainable arts and crafts ( real and fake antiques , kalagas , marionettes , etc . ) . <p> Depending on government policy and law enforcement , and what occurs in these areas in China and Thailand , the Myanmar ivory craft can carry on indefinitely .

( Fig.1 ) The elongated leaves were brittle , compressed together , water damaged , and folded into a tight " S " curve , like a wad of dollar bills after the wash cycle . This manuscript was found in the Bhamiyan cave region in modern Afghanistan , purportedly from the 5th century , on birch bark , and written in the Kharoshti script . <p> The owner 's hope was that the manuscript leaves could be opened and separated , in order to be translated . He explained to me that this manuscript was extremely rare , and that the owner hoped to discover any missing links to the history of early Buddhism . <p> Ethical ConsiderationsBut before agreeing to take this project on , I had several philosophical and ethical questions . I am familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable experience examining and treating early Buddhist sutras on paper &amp; Indian palm-leaf manuscripts . ( Fig. 2 ) These Indian and Himalayan manuscript types provoke inquiry and ethical considerations , especially issues regarding the treatment of sacred objects . As with most ethical questions , there are a wide variety of answers , depending on the opinions of religious and museum specialists . <p> Fig. 2 <p> When Buddhist sutras are found inside sculptures , conservators and curators often disagree on the appropriateness of removing these rolled-up documents from their consecrated compartments and treating them individually as works on paper . Additionally , some published accounts insist on the importance of having a religious official re-consecrate the sutras prior to insertion back into the sculptural cavity . <p> Indian palm-leaf manuscripts present fewer ethical problems for the conservator , as they are often collected individually for their illustrated images , and many beautiful examples exist in museums , libraries , and private collections . Palm leaf manuscripts were probably in use as early as the 2nd century , but no extant leaves survive earlier than the 10th century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious writings , much is known about the manufacture and treatment of the material . <p> But what about birch bark ? Prior to the day last fall when I first examined this manuscript , I was completely unfamiliar with the material as a support for writing . Admitting this to the client in our initial meeting , I took several slides , and was given a small bag of manuscript fragments ( Fig. 3 ) in order to begin research and testing on an appropriate treatment methodology . To be honest , I did n't have very high hopes , and , as I talked to colleagues about the project -- I could n't find anyone else in conservation familiar with this type of early manuscript . I was anxious about treating this object for many reasons : the object was purportedly from the 5th century , it might be a missing link to the history of Buddhism , and it was also extremely valuable . So , research and testing had to resolve whether this treatment would provide the desired results . <p> Initial research Before commencing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with manuscripts , early non-paper collections , and Indian art in general . Colleagues familiar with papyrus were particularly helpful , and other colleagues tried to convince me that the manuscript must be on palm-leaf , which was my initial error as well . A particularly helpful consultation was with Nancy Turner , Manuscript Conservator at the J Paul Getty Museum . I brought my slides and my fragments up to her lab , and we examined them under the microscope , and they were , in fact , bark . We could clearly see the laminated layers of very thin barks and examine the inks and written inscriptions very clearly . <p> The literature survey was sparse but useful , with a great deal of historical data , but little information on conservation treatment . <p> History of birch bark as a material for writing ( Fig. 4 ) The research in Butterworth 's Conservation of Manuscripts and Paintings of South-East Asia , revealed that birch-bark ( called bhoja-patra ) was a primary writing material along with palm-leaf in India before paper . Birch bark was mentioned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting its wide use during Alexander 's invasion by Hindus . Early extant manuscripts date to the 2nd and 3rd centuries , written in the Kharoshti script . Fragments survive from a range of time periods , and the material is described throughout Indian literature . Bhoja-Patra 's use diminished in the Mughal period when paper replaced it as a writing material , but it still has a sacred status in India today . <p> Fig 4 <p> Despite its status as a sacred material , all of the literature focused on bhoja-patra 's use as a support for writing . Buddhist sutras were written by monks , and often sponsored by donors , who might be high lamas or officials . The manuscripts are not illustrated and have no history of association with consecrated sculptures or images . Bhoja-patras were literally the Ancient database of Buddhism in India . <p> Gandhara The manuscript brought to my studio , now called the " Los Angeles manuscript " was found in the Bamiyan cave region of modern Afghanistan .

Because of the strong influence of the Greeks and Romans , Gandaran sculpture reveals many Western classical elements , including the treatment of the robe and its heavy folds , and the physiognomy of the central figure .

( Fig. 8 ) After being peeled off the tree , the bark was dried . Oil was then applied over it and it was polished . Layers were joined together by a natural gum . Finally it was cut to a suitable size and kept in between wooden covers . The ink used for writing on birch bark was " Indian black , a carbon ink . It was prepared by burning almond shells to charcoal , which was then boiled with cow 's urine . This ink is said to have a special brilliance and is fast to washing . " Tests have shown birch bark sheets to be typically 0.2 - 0.5 mm thick , and contain a cellulose content of 38% . Additionally , birch bark is highly soluble in organic solvents , but not soluble in cold water . <p> Fig 9 <p> Initial research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio .

( Fig. 10 ) I had decided to use humidity to attempt to open , separate , and flatten the leaves . But before I describe the steps employed , I would like to read the only historical account I could find in the literature for separation . <p> It reads : <p> " In the 1930 's , the Musee Guimet in Paris had acquired bundles of birch bark found at Bamiyan in Afghanistan . Any attempt to open the sheets was resulting in the breaking of the sheets into small bits . Water vapor had no effect on separating them .

The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fragments were immersed in cold oil which was then heated on a slow fire for some time until a light smoke started coming from the oil . In this condition it was possible to detach the leaves from one another with the help of a pair of tweezers .

The edges of the glass sheets were sealed with paraffin wax . " <p> They go on to point out the primary disadvantage of this treatment is their weight and bulky storage requirements , but clearly there are other disadvantages ! <p> Fig. 10 <p> Fig. 11 <p> The Conservation Treatment Since the inks were stable , and the bark impervious to water staining , I began humidifying the manuscript using an ultrasonic humidification chamber made from a photo tray and plastic sheeting and maintaining 80% relative humidity ( RH ) . ( Fig. 11 ) While watching carefully for excess precipitation , the manuscript underwent humidification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction , the leaves began to relax , but were not wet . I continued to humidify the manuscript in this fashion for another 72 or more hours , which allowed me to begin carefully manipulating the " block " . <p> Fig 12 <p> Fig 13 <p> As you can see , I was able to begin to open the entire manuscript from its tight " S " configuration to a looser shape . ( Fig. 12 ) Maintaining a minimum of 70 - 80% RH , the entire block not only began to open , but the outer leaves began to separate as well . ( Fig 13 ) Soon I was able to begin separating the outer most leaves with the mechanical aid of a Teflon coated microspatula and removing them completely from the block . Despite all of this humidification , the leaves were still extremely brittle and fragile , and great care had to be employed .

Needless to say , this first group 's successful separation was extremely exciting around the studio , and I called the owner with the initial good news . <p> We continued the treatment , and subsequent leaves also separated in this fashion , followed by further humidification once flat , followed by flattening between dry cotton waterleaf blotters . In the end , the leaves opened up to approximately 2 inches high by 14 inches wide , from the original 2 x 3 inch folded object . <p> Since the goal of this project was translation of the manuscript(s) , I recommended Mylar encapsulation without repair of the individual leaves .

I was so afraid of losing the order or flipping the leaves , since I do n't read Kharoshti or Sanskrit , that we were extremely careful about collation . <p> Fig 15 <p> SuccessIn the end , the treatment was a great success . ( Fig. 15 ) All of the leaves separated , and remained flat in their encapsulated packages .

Trained at the great monasteries of India and Indonesia , Atisha was a tantric adept and a devotee of Tara .

Even very early texts , such as the Manjushrimula-kalpa and the Mahavairochana-sutra , place her near Avalokiteshvara , the bodhisattva of compassion , and the earliest known Indian images of her show her as a celibate consort of Avalokiteshvara , whose active role in compassionate work she eventually assumed. ( 5 ) By the ninth century , however , she had already appeared in the Buddhist cave-temples at Ellora as an independent savioress , who , like Avalokiteshvara , rescued those who prayed to her from both physical and psychological dangers .

Taranatha belonged to the Jonangpa , an offshoot of the Sakyapa ( whose lamas also wholeheartedly shared Atisha 's reverence for Tara ) and was one of the greatest of Tibet 's religious historians . His Origin of the Tara Tantra , written in 1604 , deals with the source of the tantra and its promulgation , and it is he who is credited with the diffusion and promotion of the cult of Green Tara , and with fashioning its mature form.

Modern appreciation for ceramics in Japan arguably begins with the tea ceremony as practiced and promulgated by the 16th century tea master Sen no Rikyu ( 1522-1591 ) and his followers . Part of the elaborate ritual of the tea ceremony involves careful consideration by the participants of the ceramic utensils used to serve the tea . Tea diaries were kept and impressions of the tea bowls and ceramic paraphernalia were recorded . These diaries are important documents for our understanding of Japanese aesthetics and connoisseurship . This translates even today into the very high prices artists can demand for tea ware as opposed to comparable work intended for less ritualized use . <p> This exhibition concerns itself with modern Japanese ceramics .

It was Yanagi who , in 1925 , coined the word " Mingei " or " art of the people " to describe the traditional Japanese crafts , including ceramics , that he and his two colleagues realized were threatened by the introduction of mass produced wares . As a result of their efforts , attention was drawn to these near to vanishing traditions and interest stimulated in preserving them . One important consequence was that schools were established to preserve these traditions , as were appropriate curricula in already existing institutions . At the same time , emphasis was placed on individuality , innovation and great technical skill .

Any effort to compartmentalize them is necessarily arbitrary , but I prefer to distinguish between those whose work is primarily functional as opposed to those whose work is made primarily for display , and those who work in traditional styles as opposed to those that have been more influenced by modern idioms . <p> Traditional artists look more to the past for inspiration , though they may draw from many sources porcelain and stoneware , glazed wares and unglazed , celadons imported from Korea and China , tea bowls redolent of Oribe , Shigaraki , Bizen or any number of other styles , and their work tends to fall into the functional category . Tea ware , one of the most important ceramic genres , is often inspired by Momoyama prototypes , typically roughly formed vessels with complex glazes .

Knappers work is mostly functional , employing traditional shapes and techniques , such as poured and ash fired glazes , in the manner of Hamada Shoji , Kawai Kanjuro , et al . However , they are at the same time modern , incorporating non-traditional designs , such as the chevron patterns and Ban Chang ( Thailand ) inspired swirls that Knapper carves into many of his pieces . <p> By contrast , Nagae Shigekazu ( born 1953 ) demonstrates a more radical break with tradition .

Whether one or two , the Buddha never tells , " wrote Zhu Angzhi , landscape painter and revered calligrapher , across the side of a sublime purple clay Teapot of Bamboo Hat Shape by Chen Hongshou ( 1768-1822 ) and Yang Pengnian ( active late 18th-early 19th c. ) ( fig.1 ) . 1 Palpable shade still languishes beneath its gentle brim , which holds the essence of deflected sun in a gently textured surface infused with bamboos stalwart earthiness , and inscribed with calligraphic characters mirroring the frenzied dance of summer insects . <p> Nature abounds in Yixing teapots , collaborative late Ming ( 1368-1644 ) and Qing ( 1644-1911 ) dynasty masterworks of artist-scholars , potters , calligraphers , poets , painters , and seal engravers .

Seal carving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as art objects and received as cultural icons . Scholars determined the design parameters of these intensely sophisticated creations , controlling proportion and size , dictating construction methods , selecting suitable claysall through the exacting lens of interpreting antique objects , geometric shapes , mundane aspects of life , and organic phenomena as teapots . <p> The remarkably cultivated purple clay ( zisha ) was purportedly unearthed by a now legendary Monk of Jinsha Temple from local deposits in Yixing , Jiangsu Province and revealed to incredulous villagers who were instructed to dig in a nearby cave 2 . From 1510 onwards , it was meticulously crafted into diverse forms : Pear , melon , and gourd shaped teapots abound in the classic repertoire of Yixing designs . More fancifully eccentric forms populate the list of eighteen forms created by Chen Hongshou ( Mansheng ) ( 1768-1822 ) , magistrate of Liyang county , according to the Qianchen mengyinglu : waning moon , pearl , spring in the olden days , heavenly cock , horizontal cloud , spring vitality , and the deliriously complex " shape formed by joining two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fig. 2 <p> When considering the profound artistic explication of nature in Eastern tea ware and interrelated literati drinking vessels , one can find much to inspire animated discussion , deft philosophical musing , and deep appreciation of craft and intent in Tea , Wine and Poetry : Qing Dynasty Literati And Their Drinking Vessels , a singular exhibition at China Institute Gallery in New York City , on view from March 24 through June 16 , 2007 . In this compact , imaginatively curated collection with a broad reach , nearly fifty objects flesh out the abstract spirituality of tea culture , a long vanished world of contemplation and tremulous elegance . Akin to discovering a spectacular iridescent beetle under a plain stone , the ancient Chinese aesthetic exemplified the encapsulation and refinement of organic forms . Diminutive twin fish , expertly engraved , swim inside the bottom of a pewter Wine Cup by Zhu Jian ( active early 19th c. ) , its mouth the silvered edge of a still pond and white jade handle suggestive of a crescent moon illuminating this precious microcosm ( fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wine cups subtle twin-fish Han dynasty reference is a striking and utterly disarming Western teapots approach to the duality and omnipresent mirroring of pattern and repetitive systems , so often observed in natureleaf venation , muscle and bone attachment , root architecture , avian feather structure , ice dispersion . Johan Christoffer Jungmarkers ( 1752-1779 ) brash silver teapot boasts two spouts in perfect symmetry ( fig. 3 ) , each encrusted with shell ornamentation in Rococo style ; flora adorns the lid in a tentative knot of naturalism , yet these organic flourishes cling to an austere body gleaming with reflections of human endeavors , and speak more of the dispersion and hybridization of organic forms . This fascinating doppelganger teapot and nearly one hundred affiliated drinking and serving vessels feature in the pioneering exhibition , Five Centuries of Swedish Silver : Treasures from the Rhsska Museum , ( from February 14 through May 8 , 2007 at Scandinavia House in New York City ) . The exhibition , while essential viewing in its own right , serves as a fine and unexpected Western counterpoint to China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western design approach to nature in the crafting of teapots and drinking vessels , Scandinavia Houses exhibition , the first in the United States to showcase the history of silver design in Sweden , serves as a revelatory divining rod for European aesthetics and motifs for half a century . In addition to the mass immigration of German silversmiths to Sweden following the Thirty Years War ( 1618-48 ) , Rhsska Museum curator Mikael Nanfeldt , elucidated additional influences that conspired to make Sweden a fountainhead of European design , speaking of the " ideas Sweden imported at various points in time from Germany , France , England , and other countries " . <p> Reinterpretation of Parisian Rococo designs inspired Swedish craftsman Johan Bergengrens surreal iconic coffeepot ( 1764 ) , its writhing flutes undulating rhythmically as agitated waves across the whole of its form ( fig. 4 ) . This Western stylization and expansion of nature into familiar inorganic patterns conjures radio waves or electromagnetic patterns rather than ocean currents or the rippled architecture of sea shells . <p> Fig. 5 <p> For all of its perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( an observation which does not in any way detract from its mesmerizing power or sculptural stature ) . The casual witness might blame the material for emotional distance , or credit silver with innate graphic impact beyond the grasp of rustic clay and cast aspersions on gleaming Western metal over the often unglazed Yixing teapots , with their intrinsic warmth . But a ready comparison must be drawn to a curiously analogous Eastern teapot of Qin-Zither Shape by Zhu Jian ( active early 19th c. ) , who invented the startling idea of encasing the classic purple clay teapot in pewter ( fig. 5 ) . 4 <p> Yet for all its anachronous modernity of materials , including a geometric bronze cover knob , azure ceramic spout and sleekly elongated mahogany handle and hyperbolic design proportions , China Institutes Qin-Zither teapot feels wholly ancient . Nature has been distilled to its essence in the reductive carving of a modest prunus branch , impressed into one side with minimalist calligraphic strokes ; a poem fills the other side in seven syllables of characters which wax and wane in seemingly natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 <p> The inventive naturalism inherent in Yixing teapots and literati drinking vessels sparked as much commonality as contrast in the Western pantheon of design . First to be imported by the West , Yixing teapots " had a profound influence on Western ceramic design " , as objects that spawned equal parts inspiration and imitation in works produced by Britains Minton , Ltd , Foley Pottery and Staffordshire , Germanys Meissen Porcelain Works , and individual potters such as Josiah Wedgewood and Thomas Astbury. 5 <p> Considered together , the singularity of the organic form is equally redolent in Olle Ohlssons Swedish Teapot ( 1976 ) of only three decades ago , and Shen Cunzhous ( active 17th-18th c . ) Water Dropper of Melon Shape ( 1656 ) of three and one half centuries ago ( fig. 6 ) . Remove the spout and handle , then attach a stem atop Ohlssons teapot , and the quintessential Chinese melon form appearssquat , yet seductive , observantly contoured vegetal lobes sloping to a gentle depression at the joining of body and stem . <p> Fig. 7 <p> Dividing lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned , the Western need to abbreviate science and tame environmental forces to achieve streamlined perfection and unblemished objects versus the Eastern notion of wabithat which is admired and coveted for its uncontrived rustic beauty , imperfections , and natural flaws . Reactionary as it was purging , wabi was a Japanese aesthetic and spiritual response to the growing decadence associated first with tea consumption in China , where displays of wealth and ostentatious " tea contests " became disturbingly common , and later in Japan as well , with its wealthiest citizens funding enormous sake drenched feasts rife with gambling and public bathing . 6 <p> Fig. 8 <p> When Okakura Kakuzo bemoaned the boundless East-West chasm of aesthetics and national character in his seminal 1956 work , The Book of Tea , he could have been studying two pieces , pictured below , never before seen together : " The average westerner , in his sleek complacency , will see in the tea ceremony but another instance of the thousand and one oddities which constitute the quaintness and the childishness of the East to him " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square Teapot , modest purple clay masterpiece in the shape of an incense burner , exhibits the quirky eccentricities and humble grace of wabi , while Lars Hakanssons aerodynamic , decidedly slick Teapot ( 2004 ) , epitomizes the adroit Swedish designers reductive shorthand for natural forms . Whale bones , human fossils , ice crystals , stratified stone , soldiers on the march ( figs. 7 and 8 ) . Bridging the geometric abstraction of the earlier Chinese teapot and contemporary Scandinavian piece , German and Austrian **27;226;TOOLONG from 1910 to 1925--transports the fundamental structures fashioned by human artifice and raw nature into surreal platforms , where both are inextricably blended . In the Morgan Library &amp; Museum 's exceptional exhibition , From Berlin to Broadway : The Ebb Bequest of Modern German and Austrian Drawings , on view from April 20 through September 2 , 2007 , an abundance of examples can be cited , further reinforced by the reciprocally twisted nature and warped human psyche of the German expressionist film masterpiece , The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari , shown recently in an exquisite new print also at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fig. 9 <p> Manipulation of proportion in Eastern wares to subtly manifest the individual characteristics of organic objects is particularly masterful ; from the undulating tentacular fingers of a Buddhas Hand Citron on a nineteenth century Yixing teapot ( a beautiful example of which resides in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City ) to Zhu Jians globular spout and asymmetrical white jade knob mimicking a stem on China Institutes delightfully squat Pewter Teapot of Gourd Shape . Note the Buddha 's Hand Citron form reflected in Adolf Zethelius ' Teapot and Cover ( 1813 ) from Scandinavia House , with its flattened teardrop body , elongated spout , and organically elastic handle . Considered in totality as successful biomorphic design , Zethelius ' fluid expression of the pinched , compressed extrusions and lobular central mass suggestive of this iconic Asian fruit--reminiscent of both cuttlefish and squid in motion--is tantalizing. ( fig. 9 ) . <p> Another Chinese example of human applications brought into the more ephemeral realm of nature is the Tall Teapot with Willow Decoration ( fig. 10 ) and poetic inscription by Qu Yingshao ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the opacity of the teapots purple clay and grounded solidity of its tubular , comparatively untapered spout , knob , and handle , the brilliantly exaggerated , " choked " proportions and appendage attachments disarmingly high on the vessel body makes the object soar . Coupled with a diaphanous willow engraving on one side and a seven syllable quatrain conjuring pear blossoms in moonlight on the other , the teapot feels no heavier than a feather carried on a spring breeze . <p> Fig. 10 <p> Fig. 11 <p> Fig. 12 <p> Fig. 13 <p> Conversely , the teapots and vessels in Five Centuries of Swedish Silver at Scandinavia House epitomize the Western approach of taking nature into the human lexicon . The striated architecture , scalloped convex forms , and incised calcification of seashells is readily apparent in the components of Wiwen Nilssons ( active 1923-74 ) Coffee Service ( 1923 ) , and Count Sigvard Bernadottes ( 1907-2002 ) Bowl and Ewer and Cocktail Shaker ( 1938-44 ) ( figs. 11,12 and 13 ) , although their sophisticated , almost futuristic abstraction relegates these eccentric natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acutely insightful cognoscenti . At times , these objects emanate a decidedly inorganic perfection , even as they conjure visions of a sea star retreating or anemone in glorious starburst . <p> Yet the Eastern voice in teapot and drinking vessel design remainsas an undercurrent , as a subtext , as a whisper in the collective ear of the Western artisan . Proportionally , Nilsson and Bernadottes creations share myriad commonalities of structure and formal conception with Qu Yingshaos Tall Teapot , and despite the inherent bank vault weight and impregnability of highly polished silver , these vessels born of East and West defy the gravity of their materials , deny surface contact with the earth , and seem only to drift away together .

Resisting his family 's efforts to push him into a business career , Chang briefly entered a Buddhist monastery before beginning serious study of Chinese calligraphy and painting at the age of 19 . After an extended visit to Kyoto , Japan , Chang settled in Shanghai in 1919 to study with prominent artists Tseng Hsi ( c.1861-1930 ) and Li Jui-ching ( 1867- 1920 ) . In a training method typical among art students in China , Chang made many arduous copies of artistic masterworks , beginning to develop his legendary ( and notorious ) ability to recreate works from diverse periods . <p> Because of his family wealth , Chang first entered the Chinese artistic community as an amateur painter and connoisseur .

He transforms the dangerous human affliction of anger " one of the greatest obstacles to enlightenment " into perfection and wisdom .

@@79925825 @1425825/ <p> This thanka , whose lower register is missing , is one of a small group of surviving early-fourteenth-century paintings in the Nepalese style . Vairochana , the Buddha of the Zenith , can be identified by his white coloration and his gesture of bodhyagri mudra ( wisdom fist ) . He is flanked by two female attendants . Most probably they are : to the right , a Green Tara holding a vajra and to the left , a blue Vajradhateshvara who also holds a vajra.1 They stand in a frontal swaying posture , seemingly a variant ofthe ubiquitous tribhanga ( thrice-bent ) pose , previously used for standing bodhisattvas . Vairochana sits against a throne back that is very close in style to those seen in the early Nepalese-inspired Tathagata set ( cat . no. 36 ) ; it has the same bar at the base of the lotus seat , an identical assemblage of animals to support the projecting bar at the top , and a torana that is similarly configured , but with the addition of two birds flanking the Garuda . Eight bodhisattvas seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Tathagata series , cat . no. 36 ) make up a chorus of listeners . Some hold attributes , but it is not clear whether they are meant to be the auspicious Eight Bodhisattvas ( see cat . no. 28 ) . Small flaming aureoles at the left and the right of the inner top bodhisattvas surround dancing dakinis . Above , following the composition of the earlier series , is a short register with five deities in either corner ( rather than the four seen in the earlier group ) : to the right , Ratnasambhava , Avalokiteshvara , Vairochana , Amoghasiddhi , and another deity ; to the left , the five Tathagatas , Amoghasiddhi , Ratnasambhava , Avalokiteshvara , Vairochana , and Amitabha . The adornments worn by the principal deities reflect those seen in the earlier set . Note the parallel jewelry ( which is also akin to that seen in the Shalu murals ) , including the large anklets , although here the armlets are seen in profile rather than head on . Here , Vairochana 's dhoti is also worn over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of striped rather than diaphanous fabric . <p> A number of variations from the usual configuration of elements clarify this thanka 's date as the first half of the fourteenth century . The painting seems to be based on the early Tathagata set . The throne back is obviously similar , although it has become less plastic ; the bucket shape of the back has lost almost all its curvature . The only area in which some of the earlier concavity is still evident is at the intersection of the uprights and the back , where the back bar bends slightly . The projecting ends are also nearly parallel to the throne top rather than angled . The straight sides and the top of the throne are now almost totally visible since they are no longer covered by a large pillow . Also altered are the two lotus adornments that , in the early set , project upward from the throne back like spikes but are completely lacking in the murals . Here , they emerge from the junction of the nimbus and throne back and mirror the floral arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanking bodhisattvas ( now female ) are posed frontally , rather than in a half-profile , half three-quarter view . Although the configuration of the foliage in the torana corresponds quite closely to that seen in the early Tathagata set , it no longer exhibits the same bursting energy , having become somewhat languorous and decorative . Finally , the background of the painting is filled with scrolling rather than scattered falling bouquets . <p> Curiously , at the top center of the verso of the painting , " Vairochana " is written in early medieval Nepalese script , and in the Buddhist creed below it , penned in Tibetan letters , " dharma " is spelled with a double m , as it is in Nepali . This may be a further indication that the painting is the work of a Nepalese artist.2SMK
