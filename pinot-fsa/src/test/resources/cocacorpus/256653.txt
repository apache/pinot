Nanotechnology is already employed in the manufacture of self-cleaning windows , graffiti-resistant concrete and solar energy-collecting paints . But these already impressive advances offer only a glimpse of what 's incubating in the world 's nanotech labs today ! There , work is under way on nanocomposites thin as glass , yet capable of supporting entire buildings , photosynthetic coatings that can make any building surface a source of free energy , and paint-on lasers that could one day allow materials to send information to and from one another . <p> Intelligent coatings are the largest application for nanomaterials in the construction industry . Architectural paints , water sealers and deck treatments , as well as treatments applied during the fabrication process such as scratch-resistant or anti-graffiti coatings , all present substantial market opportunities for nanomaterials . The materials offer a number of performance attributes that make them useful in coatings applications , including transparency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mildew resistance . Read on for just a few examples of off-the-shelf building products currently using nanotechnology plus take a quick glimpse at how nanotechs wonder materials have the potential to revolutionize how and what we build ! <p> Insulating Coatings <p> Insulating nanocoatings can be used to trap air at the molecular level . The unique ability of these coatings to be painted or sprayed directly onto existing wood , metal and masonry surfaces offers a tremendous advantage to more conventional bulk insulators like fiberglass , cellulose , and polystyrene boards , which often require the removal of building envelope components for installation . Unlike fiberglass batts , cellulose fiber , and rigid polystyrene boards , insulating nanocoatings can be made transparent , and do not rely on thickness as a function of their insulating ability . Finally , they do not appear to raise the environmental and health concerns often attributed to fiberglass and polystyrene . <p> There are several types of insulating nanocoatings on the market today . One that architects and engineers might want to give a closer look isNansulate by Industrial Nanotech . Nansulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and residential buildings . In addition to its insulating properties , Nansulate also offers effective corrosion protection and natural mold and mildew resistance . It is applied exactly like paint , with a brush or roller , and comes in clear or white . It can contribute to LEED points both in terms of insulation and low VOC content . <p> Translucent nanotechnology based coatings can also be applied over windows and skylights to allow in diffused light , while insulating glass against heat transfer . For example , Nansulate Translucent GP allows 92% visible light transmittance and provides the opportunity to daylight interior spaces without sacrificing building thermal performance . After coating , windows will have a frosted look . Nansulate coatings were used on the skylights at the Frost Art Museum in Miami , FL , shown above right . The 46.000-square-foot museum , which has been described as a high tech . architectural jewel , uses multiple skylights to allow natural light into the building . Nansulate was used to save energy and improve the buildings thermal envelope by reducing heat transfer and glare . <p> Self-Cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photocatalytic coatings containing titanium dioxide ( TiO2 ) nanoparticles . These nanoparticles initiate photocatalysis , a process by which dirt is broken down by exposure to the suns ultraviolet rays and washed away by rain . Volatile organic compounds are oxidized into carbon dioxide and water . Self-cleaning nanocoatings have been used to treat everything from concrete and stone , to glass and ceramics , to textiles , wood , stainless steel , aluminum and plastic . <p> Self-cleaning windows , now available from most major window manufacturers including Pilkington , PPG , <p> Saint-Gobain , andAndersen , were one of the first architectural applications of nanotech . An ultra thin TiO2nanocoating is applied to the glass during the manufacturing process which make the glass hydrophilic or " water loving " . When rain hits a self-cleaning window , instead of beading and running down in rivulets , it spreads evenly across the glass in a great big sheet , which wipes down a bit like a rubber squeegee . The result : a clean exterior with minimal spotting or streaking , which not only cuts down on maintenance costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical cleansers . <p> Self-cleaning fatade systems can be found in Romes exquisite Jubilee Church , pictured above right . The award-winning international architecture firm Richard Meier &amp; Partners Architects LLP , New York , designed the soaring structure in conjunction with structural engineer groups Arup and Guy Nordenson and Associates , New York . Jubilee Church is an awe-inspiring composition of 256 precast , post-tensioned concrete elements assembled into semi-sphere white shells rising 85 feet into the sky . The designers called for a high-performance concrete mixture with white Portland cement , white high-reactivity metakaolin , and white carrara marble aggregate to create a brilliant , pure white concrete structure . The building is expected to keep clean , despite the church 's location in a polluted industrial neighborhood , thanks to a nanotechnology enabled self-cleaning fatade . The Jubilee fatade even absorbs pollutants from the surrounding atmosphere and breaks them down into benign elements , earning it the nickname the smog eating Church of Rome ! <p> The fiber cement company , Nichiha , employs nanotechnology in three of their precast panel lines for exterior cladding ; Canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with paint manufacturers , Nichiha created a self-cleaning finish on its fiber cement panels that captures airborne water molecules and holds them to the outside of the siding . Instead of attaching itself to the siding , soot and dirt hits this microscopic layer of water . A simple rain , the manufacturer says , will wash away stains leaving the exterior looking new . Each line has three different colors , and the siding comes with a 50-year warranty on the panels and a 15-year warranty on the finish . <p> Antimicrobial Coatings <p> Many of the multifunctional coatings already mentioned incorporate antimicrobial properties . Others are marketed specifically for their antimicrobial attributes . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says that approximately $1 billion each year is spent on antimicrobial products . Conventional antimicrobial products are marketed in sprays , liquids , concentrated powders , and gases . These products can contain any of about 275 different active ingredients , including biocides and fungicides , which pose both environmental hazards and indoor air quality concerns . <p> On the other hand , antimicrobial nanocoatings reportedly offer the benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , Bionipaints achieve their anti-microbial properties from microscopic nano-silver particles . Silver has been used as medicine and preservative by many cultures throughout history . Today , germs , bacteria or fungal spores brought into contact with surfaces coated with Bioni paints are very quickly destroyed when the integrated nano-silver particles react with proteins in the outer membranes of the microorganisms . Unlike other microbial paint systems , where the incorporated anti bacterial function will loose its effect over time , the nano-particles used in Bioni paints are solid bodies , allowing the paint to retains its antimicrobial effect permanently . The coating exceeds indoor air quality regulations measured in VOCs and qualifies for LEED credits . <p> The wide-range of applications for Bioni paints includes medical and nursing facilities of all kinds , commercial and residential buildings , hotels , resorts and more . Bioni fatade paints and roof coatings may also be used to protect the exterior of buildings from attack by algae and moss .

@@6624901 <p> While a buildings exterior fatade is only one piece of the complex building puzzle , its design certainly has an impact arguably the strongest impact in terms of visual appeal and overall first impression , often setting the tone for the building as a whole . Today , new fatade techniques , materials and technologies make almost any type of artistic expression possible , while at the same time enabling designers and specifiers to achieve optimum sustainability for a building , both in terms of energy efficiency and quality of the interior environment . Let 's take a look at a few examples of innovative , aesthetically pleasing and sustainable building fatades from around the world . <p> * * * * * * Double Skin Fatades <p> Many of the world 's iconic buildings are plagued by the same problem : interior climate control . With most of them being towering glass and metal clad monoliths , they tend to get too hot during the summer , and lose all their heat during the winter , leading to costly annual heating and cooling bills . This is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Europe 's tallest , and London 's latest landmark - Shard London Bridge - are using an innovative cladding system called Double Skin Fatade ( DSF ) . <p> The Double Skin Fatade is an innovative system of building consisting of a pair of glass " skins " separated by an air cavity . The air space between the layers of glass acts as insulation against temperature extremes , winds , and sound . Integrated sun-shading devices , typically an operable horizontal blind system , are often located between the two skins . The ventilation of the cavity can be either natural or mechanical . In cold seasons , the air within the cavity can be circulated to the occupied space to offset heating requirements , while in hot climates , the cavity may be vented out of the building to mitigate solar gain and decrease the cooling load . <p> In the case of Londons Shard , designed by architect Renzo Piano and pictured above right , the outer skin is made of a single glazing , while the inner skin is made of double glazing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural daylight to enter the interior , the ventilated cavity includes solar sensitive roller blinds . Naturally ventilated winter gardens with operable louver windows are located on each floor to allow building occupants to connect with the outside environment . <p> The DSF approach does have some drawbacks , including the loss of usable floor space and the cost of an extra skin and its supporting structure . A double wall also adds a level of complexity , requiring a whole building design approach that closely coordinates several disciplines , including mechanical and structural engineering , thermal analysis , and lighting design . <p> * * * * * * Perforated Fatades <p> Perforated walls , panels and screens have been used for centuries as a way to control the level of light entering a building while offering privacy to its occupants . Today , the functions of perforations have remained largely the same , but the materials and methods of manufacture have advanced considerably . No longer cut or carved by hand , developments in computer-controlled technologies mean that detailed patterns can now be quickly and easily etched into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings . Shade and privacy continue to be the key practical purposes of perforations , but the potential applications are now greater than ever . <p> Pictured above right , the Orange Cube , also known as Le Cube Orange , is a cultural design showroom and office building located on the banks of Sa ( ne River in Lyon , France . The intention of the project was to combine a showroom dedicated to the world of design objects inside the architecture of a fantastic building , and create an experience along the banks of the river . <p> The vibrant structure actually has two fatades , and yes , they 're both orange . The outer fatade , or " veil , " is a screen of punched aluminum panels designed to shield the building from the sun . Each panel was laser-cut , to give the screen its large , bubble-shaped apertures , and punch-pressed , to create the " micro-perforations " that give it translucency . The perforations are attached to a steel frame set approximately 10 inches from the buildings primary fatade , itself a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade of orange to give the building depth . <p> Le Cube Orange consumes less energy due to its eye catching high performance fatade , which also maximizes visual comfort for building occupants , with all offices enjoying natural daylighting . A geothermal heat pump with heat recovery provides energy efficient heating and cooling , making use of the relatively constant temperature of the nearby river . Finally , a photovoltaic system on the roof provides 10% of the buildings electricity needs . Orange was chosen as the color for the building , as a reference to the industrial color commonly used in harbors . <p> * * * * * *Media Fatades <p> For years , advertising messages have appeared painted on building walls , on rooftop billboards , and more recently , on vinyl building wraps . Now , LED media fatades are revolutionizing the worlds of architecture , media , advertising and art , to create the ultimate digital building skin . <p> A media fatade is both a giant advertising medium and an important architectural component , emphasizing the uniqueness of the building in the urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dynamic LED video screens have given architects a new medium that enables them to display corporate identities on a large scope , covering all or part of a building with still and video images , and stunning visual effects . <p> T he recently built media fatade of the Port Authority Bus Terminal ( PABT ) in New York is one of the worlds largest LED media fatades . Located in midtown Manhattan between 40th and 42nd street , the transparent media fatade , completed by GKD Metal Fabrics , effectively covers the buildings outdated steel fatade . GKD-USA , the leading manufacturer of woven metal fabrics , secured the contract to manufacture and install 6,000-square-feet of Mediamesh on the PABT . The fatade provides a multitude of benefits to the Port Authority , including opportunities for advertising revenue given its prime location one block from Times Square . In addition , the fatade hides the terminals 1970s-era steel overlay , which earned it the unflattering designation as one of the 10 ugliest buildings in the world , by VirtualTourist.com . <p> The project features 16 panels containing 1.325 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal fabric which wrap around two sides of the building , each side comprising eight panels . The size and shape of the installation creates two surfaces for simultaneous , separate or continuous messaging .

@@6624906 <p> so you probably think you 've seen it all when it comes to concrete construction . Well , think again ! New and innovative advancements in concrete technology are completely rocking the design and construction world . Here are just five of our favorites . <p> See Through , Light Transmitting Concrete <p> LiTraCon light-transmitting concrete , also known as translucent concrete , may literally be the brightest concrete development in recent years . <p> Originally developed by Hungarian architect Aron Losonczi in 2001 , the original process involved casting thousands of individual fiber filaments in prefabricated concrete blocks , making production time-consuming and costly . Newer , semi-automatic production processes use woven fiber fabric instead of single filaments . Fabric and concrete layers are alternately inserted into molds at intervals of approximately 2 to 5 millimeters , with thinner layers allowing an increased amount of light to pass through . Due to their small size , the fibers blend into the concrete , becoming a component of the material like small pieces of ballast . Following casting , the material is cut into panels or blocks of the specified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging from semi- to high-gloss . <p> The fibers are oriented in a parallel pattern which produces a brighter side and a darker side of the concrete block . Shadows on the lighter side will appear as dramatic silhouettes and outlines on the darker one . The fibers can transmit light to over 65 feet , and , as they occupy only a very small percentage ( approximately 4% ) of the total concrete block or panel , they do not significantly affect the structural capabilities of the poured pieces . In fact , load bearing structures may one day be built out of these translucent blocks . Optical fibers transmit light so effectively that there is virtually no loss of light conducted through the fibers ; in fact , its even possible to transmit colors . <p> One can imagine all kinds of artistic as well as functional applications for this new-and-improved form of concrete , from reducing lighting costs in buildings during daylight hours , to creating lit walkways to enhance pedestrian safety at night . The exciting material has already been used in projects around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embassy in Paris , and the Iberville Parish Veterans Memorial in Louisiana , pictured above . As this technology continues to evolve and mature , virtually anything could be possible for talented architects , engineers and designers reading to embrace this material of the future ! <p> Above : The largest installation of translucent concrete blocks in the USA brings Louisianas Iberville Parish Veterans Memorial to life as the structure is lighted from within as well as by surrounding flood lights . <p> SolidPoetry <p> Based in the Netherlands , SolidPoetry is made up of two designers Frederick Molenschot and Susanne Happle who are trying to make concrete beautiful again . <p> As with most forms of concrete , Solid Poetry looks fairly grey and lifeless when dry . What 's special about this particular " smart " material is that when you sprinkle it with water , hidden decorative patterns will start to emerge , as if by magic . <p> The detailed patterns are created by carefully applying a surface treatment to the finished concrete surface that darkens when exposed to water or humid air . Solid Poetry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have frequent humidity changes , such as pool sides , gardens , bathrooms , and saunas . Since Solid Poetry is produced like normal concrete , it can be manufactured in many different shapes , sizes , thicknesses , and colors . The design of the pattern is also almost limitless , and can even incorporate words and phrases perfect for public place applications ! <p> Self-Consolidating Concrete <p> Self-consolidating concrete , also known as self-compacting concrete ( SCC ) , is a highly flowable , non-segregating concrete that spreads into place , fills formwork , and encapsulates even the most congested reinforcement , all without any mechanical vibration . It is defined as a concrete mix that can be placed purely by means of its own weight , with little or no vibration . As a high-performance concrete , SCC delivers these attractive benefits while still maintaining all of concrete 's tough mechanical and durability characteristics . <p> The third-tallest building in the U.S. measuring in at 1389 ft , Chicagos Trump International Hotel and Tower is a marvel of architecture and engineering , and its strength is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of a 10-foot thick reinforced concrete mat supported on rock caissons . This 5,000-cubic-yard mat foundation is said to be the largest single self-consolidating concrete pour in North America . Designers Skidmore , Owings &amp; Merrill LLP opted to use self-consolidating concrete following the successful application of this technology in the construction of the Burj Khalifa building in Dubai , currently the worlds tallest building , according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat ( CTBUH ) . <p> For the Trump International Hotel and Tower , the concrete temperature was limited to a maximum of 80F ( 27C ) at the time of placement and 170F ( 77C ) in-place . A 56-day compressive strength of 10,000 psi ( 69 MPa ) was also specified . While each of the specification requirements for the SCC could be met easily , their combination and the need for consistency in performance for this continuous placement posed a significant challenge . <p> Concrete producer Prairie Material Sales , Inc. along with their chemical admixture supplier , BASF , collaboratively designed a concrete mixture that would adhere to the strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Plant #32 made 600 trips to the Trump Tower site over 23 hours for the " big pour " . The concrete was conveyed into place and flowed as far as 40 ft without segregating . The mixture was extremely consistent throughout the placement , even when the trucks were backed up entering the site . An average compressive strength of 9,100 psi was achieved at 7 days and the 28-day strength was well over the design 56-day strength of 10,000 psi , conclusively demonstrating the capabilities of SCC . The use of SCC is bound to grow in the coming years as innovative design professionals pursue unique opportunities for its application such as projects like Trump International Hotel and Tower . <p> Above : The mat foundation for Chicagos Trump International Hotel and Tower required approximately 5,000 cubic yards of SCC , poured over a 23-hour period . <p> Geopolymer Concrete <p> In late 2013 , the University of Queensland , Australias Global Change Institute ( GCI ) , designed by HASSELL in conjunction with structural and fatade engineer Bligh Tanner was unveiled as the worlds first building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 story high public building comprises 3 suspended geopolymer concrete floors made up of 33 precast panels . The panels are made from slag/fly ash-based geopolymer concrete coined Earth Friendly Concrete ( EFC ) , a Wagners brand name for their commercial form of geopolymer concrete . <p> Comprising sand , aggregate and a binder that contains ground granulated blast furnace slag , a waste product from steel production , and fly ash , a waste product from coal fired power generation , EFC contains no Portland cement . This allows it to have very low CO2 emissions as compared to traditional Portland cement-based concrete . The precast panels with cast in hydronic pipes also play an integral part of the building 's low energy and passive cooling modes . Prior to the GCI project , geopolymer had only been used in trials for ground bearing pavements , masonry blocks and other low level structural applications . <p> As well as being more environmentally friendly , the panels have faster curing times , which contribute to lowered production costs . The different chemistry of the binder also means that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reaction which avoids the possibility of thermal cracking , 30 per cent higher flexural tensile strength than normal concrete , and higher durability than normal concrete . <p> The designers hope that the Global Change Institute building will provide a path for others to explore new and innovative materials of the future , such as geopolymer concrete , that will improve the sustainability of our built environment for generations to come . <p> Above : The recently opened Global Change Institute in the University of Queensland may be the most sustainable building in Australia , thanks in part to geopolymer concrete . <p> Self Healing Concrete <p> Self-healing concrete could expand the life of paving and structures by as much as 50 percent and eliminate the need for costly manual repairs . Over seven per cent of the world 's CO2 emissions are caused by cement production , so reducing the amount required by extending the lifetime of structures and removing the need for repairs will have a positive environmental impact . <p> Researchers face several challenges in their efforts to find a suitable strain of bacteria for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult place for bacteria to thrive . They are trying to find an organism that is not only able to flourish , but able to produce a large amount of spores .

Micro-capsules will enclose and protect the bacteria while providing nutrients and calcium lactate , which will be converted by the bacteria once water is present . <p> British contractor Costain hopes to trial the self healing concrete on its jobsites in 2015 . With the addition of microbes , future buildings and roadways could take on an organic element that combines biology , chemistry , and architecture ! <p> Above : Concrete structures could one day soon be able to fix their own surface cracks , thanks to the work of British researchers . <p> Need more inspiration ?

In order to share his experiences with a wider audience , Enea decided to dedicate a " Museum " to his trees , thereby implying that they are equally worthy of the care and attention we usually reserve for manmade objects . His concept of constructing open-air spaces a characteristic of all Enea gardens allows the trees to be singled out and to become individuals , as visitors walk around the rooms and observe them from different angles . <p> The Museum features approximately 50 trees representing more than 25 varieties , several examples of which are more than 100 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaping were applied to transplant and preserve the specimens .

Halprin created a new sort of memorial , a sequence of four garden rooms crafted in a narrative sequence to tell the story of the U.S. during the four terms of Franklin Delano Roosevelts presidency . The memorials rooms and water features , built primarily of red South Dakota granite , use stone to express the fracture and upheaval of the times . Water , in the form of cascades , waterfalls , and pools , is a metaphorical component of the palette , with the volume and complexity escalating as the narrative progresses . <p> The memorial also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from FDRs speeches and radio talks . The sculptures , by Leonard Baskin , Neil Estern , Robert Graham , Thomas Hardy , and George Segal , depict images from the Depression and World War II , including a breadline and a man listening to a Fireside Chat on his radio . After complaints from the National Organization on Disability , a statue of the president seated in his wheelchair was incorporated into the memorial , the nations first memorial designed to be wheelchair accessible . The memorial was dedicated by President Clinton on May 2 , 1997 . <p> In Halprins New York Times obituary , the FDR Memorial was described as his favorite project . <p> #7 Tanghe River Park , TurenscapeQinhuangdao , China <p> Designed by Turenscape , an internationally renowned landscape architecture , urban design , and architecture firm based in Beijing , China , Tanghe River Park is an inspiring example of contemporary landscape design .

Turenscape was able to preserve the environmental treasures while integrating sound ecological principles . Four pavilions in the shape of clouds are distributed along the ribbon , which provide protection from the weather , meeting opportunities , and visual focal points . Four perennial flower gardens of white , yellow , purple , and blue , act as patchwork on the former open fields . The color red was chosen to be bright and inviting while also symbolizing Chinas joy and prosperity towards preserving the environment . Tanghe River Park won the 2007 ASLA Design Honor Award . In fact , Turenscape has won an unprecedented eight national ASLA awards over the last eight years , most of them for poetic and powerful urban waterfront parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civic Center Parks , two new centrally-located parks that will transform Santa Monica 's Civic Center .

This rustic , Italian inspired outdoor kitchen situated amongst Maine 's mountains features a wood-burning pizza oven , Hybrid Fire Grill , and cooktop by Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet , along with plenty of locally-quarried granite , a hand carved sink , and a custom-made farm-style dining table . <p> Bringing the Indoors Out <p> Fueled by the vision and talents of landscape architects and designers , over the last decade we 've seen outdoor spaces evolve into exotic extensions of our indoor living environments , combining the pleasures of nature with all the comforts of modern living . According to a 2013 Residential Landscape Architecture Trends survey conducted by the American Society of Landscape Architects ( ASLA ) , the trend toward bringing the indoors , outdoors , shows no sign of slowing . Landscape architects who specialize in residential design across the country were asked to rate the expected popularity of a variety of residential outdoor design features in 2013 . The category of outdoor living spaces , defined as al fresco kitchens and entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very popular . It all but tied with gardens and landscaped spaces at 94.4 percent . <p> The possibilities for outdoor rooms are almost limitless from large and spacious to small and intimate ; from a simple patio-sized eating and grilling area to a grand multilevel deck complete with cocktail bar , outdoor pizza kitchen , fountain , spa and pool . In an outdoor room , the " walls , " can be an extension of the home 's exterior walls or they can be formed by trees , shrubs , hedges , planters , fences , privacy screens or lattice panels . Outdoor " flooring " can be as simple as grass , pebbles or stepping-stones or as elaborate as wooden decking or tiles installed on a concrete pad . " Ceilings " may be outlined by tree limbs , vines , pergolas , arbors , retractable awnings or permanent roof structures . <p> The indoor/outdoor living spaces expand the homes living and entertaining square footage .

The openness makes the home look and feel larger than it actually is , and provides the extensive entertaining and living space desired by todays savvy buyers . <p> Technology , audio systems , and the home theater experience are also important to the next-gen homeowner . In the New American Homes family room , a retractable media system with digital surround sound provides entertainment for the indoor/outdoor family room and is even viewable from the pool . The media experience is available at a touch by using wall-mounted iPads or a smartphone . When the system is activated , motorized shades cover the windows , lights dim , and the projector and screen lower from the ceiling .

You could enjoy fresh air and natural lighting while preparing food , with a kitchen island or countertop to serve drinks and provide extra bar seating . Owners of the Belvedere , California home pictured at right , did just that , thanks to the NanaWall Kitchen Transition , a custom window-door combination that opens instantly to create an outdoor kitchen . The window system creates an outdoor countertop , while the door system allows a seamless transition to the patio .

But why stop there ? Why not bring outside elements inside , to enjoy year round ? <p> Without question , stone is the most time-tested , enduring and endearing building material known to mankind . The difference today is that new and incredible technologies allow designers to quickly , efficiently and cost-effectively bring the outdoors in particularly with the specification of large format " building stone " material once considered suitable only for exterior applications . <p> In the last five years , there has been a huge spike in the use of natural building stone such as granite , slate , travertine and marble in residential and commercial interior design . Because stone is as natural as any building product found on this planet , people tend to associate it instantly with the green movement , so todays interior designers are specifying it more and more to highlight the environmentally friendly aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also often be used outdoors to increase the feeling of an open living space and visually tie the two environments together , especially when the exterior is visible from the interior . <p> When using building stone indoors , there are some logistical challenges to consider . For example , advanced planning is recommended as larger stones may have to be installed earlier in the construction processfor example , some stone materials may not fit through finished doorways . Another challenge that is now being addressed is how to make stone material lighter in weight so that it is suitable for indoor applications . This may be accomplished by sawing it to a thinner format , while still maintaining the look of full-sized stones used on the exterior . <p> A prime example of a commercial interior that brought the outdoors in using natural building stoneand that did everything conceivable to be as environmentally-friendly as possiblecan be seen at the Hannaford Supermarket in Augusta , Maine , pictured above right . This Hannaford store was the first supermarket in the country to be awarded Leadership in Energy and Environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building Council . The project 's unique stonework includes the use of both full-bed and thin-veneer natural stone on both the exterior and interior of the structure . Contributing to Hannaford 's LEED certification process was the procurement of building materials from producers no more than 500 miles away . Suitable natural stone was sourced from " local " quarrier Champlain Stone Ltd. , which is located in Warrensburg , N.Y. , roughly 300 miles from the supermarket 's jobsite . <p> Hannaford 's design specification included more than 1,300 square feet of full-bed stone for the exterior and 1,500 square feet of a thin-sawn version of the same material for the interior . The inside corner matches the adjacent outside wall , spanning both sides of the storefront , and is divided by glass windows extending almost floor to ceiling . Going from the outside to the inside , only a bona fide building stone professional could tell that the interior wall consists of a thin stone veneer . <p> Another growing trend is incorporating green walls in the interiorscape . Also known as living walls , bio-walls or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freestanding structures made up entirely of plants or specialized and engineered envelope systems where vegetation is planted , irrigated and grown in modular elements secured to , or integrated with , the wall of a building . <p> All living walls require some type of support structure , a physical barrier to protect the wall , a way to deliver water , and a growing medium for the plants . Many green walls use innovative hydroponics technology . The plants will filter the air and enrich it with oxygen , naturally cooling buildings in the summer and humidifying them in the winter . <p> Parker Urban Greenscapes installed the huge biowall pictured at right in the atrium of Drexel University 's Papadakis Integrated Sciences Building ( PISB ) in the fall of 2011 . The five-story , 80-foot tall BioWall boasts over 1,500 plants and is an integrated part of the buildings air handling system , designed to help clean the indoor air . The wall is North America 's largest living biofilter and the only such structure at a U.S. university . Contaminated air is drawn through the roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volatile compounds . At Drexel , professors and students use the wall to examine its effect on the interior atmosphere and its potential health benefits for commercial and academic applications . The wall assisted the PSIB in earning Gold LEED-certification and earned Parker Urban Greenscapes two awards at the PIA Interior Plantscape Hall of Fame and Awards Banquet at the 2012 Industry Expo . <p> If you 're thinking about incorporating a lush living wall or vertical garden on a smaller scale in your next design , one to keep in mind is TerraScreen by Tournesol Siteworks . The TerraScreen Interior Greenwall System was designed by Planterra to hold large 6 " plants and can be maintained by your average interior landscape contractor . The cost-effective , maintenance-friendly system requires about 18 " of space from the wall and a catch basin , but can be supported with drip irrigation and a tank , too . It 's comprised of modular panels made with powder-coated , galvanized steel wire . Often described as living art , the TerraScreen allows the designer , landscaper , or owner to use plants to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or celebrate a season . Watering up to 35 plants takes no more than 3-5 minutes at a time . <p> As an alternative to a green wall , designers can also add features such as an architectural screen or window with organic horticultural designs that throws shadows inside a space . <p> Last but not least , here 's a fresh take on a bathroom accessory that will bring a smile to your face each time you step out of the shower : a moss-laden rug to cradle your newly scrubbed feet and transport you to the great outdoors . Aside from its ability to liven up any old shower space , the Moss Carpet also gets major bonus points for being a wonderfully low-maintenance addition to your bathroom which features a non-slip grip and resistance to mold .

@@6624961 <p> Many of the worlds most iconic cities Chicago , Barcelona , Sydney , Vancouver - can trace their historical growth back to one simple and often overlooked geographical aspect : proximity to water . Today , designers , landscape architects and urban planners are again turning their attention towards seafronts , lakeshores and riverbanks , capitalizing on the transformative potential of water to spark city-wide revitalization . <p> In this article , we take a look at 3 inspiring examples of urban waterfronts . <p> Cumberland Park and the neighboring redeveloped Bridge Building are the first phases of an ambitious master plan intended to draw Nashville residents and visitors back to the river . Designed by Hargreaves Associates , the adventure play park is committed to environmental sustainability through Brownfield remediation , storm water harvesting , improved biodiversity , floodplain preservation , and interpretation of cultural and natural resources . <p> Located on the Cumberland Rivers east bank below the Shelby Street pedestrian bridge , the 6.5-acre ( 2.6 ha ) Cumberland Park transforms land for years put to industrial and commercial use into a vibrant new family-focused adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encapsulated in the parks main landforms to reduce off-site disposal costs while introducing new topography . Many of the above-grade industrial structures were retained and restored as interpretive elements , protecting unique cultural and historic features . <p> The projects transform a derelict site into a vibrant green space . The park is sensitive to the sites relationship to the river and the impact of the 2010 floods that ravaged the Nashville area . The design team worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that creation of the park would preserve floodplain function without increasing flood elevations or decreasing floodwater storage.The park also restores native riparian buffer , reduces un-shaded pavement by 60% , increases native plant biodiversity 100% , utilizes regional materials and manufacturers to stimulate local economy , and captures an estimated 1,000,000 gallons of storm water annually to be reused as irrigation . <p> Cumberland Park is the flagship of the New Riverfront Revitalization Plan , which was endorsed by community members to provide greater accessibility and more recreational opportunities . In addition , it is an integral part of the larger city effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing a new trail head for cycle networks and greenways . <p> Stranden is the first of a multi-stage redevelopment of the precinct known as Aker Brygge in Oslo , Norway . It is part of a greater effort to reinvigorate Oslos once grimy , post-industrial seafront by creating a publically accessible boardwalk , connecting the citys east and west . The precincts developer , Norwegian Property ( NPRO ) , aims to reinvigorate Aker Brygge by refurbishing the urban outdoor spaces , transforming the areas retail concept , and introducing new office space . <p> The waterfront promenade , Stranden , was officially opened , together with a new marina , in May , 2014 . The remaining phases will be completed in 2015/16 . These include Bryggetorget , the precincts main square , and various streetscapes which connect the area to both the waterfront and the city fabric beyond.LINK Landskap is the project Landscape Architect for all urban outdoor areas at Aker Brygge , and was previously the project Landscape Architect for the iconic post-industrial sites original transformation in the late 1980s . <p> Aker Brygge is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix of apartments , shopping , culture and restaurants . The area is much loved by residents and tourists alike , and is visited by around 12 million people each year . The refurbished waterfront promenade has reinvigorated the area , breathing new life and interest into an important centre for social interaction and activity in Oslo . <p> The landscape refurbishment increases visual and physical contact with Oslos magnificent fjord , while also encouraging social interaction and diversity along the waterfront promenade . One of the projects main challenges has been to reconfigure and simplify Strandens cross-section ; reorganising and consolidating the promenade in order to create a wider , more generous publically accessible waterfront . This creates more space for promenading , staying and increases flexibility for other spontaneous and un-planned activities . According to the designers , the result is a more dynamic experience of the fjord landscape and more " space for life " . <p> LINK Landskap developed a site-specific concept for street furniture that cultivates and celebrates the role of social interaction in the public realm . The concept for street furniture was developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street furniture design and manufacture - and furniture designers Lars Torne and Atle Tveit . The concept is based on diversity of activity and flexibility of use . The projects signature colour is inspired by Signal Orange ; a reminder of Oslos maritime history . <p> Torontos Sherbourne Common is unique in the fact that it is both a major civic amenity and a cutting edge stormwater treatment facility . Running along Lower Sherbourne between Lake Shore Blvd and Lake Ontario , the 1.5 hectare park is a key component in the revitalization of the Canadian citys urban waterfront . The park 's innovative idea is that it 's a water treatment facility as well as a place of recreation . Large tanks of water under the waterfront promenade hold stormwater runoff . There is also a UV treatment facility under the pavilion in the centre of the park . After the stormwater is treated , it 's carried through a channel that runs along the length of the park , through a biofiltration bed , and into Lake Ontario . <p> The park was designed by renowned landscape architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lake " to the area . The park 's design embraces all seasons and different times of day by providing a range of opportunities . In summer , water is celebrated through the art sculptures and channel and also emerges playfully through an array of water jets scattered across the central plaza . Once the jets are turned off the plaza is transformed into a stage , and in winter months the splash pad becomes a skating rink . A carefully considered lighting strategy creates visual interest and a well lit environment for evening use . <p> A hybridized park , Sherbourne Common is the first park in Canada to integrate a UV treatment facility into its design and represents major innovation in the way natural systems and civic infrastructures are integrated into cities . Stormwater management is integral to the park 's aesthetic and interactive functioning . The stormwater narrative is the primary organizing feature of the park and describes the journey and transformation of stormwater from the sky to the ground and ultimately to the lake . The process of cleansing stormwater binds all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park into an aesthetic and experiential stormwater system that educates the public about water quality issues through its interactive and engaging spaces . <p> Sherbourne Common is the first site along the revitalized waterfront to make a strong public connection from Lakeshore Boulevard to Lake Ontario , and attempts to repair the long felt disconnect between the city and the lake . Sherbourne Common provides an opportunity for Torontonians to reengage with the lake and experience from a new perspective a forgotten stretch of their industrial waterfront . <p> As one of the first parks in Canada to pursue LEED Gold certification , Sherbourne Common successfully integrates a number of sustainable practices in the park design . In addition to the park 's extensive stormwater treatment program , other aspects of sustainability incorporated into the parks design include easy access to public transportation , storage for bicycles and other alternative means of transportation , use of native or regionally adapted trees in large numbers which strongly contributes to the City of Toronto 's tree coverage goals , and the use of water efficient plant material to reduce the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally available materials , extensively uses light colored permeable paving surfaces to reduce the urban heat island effect , and uses particular light fixtures to reduce light pollution . <p> Want to know more ?

@@6624984 <p> One design methodology that 's gaining popularity in the green movement is " Biophilia " . It 's not a new idea--Harvard biologist Edward O Wilson first proposed it in 1984--but in the last few years studies have begun to show it has significant and measurable effects on peoples ' state of mind . <p> The word Biophilia literally means " love of life " . Wilson chose it to label what he defined as humans innate and evolutionarily based affinity for nature . Biophilia dovetails perfectly with sustainable building design because it involves the inclusion of nature and natural elements in the built environment . These elements might include daylighting and natural ventilation , views to nature , and access to plants and water features . A vegetated roof , for example , which limits ambient heat build-up and reduces storm water runoff , can also provide an urban garden and connection to nature . Natural ventilation can reduce cooling loads and air-moving equipment , while also providing fresh air . Carefully shaded glazing provides heat and light , while bestowing on interior spaces subtle diurnal changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have shown biophilic elements have real , measurable benefits relative to such human performance metrics as productivity , emotional well-being , stress reduction , learning , and healing . In addition , biophilic features foster an appreciation of nature , which , in turn , should lead to greater protection of natural areas , eliminate pollution , and maintain a cleaner environment . <p> Perhaps the most famous success story for Biophilic design is Frank Lloyd Wright 's Fallingwater , shown at right , and widely considered to be the most important piece of American architecture in the last hundred years . Here are a few more examples of Biophilia in urban ecosystems . <p> * * * * * <p> Genzyme Center , Cambridge , Massachusetts <p> Designed by the award-winning German architectural firm Behnisch , Behnisch and Partner , the LEED Platinum rated Genzyme Center is a twelve-storey , 350,000 square foot office building that combines biophilic design principles and cutting-edge green technology to create an exciting , healthy and productive workplace for more than 900 Genzyme employees . With a striking all-glass exterior and a soaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban revitalization project in the Kendall Square neighborhood of Cambridge , Massachusetts . It is also recognized as one of the most environmentally responsible office buildings ever built in the United States . <p> The building envelope is a high-performance curtainwall glazing system with operable windows on all 12 floors . More than 32% of the exterior is a ventilated double-facade that blocks solar gains in summer and captures solar gains in the winter . Steam from a nearby power plant is used for central heating and cooling . The steam drives absorption chillers for cooling during the summer and is exchanged directly into heat for heating during the winter . <p> Perhaps the building 's most impressive feature is the 12-storey open-air atrium , shown at right , which acts as a huge return air duct and natural light shaft . Fresh air moves into the atrium and up and out exhaust fans near the skylight . The natural light enhancement system utilizes a series of roof-mounted heliostats ( mirrors ) that track the sun 's movement across the skylight to fixed mirrors . The mirrors further reflect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the atrium . The louvers also move with the suns path and elevation and reflect glaring , direct sunlight back to the mirrors , allowing diffuse light to enter the atrium . Once in the atrium , the light is further reflected to the floors by a system of hanging prismatic mobiles , reflective panels , and a reflective light wall on the inner surface of the atrium . This incredible daylighting system allows more than 75% of the employee workforce to work using natural light , and yields a 42% savings in electricity costs ! <p> The building also uses 32% less water than a comparable office building by using waterless urinals , dual-flush toilets , automatic faucets , and low-flow fixtures . Storm water supplements the evaporative cooling towers and irrigates the landscaped roof . Finally , building materials were chosen for their low emissions , recycled content , or local manufacturing .

As one of the highest performing commercial buildings in the world , OSC will achieve triple net-zero performance in energy and water use and carbon emissions . It is designed to meet the worlds most stringent green building criteria , the Cascadia Region Green Building Councils Living Building Challenge . <p> Passive systems are the backbone of the Centers design , capitalizing on natural systems like solar orientation , thermal mass , and heat transfer .

Able to see how they useand wasteenergy , tenants can more closely manage their personal energy use . Sustainable design coupled with tenant awareness and behavior is anticipated to push energy use reduction to more than 70% below that of a typical office building . <p> The roofs and canopies of the Center will funnel rain water into a 200,000-gallon storage tank in the basement , enough to provide for the building throughout the dry season .

But you usually ca n't eat them ! Now , a rooftop in Chicago , Illinois , is being put to productive use as a source of organic food . <p> What began as an innovative idea hatched from a passion for sustainability has grown to become a 2500 square foot , certified organic rooftop farm , rising 30 feet above Devon Avenue on the north side of Chicago . Owned by the restaurant Uncommon Ground , the farm , shown below right , illustrates how green agriculture is both possible and functional in an urban environment . <p> For over 18 years Uncommon Ground has upheld a farm to table mentality , building relationships with farmers from the Great Lakes region who follow sustainable and organic methods . In 2007 the owners of Uncommon Ground , Helen and Michael Cameron , decided to expand . In finding the second home for their restaurant at 1401 W.

Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce , from Nardello Peppers to Black Prince Tomatoes , which fuel the restaurant below . <p> Not only does the restaurant grow vegetables on the roof , they also employ 5 solar panels that heat up to 50% of the water used on site , house 4 beehives that will eventually produce over 200 pounds of honey , and teach urban agriculture classes to local school groups of all ages , ranging from grade school to grad school . The rooftop has been busy since mid-summer of 2008 when the construction finished and the farm opened its planter boxes for planting and eventual harvest . <p> The extensive remodel at 1401 W. Devon began with digging down into the basement an extra five feet to accommodate the heavy-duty steel beams required to support a rooftop farm . Every effort is taken to make the restaurant as " green " and sustainable as possible , including the interior tables , which are made from re-claimed , locally harvested wood and designed by local furniture makers . On the rooftop farm there are 28 raised bed planter boxes that were designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 640 square feet of organic soil ( nearly 6 tons ) . The planter boxes rest on top of a deck that is made entirely out of a recycled plastic and wood composite material , making it durable to the daily duties of farming . <p> Beyond the green materials and products that the restaurant uses , the idea for a sustainable community hub is important to Uncommon Ground . There is a weekly organic farmers market , complete with live local musicians and artists displaying their goods . And , once a month Uncommon Ground holds an Eco-mixer hosted by local green organizations with the intent of developing opportunities for networking and growing a sustainable community of like-minded individuals .

The best way to handle the problem of undesirables is to make the place attractive to everyone else . " --William H. Whyte <p> From medieval castles to modern airports , security concerns have always influenced architecture . Now , in the 21st century , terrorism , crime , biohazards , and workplace violence have raised public awareness about security in the built environment to an all-time high . But security does n't  need to be obtrusive , obvious or restrictive to be effective .

The goal is not to make security invisible , but simply to make the security measures in place less visible to the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pronounced " sep-ted " ) is widely accepted throughout North America as an effective way to improve safety in neighborhoods and communities . Much more far reaching than deadbolts on doors or locks on windows , CPTED principles are easily and inexpensively applied to many situations and scales , from new construction to renovation to neighborhood revitalization . CPTED includes the following four overlapping strategies : <p> Natural Surveillance <p> This CPTED design concept is directed primarily at discouraging criminal activity by ensuring that public spaces are easily observable . While " hard " surveillance techniques may involve hidden cameras and security personnel , " soft " features that maximize visibility of people , parking areas and building entrances can be equally effective . <p> Examples include : <p> Unobstructed doors and windows that look out on to streets and parking areas ; <p> Conversely , large columns or pillars , sharp " blind " corners , dense landscape screens and tall privacy fences that can shield an attacker are serious impediments to the feeling of being safe . <p> By designing environments where there is plenty of opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic surveillance may only be necessary in vulnerable locations such as elevators and interior corridors . <p> Territorial Reinforcement <p> Promoted by features that clearly define property lines and distinguish private places from public spaces , territorial reinforcement uses landscape plantings , pavement designs , gateway treatments , signage and fencing to control access to an area . When considering how you can achieve territorial reinforcement in your design , be sure not to forget about the importance of natural surveillance as these two CPTED concepts can occasionally conflict with one another . For example , wherever possible try to install non-opaque fencing that allows you to see through to the other side , such as the elegant looking Majestic design byAmeristar , shown at right . Keep access control vegetation such thorny bushes cut below eye level . <p> Territorial reinforcement is further enhanced by a sense of pride of ownership , which is demonstrated by how a space is cared for and maintained . CPTED and the " Broken Window Theory " suggests that one " broken window " or nuisance , if allowed to exist , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire neighborhood . In other words , neglected and poorly maintained areas offer an invitation to criminal activity while carefully maintained property will elicit responsible treatment . Examples of proper maintenance include the immediate removal of litter and graffiti , landscape pruning , maintenance of lighting fixtures , weed abatement and painting of worn buildings . A well displayed , strategically located phone number to call for repairs and report vandalism in public areas is also recommended . <p> Natural Access Control <p> Natural access control is another CPTED design concept directed primarily at decreasing crime opportunity by denying access to crime targets and creating a perception of risk for offenders . Achieved by the strategic design of streets , sidewalks , building entrances , exits and neighborhood gateways to clearly indicate public routes through a space while discouraging access to private areas , natural access control is a logical extension of the idea of territorial reinforcement . <h> Target Hardening <p> Target hardening is accomplished by traditional security measures that prohibit entry or access such as window locks and grilles , shatter film on windows , alarms , bollards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crime prevention is most effective when combined with the other CPTED strategies identified above , so as to achieve a balanced , holistic approach . <p> Technology is helping to balance the need for security with the publics desire for a less intrusive , " transparent " appearance . Recent advances in the field of window films are an example . An optically clear film is available that can be applied to almost any window , providing a significant increase in protection . Window films provide several security advantages . Glass-fragmentation retention film actually strengthens the glass , increasing the force necessary to break the glass and prevents glass fragments from flying . Window film is relatively inexpensive and is typically done as a retrofit on existing glass . Different types of film are available to meet different needs , including everything from vandal resistance to blast resistance . Glass fragmentation window film has been applied at facilities owned by such diverse organizations as NASDAQ , Wells Fargo and the Department of Defense . <p> The idea of hiding security devices is not new . Manufacturers have been building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Intrusion-detection equipment has also been available in hidden housings . Now , manufacturers of highsecurity vehicle barriers have followed suit . The vehicle barrier approach is unusual in that high-strength antivehicle bollards are now available in an ornamental configuration . For example , The Chandler Company , shown , right , has created a line of concrete barriers encased in decorative skin of FRP ( fiberglass reinforced plastic ) composite to help to increases the penetration resistance while minimizing dangerous blast by-products . <p> The impact of security is evident in perimeter systems , too . Some facilities are blending designs into the metal perimeter fence construction to reduce the visual impact of the fence . The corporate headquarters for Delta Airlines in Atlanta is surrounded by a fence with the Delta logo incorporated into it . Less than 10 miles away , the corporate headquarters for the Southern Company --- parent company to Georgia Power and other utilities - sports lightning bolts bent into the metalwork of the perimeter fence .
