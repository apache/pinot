
 one of 44 competitive electricity suppliers selling power in the PPL coverage area , unveiled a plan offering four hours of free electricity in the evening . But even with four hours of free power , it may not be the best deal for all consumers . <p> In this example of time-of-use or dynamic pricing , Direct Energy offers power at no charge from 7 to 11 p.m. seven days a week . Another plan offers free power for one day a week . <p> Time-of-use , or dynamic electricity pricing schemes , although common in some other parts of the country , are just beginning to make inroads with residential consumers in Pennsylvania . With restructured electricity markets and smart metering available - dynamic rates are the next step in the evolution , one that brings prices paid for electricity closer to the cost of producing the power . <p> " ( Most ) customers pay a one-size-fits-all price and have no incentive to alter their consumption in response to price fluctuations , " said Bryan Lee , of the Retail Energy Suppliers Association . Time-of-use rates have broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer advocates , he said . <p> Moving prices <p> Dynamic pricing is common in other industries , such as the airline industry , where tickets are sold based on supply and demand at a given moment . With food , a freeze in Brazil would drive up coffee prices ; a drought in the Midwest can drive up grain prices . The most obvious example of dynamic prices is at the gasoline pump , where prices change almost daily . Electricity supply and demand and the cost of generation swing widely throughout the day . Yet the vast majority of households pay a single price for power no matter when they use it , often paying a rate that does not change for months or years - an average of a cost that fluctuates widely behind the scenes . <p> That flat rate is a legacy of the old utility monopoly that set average rates because there was no way to tell when power was used - just the total amount of power used over a given period of time . PPL was ahead of its time , installing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much power is used , but when it is used . <p> A quick survey of other competitive suppliers found no other examples of time-of-use options in the PPL service area . PPL Electric Utilities has a time-of-use plan it was required to create by the state Public Utility Commission but that plan is so uncompetitive that the utility has been reaching out to the 2,000 or so customers to urge them to get on a more competitive plan , said PPL spokesman Brian Hay . <p> Dynamic prices for electricity brings electricity prices paid by consumers closer to the cost of generating the power . Also , the hope is that consumers respond to those price signals and change their habits , conserving power or moving power use to hours of less-expensive ( or even free ) power . <p> A closer look <p> Free power may sound enticing . But the rest of the day , Direct Energy 's fine print reads , electricity will cost 8.9 cents per kilowatt hour . That 's higher than all but one of the flat rate plans currently available by competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default rate of 7.5 cents currently offered by PPL to any customers opts to not select a supplier . Direct Energy 's rate is also 33 percent more than lowest available fixed rate of 6.9 cents per kilowatt hour offered by Reliant Energy Northeast . <p> Whatever is saved during free hours could be lost with the uncompetitive rates paid on usage the other 20 hours of the day . Winners will be those able to move significant energy use to after-hours . <p> While the Public Utility Commission website allows people to comparison shop against the utility default rate - all those are flat rate plans . When it comes to determining what your bill would be under a dynamic pricing plan , shopping requires some numbers crunching . PPL customers have access to hour-by-hour breakdown of their energy use through PPL 's website . A household may be able to take a month to try to move energy use to non-peak , cheaper hours . With the results , a household may be able to tell if a time-of-use plan will save them money . <p> Acting State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heats and dries clothes with natural gas , for example , may not find the plan beneficial at all . Those without natural gas service who rely on electricity to heat homes and water , may find such a plan economical , particularly if they put their tank-style water heater on a timer , for example . <p> " Having competitive electricity markets offer a world of options , " Ms. McClosky said . " Time-of-use is one kind of an option for a specific type of customer . " <p> Direct Energy 's plan allows people to drop out at anytime with no penalty . The company 's own data shows customers are less likely to drop a time-of-use plan than they are a flat rate plan , suggesting to Ron Cerniglia , director of governmental and regulatory affairs for Direct Energy customers are happy with it . <p> There may be other benefit to being on a time-of-use plan . People start paying close attention to when and how much they use power and use less of it . Mr. Cerniglia said the when the company began time-of-use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell by more than 18 percent . <p> There is also a collective benefit . Moving energy consumption to off hours , changes where power comes from and how it is generated . Peaking generators fired up during high demand will be used less . These power plants operate more expensively , and set the wholesale price for electricity , said Jacob G. Smeltz , of the Electric Power Generation Association . So shifting to power to non-peak hours reduces prices for all . <p> " If peak demand drops , the cost of meeting that demand goes down , as well , " Mr. Smeltz said . " When you use power off-peak , it 's coming from baseload facilities which operate very economically and are generally cleaner . " <p> More options coming <p> Pennsylvania recently hit a milestone with more than 2 million residential households out of 12 million purchasing electricity from a retail suppliers . <p> More time-of-use option are likely coming for consumers . Christine Nevins , spokeswoman for Con Edison Solutions , said the company is actively considering time-of-use options for residential customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-time . The PUC is pushing for even smarter meters with the capability of real-time pricing . These two-way meters can give customers , through a mobile application or a device in the home , current pricing of electricity , letting them know when power is cheap , average-priced or expensive . <p> " These products give people a better appreciation of their energy usage , allows them to make behavior adjustments and take control of their bill , " Mr. Cerniglia said . <p> read terms and conditions . <p> Nokia took the 
 looks to sell local bank branches <p> A new bank may be coming to a corner near you as Bank of America reportedly looks to unload eight branches in Northeast Pennsylvania . <p> As the nation 's second-largest bank shifts its attention and money elsewhere , it plans to divests of its branches in Northeast Pennsylvania and New York - 41 offices in all - according to news reports attributed to anonymous Bank of America employees . <p> A hot sheet of the branches compiled by Griffin Financial Group Inc. showed 8 branches for sale in the region from the downtown Scranton office to those in Freeland and Lehighton . <p> Unlike many portions of the country where Bank of America dominates , the company has had a relatively small portion of the banking business pie in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area with a deposit market share just under 3 percent . While it has just one branch in Lackawanna County , it has more in the Wyoming Valley and Hazleton area . In recent years , Bank of America has already begun to pull back , deciding not to re-open the flood-damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since Bank of America Chief Executive Brian T. Moynihan took the post in 2010 , hundreds of Bank of America branches have closed . Mr. Moynihan has said the bank needs fewer branches as more banking activity moves online . <p> " They are giving up their dream of being everywhere , " said Bert Ely , a financial institution consultant in Alexandria , Va. , " With such a modest market share , you either built it up or get out . " <p> Among the local Bank of America branches there are some plums . The Hazleton branch at 1213 N. Church St. has the most deposits of the 41 for-sale branches , million as of 2012 , according to data from SNL Financial , a bank data firm . The downtown Scranton branch has the highest growth rate of the branches , a compound annual growth rate of 22 percent . <p> But overall , Bank of America is selling the branches because they are in stagnant markets . <p> Bank of America is in no rush and in fact , is not acknowledging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sale could go down , observers say . No matter what , banking will change in Northeast Pennsylvania and customers will find themselves with another institution . <p> When banks sell branches , what they really sell are the deposits and deposit customers attached to the branch . Sometimes the consumer loans are included , as well . The purchase price is negotiated from the total deposit amount and types of deposits , said Wilson Smith , a bank equities analyst with Patriot Capital Partners in Philadelphia . <p> What could happen <p> The best for Bank of America would be one buyer , taking all . That single buyer would have to be a fellow mega bank , looking for a place in a market where it has little or no presence . Or it could be a regional bank looking to solidify an existing presence or expanding a contiguous foot print , but some observers wonder if a regional bank could pull together a take-all offer . <p> If Bank of America ca n't find a single buyer , it could sell clusters of branches here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office to round out a presence . <p> A single buyer may take all of them , then later divvy up branches it is not interested in . That what Joe , First Senior Vice President of the FNCB Bank in Dunmore , thinks may happen . He does n't think a mega bank has much use for crowded , lower-growth markets like Northeast Pennsylvania . The only buyer for those branches would be incumbent banks looking to complement or supplement their service area . <p> Alan Dakey , chief executive officer of People 's Neighborhood Bank does n't think local banks will have a crack at the branches . His bank would love go get an instant market share in Scranton and has taken steps with a loan production office in the city . But in several similar sales , People 's has been denied a place at the table because it wanted one or two branches . <p> A branch like the one in Hazleton or Scranton could be valuable for a bank , as it offers instant market share , said Fidelity Bank chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about impossible to go into a city and build market share from scratch , " Mr. Santaniello said . " Opportunities like this are an entry for a bank . " <p> Another bank mentioned as a potential buyer of some of the branches is First Keystone Bank , a bank that pushed its way north , opening four branches in the last two years , including one in Dallas , Pa. , at the site of a shuttered Bank of America branch . <p> " If a branch is offered that met our criteria as where we wanted to be , we 'd definitely be interested , " said bank president and chief executive Matthew P. Prosseda . " A large bank may think a branch is too small or not profitable , but to a small bank , whose costs are generally lower , it could be a great addition . " <p> No matter what happens , smaller community banks revel in tectonic shifts of large banks . <p> " We absolutely love when big banks make sweeping changes , " chuckled Mr. Dakey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change and look for other options . " <p> Why : In 2007 , the bank proved it was a player by acquiring Pocono Community Bank and has made it clear it wants a stronger presence in the Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties . <p> Fred Hickman , South Abington twp . <p> Former regulator , former president of North Penn Bank , Scranton <p> Pick : M&amp;T Bank <p> Why : While it has a light branch network in Northeast Pennsylvania and New Jersey , M&amp;T could significantly beef up that presence with those Bank of America branches . Nearby headquarters ( Buffalo , N.Y. ) , balance sheet strength , and market knowledge makes them contenders . <p> Why : Fast-growing Philadelphia-based Customers Bank has cobbled together a robust branch network in suburban Philadelphia and could view the Bank of America branches as a score to the north .

 drilling in Wayne is fading <p> Steve McConnell / Staff Photo Bob Rutledge , head of the Northern Wayne Property Owners Alliance , holds a T-shirt Hess was giving away four years ago . The fervor over drilling has since died down , with companies dumping hundreds of leases . <p> HONESDALE - Four years ago , Hess employees slathered barbecue sauce on ribs and cut a cake adorned with the gas company 's logo at the Wayne County Fairgrounds to celebrate the closing of a monumental deal . <p> The 1,000-plus members of the Northern Wayne Property Owners Alliance had signed over more than 100,000 acres to Hess for potential gas development . Envisioning the riches they might make , they handed out " Drill Now " T-shirts and " I ( heart ) Marcellus Shale " bumper stickers at the barbecue . <p> Owners alliance President Bob Rutledge now has them tucked inside boxes in his basement following last week 's surprising announcement by Hess , and its joint development partner , Newfield Exploration Co. , that they are bailing out . <p> The companies did not give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price for natural gas and the company 's desire to redirect its focus to its oil interests elsewhere in the U.S. <p> " It was a pretty exciting time . It was a long time awaiting , " said Mr. Rutledge , who had hoped Hess would tap a production well on his Damascus Twp. property . " We just did n't grab the first money that came to our door . " <p> A Sunday Times review of leases and well permits in Wayne paints a grim picture that the dream of drilling is dying there . The newspaper found : <p> - The state Department of Environmental Protection did not issue any permits to gas companies this year in Wayne . <p> - While nine exploratory wells were drilled in Wayne by Hess , Newfield , Stone Energy and Chesapeake , none of the wells were hydraulically fractured and converted to production . The Delaware River Basin Commission 's moratorium prohibits gas drilling in the almost 14,000-square-mile basin , which includes nearly all of Wayne , and puts a cap on the number of exploratory wells . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leases . Records also show companies not renewing leases , or handing them off to other outfits willing to wait out the commission 's drilling moratorium enacted three years ago so the agency could develop its own environmental regulations . Before bailing , Hess and Newfield were the biggest players left in the Wayne shale play . <p> Several years ago , gas companies flocked to Wayne County to secure large tracts of land for potential development . However for two years , new leasing has been nearly nonexistent . <p> This comes after a leasing surge that began around 2007 , and peaked in 2009 and 2010 . <p> It has plummeted since . <p> For Louisiana-based Stone Energy , a company executive said the commission 's moratorium has put the brakes on their gas exploration efforts . <p> The company still has property leased in Wayne , though they have chosen not to renew some leases , and they are not securing new leases because of the moratorium , said Rick Toothman , senior vice president for Appalachia operations . <p> They are still interested in gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , " Mr. Toothman said . <p> However , they do not know if it is wise to go forward because they have not been able to drill more wells to collect data to determine if there is marketable natural gas . <p> " It would be too early to speculate , " he said , whether to " promote it or condemn it . " <p> There are skeptics who do not believe there is commercially viable gas in the basin . Both Stone and Newfield declined to release the results of their exploratory wells . Efforts to reach Cabot Oil and Gas Corp. , Chesapeake Energy , Exco Resources and Southwestern Energy Production Co. - the drilling companies that have had leases in Wayne - for comment were unsuccessful . <p> " For the time being , I would say gas is dead in Wayne County , but there is a lot of cards in that deck , " County Commissioner Brian Smith said .

Chris Christie 's representative on the board , during a July 10 meeting . The comments address the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts , reviewing regulations and other related matters to " reach consensus on a path forward that provides for the development of a potentially valuable energy source while protecting the vital water resources within the basin .

The vote never happened . <p> It has not been rescheduled . <p> The pullout of Hess and Newfield was a big victory for local environmentalists . <p> " To be a human being you have to look beyond the money in your pocket , " said Barbara Arrindell , director of Damascus Citizens for Sustainability , an environmental group with an office just across the Delaware River from Wayne County in Narrowsburg , N.Y .

 a man was discovered Saturday in a vehicle teetering on a ledge overlooking Roaring Brook , Lackawanna County Coroner Timothy Rowland confirmed . Darkness , rain and the position of the vehicle made recovery and identification of the body impossible until today , he said . <p> Mr. Rowland said the vehicle is an SUV , but declined to disclose the make or model . <p> Family and friends of Frank Bonacci , 24 , a Dunmore man missing since July 20 , were drawn to the scene by Facebook posts reporting that an SUV had been found in a ravine near the University of Scranton . Mr. Bonacci was last seen driving his silver 2006 Jeep Liberty . <p> At 9:50 p.m. , Scranton police Lt. Martin Crofton ushered Mr. Bonacci 's family members to a private truck to update them . Afterward , he told the media that the vehicle was approximately 1.5 miles upstream of the command post set up near Jacobson Hat Co. and the University of Scranton tennis courts . <p> " The vehicle is in a very precarious position and ca n't be approached safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the investigation , but this appears to be accidental .

As rain fell and hope eroded into uncertainty , some family of Mr. Bonacci were overwrought , having to be taken home . Others bristled at the presence of the media . <p> The police response was complicated by the Facebook page created to mobilize people to search for Mr. Bonacci . As the emergency scanner began to carry transmission about the discovery of a vehicle and the call for assistance , listeners began posting pieces of what they heard and speculation on the Facebook page . <p> At around 8 p.m. , posts saying Mr. Bonacci 's Jeep had been found began appearing on Facebook .

Crofton said no one can be sure how the vehicle got there , or if there was another possible route . That will be determined later in the investigation , but he said there is no legitimate reason for a civilian to drive along the tracks in that area . <p> A resident of the neighborhood , Joe Schlesser , was among the onlookers .

Mr. Bolus , who is no stranger to the media and has fashioned himself a civic leader in various ways , including funding Christmas dinners for the poor , said the verdict was a life-changing moment for him . <p> Standing before a row of TV cameras , Mr. Bolus said he was " done " with the area .

 once chock-full of manufacturers that provided tens of thousands of jobs and livelihoods to area residents . Many industries were tucked inside the patchwork of Scranton neighborhoods and came to dominate and define their surroundings . They spurred myriad small businesses and mom-and-pop stores that fed off teeming workforces . <p> But as manufacturing waned over the years because of changing times , so too did their neighborhoods that , in some ways , have never fully recovered , said Austin Burke , president of the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce . <p> When the British Invasion swept America , Beatles songs were pressed into vinyl at the former Capitol Records factory in South Scranton . By 1970 , however , Capitol consolidated operations at a plant in Virginia , and 550 employees in Scranton received notice that their plant was going to be sold . Like Capitol , the nearby former Sauquoit silk mill in South Scranton offered not only paychecks , but also a workplace close to home for thousands of workers , Mr. Burke said . <p> Perhaps the prime example of manufacturing 's boom and bust is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1890s , Mr. Burke said . For more than a century , the behemoth brick building on Avenue in a lowland between a railroad and the Lackawanna River was one of the area 's largest employers , and the lifeblood of thousands of workers and their families . In its heyday , Scranton Lace was the world 's biggest producer of Nottingham lace , before the factory 's wane culminated in its closing a decade ago , in 2002 . <p> " Look at the Lace Works . Thousands of people worked there , and I would bet you that 85 percent of them walked to work , " Mr. Burke said . " When that closed , a lot of people , my goodness , had to go get driver 's licenses to work elsewhere . " <p> Dave James , 58 , grew up and lives a few blocks away from Scranton Lace . He never worked there , but recalls when the plant was running at full tilt , with three shifts around the clock . The neighborhood was vibrant , brimming with " 20 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local businesses also prospered . Every morning as the sun rose , graveyard shift employees ending their workday would pile into a nearby tavern that was packed all day and night . Now , however , Scranton Lace has devolved into a ghostly eyesore , known more as a favorite subject for photographers and documentarians attracted by the bygone era it represents and its frozen-in-time quality . <p> " It 's gone . Empty . Windows broken . It seems that every day there are more and more windows broken , " Mr. James said of Scranton Lace . " It 's a shame . Somebody should do something with the building . " <p> Another chapter for Scranton Lace has been in the works . In December , the city council approved a zoning change that will allow developer Lace Building Affiliates to redevelop the former factory into apartments , commercial and retail space . <p> Some manufacturing facilities , however , are long gone , having been razed years ago . Mr. James ' recalled one such place , the Haddon Craftsmen bookbindery on Wyoming Avenue , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was the only job he ever had , " Mr. James said . <p> Haddon Craftsmen had moved to Scranton from New Jersey in the 1940s , to a printing plant on Wyoming Avenue that dated to the 1890s . In its heyday , Haddon employed more than 1,100 . After it fell vacant in 1996 , a proposal to convert it into housing was pursued but never succeeded . Haddon was demolished in 2001-02 , and the site now is the athletic field of the Scranton Preparatory School , located across the street . <p> After the demise of deep mining in the 1950s , mills helped keep the region from economic collapse . In the 1940s and 1950s , the textile industry had 160 mills in Lackawanna County employing more than 15,000 people , including 8,000 in the city of Scranton . As an industry , textile and garment manufacturing was second only to mining in size , value and employment . <p> But over the years , many manufacturing jobs fell victim to large outside forces , Mr. Burke said . <p> " Two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's not to say that manufacturing is dead - it is n't - but it has evolved , he said . <p> Technological advances have allowed manufacturers to achieve greater output and efficiency with less manpower , he said . <p> " I believe the value of manufactured products in Lackawanna County is greater now than it was when we had three times as many employees , " Mr. Burke said . " The flip side of more productivity is you have less employment . " <p> Rising globalization also has resulted in many manufacturing industries having gone overseas , he said , noting that small , ancillary businesses that used to feed off bigger plants also have disappeared . <p> " Globalization and technology whacked us for employment , " he said . <p> The recent recession also has taken its toll . The region 's manufacturing employment has decreased 18 percent since December 2007 and area production plants have shed 5,900 jobs , according to state data . <p> Large outside economic forces were not unique to Scranton or the county .

" <p> Eugene McGuire was 17 on the night of June 17 , 1977 , drinking and playing cards with his 19-year-old stepbrother , Sidney Coolbaugh , and 24-year-old cousin , Robert Lobman , when the three opted to go to a Lake Winola bar , the Marine Tavern Inn . <p> After a few drinks , Mr. Lobman informed the other two he planned to rob the bar , according to court documents . Out of fear that Isabelle Nagy , the 60-year-old bartender , might recognize Mr. McGuire and Mr. Coolbaugh as " local boys , " Mr. Lobman ushered them outside and told them to remain as lookouts . <p> Mr. Lobman then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " bang and a crash , " the younger boys entered the bar and witnessed the murder of Mrs. Nagy . <p> Mr. McGuire then fled to New Jersey with Mr. Lobman . He returned a few days later and surrendered to authorities . <p> In exchange for testimony about Mr. Lobman , the two teens were convinced to plead guilty to second-degree murder , which carried a mandatory sentence of life without parole . <p> The plea violated Mr. McGuire 's constitutional rights , but that would not become clear for another 32 years . A 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision , Graham v. Florida , held that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause in the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution did not permit a juvenile offender to be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for a nonhomicide crime . <p> Within 60 days of the Supreme Court decision , Mr. McGuire on his own filed a post-conviction relief petition with the Wyoming County Court of Common Pleas .

" That 's important , and why I think he should be released , soon , despite having been associated with this atrocious act . " <p> Mr. Buttner called Mr. McGuire a model defendant to represent , and said that if released , his client has a job waiting for him in Texas working with a Christian ministry .

He also underscored that Mr. McGuire 's counsel in 1977-78 was ineffective . <p> The assistant district attorney said Mrs. Nagy did not have children , but he had spoken with two nephews , and they believed Mr. McGuire had been incarcerated long enough . Mr. Idec said Charles told him that his mother , the last surviving sibling of Mrs. Nagy , had been contacted by then-Gov .

 bottom-scumming algae known as " rock snot " has been found in more than 100 miles of the Delaware River , alarming scientists who fear it will be tracked into untouched trout streams that feed into the waterway . <p> The algae , also known as didymo , has been present in cold-water sections of the Delaware since 2007 , but the intensity and extent of clotted mats discovered by Delaware River Basin Commission aquatic biologist Erik Silldorff on April 18 was startling . <p> " It is an unusually large bloom and it 's getting into areas of the river where we were hoping it would n't ever be a problem , " including traditionally warmer stretches of the river , Dr. Silldorff said . <p> He recorded it in a stretch in Pike County between the mouth of the Lackawaxen River and the Dingmans Ferry Bridge that includes parts of two National Park units - the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area . <p> State and federal scientists have since found that the blooms extend north to Callicoon , N.Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaware . <p> " These big blooms are knocking on the doorsteps of all these great trout streams in the region , " Dr. Silldorff said . <p> Didymo is an abbreviated version of the algae 's scientific name , didymosphenia geminata . It does not pose a human health risk , but it smothers ecologically valuable algae at the bottom of the food web and crowds out important habitat , disrupting food sources for trout and other organisms . <p> It is also easily tracked from one waterway to another on fishing equipment , kayak bottoms and felt-soled boots . <p> Scientists are working to characterise the cause , regularity and extent of the blooms , but they are focused first on preventing its spread outside the Delaware . <p> So far , it has not invaded cold-water streams that flow into the main stem of the river , but it would likely thrive if it were planted there , Dr. Silldorff said .

 For the past few weeks , contractors have swarmed the natural gas well site next to the Bear Fuel service station on state Route 118 in Columbia County . <p> This time , they were filling instead of drilling . <p> Bear Fuel employee John Leshko was close enough that he could watch the contractors pulling up the pipes and well casing . On Wednesday , they covered the area where a drilling rig once stood with sheets of metal . <p> It is n't the first time an exploratory gas well in the region did n't produce enough gas to be considered economically viable . <p> Geologists say the unproductive part of the Marcellus Shale extends beyond the coal region , where the high temperatures that hardened the anthracite " cooked " the natural gas out of the shale . The latest in a series of unproductive wells confirms experts ' beliefs that producing natural gas in the region may be nothing more than a pipe dream . <p> " Right now , I would be surprised if anything in Luzerne County were to come up productive , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environmental Research for Northeastern Pennsylvania at Wilkes University . <p> Heather Lamparter , general counsel for EXCO Resources LLC , which was exploring the area near Bear Fuel , said the company is plugging and abandoning the well . <p> " It was not a good well , " she said . She declined to elaborate . <p> Just a few miles away , WPX Energy had a well pad on state Route 487 near St. Gabriel Hill Road . <p> WPX Energy is continuing to evaluate that well , spokeswoman Susan Oliver said . But the rudimentary wellhead stands alone in the field , the drilling rig and water tankers gone and unlikely to return . <p> The financial report for the fourth quarter of 2011 provided by Ms. Oliver says that , besides losses from lower natural gas prices , WPX also reported a million loss related to the unsuccessful exploration , including the cost of land leases . <p> Both wells are less than five miles from the Buda site behind the Ricketts Glen Hotel on Route 118 in Fairmount Twp. , Luzerne County , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas well during the summer of 2010 . <p> Encana has since abandoned that well and a second one in Lake Twp. , saying the wells did not produce enough natural gas to be viable . <p> The Marcellus Shale formation extends throughout Northeast Pennsylvania , including Lackawanna , Luzerne , Wyoming and most of Columbia counties . Not all of it is proving productive . <p> Terry Engelder , Penn State geosciences professor and Marcellus Shale expert , coined the term " line of death " for the point where the shale stops being productive . <p> While geologists and gas companies know the area around the Lackawanna Syncline - a banana-shaped formation that runs through Luzerne and Lackawanna counties - is likely to be devoid of methane , they do n't how far it is from the " line of death .

The companies might have a sense of where the line is , but they are unwilling to disclose it , he said . <p> " I guess they feel it 's proprietary , " he said . <p> Researchers at the institute have been trying to track the " line of death " on their own .

And the situation has caused a shift in the average age of workers , with the percentage of young people dropping to the lowest level since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping track in 1948 . <p> At this point , the percentage of people over 65 in the workforce is at its highest rate since 1965 , with almost 2 million older workers entering since the start of the Great Recession . There are now almost 7.7 million workers over 65 , or 18.5 percent of the workforce . That 's 2 million more than the teenage cohort of workers . <p> It 's not just the younger seniors who are still punching the time clock . The number of workers over 75 has never been higher , with 7.8 percent of that age group in the workforce , nearly double the percentage from 1987 , when the government starting keeping track .

" The old way was you clip coupons , sit on the beach and enjoy your retirement . " <p> Now more people are healthy later in life and able to work , so their retirements are spent working part-time jobs that leave them able to take time off to travel but also give them something to do and a paycheck when they return home . <p> The part-time jobs they desire , though , are a hot commodity with younger workers . <p> In a recent survey by Gallup , the company found 32 percent of to were underemployed in April . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the youngest workers , ages 16 to 19 , who are working or even trying to get a job , fell to 31.8 percent in April .

And the percentage of teens working is far off the annual rates of 51 to 57 percent that the country saw in the 1980s and 1990s . <p> Some of that might be by choice .

Geroulo had one question Wednesday before sentencing the former Lackawanna County deputy coroner for conspiring to have his funeral home torched by a state trooper posing as an arsonist for hire . <p> Why ? <p> " The insanity of alcohol , " Mr. Swoboda , 59 , said . <p> It 's a concept he learned in Alcoholics Anonymous in the months since his arrest in August , he told the judge . <p> By the time he met an undercover state trooper in JJ Restaurant in Clarks Summit the evening of Aug. 1 to offer him to burn down the Davies and Jones Funeral home on South Main Avenue in West Scranton , Mr. Swoboda 's drinking had become a daily , daylong vice . <p> Another thing he learned about alcoholism is that " we as alcoholics go to risk-taking - it 's part of our disease , " he said . <p> And the risk Mr. Swoboda decided to take was to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arsonist-for-hire was actually a state trooper . He was even pretty sure that the person who introduced the two that evening was an informant working for him . <p> " In my sick mind , I had to find out for sure , " he said . <p> So , on Aug. 4 , Mr. Swoboda met the suspected informant and handed him a manila envelope filled with 10 bills - a down payment for the job . <p> The arsonist was to receive another soon after the fire , which Mr. Swoboda wanted to " look like an accident , " suggesting he set a rug on fire . <p> The apartments inside the building were empty , he told the informant , and the next day he would show the arsonist around the building . <p> There was one condition that had to be met when the fire was set : It was " very important " that the arson occur while Mr. Swoboda was on vacation during the last week of August . <p> " In my own alcoholic mind , I thought I controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At about 2:30 on the afternoon of Aug. 5 , Mr. Swoboda met the undercover trooper at JJ and drove him to the funeral home . <p> He pulled behind the building , parked his car in the driveway and started pointing out different parts of structure as they walked to the front . <p> Then , as he unlocked the building 's front door , the state troopers who arrested him on two counts of arson and one count each of criminal solicitation and reckless endangerment proved him right . <p> " His life is shattered , " Mr. Swoboda 's attorney , Joseph D'Andrea said in court , adding that Mr. Swoboda will lose his license as an undertaker and funeral director , a career he began in 1980 . <p> When he was brought to the Lackawanna County Prison after his arrest , he was put on suicide watch for the three days he served before posting bail and admitting himself to Clearbrook Treatment Center . <p> " He reached his low , " Mr. D'Andrea said . <p> In April , Mr. Swoboda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the trouble Mr. Swoboda has caused himself , the end result has made him see the whole ordeal as something of a " blessing .

It was not clear how long Mr. Swoboda spent at the facility . <p> After the judge read him his sentence , Mr. Swoboda turned away as if to walk back to his family seated in the gallery . <p> But a sheriff 's deputy stopped him , turning him around to clip handcuffs beneath his pin-striped suit 's cuffs and lead him away . <p> Contact read terms and conditions . <h> Is ?

 twin brother committed suicide in December 2010 , former Army Staff Sgt. Earl Granville never liked the holidays . <p> While getting ready for a party at his girlfriend 's workplace , Earl received a call from his mother telling him the news : Staff Sgt. Joseph Granville was dead by his own hand . <p> It hit him like a brick , throwing him to the floor in a flurry of shock and disbelief . While the event deepened his aversion to the holiday season , he said the event brought his family closer than ever before . <p> " We still exchanged gifts but we were more glad to be with each other than ever before , " Earl said . <p> Earl Granville said he believed Joe had a " touch " of post-traumatic stress disorder , a condition behind a deadly epidemic sweeping the nation . <p> Today , the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that one veteran commits suicide every 80 minutes . <p> Iraq and Afghanistan veteran suicides represent 20 percent of total suicides in the United States , though only one percent of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense has made it a top priority to identify and prevent suicides , but the numbers are stark . <p> Suicides among active-duty servicemen and women increased by 87 percent from 2001 to 2011 , the Department of Defense reports . <p> Within the Army alone , there has been a more than 200 percent increase in the 10-year period , from 52 suicides in 2001 to 165 in 2011 . In the first seven months of this year , the Army reported there have been 66 confirmed active-duty suicides , with 50 remaining under investigation . <p> Dr. John McGrail , a former Coast Guard officer and clinical hypno-therapist , said military culture tends to impede motivation to receive help . He said soldiers expect themselves to " suck it up " when troubled and avoid help , believing it to be a sign of weakness . <p> " Given our society 's and the military 's culture and traditional attitude toward seeking help for mental heath issues , many of these men and women are both afraid to seek help , and are surrounded by people back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going through , " Dr. McGrail said . " Eventually it becomes such a burden that they see no alternative but to end their own lives . " <p> Psychiatrist David Reiss , M.D. said even minor PTSD , if left untreated , could have severe repercussions . Since anxiety and hyper-arousal are common symptoms of PTSD , sleep deprivation is common . <p> " If you take someone who is sleep-deprived , they 're going to be unhappy and depressed , " Dr. Reiss said . " It 's something that needs to be treated immediately . " <p> Earl Granville credits counsel with putting his life back together . <p> While overseas , Earl lost his leg to an improvised explosive device that killed five of his comrades . <p> With his life upended , he began talking to a counselor - in complete contrast to the " macho idealism " he had come to expect from his time in the military . After the first time he spoke with a counselor , he began to feel like he had been " freed . " <p> " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better , " Earl said . " Even on days when I felt OK , I still would go and talk about anything . It helped me get through my injury and Joe 's death . " <p> One of the key symptoms of PTSD is avoidance , where those suffering begin to avoid stimuli and situations that arouse stress , said Dr. Matthew Dooley , a psychologist and expert on PTSD at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Plains Twp . Some sufferers avoid contact with others entirely , at severe cost to their social functioning and self-esteem , he said . <p> One of the ways Dr. Dooley treats PTSD is by teaching patients muscle relaxation and breathing techniques and gradual exposure therapy . Gradual exposure therapy for a patient with a fear of spiders , for example , would involve gradually exposing the patient to more and more spiders over several weeks . With gradual exposure , the fear of the stimulus washes away , building acceptance and familiarity . <p> Treating post traumatic stress disorder is more complicated , primarily due to difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to patient , Dr. Dooley said . Still , he stressed , the only way to make any progress is to " take the first step " and seek help . <p> " We ca n't do anything unless the person suffering recognizes their need for help , " he said . " This is n't something that they can conquer on their own . " <p> When Joe Granville came back from Iraq in 2006 , there was a change in him , Stephanie said . It was small , but obvious . When Earl lost his leg in Afghanistan , Joe began a " downward spiral . " <p> " He wanted to go back to war and find the ones who did it , " Stephanie said . " He wanted revenge . " <p> Joe signed up for redeployment , but when he received the letter stating he would have to wait out the latest rotation , he came back to the house in tears . <p> " I think he needed to be there , " Stephanie said . " He was a through-and-through leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> After Joe died , Stephanie stayed in bed for four months . <p> " Then my mother came into my room and told me I needed to get up , I have children to take care of who need me , " Stephanie said .

Still , she said , he will always be there with her , she said , in the loves of her life - her children . <p> " They have his eyes , " she said . " They are exactly his eyes . " <p> Nearly two years after Joe 's death , it is a Sunday routine to visit his grave with her three children to plant flowers , clear debris and talk about the man they will always love . <p> Jonathan , 7 , and Emily , 4 , like to sit on either side of his grave and remember their father , debating whom he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs around wearing his father 's headgear , his backpack and , sometimes to Stephanie 's chagrin , his gas mask . <p> She remembers Joe as a man of action , a " hothead " at times , but always " a good man .

Though they were twins , Joe was his older brother . <p> " It was like losing a part of me , " Earl said . " He was not just my war brother but twin brother . I took it pretty rough for awhile .

 of urgency is prompting biologists to use experimental treatments to kill a likely cause of white-nose syndrome , an affliction that has reached crisis level for the state 's cave-dwelling bats . <p> Mounting deaths have forced researchers to act , despite the fact that studies of the syndrome 's cause and treatments are not complete , said DeeAnn Reeder , assistant professor of biology at Bucknell University . <p> " There 's this pressure to do something , even if it 's not the right thing , " she said . <p> Ms. Reeder and Greg Turner , a biologist for Pennsylvania Game Commission , are treating bats in Bucks County with two anti-fungal agents , Terbinafine , found in athlete 's foot treatments , and a natural compound administered in vapor form they declined to identify , referring to it only as " Agent C " . <p> The treatment involving Terbinafine was a natural route to take , Ms. Reeder said . <p> " It 's a known anti-fungal agent , and one of the first obvious things to try , " she said . <p> The treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reacted negatively to the treatment , grooming themselves excessively to remove it , Mr. Turner said . <p> The goal is to see if removing the fungus increases bats ' survival rates , Mr. Turner said . " This will help us provide data as to whether fungus is the causative agent , " he said . <p> White-nose syndrome , named for the white fungus that grows on the noses and wings of affected bats , attacks the mammals ' immune systems , causing them to arouse from hibernation prematurely to fight infection , said Gary Kwiecinski , University of Scranton biology professor . <p> The fungus has them waking up twice as frequently , which burns away their fat stores . Bats mostly die of starvation , he said . <p> Game commission biologists found hundreds of dead bats outside two abandoned Carbondale mines in February last year . At that time , four other sites - one in Luzerne County and three in Mifflin County - were also affected , according to the game commission . The number of counties with confirmed affected sites has since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has killed 1 million bats throughout the Northeast , and if it remains unchecked , affected species could be wiped out within four years , Ms. Reeder said . <p> Biologists have yet to determine whether the fungus is a symptom or the cause of the disease . In most cases , it depends who you talk to , said Jeremy Coleman , National WNS Coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . <p> " At this point , I would say that the fungus as the cause is the most likely explanation , " he said . " We 're still very much interested in research that looks at other factors . " <p> Nebulous bat population figures make it difficult to track the true impact of the disease statewide . Many of the small , nocturnal mammals hibernate in underground locations inaccessible to humans , Ms. Reeder said . <p> Researchers have uncovered a fraction of the state 's winter hibernation sites though tracking the endangered Indiana bat , but many remain unknown . <p> " I think that we are an excellent location for bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> Relative to the size of the problem , researchers are scrambling to keep up with a backlog of blood samples and other information . <p> Ms. Reeder estimated that researchers need an infusion of million immediately to hire more lab and field workers . <p> There is a ray of hope among the high mortality rates and burgeoning costs . The western side of the state , where biologists expected to find white-nose this year , remains clean , Mr. Turner said . <p> Still , there is no doubt that the disease will leave a lasting mark on the world . <p> Even if some bats survive , it will take decades to rebuild the population - female bats only produce one pup per year , Ms. Reeder said . <p> The million bats that have died ate about 694 tons of insects every year , including crop pests and mosquitoes , Ms. Reeder said . That loss could lead to increased pesticide use or the spread of West Nile virus . <p> " It really is that serious , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 's terms for commenting <h> 4 posted comments <p> Give me a break , not everything happening in the state has to do with your petty little narrow-minded world .

 Michel Boufadel began a recent presentation about Marcellus Shale drilling with a photo of the ruptured Exxon Valdez oil tanker spilling into Alaskan waters , a disaster whose remnants the Temple University engineering professor has been studying for years . <p> He flipped to a photo of himself and some graduate students standing around a pool of oil in a hole in the sand of an Alaskan beach . <p> " Everyone assumed in 1992 " that the oil from the spill had been properly remediated and was " going to disappear , " he said . " Yet it is still there . That is the problem with groundwater pollution . It does n't go away that fast . " <p> Dr. Boufadel is one of the scientists who study the rocks , water and people directly affected by Marcellus Shale drilling who cautions that everything from the way the rock breaks underground to the way contaminated water travels through an aquifer has not been - or can not be -thoroughly considered . <p> Much of the attention about the environmental risks of natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking water aquifers . <p> According to the industry and both state and federal regulators , there has never been a confirmed case of contamination being caused by the fracturing - a process of injecting millions of gallons of water , sand and chemical additives underground at high pressure to break apart the rock . <p> The industry takes a narrow view of what such contamination would mean , limiting it to what they say would be an impossible instance of the toxic mixture migrating through the new cracks caused by the fracturing operation , up a mile of rock , and into a drinking water aquifer . <p> But legislators and federal regulators are increasingly looking at hydraulic fracturing as more than the isolated act of breaking apart the gas-bearing rock ; they see it as part of an interconnected series of often hazardous steps , from trucking and storing toxic chemicals on a well site to disposing of the fluid laced with salt , metals and radiation that comes back out of the wells . <p> In March , the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans for a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the whole life-cycle of a well . <p> Kathryn Klaber , the head of the Marcellus Shale Coalition , a Pennsylvania-based gas drilling cooperative , said the industry supports the EPA study , as long as it does not halt or slow the pace of drilling . <p> " I do n't think you have to stop something in order to study it , " she said . <p> The industry also points to a previous EPA study of hydraulic fracturing that did not find any instances of the practice causing water contamination , but which was limited to only one type of hydraulic fracturing , in coal-bed methane wells . <p> " What we 're missing is that definitive , absolutely unquestionable , science-based , non-politically influenced study , " said Dr. Anthony Ingraffea , a Cornell University engineering professor who has two decades of experience working on computer simulation of hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas wells . " And that is what everybody is hoping that the EPA will do . " <p> ' What can we live with ? ' <p> Many scientists , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usefulness of the EPA study , no matter how ambitious the final scope , because it must be completed by 2012 , a relatively short amount of time . <p> " There should n't only be one study or awaiting the EPA study , " said Dr. Boufadel , who advocates for risk-assessment studies tailored to individual communities near gas drilling . " There should be 10 or 20 studies . That would allow the truth to come out . " <p> He proposes studies that would measure and assign a value to the relative risk of living among a certain number of wells , compressor stations , pipelines , wastewater impoundments and the other infrastructure necessary for drilling and production . <p> Evaluating risk , he said , is " how insurance companies make decisions . That 's how we , as people , make decisions . <p> " It is not yes or no . It is what can we live with . " <p> Asked if he knew of anyone conducting a study like that he said , " No . Not to my knowledge . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard in Pennsylvania for measuring contamination from drilling are questionable . <p> The weight of any water contaminated with the salty waste produced by Marcellus Shale wells will cause it to sink in an aquifer , he said , below the reach of conventional measuring tools , like groundwater monitoring wells . <p> " We really need more advanced models than we are talking about now , " he said , or the state will risk misjudging the scope of a contamination incident until a " whole aquifer is polluted . " <p> ' Nobody knows ; no one can know ' <p> Conrad Dan Volz , director of the Center for Healthy Environments and Communities at the University of Pittsburgh , also argues that science has been missing in much of the consideration of long-term or cumulative effects of shale gas exploration . <p> He lists a number of elements of the drilling process that require further study , and plans to begin researching some of them this summer in southwestern Pennsylvania . His work will include baseline testing of rivers and comparisons of drinking water wells in areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is , why did n't we do the science beforehand on this ? " he said . <p> " What we 're really bad at - and we have the tools to do this - is anticipate problems . And I do n't see where anyone has done much anticipatory work . " <p> Even the most straightforward assurance about the hydraulic fracturing process - that aquifers are protected from fracturing by thousands of feet of layered , solid rock - is not as certain as the industry insists , Dr. Ingraffea , of Cornell , said . <p> Although he does agree that the chance of contamination through those layers is minuscule , he also knows from experience that the work to predict and measure where fractures go is necessarily inexact , and the rock " unfortunately " is not solid or impermeable . <p> To say that hydraulic fracturing contamination through direct communication with an aquifer is impossible is " nonsense , " he said . " To say that it is inevitable is nonsense . <p> " We 're dealing with a highly probabilistic underground system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exactly the geology that 's down there , exactly the geometry of what 's down there . " <p> Add the very remote risk of fractures causing direct contamination , to the larger risks of well casing failures and human errors on the surface and the total probability of failure during Marcellus Shale gas production " starts looking , to me , high , " he said . " Very risky . " <p> Gas drilling companies have financial incentives to avoid mistakes , he said , but the experience of Marcellus Shale exploration so far - what he calls " ground truth " - has been a series of mistakes followed belatedly by attempts at improvement . <p> " They could have done this totally differently if they were n't in a hurry , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ <h> 1 posted comments <p> " Add the very remote risk of fractures causing direct contamination , to the larger risks of well casing failures and human errors on the surface ... " <p> That says it . Waste water may not migrate underground , but there will be ground water contamination from surface spills and surface impound leakage . It 's inevitable considering the large volumes of waste water that will be handled . <p> One area where there has been risk assessment is mortgage lending . The risk is not so much of physical damage as it is of loss of market value . <p> Treme finished its 
 One natural gas well has been drilled into the Marcellus Shale in Lackawanna County , but much more development is on the county 's doorstep . <p> Already more than an eighth of the county 's land has been leased to companies planning to drill in the Marcellus Shale , according to deeds recorded with the county . <p> The total land leased - about 38,000 acres - amounts to an area roughly twice the size of Scranton . <p> Those leases carry a soft deadline for drilling : Many of them have a primary term of five or seven years , which means the companies have to make some progress to develop the gas within that time or renegotiate to extend the agreement and risk losing the lease to a competitor . <p> Because the vast majority of the leases in the county - 816 of them - were recorded in 2008 , the incentive for developing the gas is approaching . <p> The land rush has touched a vast area of the county . Land in 20 of Lackawanna 's 40 municipalities has been leased , with the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benton and Greenfield townships , as well as areas of the Abingtons . <p> Many of the county 's most prominent farmers , including the Manning , Eckel , Roba and families , have signed leases . <p> Although much of the land has been leased outside of the population centers along the Lackawanna Valley , leased parcels are not strictly on farms or in rural areas . <p> Baptist Bible College leased 114 acres on its South Abington Twp. campus . <p> The Abington Hill Cemetery Association leased 120 acres in South Abington along the Morgan Highway . <p> Leases have also been agreed to on land near residential areas . For example , 38 acres have been leased along the 900 and 1000 blocks of Fairview Road in South Abington . <p> The Newton Lake Association and the Associates at Chapman Lake , two community associations that own their namesake lakes and the area around them , both signed leases . <p> Religious organizations have also signed leases , including the Harmony Heart church camp in Scott , a parcel in Scott owned by Parker Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abington Twp. , and Community Bible Church in Greenfield . <p> The amount of Lackawanna County land leased for gas development surprised even people who have followed the subject closely for years . <p> Lee Jamison , a leader of the multi-municipal Abington Council of Governments , which has hosted educational events and speakers regarding Marcellus Shale drilling since 2008 , did not know the extent of the leasing or its reach to areas outside of the rural northwest of the county . <p> He said despite educational events and active gas drilling in nearby communities , Lackawanna County municipalities have to do more to follow changing legislation and precedent-setting court cases to prepare for the coming development . <p> " I still think there 's quite a lack of preparedness on the part of the local municipal officials , " he said . " Often times you get conflicting reports and confusing stories . " <p> Mr. Jamison , who recently lost in the Republican primary race for state representative in the 114th House District , made Marcellus Shale a central part of his platform . <p> " Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of developing the Marcellus resource , " he said , " but they want it done correctly .

 grapple with the borough 's finances , other municipalities have taken advantage of state-recommended measures to avoid falling into distressed status or bankruptcy . <p> Officials in West Wyoming in Luzerne County and the city of Coatesville in Chester County said the state 's Early Intervention Program is helping to correct serious financial problems in their municipalities . <p> Dunmore officials are considering the Early Intervention Program , which is offered through the state Department of Community and Economic Development . The matching-grant program pairs a municipality with an outside agency , which provides an analysis of municipal finances , as well as recommendations for improvements . <p> Fred Reddig , executive director of the Governor 's Center for Local Government Services at the state DCED , has described the program as a way for a community to avoid distressed status , known as Municipalities Financial Recovery Act 47 of 1987 . When a municipality files for Act 47 , the state , through the DCED , steps in and appoints a coordinator who examines revenues and expenditures and devises a recovery plan . <p> " We did n't really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intervention Program ) , but it was well spent ( toward ) straightening out our financial situation , " said Eileen Cipriani , West Wyoming Borough Council president .

" Overall , I would say we have probably implemented about 20 percent of the recommendations , " said Ted Reed , Coatesville 's interim city manager . <p> The specific recommendations in the plan , as well as an extensive look at the city 's financial history stretching back to about 2000 , is what has really helped Coatesville officials work on repairing the city 's finances , Mr. Reed said . <p> " The detail is what helps , " Mr. Reed said . " Generalization does not set a good strategy to help the economic recovery . So the more detail , the better .

 Scranton Press is closing up shop after 22 years and the publication of more than 200 titles , a victim of financial pressures and shifting priorities . <p> The press stopped accepting new manuscripts earlier this year and will officially shut down at the end of the summer , said Harold Baillie , Ph.D. , University of Scranton provost and vice president for academic affairs . <p> " Basically , it was a budgetary decision .

" Our main priority is the education of our students , and that takes precedence in the distribution of our resources . " <p> Supporters of the press called its demise a blow to Scranton and Northeast Pennsylvania .

 The breathtaking drop from the heights above Loyalsock Creek that gave Worlds End State Park its name might also be one of the few things that can save the popular camping , hiking and fishing destination in Sullivan County from being the site of Marcellus Shale natural gas wells . <p> Because Pennsylvania does not own the mineral rights to at least some , if not all , of the gas-rich deposits below the park , state policies prohibiting drilling on park lands do not apply there . <p> If the unknown mineral rights owner ever wanted to drill for gas under the park , the park 's steep sides , its relatively small size and its proximity to Loyalsock Creek might dissuade a driller from sinking a gas well directly on park land , park manager William Kocher said . Otherwise , the state has no right to say no . <p> " You do n't have a whole lot of control when you do n't have the subsurface rights , unfortunately , " he said . <p> Pennsylvania does not own the mineral rights to about 80 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Natural Resources Secretary John Quigley said . <p> During decades of land acquisition to build the parks system , a desire to purchase the most land often meant buying the surface without the expensive mineral rights or buying land that had long been severed from the minerals claims below it . <p> For years , oil and gas companies have drilled a limited number of wells on state park land in western Pennsylvania where the mineral rights were privately owned , but the push to exploit the massive Marcellus Shale has brought a new anxiety to the state agency that is charged with maintaining the state parks as what Mr. Quigley called " oases . " <p> " The scale we are facing is unprecedented in the history of the state parks system , " he said . <p> The department is in the process of building a database of where it does and does not own the minerals below the parks , and it has compiled a preliminary list based on the parks ' resource management plans which spokeswoman Christina Novak warned is " our best determination " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the list , the state owns the mineral rights under most of the state parks in Northeast Pennsylvania , including Lackawanna , Ricketts Glen , Frances Slocum , Salt Springs , Gouldsboro , and Promised Land . <p> The state does not own all of the mineral rights under Hickory Run State Park and the minerals ownership of Prompton State Park is unclear . <p> Even where the state owns the mineral rights under a park , it has little or no influence over drilling on adjacent private land . <p> Encana Oil &amp; Gas USA has started drilling an exploratory well on Route 118 in Fairmount Township near Ricketts Glen State Park and has received or applied for permits for five others within a mile of the park 's southern border . <p> The Friends of Salt Springs Park , a nonprofit organization that manages the Susquehanna County state park and works to buy and conserve land around it , signed a nonsurface disturbance lease with Talisman Energy USA for 137 of the nonprofit 's 437 acres around the park . <p> The Salt Springs lease deal did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft some of the protective language in the lease . And Ricketts Glen State Park manager Terence Daltroff said Encana invited park staff to discuss the nearby drilling in April and has had an open-door policy ever since . <p> The only impacts he has seen so far has been truck traffic associated with drilling at wells in the busier exploration areas in Wyoming and Bradford counties north of the park . <p> Although the current drilling is taking place about half a mile from the park 's boundary , it is about a mile from the popular hiking trails around the park 's waterfalls - too far for the sounds of drilling to travel right now . <p> " What will happen when the leaves fall off the trees , we 're not sure , " he said . <p> The threat to the state parks where private owners hold the mineral rights is still largely an impending problem more than an immediate one . <p> Mr. Quigley estimates that there are a dozen or fewer parks where drillers or seismic testing firms have expressed interest in accessing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to verify they own the minerals before the agency will begin to discuss their plans . <p> But Mr. Quigley expects that list of interested drillers will grow . More than half of the state 's 117 state parks are underlain by the Marcellus Shale . <p> He also gets " heartburn , " he said , because of how limited DCNR is in regulating how a driller with permission to access the shale must treat the state 's surface land . <p> In a decision last year , the state Supreme Court found that DCNR can not unilaterally impose on drillers a standard surface-use agreement that governs how they can impact the surface of the parks as they get the gas . <p> Historically , the agency has been fairly successful in getting drillers to agree to the surface-use plan , Mr. Quigley said , but the court found for the first time that DCNR can not compel them do it . <p> " Our remedy at law is if someone screws up the resource , we can sue them , " he said . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking about the public lands in the best managed park system in the country . " <p> Jan Jarrett , the president of PennFuture , said that decision put the state 's conservation agency in the unusual position of having more control over drilling in state forests - which have always been designed for multiple uses , including mineral extraction - than they do in state parks , which are preserved for one use : public recreation . <p> " It 's very disconcerting , " she said . " I think they are trying their best to keep the integrity of the recreational resource intact . But that 's not always possible . " <p> One option for protecting the surface of the state parks would be for DCNR to buy the mineral rights below them - something PennFuture advocates for select parks . <p> Before the Marcellus era , the agency routinely bought mineral rights below high-value parks using a fund replenished by oil and gas leases and designated for conservation use since 1955 . In 2007 , it bought the rights below Cherry Springs State Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dark skies . <p> But the fund was largely emptied during the last two budgets , when million from it was redirected to the state 's General Fund . And because of budget cuts to DCNR , the agency is using the leftovers to subsidize its operations , Mr. Quigley said . <p> " Literally , we do n't have money to go out and buy mineral rights anymore . " <p> The Pennsylvania Environmental Council , which held a Marcellus Shale policy conference earlier this year , released a report that encourages drillers , mineral rights owners and DCNR to work together to develop best management practices to address concerns about drilling in the parks . <p> " We were hopeful that any developers who are trying to access that gas would be agreeable to the Commonwealth coming to them and saying , let 's sit down and talk about how to do this , " said Don Welsh , president and CEO of the council . <p> Mr. Quigley said the good intentions of the gas companies - and the public scrutiny they will be under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides some insurance that the drilling will limit the damage to the parks . <p> " But at the end of the day we ca n't necessarily depend on the good will of others , " he said .

That much is certain . The U.S. War Archives lists him as holding the rank of private . Having served on the Massachusetts continental line , he applied for a military pension and began receiving one on Nov. 15 , 1826 in the sum of per year . <p> " Daughters of the American Revolution Magazine " reported on improvements to the Taylor Memorial Cemetery in 1906 as follows : " It is said that seven Revolutionary soldiers sleep here , but the graves of only two have been identified .

But , when the new fence was dedicated in 1906 , Simon of Waverly , who was 84 at the time , vividly recalled Parley Hughes as a soldier of the American Revolution who also had the distinction of being one of Gen. Washington 's body guards . <p> Who were these guards ? To be chosen as a life guard , as they were called , to Gen. Washington was indeed an honor . According to Harry M. Ward , author of " George Washington 's Enforcers : Policing the Continental Army , " " the idea of having his own life guard appealed to George Washington . A life guard , doubling as body and honor guard , had been customary in European practice for the purpose of serving sovereigns and commanding generals .

" The General , " it states , " being desirous of selecting a particular number of men , as a Guard for himself , and baggage , ... depends upon the Colonels for good Men , such as they can recommend for their sobriety , honesty , and good behaviour ; he wishes them to be from five feet , eight Inches high , to five feet , ten Inches ; handsomely and well made , and as there is nothing in his eyes more desirable , than Cleanliness in a Soldier , he desires that particular attention may be made , in the choice of such men , as are neat , and spruce .

He confessed to a crime as unfathomable as it is foul , and he belongs behind bars . <p> He is also a human being , even though he has done his worst to disqualify himself from the considerations that distinction affords . <p> Mr. Pinto , 29 , pleaded guilty in May to producing child pornography and was shipped to Lackawanna County Prison to await sentencing in federal court . He should still be in his cell , but instead he lies comatose in intensive care at Community Medical Center in Scranton , his face pulverized , his brain floating in a lake of blood . <p> He is breathing and eating through tubes , according to Patrick Rogan , the Scranton lawyer who is preparing a slam-dunk federal civil rights suit against the county and anyone and everyone who can be held legally responsible for his client 's condition .

At his arraignment on the murder charge in a Luzerne County courtroom , he head-butted his co-defendant , who was taken away on a stretcher . Mr. Simonson 's penchant for mayhem was well known when he was sent to Lackawanna County Prison , where he should not have had access to a beam of sunlight , let alone Mr. Pinto . <p> And yet there he was on the morning of Aug. 8 as Mr. Pinto , a protective custody inmate , returned from recreation . <p> Police say Mr. Simonson , an " administrative custody ( known to head-butt without warning ) " inmate , punched Mr. Pinto and knocked him to the ground .

Who knows what the third may have been distracted by , but The Sunday Times Giant Sudoku puzzle is wildly popular . The coupons are great , too .

There are but two explanations for such an obvious blunder on the part of the responding officers - gross incompetence or criminal complicity . Which one is acceptable ? <p> Whether the shoes or rag were collected as evidence is also unclear . If they were not , everyone involved in the immediate response to the incident should be fired . From a cannon . <p> There would be no question about what happened and who is responsible if all areas of the prison where inmates travel were outfitted with cameras that record . Incredibly , some areas of the prison have less video surveillance than the average convenience store . It 's likely some inmates were convicted based on the same type of video evidence the prison administration is incapable of producing . <p> How is such technological stagnation acceptable to the correctional officers union ?

Munchak , who have since been indicted on a raft of federal corruption charges , pointed to the " perfect rating " as irrefutable evidence that the prison had recovered from a 2003 scandal rooted in a Times-Tribune investigation and a pair of grand jury probes that uncovered a host of abuses at the prison .

The case was dismissed after he missed filing deadlines . He has appealed , but a reversal seems unlikely . <p> Mr. Pinto 's lawyer is unlikely to have such slippery fingers .

In fairness , it 's possible Mr. Hughes did n't know the background of Olde Good Things , either . <p> The business is owned by the Church of Bible Understanding .

It was originally called the Forever Family and soon spread to Bethlehem , Scranton and Wilkes-Barre . Within three years , the group was recruiting wayward youth in Philadelphia , New York , Syracuse , Pittsburgh , Cleveland and Baltimore . <p> Wherever its army of proselytizers turned up , COBU soon wore out its welcome . A March 1 , 1976 , Time magazine article described vigilante attacks on " fellowship houses " in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre . Time quoted Monsignor and future Bishop James C.

If you really want to grasp the good news of the gospels , you must enslave yourself to him and work in his sweatshop businesses for little or no compensation . <p> Mr. Traill 's followers reportedly live in squalor while he lives it up between Philadelphia and Pompano Beach , Fla . He has access to at least two private planes . COBU once claimed 10,000 members , but most experts suspect it actually peaked at around 3,000 . Today , membership is believed to be fewer than 50 . <p> Cult 's assets <p> The latest federal tax records available show that COBU reported total revenue of million in 2008 , including million from contributions . It listed million in total expenses , including about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even ex-members who say the cult is destructive to its adherents insist the orphanages are legitimate and truly help people . <p> reported assets of million as a nonprofit organization in 2008 .

Based on county assessment records , paid to the county , school district and city in property taxes last year . Deadline came before I could find out if it pays mercantile , business privilege , occupational and wage taxes . <p> Olde Good Things ' lawsuit against the city and the Scranton Sewer Authority stems from a December 2007 fire at a warehouse it owned at North Ninth and Lackawanna avenues . The sidewalk above the building crumbled , and the damage was worsened by heavy rains . The city contends that the fire and subsequent demolition of the remains of the building caused the damage . Olde Good Things claims the sidewalk collapsed because the sewer system failed , and wants the city to take responsibility for stopping the flow of raw sewage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sewage backups are n't confined to the Olde Good Things site . The property is an eyesore , strewn with debris and wood . <p> A neighbor I talked to last week said she and others are fed up with the mess and want the city to do something about it . That seems unlikely as long as the lawsuit is unresolved . <p> Legal case not issue <p> The fact that Olde Good Things is owned by a cult is immaterial in terms of deciding its dispute with the city . This is America , where we are free to follow any former atheist vacuum cleaner salesman we choose . When an employee of the taxpayers of Scranton takes sides against them , however , they deserve to know all the details . In a sense , it 's hard to blame Mr. Hughes for taking COBU 's case .

As the mine water comes into the system , it is between 55 and 60 degrees , said Wendy Yankelitis , director of physical plant for Marywood . <p> Water from the mines never touches the water flowing through the cooling system throughout the building . Instead , the mine water goes into an exchanger , where the mine water cools the water inside the building .

 year looms , officials tight-lipped about Mercy Hospital 's potential buyers <p> While Mercy Health Partners is mum on which companies are in the running to buy its three hospitals and numerous outpatient clinics , two potential frontrunners are emerging : Texas-based Legacy Hospital Partners and Tennessee-based Community Health Systems . <p> Legacy Hospital Partners is a privately held company that focuses on acquiring and developing hospitals in partnership with various non-profit hospital companies , according to its website . LHP operates Portneuf Medical Center in Pocatello , Idaho , and Texas Health Presbyterian in Sherman , Texas . Company spokeswoman Patricia Ball did not return phone calls seeking comment . <p> Community Health Systems is a publicly traded company that purchased Wyoming Valley Health Care System for million in 2009 . Company officials also did not return phone calls . <p> Members of the Mercy board of trustees declined to comment about the potential sale . Mercy spokeswoman Gladys Bernet declined to comment on potential buyers or on when an announcement might be made . <p> Kevin Cook , Mercy Health Partners president and chief executive officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to generate enough capital to " remain competitive in the current market . " Mercy Health Partners is expected to settle on a buyer before the end of the year . <p> As both LHP and CHS are for-profit companies , some fear that will change Mercy 's mission and affect the standards of patient care . <p> Licensed practical nurse Jackie , who has worked for Mercy Hospital for more than 30 years , is one of many workers who have heard that LHP and CHS have expressed interest in buying Mercy . <p> And , Mercy officials will not talk to workers about those two companies or any potential buyers , Ms. said . <p> " It 's frustrating , not having any information , " she said . <p> Registered nurse Sue Tonkin , who has worked at Mercy Hospital since 1974 , has also heard that LHP and CHS are potential buyers , though she also said officials will not confirm either has shown interest in the hospitals . <p> Like many at Mercy , Ms. Tonkin is concerned that Mercy will lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . <p> " It means a lot to our patients and their families ? ? ? to know that faith-based care is one of our core missions , " she said . " Mercy is a family and I 'm afraid we 'll lose that , too , if we 're taken over by a for-profit corporation . " <p> Mercy board members contacted last week declined to comment on whether the hospital system will be able to keep its Catholic affiliation after a sale . And in a prepared statement , Diocese of Scranton spokesman Bill Genello said the Sisters of Mercy is the owner of Mercy Health Partners and has " the autonomy to determine the disposition of the institution . " <p> The diocese hopes , however , that hospital officials will " complete a transaction that results in the best possible outcome for our community and that there will be the opportunity to continue to provide pastoral care to patients and their families in some fashion , " Mr. Genello added . <p> Employees concerned <p> Beyond the question of whether Mercy will retain its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for-profit buyer would continue the hospital system 's commitment to the community and to employees . <p> Especially troubling for Ms. , Ms. Tonkin and other Mercy employees is CHS ' history at other hospitals , including the recent purchase of Pottstown Memorial Medical Center and Wyoming Valley Health Care System , which includes Wilkes-Barre General Hospital . <p> Wilkes-Barre General registered nurse Fran Prusinski spoke about her experience with CHS at a meeting organized last month by Mercy Chapter of SEIU Healthcare PA . She said CHS will approach patients in hospital rooms to ask how they intend to pay for care . She and other members of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals , which represents about 450 nurses at Wilkes-Barre General Hospital , also claim CHS is not respecting the hospital 's employees . <p> In September , the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against WVHCS for bad-faith bargaining and unfair labor practices after union officials accused CHS of refusing to provide documentation about how much nonunion members have to pay out of pocket under the CHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to union members . <p> Nurses at Wilkes-Barre General Hospital on Saturday announced plans to strike for one day on Dec. 23 to protest bad-faith bargaining by owner Community Health Systems . <p> On Thursday , Mercy 's SEIU members met with Mary Robinson , a central service technician with Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane , Wash . CHS bought the medical center in 2008 . Since then , Deaconess ' trauma center and Parkinson 's disease clinic have been closed , a move Ms. Robinson said represents one of CHS 's broken promises . <p> " CHS said they 'd come in ? ? ? and our services would n't change , staffing would n't change , " she said .

 of Scranton has expanded , so , too , have tensions between the college , city council and some taxpayers . <p> The crux of council 's argument with the university is that its tax-exempt boundary has grown by leaps and bounds , but the thriving college has not given millions of dollars at once to help rescue the financially distressed city . <p> Council has argued , most recently in the debate a few months ago over the university 's plan to raze Leahy Hall to make way for a new building , that the university 's growth was facilitated by the city 50 years ago . <p> In a presentation during the July 25 council meeting , council solicitor Boyd Hughes outlined the city 's role in the 1960s in helping the university expand its toehold in the lower Hill Section into a larger footprint . <p> " The University of Scranton would n't be what it is today if it were not for the city of Scranton , " Mr. Hughes said . <p> University spokesman Stan Zygmunt said the college would not respond in a statement or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Economic and Community Impact " report by the university that measures its overall contribution to the city and region in the billions of dollars . That report notes that the university has created scores of jobs that pay wage taxes ; the college has paid millions in construction permits and fees ; it has drawn students by the tens of thousands and has raised the city 's profile and prestige . The college also annually gives the city the largest donation it gets from any nonprofit , . <p> Story Continues below graphic <p> Mr. Hughes ' presentation stated the following : <p> In 1964 , the city adopted a " Pennsylvania 108 Urban Redevelopment Plan , " also called the University Plan , that laid out an institutional footprint for the college to grow in . <p> Using primarily federal and state funds , the Scranton Redevelopment Authority condemned , bought and demolished most of the homes in this zone , paid for owner and tenant relocations , and gave the university a clear site on which to build . The city also changed the zoning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of classroom buildings and dorms . But the university over the years has " mushroomed " beyond the original footprint by obtaining from the city use variances . Overall , the university owns some 170 parcels in the city , according to public real-estate records . <p> From , million of assessed value was taken off the tax rolls as a result of the university 's acquisitions . And from 1992 through 2009 , million in real estate taxes were lost by the city , county and school district due to the university 's tax-exempt growth . <p> In 1960 , the city 's population was 111,000 residents , but by 2010 it had dwindled to 77,000 . <p> " So while the university of Scranton since 1964 has greatly expanded , the city has contracted its tax base , " the population has contracted and million of assessed value has been removed from tax rolls , Mr. Hughes said . <p> The city in 1976 also closed a portion of Linden Street to help the university create a campus-like atmosphere , all " without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Hughes said . <p> As the university grew and prospered , the city - or at least city government - struggled . In 1992 , Scranton was designated under state Act 47 as financially distressed , and remains so today . The city is facing large tax and hikes to close a million deficit in next year 's budget . <p> Meanwhile , the university posted a million " profit " in 2012 , Mr. Hughes said . <p> The university each year gives to the city a donation that the city calls a ' payment in lieu in taxes . Since 1983 , the university has donated a total of million to the city in such voluntary contributions <p> Council President Janet Evans noted that Providence , R.I. , and Baltimore had some of their larger nonprofits " rescue " those cities by significantly increasing PILOT donations to compensate for tax-exempt land . She likened the history between Scranton and the university to that of a parent and a child , respectively , in which the parent raised the child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs the child 's help . <p> Some of the university 's contributions cited in economic report include : since 1980 , the university 's economic impact to the region has been billion ; since 1980 , the college has granted undergraduate degrees and 9,665 graduate degrees ; the college paid to the city million in building permits and business privilege taxes on four recent major construction projects ; and students spend an average of million off campus each month ; university employees and alumni make up nearly 10 percent of the city 's workforce , and nearly 1 in 10 city residents are students , alumni or employees of the university ; and 2,750 students have contributed 1.9 million hours of community service since 1997 . <p> Jack Carling , who was director of relocation for the city 's Redevelopment Authority that facilitated the redevelopment of the lower Hill Section into the university campus in the 1960s , said the impetus for the university plan stemmed the city 's desire to widen Mulberry Street between Wyoming and Mifflin avenues . On the corner of Wyoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university that dated to its precursor , St. Thomas College . The city needed to condemn and raze that St. Thomas College annex building to widen Mulberry Street , Mr. Carling said . <p> " Everybody got this bright idea - if you want our property on Wyoming Avenue , how about doing something for us up on the hill , " Mr. Carling said . <p> The university years earlier had been given the Scranton family estate in the lower Hill Section and had installed surplus Navy barracks as classroom buildings there . By the early 1960s , the lower Hill Section had been on a downslide with conversions of large , older double houses into apartments with 6-8 units and mixed commercial uses . <p> " It was going to be a buyout of overcrowded and mixed-use " housing , Mr. Carling said . " The housing was starting to slip badly , so there was plenty of justification ( for condemnations ) . And you had the university with great needs , and that area was designated for clearance .

The mission was summarized in that article by county chapter founder and President Dr. Anna C.

Through a contact number at a Trenton , N.J. , homeless shelter , it was discovered his name was actually Matthew Hogan . <p> - ? ? ? Patrick Taylor , 57 , told acquaintances he had family in Jessup or Stroudsburg . Died in April after years of battling seizures and alcoholism . <p> - Jesse Wilson , 80 , worked at a newsstand before being hospitalized for acute dehydration in October . Authorities believe they found his sister , but she denied knowing him . <p> - John W. Smith , 70 , a Navy veteran who died Dec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo 's story holds particular intrigue for retired Coroner Joseph Brennan , if only because it was his first and longest-standing unclaimed case . When Mr. Brennan opens Mr. Buffalo 's folder and flips through his old handwritten notes , memories of a search for answers slowly come back into focus . <p> Mr. Buffalo 's belongings were few . On him was a medical services card with an alias , one of at least eight names and stolen identities he went by , including " Edward Danforth " and " James Badhorse . " He bore the scars of a pair of knife wounds on his body , and the words " Indian Chief " were tattooed on his right arm . <p> A card for a business led Mr. Brennan to call Davy 's Last Chance in Chenango Forks , N.Y . Although Mr. Buffalo had been there , the bar was a dead end for information . A post office box in Mission , S.D. , likewise proved to be a cold lead . <p> Mr. Brennan , who resigned as coroner earlier this month after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also matter-of-factly part of the job . <p> " It 's the investigative part of this office that has to be done , " he said . <p> Worth remembering <p> But a case like Mr. Buffalo 's can not help but stir a little wonder . <p> " It 's none of my business , and I 'll never know , but you always wonder how they get from point A to point B , " Ms. Berardelli said . <p> Some of these mysteries arrive from apartments and nursing homes . Others from hospitals , or alleyways if they were homeless . Many are " out-of-town people who just come here to get lost , " Ms. Berardelli said . <p> For Megan Smolenyak , the idea that someone could be so entirely lost to society serves as gnawing motivation . A professional genealogist , Ms. Smolenyak has a saying : " Every life is worth remembering . " <p> Ms. Berardelli routinely enlists the help of Ms. Smolenyak , a researcher and author who founded a group dedicated to cracking these kinds of cases , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genealogy , she rounds out this unlikely team of detectives . Mr. Brennan was a funeral director . The new coroner , Tim Rowland , runs an ambulance company . Ms. Berardelli previously worked for the physician 's answering service at CMC . <p> Though her father grew up in Wilkes-Barre , Ms. Smolen ? ? yak became involved with the Lackawanna County coroner 's office through the chance discovery of some of its cases during an online search several years ago . <p> Bodies go unclaimed for many reasons , Ms. Smolenyak said . People disconnect because of fights and grudges , because of financial hardships , because of drug and alcohol abuse . Sometimes they simply outlive everybody they know . <p> Dignity in death <p> Josefina Woods was 66 years old when she died on Dec. 13 , 2009 .

Ms. Smolenyak turned to her databases and found Ms. Woods ' maiden name was Alvarado , and that she might have relatives in Texas . Ms. Berardelli called number after number to no avail . <p> She did get through to a sister of Ms. Woods ' third husband , but they had only been married a short time , and Ms. Woods never spoke of family or children . <p> " We give it our best , " Mr. Brennan said . <p> For most of the unclaimed , after all leads are exhausted , the coroner obtains a court order to cremate the body . Funeral homes are asked to sign and file the death certificates , and either they hold onto the ashes , or the remains are kept in a cemetery vault . <p> A few of the unclaimed are buried in a section of Cathedral Cemetery for the indigent and unknown . Those that were veterans receive military burials . <p> " Everybody deserves dignity in death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowland , who took over as coroner Jan. 1 . <p> Lives disappeared <p> In cases where the next of kin is found , some people are indifferent or wary , but it is the thankful ones who stand out . <p> Mr. Brennan recalled a man found dead in a cardboard box in a Scranton alley . There was a number in his wallet , and when Mr. Brennan called it , the man 's mother picked up . <p> " She was the only person who ever said to me , ' Oh , thank God . ' I said , ' Excuse me ? ' She said , ' I 've waited 15 years for this phone call . ' " <p> Then there was Robert Haase , 80 . A World War II veteran , he died July 2007 living in an apartment on Green Place , where authorities found his mail from the VA , a stamp collection , paperwork for a property he no longer owned , health cards and in quarters . <p> Looking for more clues , Ms. Berardelli checked Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He also left a letter that looked like a will and indicated he had a son . It was written 15 years earlier , and Ms. Berardelli was sure it was a suicide note . Its last line read : " I could n't stand it anymore .

The son ended up in foster care . <p> That really struck Ms. Berardelli . Mr. Haase abandoned his son but never forgot him . The love was still there , in its own way , she said . <p> Ms. Smolenyak said she realizes some unclaimed people did not necessarily lead the most admirable lives , but she believes one measure of a society is how it cares for its deceased . <p> " Where are we as a people if we just let them disappear ?

 Twp. men makes own sopressata <p> Jason Farmer / Staff Photographer Ron takes several rings of sopressata out of his outdoor smoker . The Scott Twp. resident has been making the dry-cured Italian salami for about 25 years , using a recipe that 's popular in his native Carbondale . <p> It seems appropriate that Ron makes his living in antiques . In many ways , when it comes to food at least , the Scott Twp. resident possesses a self-sufficiency that harkens back to a different era . <p> He makes his own wine . He roasts his own peppers . He raises chickens and cows . <p> He is also well-versed in the Old World art of curing meat . But it 's an involved process , one that requires the help of a few friends . <p> So , every year around this time , Mr. brings together a diverse group of guys from all over the valley to help him produce a gargantuan batch of sopressata , the salty , fatty and extraordinarily tasty dry-cured Italian salami . <p> Mr. and his crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff , the majority of which is now hanging in the basement of Mr. 's Carbondale antiques shop . The dead of winter is n't good for much , but it 's ideal for producing first-rate " super , " as it 's often called for short . <p> In addition to Mr. the group includes his brother , Paul , of Chapman Lake ; Rick Pambianco and Tony DiMatteo of Archbald ; Tommy Staple , Mike Caporali , Jake Poronsky and Joe of Carbondale ; John of East Scranton ; Victor Giambrone and Brian and Bill Kennedy of West Scranton ; and with Dave Stiner of Throop . <p> For these guys , putting out a top-quality batch of sopressata is only part of the attraction . Their task comes complete with a couple of meals , several glasses of homemade wine , playoff football on the TV and a whole lot of good-natured teasing . <p> It 's male bonding of the best sort . And the results are delicious . <p> Carbondale tradition <p> Mr. has been making sopressata for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the family of Carbondale , where Mr. grew up . <p> " They had that recipe for 100 years , " said Mr. , whose ethnicity is Italian and Polish . <p> About 10 years ago , he started making super with this particular group of guys , some of whom were there from the beginning , some of whom joined along the way . <p> For the first few years , they made it in a tiny cinder block " bunkhouse " on Mr. 's sprawling property off Green Grove Road . Besides its significant space constraints , the bunkhouse was heated by an old coal stove that gave the place a permanent smoky haze . <p> Still , they managed to get the job done . <p> " You should 've seen that set-up , " Mr. Giambrone said with a laugh . <p> A couple of years back , Mr. replaced the bunkhouse with a much larger garage that comfortably fits the fold-out tables that serve as the group 's assembly line . <p> Before the guys have even taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done , namely taking the pork butt the super is made from , boning it , grinding it up and mixing it with a combination of paprika , fennel seed , crushed red pepper and loads of salt , the primary curing agent . Mr. used to do this himself , but it 's such a chore he 's since handed the duties off to the professional butchers at Bosak 's Choice Meats in Olyphant . <p> Following a hearty breakfast of eggs , bacon and potatoes , the group gets down to business . Mr. brings the ground sausage out in 25-pound batches that are weighed on a bathroom scale that sits on the one table . <p> First , the sausage goes into a hand-crank cast-iron sausage press that dates to the early 1920s . This relic gets the job done , but requires so much exertion on the part of the person working it that it makes the table shake . On this particular day , the task fell mostly to Mr. Poronsky and Paul , both of whom handled it with aplomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busting Mr. 's chops for not having a modern electronic press . <p> " Someday , I 'm going to buy my own machine . But , we 're in a recession , " cracked Mr. , who also makes lonza , another type of cured Italian pork . <p> " The only problem with those ( machines ) is they come with plastic gears . No good , " Mr. Staple said . <p> As the meat passes through the press ' tube , another guy waits with the casings , which are cow intestines that have been turned inside-out and thoroughly rinsed in lemon and salt water . " It takes the smell out of them , " Mr. Staple said . <p> The key to properly filling the casings is to keep as much air out of them as possible , and , of course , to avoid breaking them . Brian Kennedy proved highly adept at this . In the course of his shift , only a couple burst . <p> " Everyone 's got certain tasks they do well , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casings . To avoid cuts and blisters , they put duct tape around their fingers . <p> After the casings have a series of minuscule holes poked in them to release any trapped air , they 're hung up on poles and escorted out to Mr. 's outdoor smoker . <p> All told , the sausages spend about a half hour in the smoker . There is n't enough heat in the smoker to cook the rings ; it simply allows them to take on the flavor of the wood burning in it . Mr. prefers apple wood , " but you can use any type , " he said . <p> For four hours , the process repeated itself numerous times , with the group taking a break for lunch - ground sopressata patties topped with the roasted peppers Mr. makes every fall with his wife , Maria . Served on a hard roll , they were , in a word , superb . <p> Subhead <p> When the last 25-pound batch was completed , Mr. took the rings to his antique shop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because the sopressata needs to cure in a cool environment , preferably about 40 degrees Fahrenheit . That 's why Mr. and Co. always make it in the first few weeks of the new year . Do it in November or December , when there 's a greater chance of an unseasonably warm day , and you run the risk of the casings getting moldy . <p> " If you make them too early , it can destroy the sausage , " Mr. Giambrone said . <p> The sopressata needs at least six weeks to cure , Mr. said . Mr. Pambianco likes to let his go for eight weeks , preferring the harder texture that comes with additional aging . <p> " I also like mine a little more peppery than how we make it , " Mr. Pambianco said . <p> By the time the sopressata has been divided among the group - they get 50 pounds each - the rings have shrunk to around half their original size .

 ago , seeing a bald eagle in Northeast Pennsylvania was a rare event . <p> Today , spotting the national symbol is becoming more common , but no less awe-inspiring - particularly since a pair of the birds have taken up residence along the Lackawanna River in the city of Scranton . <p> Bernie McGurl , executive director of the Lackawanna River Corridor Association , spotted the birds by chance on Groundhog Day and snapped a few pictures of them . <p> He does n't want to disclose where he saw them or their nest , which he said is within a mile of a deep trench in the Lackawanna River with a population of carp that offer the eagles a ready food source . <p> " Bald eagles like their privacy , " he said . <p> Even as the re-establishment of the bald eagle makes the once-rare sighting more common , it poses other challenges . <p> As the urban pair show , the reclusive bald eagles are living closer to people .

Now , he 's lost count of how many times he has seen them . <p> The game commission is accepting public comment on a draft 10-year bald eagle management plan that outlines the state 's strategy to sustain bald eagle populations . The plan is available at the commission 's website , www.pgc.state.pa.us . Comments will be received through Thursday , March 3 . <p> Birdwatcher Patti Ollendyke of Scranton said people need to be educated about the spread of bald eagles .

 on relationship with father , his work <p> Special to The Sunday Times Jason Patric portrays alcoholic writer Tom Daley in the revival of " That Championship Season , " opening on Broadway on Sunday , March 6 . The Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning play was written by his father , the late Jason Miller of Scranton . <h> Related stories <p> Jason Patric was only 6 when his father gained fame and fortune for " That Championship Season " in 1972 . <p> While the overnight success allowed his family to move " out of poverty and change our lives , " it also cost Mr. Patric his father . Shortly after the play garnered international acclaim , Mr. Miller left his family . He never wrote another play comparable to his masterpiece . <p> " It has a lot of identifications , personally , of triumph , and also defeat , " Mr. Patric said in an interview with The Sunday Times following a recent preview performance of a revival that opens May 6 on Broadway . <p> " My dad , he had a very brief moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the revival , said that while it was difficult to revisit the catalyst that drove his father away , it is so well-written he was able to distance himself from its deeper personal attachments . <p> " I just want to look at it as a text and a piece of material , " he said , " just discovering the language of it - the beauty of the language and the specificity of each piece of punctuation . " <p> When rehearsals began and his fellow actors turned to him for insight , he said he found it difficult to walk the line between being helpful as an insider and coming at it fresh , as just another member of the team . <p> " As the sort of keeper of the play , there are certain questions , and I would answer them to the best of my ability , " Mr. Patric said . " I 'd give a little bit about Scranton . I mean , my grandparents lived there , so I went a lot when I was a kid . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can help you with anything , I will , but this play - I want it to be new to me . My association is just to you guys . ' Not what it was to my father , the good and the bad things . " <p> In the Electric City <p> Recently , Mr. Patric visited Scranton to film a spot for a morning talk show . A camera crew followed him as he checked out his father 's old stomping grounds , including his former high school , St. Patrick 's , his family home on Fillmore Avenue and Courthouse Square , where , in 2008 , Paul Sorvino unveiled a bust of Mr. Miller . <p> Mr. Sorvino starred in the stage and movie productions of " That Championship Season " in the 1970s and ' 80s . <p> It was the first time Mr. Patric saw the statue , but he said he felt no real connection to it . <p> " I guess to create something in Scranton so people there feel that they can go on to the arts if they so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means nothing to me , looking at a piece of metal that 's supposed to be your father . " <p> Setting foot in the city was " visual and sensual stimulus , " Mr. Patric said , adding that it looked the same to him as when his father and grandparents were still alive . <p> " When I 'm there , it 's just tapping into memories of certain nostalgia I had as a little boy , " he said . " I do n't know enough of the people or the town or what it 's really doing now ; how it 's turning a corner , how it 's not . What 's the same , how it 's not . " <p> After he moved back to Scranton , Mr. Miller 's relationship with his son was strained . <p> " I do n't like the idea ? ? ? him coming back to Scranton , ( it ) was not this great son coming home to celebrate , which is sort of the myth , " Mr. Patric said . " It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the town . <p> " It 's just , you know , he was able to get away with just being Jason Miller there . Stumbling around . When someone 's not sober , they 're just really not interesting to talk to . " <p> On his own <p> For much of the time Mr. Miller lived in Scranton , Mr. Patric was trying to establish an identity on his own merits , without cashing in on his famous heritage . His mother , Linda , was the daughter of Jackie Gleason , so the acting genes were strong on both sides of his family . <p> " The paternal or familial nepotism is not my bag , " Mr. Patric said . " I can understand why people would be interested and that 's why I 've talked about my past and my father , and I 've never done that in 25 years . <p> " I 'm doing it now because ? ? ? that 's an interesting side to the story . It 's not something ever-present in my mind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Reinforcing the point , Mr. Patric said one of the themes of the play is the examination of the father-son relationship . Even his character contains " pieces " of his father . And given the choice , he guessed his father would have chosen Tom the writer for his son , anyway . <p> " I feel sometimes that I have a sense of communion with his spirit . In some strange way , in some circular , sort of karmic way , this came back to me at this point in my life , something I 've always avoided , " he said . " And that was just the point where I thought , ' You know , this is a great gift to be doing right now . ' And I appreciate it . " <p> His believes his father would be proud , too . <p> " He would love these actors . Without question . That I know . " <p> No business like it <p> Mr. Patric has had a career he refers to as " unconventional , " during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became disillusioned with Hollywood early in his life . <p> " My methodology is at odds with the mechanism of the business . And so I do n't necessarily like what I do , either , " he said . <p> This aversion to the very thing that sustains him made Mr. Patric 's character Tom that much more identifiable . <p> " I relate to Tom in a way , just searching for some sense of inner truth and meaning in what you do , what you 're about , " he said . " That 's why this has been a wonderful gift . A gift , in effect , from the ether , coming back this way , because I 'm very dissatisfied and bored with the movie business . So this has energized me in a way , not just as an actor , but as a man and a person . " <p> Whether he will feel differently about the fractured father-son relationship his own life mirrors from the play after it has completed its run remains to be seen . <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I would n't want that to be my selfish endeavor in this , you know . I prefer to get closer , as opposed to closure , to my father 's essence . <p> " When I think about this , I think about the who wrote it , that guy and his sort of effervescent zeal to blaze through the sky . " <p> Mr. Patric said it is his wish that many people from his father 's hometown will make the trip to New York to see the play , since it is steeped so heavily in local history and lore . <p> " I really think that people from Scranton , certainly Wilkes-Barre , or anywhere in the Lackawanna Valley - that 's where it 's set - this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to come see a masterpiece that came from your roots , came from your dirt , came from your coal , " Mr. Patric said .

 File The Emerald Isle Step Dancers from Pittston perform during the 47th annual St. Patrick 's Parade in downtown Scranton in 2008 . This year 's parade steps off on Saturday . <p> 50 years of parade <p> Ask Paul F. Crowley why Scranton 's St. Patrick 's Day Parade thrives after a half-century , and he 'll talk about friendships and traditions , bound together across generations as if tied by bows of Kelly green . <p> Then the last surviving founder of the St. Patrick 's Parade Association of Lackawanna County will talk about families - and little girls with batons . <p> When the 2011 parade steps off Saturday at 11:45 a.m. , the 50th consecutive edition of what is often referred to as Scranton 's version of Mardi Gras , the Bellevue section native will have seen it grow from a humble notion into one of the largest and most celebrated events of its kind in the nation . <p> Mr. Crowley , who now lives in Mechanicsburg , said the parade was always intended to be a family event where parents and children of every ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intrusion of " politics and issues . " <p> " You know what made us successful ? I 'll tell you one thing , " Mr. Crowley said . " There are more little girls in that parade - twirlers - and they all have mothers and aunts and grandmothers , and they are all out there supporting their children . In all of Lackawanna County , we want our children to be successful . " <p> Organizers of the 2011 parade are n't about to mess with a time-tested formula , parade director Jaime Hailstone said . Among the 168 entries registered as of last week were at least six youth baton or dance troupes , along with at least five groups of step dancers . <p> Although the association is always looking for new pipe bands , high school bands and other performers and attractions to make each parade a unique experience , one of the first topics discussed when planning started for this year 's parade was whether to do something different in recognition of the 50th anniversary milestone , he said . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer was we really ca n't , " Mr. Hailstone said . " The bottom line is we could not think of anything we wanted to change . There was nothing you could subtract and really nothing you wanted to add . " <p> But there will be a few wrinkles : <p> - ? ? ? The United States Naval Academy Marching Band , billed as " The Navy 's Oldest and Finest Band , " will make its first appearance . Mr. Hailstone , who credited U.S. Sen. Bob Casey with helping to bring the unit to the city , said the association always searches for a military band to lead the march " and Annapolis was able to do it this year . " <p> - ? ? ? The record 14 pipe bands include several that will be making their parade debuts , he said . At the other end of the spectrum is the Penn York Highlanders pipe band , which has performed in all previous 49 parades . <p> - ? ? ? The Washington Showstoppers Community Marching Band , winner of last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an encore , Mr. Hailstone said . The Original Trilby String Band of Philadelphia , which made a crowd-pleasing appearance in 2009 , also returns after a year 's absence . <p> The association anticipates between 12,000 and 15,000 people will participate in the parade . Mr. Hailstone said the size of the expected crowd is more difficult to project because turnout is often dictated by the weather . Last year 's parade attracted an estimated crowd of 40,000 despite the damp , blustery conditions . <p> One of the hallmarks of the parade is how many people return year after year , Mr. Hailstone said . <p> Some who attended the parade as children are now bringing their own children or even their grandchildren , he said . Anyone who questions the number of out-of-town visitors the parade attracts to Scranton each year has n't tried to make a hotel reservation for next weekend . <p> " Six to eight months out , people are getting their rooms , " Mr. Hailstone said .

 trash has given Northeast Pennsylvania a new distinction : home to the second-busiest garbage dump in Pennsylvania . <p> Keystone Sanitary Landfill in Dunmore and Throop accepted 1.26 million tons of household trash and industrial waste last year , which was more than all but one municipal landfill near Philadelphia , a Sunday Times analysis of state Department of Environmental Protection data show . <p> Of that , nearly half came from New York state , which contributed 546,299 tons of mostly household and business trash . <p> From the Empire State alone , that 's 1.09 billion pounds of garbage , or the weight of 13,657 fully loaded tractor-trailers , which have direct access to the landfill via Interstates 380 , 81 and 84 . <p> On Dunham Drive , garbage trucks , dump trucks and tractor-trailers rumble down the main road leading to the landfill practically nonstop throughout the day , many bearing out-of-state license plates . <p> Just 16 percent - 206,734 tons - came from Lackawanna County . <p> Joe Dexter , who manages the multimillion-dollar Keystone operation that has about 100 full-time employees and is permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , attributed Keystone 's success to holding a range of waste disposal contracts with in-state and out-of-state local governments and private firms . <p> " That 's the butter .

 - One of downtown 's cornerstones <p> The Sunday Times archive April 9 , 1923 : The construction of the furniture store Stoehr &amp; Fister at Adams Avenue and Spruce Street . <p> Gustav Stoehr and Ray Fister broke ground at Adams Avenue and Spruce Street in April of 1922 . They had earned a reputation as one of the pre-eminent furniture dealers in Northeast Pennsylvania , and their grand new structure took its place among the regal skyscrapers around Courthouse Square . <p> The use of sculpture and stonework to embellish buildings is as old as architecture itself . The Stoehr &amp; Fister building features ornamentation that signifies the building 's original purpose . All around the perimeter , just above the first floor , elves are busy at work carving , turning and in other ways making wooden furnishings . <p> The firm began as Stoehr , Fister &amp; Jennings in 1906 , a time when the population of the region had reached its peak , and business and industry brought prosperity . It sold everything a well-appointed home or office could require . <p> The first floor housed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking machines - phonographs , gramophones and the like . The firm 's offices and shipping rooms were located on the first floor . <p> Both second and third floors were divided into rooms appropriate for displaying suites of home or office furniture . Carpets , rugs , linoleum and draperies could be found on the second floor . The fourth floor displayed additional living room and dining room furniture , while the fifth showcased bedroom suites and other furnishings . Kitchen furniture , stoves and other kitchen items were found in the basement , along with packing rooms and the company 's power plant . <p> But Stoehr &amp; Fister was not just a retail facility . At the top , the sixth floor provided spaces for repair and finishing shops , as well as for storage . <p> In 1939 , having been in business together for 33 years , Gustav Stoehr and Ray Fister dissolved their partnership , and the business passed to Robert Stoehr , Gustav 's son , who had been the manager for some time . <p> A number of firms had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1906 .

The email was obtained from a confidential source by The Times-Tribune , and the judge confirmed he wrote it . <p> Judge Nealon had been a contender for a federal judgeship but said he is no longer in the running .

The judge 's Dec. 2 , 2004 , email was sent about a month after the board asked the court for permission to consolidate or change the locations of 139 voting districts mainly for reasons of efficiency . <p> In an interview with The Times-Tribune , Judge Nealon confirmed he sent the email to former Democratic County Commissioner Joseph Corcoran and attorney John P. O'Boyle , who was the solicitor to minority Democratic Commissioner Randy Castellani at the time . <p> The Board of Elections majority was Republican County Commissioners Robert C. Cordaro and A.J. Munchak , who had knocked Mr. Corcoran out of office in the 2003 election . <p> Judge Nealon said his goal was to ensure he had a clear record of what was happening , and he believed objections to the plan could help accomplish that .

" <p> Jerry Notarianni was chairman of the county Democratic Party at the time . <p> " This is a political winner for you , " the judge wrote . " No one likes to have their polling place changed and you could gain a lot of grass roots support in the affected districts if you mobilize objectors to protect those voters ' rights . " <p> The judge also tells the men to keep it a secret . <p> " But whatever you do , do n't tell anyone that this petition has been assigned to me , " he wrote . " and Hardaway think it 's going to be heard by a 3 judge panel but ( court administrator ) Billy Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one who knows that and we do n't want to educate the other side on this and have them demand a 3 judge panel instead . " <p> Hardaway is Cathy Hardaway , the county director of voter education at the time . <p> That line is followed by one final sentence : " GET TO WORK ! ! " <p> Motive behind email <p> Judge Nealon said on Wednesday that the case was always assigned to him and was never intended for a three-judge panel . <p> He wrote the final part of the email to create urgency in Mr. O'Boyle and Mr. Corcoran to act , he said . <p> " The last part here is just made up , " he said . " It was never going to be assigned to a three-judge panel . I mean , the other side knew who it was assigned to . They would have gotten the notice from the court administrator long in advance of that . " <p> Efforts to reach Mr. Corcoran and Mr. O'Boyle were unsuccessful . <p> Judge Nealon said he emailed the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of the plan at " some kind of a public function " weeks earlier . At the public function , the judge said he asked Mr. Corcoran if he would be involved in objecting to the plan . If so , because they are friends , he would have had to recuse himself , Judge Nealon said . Mr. Corcoran , a year after losing his re-election bid , seemed uninterested in pursuing the matter , and Mr. O'Boyle said he could not because as minority solicitor he would have been in the position of objecting to a county plan while working for the county , Judge Nealon said . <p> " And they both indicated that they were not getting involved but that they wanted to look at it and see if certain districts were being unfairly targeted for consolidation on partisan or political grounds rather than the legitimate legal basis , " he said . <p> By the time he sent the email , no one had objected to the plan and he was becoming concerned that the voting district changes might make it harder on elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county website contained the basic petition for consolidation but lacked exhibits that outlined specific voting district changes , he said . <p> " When I had clicked on that day , and it was n't there , as you can tell from the email , I became suspicious that perhaps that was not wholly inadvertent and maybe people clicking on would not realize ? ? ? that their districts were going to be affected , " Judge Nealon said . " I was concerned that a proper record would n't be made for me to decide these issues . I was concerned that we would go out there and it would essentially be unopposed . When I say unopposed , it would be ' Here 's the plan , there 's no objection , rubber-stamp it . ' ? ? ? ' ' <p> So he emailed the only two men who had asked him about it , Mr. Corcoran and Mr. O'Boyle , who had obtained copies from his office , he said . <p> " So I knew that they had it and that no one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my part , I sent them this email encouraging them to contact the appropriate " people , he said . <p> Asked if he was giving legal advice , Judge Nealon replied , " Well , I mean I was telling them they had to file written legal objections and attend the hearing and explain why it would present a hardship and , to be honest with you , I was using strong language , quite candidly , because I knew that they had gotten this several weeks or a month before and nothing had happened . " <p> That is also why he used the language about the issue being " a political winner , " he said . <p> There were two major objections to the plan . Two Jefferson Twp. supervisors did not want the township 's single voting district split in two . A Scranton committeeman also objected that only Democratic districts were targeted for consolidation . Election officials agreed to keep the township district intact and argued successfully that they did not target Democratic districts . <p> In the end , despite pushing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was presented and with only minor conditions . The county went from 239 to 163 voting districts . In several precincts , the judge required an additional voting machine . He also required the board to issue new voter registration cards to all voters in affected districts to notify them of changes and took control of the appointment of election judges and inspectors in those districts . <p> " And I would submit to you that that supports my statement I 've made to you ( that ) my goal was to have a full and complete record developed before me so that I could decide this issue correctly , " he said . " It was n't to have somebody come in and raise any type of objection so that I could deny the plan or disapprove of it in any way ... Here , I obviously felt I could still be fair and impartial , and I was fair and impartial and decided the case ... in favor of the petitioners . " <p> Questions raised <p> The judge said he has not been contacted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against judges . <p> Attorney Joseph A. Massa Jr. , chief counsel for the Judicial Conduct Board , said the state Constitution forbids him from confirming or denying whether the board has received a complaint about a judge or whether it is investigating a judge . <p> Judge Nealon denied ever doing anything similar before or since , and said he does not know whether publicity about the email will hinder his ability to act as a judge . <p> " I would hope that those lawyers and litigants that appear before me with some regularity would regard this as an isolated incident and ethical transgression on my part and would hopefully still feel confident in my ability as a judge , " he said . <p> His role in guiding the case outside the courtroom raises questions about whether Judge Nealon violated the canons of the state Code of Judicial Conduct . <p> Canon 1 of the state rules requires judges to preserve " the integrity and independence of the judiciary . " Canon 2 says judges " should conduct themselves at all times in a manner that promotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " should not allow their family , social or other relationships to influence their judicial conduct or judgment . " Canon 3 says they " should be unswayed by partisan interests , public clamor or fear of criticism . " Canon 3 also says they should disqualify themselves from hearing a case " in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned , including ? ? ? instances where ( a ) they have a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party ? ? ? " <p> Canon 7 says they " should not engage in any other political activity except on behalf of measures to improve the law , the legal system or the administration of justice . " <p> Legal ethics experts <p> Several experts in legal ethics to whom the situation was described without naming Judge Nealon said he violated ethical rules . <p> " Actually , it 's pretty hard to believe , " said John M. Burkoff , a professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh with an expertise in legal ethics . " The first thing that is absolutely clear is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nonpartisan and neutral . " <p> Mr. Burkoff cited canon 2 's command to act with integrity and impartiality and canon 3 's admonition to be " unswayed by partisan interests . " <p> To suggest arguments in a case over which a judge is presiding is " inappropriate , if not in actuality , then certainly in terms of appearance , " Mr. Burkoff said . The email goes " beyond simply making sure both sides are represented , " he said . <p> Arthur D. Hellman , also a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh , and a leading national expert in judicial ethics , said the judge 's behavior is " almost incredible . " Mr. Hellman said the judge could have avoided any controversy by simply publicly announcing that the consolidation petition was filed and inviting people to comment or formally object to it . <p> " What you 're describing is such a patent violating of judicial ethics , " Mr. Hellman said . " If he did this , it violates so many basic rules ... This is n't in the debatable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Attorney Philip Feldman , certified expert in legal malpractice in California , said the judge urging the recipients to keep the assignment of the case to him a secret alone warrants discipline because it is constitutes serious misconduct . <p> " Based on those lines and the foundation leading to it , it seems more probable than not that the judge is begging for removal from office or ( an ) exceptionally strong reprimand , " Mr. Feldman said . " Wow , that 's a killer . " <p> Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr. , professor emeritus of law at the University of Pennsylvania and another leading national expert in legal ethics , called the judge 's behavior " seriously improper " in an email . <p> " If he thought the Democrats should have some kind of notice he should have advised the parties to give such notice , " Mr. Hazard said . <p> Ironically , as Mrs. Hardaway testified at the hearing , the Board of Elections did send notice of the proposed changes to local political parties . <p> Federal nomination <p> Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.

The first student to enroll was Dorothy Hammerly of Brooklyn , N.Y . This was an era of applying scientific knowledge to the home front in areas such as home canning and nutrition .

This attitude raised the status of the housewife to an educated professional . <p> Enrollment numbers show just how prevalent that attitude was .

 budgets , teachers pay out-of-pocket for supplies <p> As thousands of students return to class this week , they are not the only ones who went back-to-school shopping . <p> Teachers have stocked up on crayons , pencils and notebooks as area school districts have cut supply budgets or have strengthened controls over purchasing . <p> And through the course of a year , many area teachers say they spend at least several hundred dollars on items for their classrooms . <p> They are not alone .

This can be fixed , " he said . " But there are people who have worse than this . They have no place to stay . " <p> At Greenwood 's Furniture on East Tioga , water was lapping at the curb in front of the store at midday - higher than Agnes , higher than owner Mark Monsey had ever seen it . <p> " We 're just a few inches away , " Mr. Monsey said as he wolfed down a sandwich . <p> He had spent all Wednesday night trying to raise as much furniture as possible above the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as it did . <p> " If I had known this , I would have gotten a tractor-trailer and moved it out , " Mr. Monsey said . <p> As the floodwaters crept closer to her home at 12 Pine St. on Thursday morning , Linda Sherman set up a measuring stick in her yard to monitor the depth and jokingly yelled to a neighbor , " I always wanted riverfront property !

She was n't worried about the first floor of her home flooding . <p> By 3:30 p.m. , she was n't as confident . <p> " We 've moved everything we can to the second floor , " Mrs. Sherman said .

It rushed across Route 11 , flooding other stores . <p> People walked across the bridge over the river from to view the devastation - a site many said was too familiar . <p> Thompson resident Sherry Sparks , a Red Cross volunteer , recently returned from assisting in flood cleanup in Vermont . On Thursday , she took photographs of damage in Great Bend , and today , she will answer phone calls for people seeking assistance . <p> " To see this is just terrible , " she said , surveying the damage near Interstate 81 .

But this time , he was ready . <p> Mr. moved many things from his basement and yard upstairs or across the street , and sent his wife to stay with their daughter before the water from Harmony Creek , just south of the Susquehanna , got too high . <p> By 3 p.m .

 Urban walked into the Luzerne County emergency management command center early Friday with a degree of optimism after an anxious night of watching and waiting . <p> The surging Susquehanna River had crested in Wilkes-Barre at 38.83 feet , almost 2 feet below projections and well below the top of the county 's levee system , he said , hailing the update from the National Weather Service as " good news for us . " <p> The figure , supposedly recorded at 9:45 p.m . Thursday , held for hours and became as central to the story of the flood as the muddy waters flushing through homes in West Pittston and the streams gushing from busted gaskets along the Market Street Bridge in Wilkes-Barre . <p> There was an air of relief and a sense of security . The record territory of Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972 had been averted , the levees - built to withstand waters of up to 44 feet - were holding and , barring an unforeseen catastrophe , the Wyoming Valley had been saved . <p> On the riverfront , though , " things were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Luzerne County Flood Projection Authority . <p> Water continued to rise long after the National Weather Service said it had crested and the levee system developed weaknesses not anticipated for a flood of nearly 39 feet , Mr. Brozena said .

Friday . <p> " We are containing a much larger flood than we had previously anticipated , " he said . " We basically told people it was a 39-foot flood . Well , guess what : It was n't .

The last river level reading recorded by the gauge put the river at 38.72 feet in Wilkes-Barre at 11:15 p.m . <p> Mr. Hlywiak said Friday morning , before the U.S. Geological Survey report , that forecasters were confident in their determination that the river had crested even though the gauge had failed . <p> He cited two factors : <p> n ? ? ? The river " reliably " crests at Wilkes-Barre six to eight hours after it crests upstream in Meshoppen , Wyoming County , Mr. Hlywiak said . The river crested there at 5:15 p.m. , according to National Weather Service data . <p> n ? ? ? Emergency management officials in Luzerne County reported to the National Weather Service that river levels appeared to be receding . <p> " That 's the best confirmation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose responsibility it is to be on the ground say it 's receding , that 's more believable than a gauge report . " <p> Signs of a gauge malfunction may have developed as early as 5:45 p.m . Thursday as the river level fluctuated with slight increases and decreases at each 15-minute reading . According to the gauge , the river rose from 38.71 feet at 5:45 p.m. to 38.72 feet at 6 , then fell to 38.7 feet at 6:15 . The river then rose to 38.79 feet at 6:30 , according to the gauge , then fell again to 38.63 feet at 7:15 . <p> By Friday afternoon , the National Weather Service conceded the higher number , removing the crest from its online river-level chart and revising its prediction models upward . <p> " We had to entertain the idea that maybe the crest came early at Wilkes-Barre because we could n't trust the flows coming from upstream , " he said .

 benefits of Sunday hunting disputed <p> Michael J. Mullen / Staff Photographer Stan displays a crossbow inside his One Stop Sports Shop . " If you can do everything else on a Sunday , why not hunt ? " he asks . <p> A recent report about the potential economic benefits of Sunday hunting in Pennsylvania reignites a longstanding skirmish . <p> Expanded Sunday hunting could create up to million in annual spending , including million in retail sales , according to estimates in a report to the state Legislature 's Legislative Budget and Finance Committee . The study , prepared by Southwick Associates , a Florida firm that researches wildlife economics , says the activity could support up to 7,400 jobs and generate million in state and local taxes . <p> The report 's spending projections come under fire , though , for overestimating the economic impact . <p> " The study does not take into account the impact of activities that are already occurring on Sundays that will be reduced or displaced by Sunday hunting , " Joel Rotz , government relations director for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bill . <p> " The number is not going to be nearly as big as these numbers would suggest , " said Richard Ready , Ph.D. , a professor of agricultural and environmental economics at Penn State University . " Actual spending would be smaller . " <p> The bill remains in a House committee and would not establish universal Sunday hunting . It would direct the state Game Commission , which endorsed the bill last spring , to determine the Sundays to allow hunting and in which field sports seasons . <p> The contest pits farmers and outdoor activities groups against hunters and firearms-rights organizations . The two sides represent the state 's most powerful outdoor interests , and this is at least the fourth state legislative battle over Sunday hunting in the last decade . <p> Pennsylvania allows hunting for crows , coyotes and foxes on Sunday , but not for large game , such as deer and bears . <p> " If you can do everything else on a Sunday , why not hunt ?

" <p> Nate Hosie , a nationally known hunter who lives in Susquehanna County and is a cast member on " HeadHunters TV , " a program on the Outdoor Channel , said most state sportsmen favor expanded Sunday hunting . <p> " There would be very few hunters who would disagree with a Sunday hunt , " he said . " What about a guy who works six days a week and only has Sunday off to hunt ? " <p> " It should help business , " he said . " It would be good for the economy . " <p> But Mark Piazza , owner of Shawnee Guns and Ammo in Plymouth , supports Sunday hunting , thinks it would have minimal impact on his sales . <p> " I doubt if it will pick business up , " Mr. Piazza said .

The expenses include lodging , airfare , guide fees , boats , weapons and other gear , licenses and land purchases or rentals . <p> The Southwick study , though , discounts potential lost spending from other days of the week if Sunday hunting expands , Dr. Ready said . <p> " I have no idea how much shifting would occur , but I 'm sure some would occur , " he said . <p> He also sees an overestimation in the study about new spending . <p> " All of these models assume that spent by a hunter on Sunday is a new dollar that would not have been spent otherwise in the state , " Dr. Ready said . " A lot of it is going to come from money that would have been spent anyway .

The lecture was presented to a standing-room-only audience of nearly 800 at the Houlihan-McLean Center . Dr. Nash is best known for his work in game theory , which focuses on how people interact in situations where binding agreements can be made and situations where they can not be made , also known as cooperative and non-cooperative games . His theories on the forces that govern chance and events have been influential in numerous fields , including market economics , artificial intelligence , politics and military strategy . He was awarded the Nobel Prize for one of his most well-known concepts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " Ideal Money and the Motivation of Savings and Thrift . " He spoke about recent economic crises , including the national debt of Greece and the " panic of 2008 " in the United States .

' bad money is better than good money . ' " Dr. Nash said he suggested the use of an industrial consumption price index , or ICPI , to use to give " ideal " money its proper value . He said that in this case , however , honesty can be very important . " Here is where I see the importance of honesty ... sometimes the people in the USA have been told things like ' inflation is not a problem , ' when statistics compiled by the Labor Department ... indicate there is , indeed , ongoing inflation , " Dr. Nash said .

As more arrive , the blades are being shifted by crane from one place to another to make room for others arriving sometime between now and the end of the year . <p> The components are so big that even the cranes used to cart them have to be built on site , Mr. said . <p> He noted on average each blade is approximately 230 feet long and , even though they 're made of lightweight fiberglass , each weighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate the tower sections and the housing for the engines called nacelles .

One is for 75 megawatts with Old Dominion Electric Cooperative in Virginia , and a second is with the Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative Inc. for 30 megawatts . <p> Ms. Abbott said BP Wind Energy is marketing the remaining capacity to other customers in the northeastern United States .

 near city of Carbondale vexed redevelopment project construction <p> A mine fire raging underground came " very close " to the place where officials hoped to cut it off . On Feb. 9 , 1961 , Carbondale Mayor Frank L. Howard announced that an all-out push would , he hoped , stop the fire before it spread farther . <p> The stepped-up action came just nine days after a wayward blast showered the area with huge chunks of rock and brought a halt to efforts to contain the fire . The multimillion-dollar urban renewal project called for strip mines to contain the fire and then eradicate it . The fire had raged beneath the city 's west side for nearly 15 years in mines owned by the Carbondale Coal Co. , a subsidiary of the Glenn Alden Co . <p> The Carbondale Redevelopment Authority had purchased 80 homes in the vast redevelopment area to make way for the project . Strip-mining efforts had begun several weeks before the mayor 's announcement , starting near the A&amp;P supermarket on Brooklyn Street and proceeding toward West Mountain . Crews dug pits along both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground level . At the bottom of the pits , small power shovels and trucks removed the coal . <p> When officials planned the series of strip-mining cuts , they believed the Brooklyn Street cut was far enough away from the southern and western boundaries of the fire to contain it easily . But by Feb. 8 , officials realized how close the fire had come to the area where they had expected to stop it . <p> That realization led the mayor to step up efforts . Mining crews drilled holes along the old New York , Ontario &amp; Western Railroad bed , directly behind the A&amp;P supermarket . Temperatures in those holes were among the hottest since the project began , burning up to 1,200 degrees - which meant a change in the blasting schedule . Previously , crews had been able to drill a number of holes , fill them with explosives and blasting caps , and detonate them all at one time . But with temperatures as high as they were , the explosives had to be detonated within three minutes from the time they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not smoothly . In early March , Mr. Howard and the state department of Mines and Mineral Industries shut down operations after a blasting accident damaged buildings and automobiles . Secretary of Mines Lewis Evans lifted his ban about two weeks later . <p> Mr. Howard would not allow work to resume , however . <p> " We definitely want some type of assurance as to what you are going to do to guard against another such accident , " he told the mine company . <p> In late May , work at the bottom of the pits was again halted when a power shovel operator was killed in an earthslide in a pit at a different site in Carbondale Twp . Officials feared the same could happen at the project in the city of Carbondale . Power shovels or trucks could plunge through the surface into the abandoned mines that lay just below the bottom of the pits , they feared . Or the walls of the pits might collapse as the abandoned mines settled . The drag lines continued to operate as the battle to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the surface for the first time on Nov. 17 . Crews unearthed the fire late in the afternoon in a strip trench along Brooklyn Street near the Eighth Avenue crossing of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad . The fire became visible when the rock that separated a top 5-foot vein from a 20-foot second vein collapsed into a long-abandoned tunnel . One observer said the fire seemed to be centered in pillars in the second vein . The rock layer between the two veins also appeared to be on fire , the man said . <p> Despite a city ordinance prohibiting strip mining after 11 p.m. , Mr. Howard gave permission for around-the-clock efforts to halt the big blaze . <p> The redevelopment project continued , but the fire and the effort to contain it continued to plague the city of Carbondale for years . <p> CHERYL A.

 a foul-smelling black fluid found in a Scranton sewer line three months ago failed to determine a source , the sewer authority director has told the board . <p> During a meeting this month , Scranton Sewer Authority Executive Director Gene Barrett said a source of the discharge could not be determined . His remarks echoed prior comments in October by state Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman Colleen Connolly , who said the source of the discharge may never be determined . <p> The fluid was detected Sept. 24 , when a stench from a sewer line permeated parts of Green Ridge and Dunmore and prompted some evacuations . <p> In late October , the DEP determined that leachate from Keystone Sanitary Landfill in Dunmore likely was not the source of the discharge . DEP 's analysis found that the foul-smelling fluid was a chemical mixture of a petroleum product similar to diesel fuel , home heating oil and other chemicals not typically associated with petroleum products .

 homeowner will pay more in property taxes in 2016 compared to five years ago due to a recent spate of double-digit tax hikes from City Hall and the school district . <p> A Sunday Times analysis of tax rates found that a homeowner 's property tax bill will soar 32 percent , from in 2012 to for 2016 .

 2016 about degree of difficulty <p> Barring some unforeseen circumstances , the presidential nomination contests are over . Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be the respective nominees of their parties . <p> For Democrats , that 's probably OK . For Republicans , not so much . A Trump nomination looks like trouble up and down the GOP ticket : no White House , maybe loss of the Senate , possible loss of several state legislatures and a few state houses . <p> In short , the GOP needs some " unforeseen circumstances " if , as many now believe , to avert electoral disaster . <p> The party 's last-gasp efforts to support Marco Rubio and stop Trump on Super Tuesday were clearly too little and too late . Now the so- called " establishment Republicans " confront a fateful decision to rally around Trump as a few already have or try to derail his candidacy by drafting a convention " dark horse , " maybe Mitt Romney or even John McCain . <p> No draft in 60 years <p> How exactly that would work out remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention since 1976 . Moreover , the last brokered conventions were in 1948 for Republicans and 1952 for Democrats . And the last bona fide draft was more than 60 years ago when Republicans nominated Dwight Eisenhower . <p> One thing , however , is certain ; if Trump is derailed , it will not be accomplished in the primaries and caucuses that remain ; if it happens , it will take place at the Cleveland convention in July . <p> The establishment GOP 's motive for trying to stop Trump is strong . Beyond almost any doubt , a Trump nomination would tear the Republican Party asunder perhaps presaging a generation of wandering in the political wilderness as happened to Republicans after Hoover 's loss in 1932 and to a lesser degree to Democrats after Hubert Humphrey 's loss in 1968 . <p> Deeply aware of this ominous history , Republican leaders face a daunting dilemma : Embrace Trump with its inevitable political costs or move to deny him the nomination , thereby entering an uncharted political no man 's land . <p> For many Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , which is no choice at all . A Trump nomination could destroy Republicans as a major national political party and few party leaders doubt that . <p> Further muddying these already muddy waters is the possibility of an independent candidacy . The former mayor of New York City , billionaire Michael Bloomberg , may still be considering a candidacy . <p> At first blush , a Bloomberg candidacy may seem promising . Voters in recent polls have indicated they are ready for a third party and given the extraordinarily high levels of dissatisfaction with government , a Bloomberg candidacy would seem promising . <p> Bloomberg , who has expressed strong personal concerns about Trump , might do it . <p> But his disadvantages are formidable . He has to start with no organization at the grass-roots level and no candidates running for federal and state offices to be part of his team . He must also pull voters away from the major parties , a difficult challenge given the growing polarization and increased partisanship among the electorate . Finally , he must fulfill the myriad Byzantine petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent candidate and he must do so in enough states to give him any reasonable chance to win the 270 Electoral College votes required to win the presidency . <p> Helping antagonist <p> Then there is the personal calculus for Bloomberg : An independent run is likely to draw more votes away from the Democratic ticket and earn the support of independents , thus helping his avowed antagonist , Trump . Bloomberg in a real sense would be running against himself . <p> A Bloomberg run , should it happen , would certainly be a wild card in what has been the wildest of political years . Nevertheless , his primary role would be that of a spoiler , whose candidacy helps Trump . <p> All of this presents in sharp relief the painful quandary Republicans face . A Trump nomination could deal the party an electoral defeat in November that might take a political lifetime from which to recover . An independent candidacy could help , but like all third party efforts , it is fraught with unknowns . <p> For Republicans , the only viable path forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if they can stop Trump at the convention , a Trump independent candidacy is all but certain . <p> This is truly a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea the proverbial rock and the hard place . <p> Already late winter , it 's clear that 2016 is likely to be a bad year for the GOP .

 Easter Rising drew criticism of British government from locals <p> ASSOCIATED PRESS FILE Above , some of the damage caused during the Easter Rising , an armed rebellion against British rule that took place on Easter Monday , April 24 , 1916 , in Dublin , Ireland . At the right in the photo is the O'Connell Bridge , continuing into O'Connell Street , with the O'Connell monument at left and showing the ruined area around the Eden Quay . Pictured below are ruined buildings on North Street in Dublin . <p> April 24 marks the 100th anniversary of an armed rebellion in Ireland by people seeking an end to English rule . <p> In what became known as the Easter Rising , proponents of self rule took over several strategic buildings in Dublin and then clashed with the British military . <p> Battles that raged in the streets over the five-day conflict left hundreds dead , more than 50 percent of whom were civilians , according to research by Irish Central . <p> The clash was part of a decades-long struggle to end British rule in Ireland . Home-rule bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but failed each time . As the years passed , more and more Irish people began pushing for independence , leading to the organization of several pro-Irish groups including the Sinn F ? in League and , later , more militant groups such as the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army . <p> Rebels had planned to begin occupation of key buildings in Dublin on Easter Sunday but postponed their action to the following day , according to a history compiled by the BBC . On April 24 , they took over several prominent sites , including the General Post Office , the Four Courts , the South Dublin Union and St. Stephen 's Green , with little incident . <p> 18-20,000 soldiers <p> The next few days brought sporadic but fierce fighting with British troops , who were at first greatly outnumbered . By April 28 , however , " the 1,600 rebels ... were facing 18-20,000 soldiers , " according to the BBC . <p> Leaders of the Irish rebels Patrick Pearse , Joseph Plunkett and Tom Clarke among them agreed to surrender on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the surrender order did not reach some of the outposts until the following day , Sunday 30 April , " according to a history written by the National Library of Ireland . <p> In the aftermath of the surrender , 15 leaders and participants in the uprising were executed , among them Mr. Pearce and his brother , Willie . Another 97 Irish fighters were sentenced to death . But most of those were spared , their sentences commuted to prison terms , as news began to spread about the bloody , five-day battle . Public opinion about the clashes was one of shock and outrage , especially as it became clear that the many civilian casualties were caused by British shelling and heavy artillery . <p> At first , news about the Easter Rising was sparse , thanks in part to a lockdown of information by the British government . Articles about the uprising were carried on The New York Times front page for 14 days straight , starting April 25 , but many of the early stories relied almost completely on information provided by the British government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the headline , " Troops crush revolt in Dublin , take Post Office seized by rioters ; many killed in street fighting .

" <p> Eyewitness accounts <p> Articles continued to appear in The New York Times , including one the day of the rebels ' surrender , which contained eyewitness accounts of the fighting from people who fled Ireland and arrived in London . <p> The Scranton Times ran news of the Easter Rising on the front page starting April 25 , 1916 , and continued publishing articles daily through mid-May .

To shoot them down was a piece of base brutality and will no doubt cause reprisals by the people of Ireland . " <p> Mr. Ford compared Patrick Pearse to George Washington , in that the Irish leader " represented a people throwing off the yoke of England , " the story in The Scranton Times said . " Washington would have been shot like Pearse had he fallen into the hands of the English . " <p> Locally , prominent Irish leader Jeremiah O'Leary praised the Irish fighters ' courage , saying it was clear they knew the likely outcome of the uprising . <p> " They were not striving for immediate results , " he was quoted as saying in the May 4 , 1916 , article .

 of catastrophe <p> President Ronald Reagan greets House Speaker Thomas P.

As Reagan reached for O'Neill 's hand , he said , " Let 's get a picture of that . " ( AP Photo/Ira Schwarz ) <p> Among some people , the new parlor game is choosing who would make the worst president : Ted Cruz or Donald Trump . This is not a lady-or-the-tiger dilemma , but a one . The choice is between a fiercely friendless reactionary and a bombastic , thoroughly dishonest egomaniac . You pick . <p> My choice is Trump . He wins in this close and ugly race even though I consulted a conservative lawyer who knows Cruz and he , to my surprise , chose the Texas senator . He cited Cruz 's cramped interpretation of the Constitution and a personality approximating that of a wolverine . <p> The fact that Cruz is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply troubling . He is not seeking to be an astronaut who would spend the next four years alone in space but shooting for the White House where he would be politician in chief . As president , he would forever be at odds with Congress . We have had enough of that already . <p> The death of Nancy Reagan harkened us back to an era when politicians had opponents , not enemies . The ultimate example of the schmooze as an instrument of government is the amicable relationship enjoyed by Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill , the conservative Republican president and the liberal Democratic speaker of the House . <p> Still , Trump strikes me as the more dangerous candidate . I do n't think Cruz would ever have sputtered such contempt for the rule of law as Trump did when he said he would revive torture waterboarding being the least of it . He said he would compel its use even though it was against the law and the military might , as it should , refuse to follow his order . What would he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate ? <p> " I 'm a leader , " he added a moment later . " I 'm a leader . I 've always been a leader . I 've never had any problem leading people . If I say do it , they 're going to do it . That 's what leadership is all about . " <p> Trump believes that the time he spent as a kid in military school was the equivalent of military service . If so , he missed the lecture I got in basic training on how we were under no obligation to follow an illegal order . This lesson had to be repeated a number of times because not every soldier understood that even his drill sergeant had to respect the Constitution and the laws of the land . <p> This is bedrock stuff .

But he can not recant his florid-faced insistence that the law is what he says it is . Nor do I accept the assurance of his defenders that these are silly debate moments that would never be repeated in the solemnity of the White House . The argument that the Mr. Hyde of the campaign trail would become the Dr. Jekyll of the Oval Office is the true triumph of hope over common sense . History warns that the man may well be the monster he pretends to be . In general , power does not humble . <p> Cruz is who he says he is . His legal philosophy is parched and constricted , his Constitution , like the Ten Commandments , a sacred document divinely authored . It is open to amendment , not interpretation . <p> Cruz 's true danger is his zealotry . When he can not persuade , he obstructs . He is a man of heroic petulance , unsuited in manner for the presidency , but not by intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be preferred to someone who does not take it into account at all . <p> The system has failed us . Either Trump or Cruz is likely going to be the Republican nominee and all that would stand between him and the White House is a single person , probably Hillary Clinton , and the law of averages : no indictment , no slip in the bathtub , nothing like that .

Mrs. Housel 's husband is a former guest at the house and she is a former manager at the facility . The Ronald McDonald House is a no-cost residence for the parents of critically i 'll children . Byline : Edward Pikulski Date created : 03/15/2000 <p> The first thing Richard Bradshaw tells people when they enter his longtime place of employment is to take off their shoes , put up their feet and relax . <p> In other words , make yourself at home . <p> That , in a nutshell , has been the mission of the Ronald McDonald House of Scranton since its doors opened June 25 , 1986 . <p> The house , located at 332 Wheeler Ave. , just down the street from Geisinger Community Medical Center , provides a " home away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children at local hospitals free of charge . It 's one of more than 300 Ronald McDonald Houses throughout the world . <p> With the addition of its family rooms at GCMC , Moses Taylor Hospital and Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center , the " Ronald House , " as Mr. Bradshaw affectionately refers to it , now serves more families than ever as it approaches its 30th anniversary . <p> Donations and fundraising fuels the house 's existence , and on Sunday , April 3 , it will hold its annual Gourmet Gala at Mohegan Sun Pocono in Plains Twp . <p> With those funds , along with a dedicated staff , board and volunteer network , the house can provide families with a little bit of normalcy during an extremely abnormal situation . <p> " To watch it grow into what it is today has been very exciting , " said Mr. Bradshaw , the house 's executive director since 2000 . " What we do is all about compassion . It 's compassion for the families , it 's compassion for the kids . There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do next . This takes as much stress out of the equation as possible . " <p> Philadelphia start <p> The first Ronald McDonald House was established in Philadelphia in 1974 by NFL player Fred Hill , who recognized the need for a safe , supportive environment away from the hospital for families when his daughter was being treated for leukemia . With the help of McDonald 's restaurants in the Philly area and his Philadelphia Eagles teammates , Mr. Hill raised the funds needed to purchase the house . <p> The Ronald McDonald House network had spread to many other cities when , in 1984 , local pediatrician Mel Wolk decided it was time for Scranton to have its own . <p> " I 'm sitting on my porch on a summer day , and I turned to my wife and said , ' What if we had a Ronald McDonald House here ? ' " Dr. Wolk said . " With the neonatal ( intensive care ) unit at CMC , I thought it 'd be good to have one here , like the one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration at CMC , where he was the then-head of pediatrics , as well as local McDonald 's franchisees Albert and Carol Mueller . The Muellers , who had been involved in establishing the Danville Ronald McDonald House , made the initial donation . CMC purchased the 2,430-square-foot , three-story house , the 92nd in the Ronald McDonald system , and leased it to the nonprofit Northeastern Pennsylvania Children 's House Inc . <p> Since June 1986 , the house has never closed . <p> " It just flew , " said Dr. Wolk , the house 's first board president and now an honorary board member . " And it 's just flown beautifully over the years because people keep it flying . And a lot of that is due to Rich Bradshaw . " <p> Mr. Bradshaw 's introduction to the Ronald McDonald House was at age 7 , when he stayed at the Philly house following a surgery . <p> " For years , I always remembered what took place and the compassion that was shown to me and my family , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scranton house as a way to give back . <p> He figured he 'd do it for a couple of years and then move on . But the house simply got in his bones and became an essential part of his life , he said . <p> In 2000 , he was hired as executive director . Since then , the house has gotten an addition and can now accommodate up to eight families . Cozy and welcoming , it has all the usual features of a residence parlor , dining room , kitchen , playroom and yard for the kids . Each bedroom has its own private bathroom . <p> Even when the house is filled , it can put up additional families at local hotels it has relationships with , Mr. Bradshaw said . One time , he said , it had 17 families in hotels . <p> The house strives to provide a taste of home for families , where they can lounge on the sofa , watch TV and eat a meal prepared by a volunteer . <p> Every Thanksgiving , Mr. Bradshaw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . After dinner , they retire to the house 's conference room and watch Christmas specials on the room 's projector TV . <p> Bridget , the house 's family room coordinator , said one recent image particularly stands out to her a little girl riding her scooter through the house , just as she would at her own home . <p> " I love it . Getting to meet the families and seeing them through , I really enjoy what I do , " Mrs. said . " I feel like I 'm making a difference in the world . " <p> A lot of families stay in touch with Mr. Bradshaw , which is not surprising when you consider he and the house 's staff and volunteers are there with them during such a tough , vulnerable period . Mr. Bradshaw vividly remembers a man who was in the Marines weeping over the plight of his child . <p> " It 's not often where you see grown men crying , " he said . " I do n't know how many times I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family out of my mind . ... It 's a blessing being able to share what I get to share with these families , those moments where you get to offer some strength and some hope . " <p> Subhead <p> Tonia Smale , of Dingman Twp. , Pike County , recently stayed at the house for about a month as her newborn , Isabella Eve Lorenzo , learned to suck , swallow and breathe after being born six weeks premature on Dec. 29 . <p> " She needed to catch up . ... That was her big developmental thing , " Ms. Smale said . " I was like a nervous wreck . She would stop breathing at certain intervals , her heart beat would drop . We needed to learn how to react to that . " <p> Being able to come back to the house after such physically , emotionally and mentally draining days at the hospital was hugely beneficial , Ms. Smale said . <p> " It kept us healthy . It kept us safe , " said Ms. Smale , a Type II diabetic who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After leaving the hospital , Isabella came down with more complications , including regular vomiting . After a couple of scary weeks , doctors determined the issue to be her pyloric valve . Now , Isabella is healthy and content . <p> During that period , Ms. Smale stayed at the Danville Ronald McDonald House while Isabella was being treated . She said it was interesting to see how the two houses provided " the same level of comfort . " <p> The family rooms at Moses Taylor , and Geisinger Wyoming Valley , complete with hospitality carts and play areas , have added another critical component to the mission , Mr. Bradshaw said . <p> He knows this because he has experienced their value firsthand . A few years ago , his wife gave birth to twins and experienced complications that threatened her life . <p> Being in the family room at Moses Taylor with other people going through similar experiences helped him keep his bearings . He and the other fathers watched Monday Night Football , ate pizza and " offered support to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " It was the first ray of hope I had in that whole experience .

MULLEN / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Dianne Borelli of Dickson City holds her 15-year-old dachshund Maximus with some of the items she creates , including hand-painted rocks and watercolor paintings . <p> A love of beautiful sounds , faith and the simple things in life drives Dianne Borrelli 's devotional pastimes and creative pursuits . <p> The Dickson City resident dedicates nearly all of her time to bettering the world through her art and music . She learned from a young age within her own family that music establishes bonds between people . <p> " I was fortunate enough to have family who loved music , " Ms. Borrelli said . " When we got together , my uncle Johnny always had the guitar . My family were singers . <p> " My father was a Welsh tenor , my mother sang soprano , " she explained . " Everyone would pick a note , divide it into five and then sing it . That 's just the way we were . " <p> This love for music carries over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed by Ms. Borrelli and several of her closest friends , who recorded a CD of their material . <p> " I thought that I could teach myself how to play , and I did . I 'm no John Denver , but I do my own thing , " Ms. Borrelli said . " As a result of that , I got involved at the folk group at our church . <p> " The people that I sing with are awesome , " she said . " We 've been singing together for 35 years . Instead of finishing each other 's sentences , we finish each other 's notes . " <p> Ms. Borrelli strives to teach children the tremendous power words can have through music , though reaching out to young people has been a running theme throughout her life and career . <p> She was a registered nurse in the labor and delivery ward for nine years at St. Joseph 's Children and Maternity Hospital , worked at Community Medical Center as a registered nurse and volunteered at a group home in her neighborhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children with special needs in the Mid Valley School District , until her retirement in 2012 . <p> Now , with more time for volunteering on her hands , Ms. Borrelli preaches her message of empathy , usually with the help of her Martin Backpacker guitar . <p> " We have to teach our kids that words are something that are sacred , because they establish bonds , " she said . " They are n't supposed to twist , bend or break other people . <p> " You are supposed to bring whatever good you can out of a person and throw it out into the universe so that it becomes more . " <p> Ms. Borrelli continues to look to her family for blessings and inspiration . Her daughter , Caitlyn , works as a physical therapist , and her son , Kevin , is an educator . Her late husband , Jim , who died 12 years ago from a brain aneurysm , was an organ donor who helped nine people in need of transplants . <p> The walls of Ms. Borrelli 's home showcase her unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art . She makes " " from the sleeves of shrunken wool sweaters , plus " Wee Remnants , " which are tiny people-shaped figures with big ears into which people " whisper their troubles . " <p> Ms. Borrelli 's artistic energy powers her mission of helping others . She sells hand-painted rocks , shoes and other items at local craft shows and donates the profits to Mary 's Meals , a worldwide charity dedicated to feeding hungry children . <p> Ms. Borrelli delved into the arts scene when friends convinced her to attend the inaugural Antiques in the Park in Carbondale . She declined at first , insisting she did n't have any antiques to sell , but heeded their advice to bring along her painted rocks . <p> " Well , a rock is old , " she noted with a chuckle . <p> To her surprise , the rocks were a hit with buyers . Ms. Borrelli believes people were drawn to the rocks due to connections to their childhood or events they wanted to recall . <p> " I was just gobsmacked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be huge , " Ms. Borrelli said . " It 's not incidental that I was there . " <p> To her , recognition from art sales is not important . She has no idea how much she has raised and donated to the charity so far , and has no desire to know . <p> " It 's not about that at all . When I get , that ( represents ) a child to me , " Ms. Borrelli said . " Sometimes I 'll add to that . Sometimes it 's hundreds of dollars . " <p> The emotional value of feeding the hungry goes beyond filling an empty stomach . It reinforces the idea that all people matter . <p> " I think the wonderful thing about feeding someone is that you 're sending a message to them that they 're worth it , " Ms. Borrelli said . <p> Her insatiable drive to improve the world is fueled by a sincere belief that regardless of a person 's appearance or the struggles they battle , everyone deserves a chance to shine . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Ms. Borrelli said .

 Week : Elk Lake 's Hunter Watkins <p> The Elk Lake senior had a busy week . He began Tuesday by competing in an exhibition track meet against Carbondale Area where he threw the javelin 193 feet , 5 inches . Then , later that day , he played in the Lackawanna League Senior All-Star Basketball game at Valley View High School and scored six points . On Thursday , in the team 's first Lackawanna Track Conference meet , he won three individual events and was a member of a winning relay . His highlight came with a school-record throw in the javelin of 196-8 . <p> Age : 18 <p> Family : Mother , Sharon ; father , Donald ; sisters , Lydia and Taylor . <p> Athletes you admire : My sister , Taylor . She is the hardest working person I know and she is always so uplifting . LeBron James and javelin thrower Barry Krammes . <p> Favorite food : Pizza and wings . <p> Three people you 'd like to have dinner with : LeBron James , Steph Curry and Usain Bolt . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that had to be tough : It was n't too bad . My coaches had talked before the track meet and it was more about what events I was going to be able to do before I had to leave for the game . I was really relaxed and I had a new step rotation and I just let one rip . My first throw went 188 , my second 172 and them I just let one go and it felt really good . It went 193-5 and that is a pretty good mark for the first meet . <p> You broke your school record in the javelin in the first meet of the season against Riverside and that is a really good start : Yeah , it was on my first throw . Then I had a 195 and a 190 , so I was consistently in the 190s . That 's what I want . I know what I have to do now and I ca n't focus in on one throw . If I throw 170 on one day or maybe 220 on another day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you throw . <p> In the win over Riverside , you also ran and won the 300-meter hurdles , the discus and ran the 1,600 relay : Running the hurdles is a long process . It 's tough with the hurdles , and this spring the weather has been so good that I had to take advantage and get a lot of throwing in at practice . I ran a 42 ( seconds ) , but I lost my form a little . I have high hopes for the season . <p> Last year , you won a seventh-place medal at the PIAA Class AA Championship meet , but threw 178-11 , which was shorter than your 192-4 throw at districts , what did you learn from that experience ? I know what to expect now . I was warming up and I was doing some javelin spikes into the ground and the official stopped me , so I know now not to do that . I know the environment , I know the way the meet is run . <p> When did you first pick up a javelin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sprinter , but I was not a sprinter . I tried some other events and my sister was throwing the javelin then . I picked up the girls javelin which is the junior high javelin and I threw it pretty far . We do n't do the javelin in our league in junior high during the season , but I was able to do it at the league meet and I broke the record with a throw of 150-3 . Nick Solfanelli ( Now at Duke ) beat me , I think he threw like 152 . From my freshman year on , the coaches said , I was throwing the javelin . <p> In its 66th season , the ATHLETE OF THE WEEK appears every Monday in The Times-Tribune . A radio interview with Watkins will air on a future date on " In The Zone " with Joby Fawcett on NEPA 's ESPN Radio 630 and 1240 AM and 96.1 and 100.1 FM .

 judge has refused Attorney General Kathleen Kane 's request to have an out-of-county judge preside over her trial on perjury and obstruction charges related to an alleged leak of grand jury secrets from her office . <p> Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy also refused , in an order filed Tuesday morning , to throw out the charges against Ms. Kane , whose attorneys argued the process by which a special prosecutor used a grand jury to investigate the release of confidential information to a reporter was illegal . <p> The judge put off ruling on Ms. Kane 's request to have the charges quashed because she is a victim of a " selective and vindictive " prosecution until after arguments on whether she should be allowed to keep details of those claims secret . <p> Ms. Kane 's lawyers said in a hearing last week that they have been warned by a Philadelphia judge that Ms. Kane and her defense team could face findings of contempt if they make public details of her claims that the case against her is politically motivated . <p> Ms. Kane , a West Scranton native , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand jury investigation into a Philadelphia civil rights leader 's use of government grants . She is also charged with lying about whether she took an oath to keep grand jury information secret . According to county prosecutors , Ms. Kane used the leak to discredit a rival , former state prosecutor Frank Fina , and then lied about the leak under oath . <p> Judge Diane L. Anhalt was assigned to oversee a Philadelphia grand jury investigation of a corruption case which Ms. Kane was publicly criticized for abandoning early in her term . Anhalt issued a protective order barring intimidation of any witnesses , including Mr. Fina . <p> Judge Demchick-Alloy noted the public interest in Ms. Kane 's case and instructed her lawyers to seek permission from Judge Anhalt to file the claims publicly . <p> In a hearing March 22 , Ms. Kane 's attorneys argued that none of Montgomery County 's 20 judges is capable of fairly presiding over her trial because the close relationship some have to the case is too prejudicial . <p> Judge Risa Vetri Ferman is the former district attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Judge William Carpenter presided over the grand jury that recommended charging Ms. Kane ; and special prosecutor Thomas Carluccio , who oversaw the leak investigation , is married to Judge Carolyn Carluccio , Ms. Kane 's attorney Ross M. Kramer argued . <p> Ms. Kane 's team also argued that Thomas Carluccio , who Judge Carpenter appointed to investigate allegations of a leak from Ms. Kane 's office , did not have authority to conduct a grand jury investigation , subpoena witnesses or take sworn testimony . Because of that , all of the evidence against Ms. Kane must be thrown out , they argued . <p> Judge Demchick-Alloy did not state her reasons for denying Ms. Kane 's motions . <p> Ms. Kane 's trial is scheduled Aug. 8 . <p> Contact the read terms and conditions . <p> A Vietnamese court 
 my iCloud <p> A week ago , I spent a good deal of time on the phone with a woman in Manila . Her name is Carolina and she works for Microsoft , which insists on compelling me to " upgrade " to Windows 10 . I tried , but for some reason it did not work . My computer froze and so I had Microsoft walk it back to Windows 7 whereupon , a bit later , Microsoft struck in the middle of the night and " upgraded " me one more time , and one more time my computer froze . That 's how I wound up with Carolina . I 'd like to think that she helped the FBI unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists . <p> Carolina took over my computer . ( She had my permission . ) The cursor started taking orders from the Philippines . It skipped all over the screen and then into this folder and that folder , things opening and closing , my ( digital ) life unfolding before me , Carolina hopping here and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things by color ( there must be an app for that ) and , finally , pronouncing the problem solved . The computer was returned to my control and Microsoft , I was assured , would never again take command of my computer and " upgrade " me to Windows 10 , which , for some reason , my computer is allergic to . A week later , Microsoft tried again . <p> While all this was happening , the FBI and Apple were fighting over whether and how to unlock Syed Rizwan Farook 's iPhone , which could contain important information maybe relating to a future terrorist plot . Apple spurned the FBI 's request , maintaining that if it unlocked this single phone , the method for doing so would leak and every 14-year-old kid would be hacking cellphones instead of developing useful assassination skills on some computer game . As if to prove that this was not a trivial concern , some third party did indeed show the FBI how this is done . The phone spilled its secrets and the Justice Department dropped its case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Apple and the government were duking it out in court , local prosecutors cut and pasted the FBI 's request and demanded the keys to the cellphones they had seized in their own investigations . You could suspect they did this in cooperation with Tim Cook , Apple 's CEO , who had argued that if the company opened the door for the FBI , every sheriff who has just made a marijuana bust would be at the courthouse seeking a warrant . <p> As sometimes happens in life , both sides had a case , but from the start I tilted toward the FBI . Farook and his wife , Tashfeen Malik , murdered 14 people and wounded 22 others and this can not be allowed to happen again . But while I was still mulling over this matter , Carolina clarified things . There she was digging around the innards of my computer , doing things I did not understand , and while she had my permission she nevertheless came to represent all the people and companies and God-only-knows-what who I deeply suspect muck around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself for the counterattack the assurance from the biggies ( Google , Amazon , etc. ) that this does not happen . Maybe not . But I am told that my location is tracked and my buying habits are known and " cookies " incessantly tattle on me . Some people I know have had their emails filched by the North Koreans or somebody and wind up on the Internet for the malicious or the merely curious to peruse . What privacy is the nice Mr. Cook talking about ? <p> I do not doubt his sincerity . And I will concede that some of my paranoia is attributable to my heroic lack of computer knowledge . ( My expertise is in the cloud . ) But I long ago gave up any expectation of privacy . While I fear the government more than I do private enterprise the government , after all , has guns and jails and a U.S. attorney can ruin your life on a whim I nevertheless feel that nongovernmental actors ( I love that term , makes me think of George Clooney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tailing me , watching me : " Hello , Richard , we have that shirt you were looking at .

 his childhood dream of becoming a professional wrestler all the way to Scranton . <p> The moved from Brooklyn , New York , a few months ago to try out for a spot at Back Breakers Training Center , a professional wrestling school on North Washington Avenue downtown . <p> From an early age , Mr. watched edgy , larger-than-life wrestling characters and wished to emulate them . Their outgoing personas were in stark contrast to his own quiet personality . <p> " I wanted to be a character like that , " he said . " I 'm an introvert . ( Wrestling ) gives me the opportunity to be the complete opposite of myself . " <p> He is n't alone . The cult world of sports entertainment draws many people like Mr. . Slightly more than 84,000 tickets were sold for tonight 's World Wrestling Entertainment Wrestlemania 32 at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington , Texas , according to The Wrestling Observer Newsletter . <p> Back Breakers teaches the training required for both performance and athletic endurance in professional wrestling . <p> Students establish personas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to crowds or cameras .

Like the sport itself , his school has grown in popularity steadily over the years . By his estimation , about 25 percent of every roster in the Northeast is made up of Back Breakers students . <p> On top of his day job at Cigna , Mr. Glory trains , promotes , books and takes care of odds and ends at the center in his spare time . <p> " ( Cigna ) is my Clark Kent job , " he joked .

With the explosion of technology , particularly social media , viewers lifted the veil and revealed that wrestling matches were choreographed . <p> Mr. Glory said people should n't be so quick to write off pro wrestling . He urged viewers to think of it in a different light . <p> " You go to the movies to be entertained , " Mr. Glory pointed out . " You know the people are acting and you know it 's fictional , but you still pay the money to go to be entertained . Wrestling is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are actors , who put our bodies on the line , " he said .

The aggression and fast pace of the show was unlike anything he had ever seen . <p> " It was mindblowing , " the 21-year-old Edwardsville resident said . " It was n't like watching cartoons or the Power Rangers or any other sport for that matter . " <p> Mr. Horn was an outgoing kid who played in bands and aimed to capture any room he walked into .

" <p> The possibility of injury in professional wrestling looms heavy . Mr. Glory advised anyone who wants to get into the ring , from wrestlers to referees , to stay fit and work hard to ensure their own safety and the safety of others . <p> " ( Wrestling ) requires a lot , an extensive amount , of training to do the things that we do , " Mr. Glory said .

It also helped develop his persona , a " McDojo " instructor more interested in profiting off of students than teaching them . <p> Though his character is slightly comedic , he still works hard to entertain without injury .

 school bus contract Issues of cost , transparency <p> The Abington Heights School Board and administration helpfully have demonstrated a better route to a new transportation contract than that taken by the neighboring Scranton School District . <p> A majority of Scranton 's board recently railroaded through a four-year contract extension for DeNaples Transportation . In doing so , it defied the district 's own policy , a three-member board minority and the state auditor general 's office , all of which had insisted that the district seek bids for the sake of price competition and public transparency . As state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale put it , the board 's failure to seek bids after several audits recommended it is " mind-numbing . " <p> When the auditor general recommended that Abington Heights seek proposals for a transportation contract , the administration did so . In February , Superintendent Michael Mahon , Ed.D. , recommended that the board hire Rohrer Bus Service of Perry County at a savings of about a year . <p> The six local contractors who now provide transportation services for Abington Heights then sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same neighborhood as the Rohrer proposal . <p> Clearly , price competition can save money for taxpayers . And , publicly seeking requests for proposals ensures that prospective vendors are on equal footing when seeking public business . <p> In Scranton , there is no way to know how honest competition would affect the price of bus transportation because the school board rejected the very concept . And there is no public record of whatever process led to the contract extension with DeNaples Transportation . <p> Having violated its own bidding policy , the Scranton board now plans to change it , thus officially endorsing its own lack of transparency . That , however , can not change the valuable contrast with the Abington Heights process , which Scranton read terms and conditions . <h> The Perils of

 Notarianni complains of being excluded <p> Lackawanna County Commissioner Jerry Notarianni contended Wednesday that Commissioner Patrick O'Malley continues to marginalize his role in important county business . <p> Mr. Notarianni balked at a late addition to Wednesday morning 's meeting agenda authorizing key roles for Chief of Staff Andy Wallace and Solicitor John Brazil in refinancing million in county debt to avoid complications from his lawsuit seeking to void several high-level administration appointments . The Democrat said he supports refinancing the debt but not getting the resolution until 3:45 p.m . Tuesday was another sign of other administration officials trying to keep him in the dark . <p> " I 'm not going to be led down this garden path by people I absolutely do not trust , " Mr. Notarianni said . " In my opinion , people should n't trust them . You 've seen what they 've done in the past . This has got nothing do with ( Republican ) Commissioner ( Laureen ) Cummings . This is strictly my position on Commissioner O'Malley and my position on attorney Brazil . I have absolutely no faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. O'Malley , who last year switched from Republican to Democrat , said he did n't see the resolution until about the same time as Mr. Notarianni . The only reason for the rush , Mr. O'Malley said , was to safeguard the transaction which Chief Financial Officer Thomas Durkin said will save million over two decades . <p> " This is n't about the case , " Mr. O'Malley said . " This is n't about John . This is n't about me . This is n't about Jerry . This is n't about Laureen . This is n't about ( minority solicitor John ) Cerra . It 's about the 214,000 citizens of Lackawanna County and our taxpayers . We 're the stewards of their money . And , I 'm not here to not save money for them . County government moves forward . " <p> Mr. Notarianni 's lawsuit contends , among other things , several appointments of top administration officials were illegal because they did not happen at a public meeting and that party affiliation aside , he is the minority commissioner who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks official legal advice he trusts and wants a judge to rescind the appointments , which could cause problems for the refinancing if officials involved with the transaction lose their positions . <p> Ms. Cummings and Mr. O'Malley argue the appointments were part of their executive powers and do n't require a public vote . They also contend party affiliation determines majority and minority status , and a different interpretation would create an impractical shifting majority . <p> Attorney Brian , bond counsel for the county , said consultants expected the case to be resolved by now , but there is still no judgment . The county is scheduled to close on the bond deal next week . <p> The resolution on Wednesday was designed to have no implications for the lawsuit and ensure the transaction goes through smoothly -- so the county does not have to revise any disclosures to investors , giving them a chance to back out of the deal , Mr. said . <p> Mr. Wallace said he gave Mr. 's cell phone number to Mr. Notarianni so the commissioner could ask questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace if he knew about the situation before Tuesday , and his chief of staff told him he did . <p> Attorneys for both sides clashed at the meeting . <p> " Is this a way to get around the lawsuit ? " asked Paul Walker , one of the attorneys who has been working with Mr. Notarianni . " Was there legal advice given to either Mr. Brazil or the other county commissioners indicating that the method by which Mr. Wallace or Mr. Brazil was appointed was defective , as a result of which these bond issues ca n't go through ? And if that legal advice was given , why was n't Mr. Notarianni notified ? " <p> Mr. Cerra contended the lawsuit lacks merit and Mr. Notarianni already approved an ordinance requiring him to sign any documents to make the bond transaction happen . <p> " This is simply an effort to ratify and make sure that the bond is delivered in the proper manner so that the financing can be put in effect so that hundreds of thousands of dollars can be saved , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that are putting the financing through and certifying to the holders of the bonds that would be enforceable . It does not correct any errors because there are no errors . The lawsuit is completely frivolous . " <p> Mr. Cerra said the attorneys who were appointed as the county legal team are always available to Mr. Notarianni and argued the Democrat would be better off if he listened to them . Mr. Notarianni said he does not have confidence in the legal advice he would get . <p> Ms. Cummings called for an executive session to discuss a litigation issue amid the debate , and after the approximately 40-minute closed-door meeting , the resolution was pulled from the agenda to give Mr. Notarianni more time to review it . <p> Aside from the bond issue , Mr. Notarianni said another example of his isolation happened last week when Mr. Wallace was directed not to answer questions about the proposal to consolidate county offices at the former Globe Store if they come from his volunteer legal advisers . <p> The commissioner said Mr. Wallace , however , was helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief of staff directly , and commissioners agreed Wednesday to hire accountant Michael Barbetti to audit the county 's financial analysis of the potential move . <p> Susquehanna County Senior Judge Kenneth Seamans heard arguments on the lawsuit last month .

Jude laughed and smiled , and his brother called goodbye to him when their mother dropped off the baby first . <p> Mrs. Zayac 's colleagues at Johnson College , where she worked as a bursar , were delighted for her return to work . Her desk was still decorated with streamers from her welcome-back celebration when the call came just after 8:30 a.m . <p> The director of her children 's daycare was a close , personal friend , and always texted Mrs. Zayac , even if her children were sick . Without hesitation , she answered the phone . She already knew something was wrong . <p> " You have to get here right now , " came the voice at the other end of the call . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zayac flew out the door to her car and sped toward the same spot where she only just handed over her seemingly healthy children . Along the way , she called her husband , but was unable to reach him . His cell phone , forgotten in his car that morning , rang unanswered . <p> Mrs. Zayac relayed the emergency through a receptionist at his Wilkes-Barre office , where he works as a CPA , as she zoomed through the streets of Dunmore to reach her baby . <p> " My legs felt like cement , " she recalled . <p> By then , an ambulance had transported Jude to Moses Taylor Hospital , and Mrs. Zayac altered her course to meet him there . She parked her car on the sidewalk and barreled through the intake area to the emergency room , where a doctor and two nurses stopped her in her tracks . <p> " I remember I was just screaming , ' Is he alive ? Is he alive ?

' And I was telling them his name . " <p> As she watched , a young , tall doctor continued compressions . But Jude never breathed on his own again , and after 45 minutes without oxygen , his time of death was called around 9:45 a.m . <p> The and their extended family , most of whom had made their way to the hospital as news of Jude spread , held him in turns and numbly answered questions about funeral arrangements as reality sunk in . <p> The torment continued as they struggled to explain what had happened to Greg Jr .

The family often visited his grave in Dunmore Cemetery together . <p> Mr. and Mrs. Zayac consulted a counselor before they sat their eldest son down to deliver the terrible blow . <p> " He came into the house and we tried to stay calm , " Mrs. Zayac said . " The last thing I wanted to do was have him upset or hurting , because we could n't fix this for him . <p> " We said , ' You know how when God is ready to take people back , he calls them to heaven ? ' And he said yeah , " she continued . " And we said , ' Well , today , He needed Jude . He called Jude up to heaven . When you go home , Jude 's not going to be there .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did say goodbye , because we dropped Jude off together . When Mommy said goodbye , you said goodbye . We said it together . ' And he was just devastated . " <p> For the next few weeks , the grieving parents and Greg Jr . stayed at Mrs. Zayac 's mother 's house . Jude 's grandmothers moved the baby furniture and items into the attic . They all sought counseling . <p> The shock of Jude 's SIDS diagnosis brought to light the silent killer that claimed about 1,500 infants in 2014 , according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . There are no warning signs for the disease , though preliminary research suggests that doctors may be able to develop a hormone test and screening process that indicates which newborns are susceptible . <p> " There 's nothing they can say , looking at your child , that tomorrow he might die .

An online campaign started by a family friend garnered in donations in just 10 days . <p> The family established the Jude Zayac Foundation and decided on a benefit 5K after seeing similar events pop up on social media forums for grieving parents and SIDS victims . By the family 's estimate and own research , Jog for Jude was the largest single 5K for SIDS in the country last year . <p> The dialog that Jog for Jude initiated has been critical for awareness and keeps the family from feeling alone . <p> " There ended up being several people last year who ran in the race or came that either had a sibling who died from SIDS or a child that died , and we got to talk to them a little bit that day , " Mr. Zayac said .

 concept of justice <p> This year , the legal community , our justice system and the nation commemorate the 50th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision in the case of Miranda v. Arizona . <p> At the time , Miranda caused great controversy , particularly among those in law enforcement , over the nature and extent of the constitutional rights of criminal suspects . The case centered on the right to have legal counsel , regardless of the defendant 's ability to pay , immediately after arrest and during interrogation and prosecution . <p> In many respects , the Miranda ruling in June 1966 built on two other U.S. Supreme Court cases , Gideon v. Wainwright and Escobedo v. Illinois . Much debate was whether or not these cases had expanded an interpretation of the Constitution 's Fifth , Sixth and 14th amendments or merely explicated and better effectuated those rights . <p> Immediately following the Miranda decision , police and prosecutors offered dire predictions that convictions would be dramatically curtailed by the ruling , but those fears have been nullified by the passage of time . Improved investigative methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Miranda proved not to be a widespread , insurmountable obstacle to crime-solving or guilty verdicts . <p> Now , while whole generations have grown up watching television shows where the Miranda warnings are routinely read to criminal suspects , it is difficult to fathom a time before Miranda where the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent when questioned by police were never explained to those arrested . <p> However , Miranda represents more than a formal notice to people taken into custody . It also emphatically advanced the American concept that fairness in the criminal justice system is an ideal that requires good faith actions by those in authority and evidence that is obtained through proper means as overseen and enforced by the courts . It is a corollary to the principle of the presumption of innocence . <p> It is axiomatic that there is no public interest in convicting an innocent person . Nor does a wrongful conviction do right by victims or their families . Besides causing incalculable damage to the innocent , prosecuting and incarcerating the wrong person is a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large to menace society again . <p> We live in an age where hardly a week goes by that we do n't read or hear about someone being released from jail after years of incarceration because new evidence has come forth or old evidence has been discredited . Too many of these former convicts have spent time on death row . We also have been exposed increasingly to videos that often demonstrate versions of events that contradict either official reports or witness statements . Moreover , scientific research has demonstrated the diminished value of eyewitness identifications and even some confessions . Many of these issues were explored in the recent Netflix documentary series " Making of a Murderer , " whose widespread popularity underscores Americans ' passion for justice . <p> As we now witness a fight over the latest nomination of a justice to the Supreme Court , the role of that court and individual justices should stand as a reminder of the importance of the office and institution .

 prison guards fired or punished for refusing overtime do not qualify for protection under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act because there is no reasonable action the prison can take to accommodate them , an attorney for the county says in a court motion . <p> Each of the guards obtained doctors ' notes saying medical conditions precluded them from working overtime .

" <p> These 36 words dragged both the scandal and Paterno back into the national consciousness , providing his many detractors with the proof they needed to sink his name and reputation to the depths . Not only did Paterno know about Sandusky 's actions in 2001 , they 'll say , he knew about it , somehow , a quarter century before that . <p> That said , this is hardly any more proof than we had before that Paterno was complicit in a cover-up . <p> For starters , it 's not even an allegation directly from a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first two words of the sentence that has everyone talking confirms as much -- fighting to not cover what Penn State hoped would be close to million in settlements the university agreed to pay Sandusky 's victims . <p> Glazer 's sources are sealed depositions , and those are n't opening , probably ever . Who knows what they contain . But it is known that then-university president Rodney Erickson told Bloomberg in September 2012 that the university wanted to reach a settlement with " ideally all " of victims who brought civil cases against it . <p> It stands to reason it did so with the vast majority because it had at least a modicum of concern the claims were legitimate . Understand , these were not claims proven at trial . If so , there 'd be plenty of questions about a claim like this . Like , who else did this child tell , and if someone was told , why did n't they make more noise ? How did he get such intimate access to Paterno ? What exactly did he tell him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know the answer to those questions , though . <p> What I keep coming back to is that , in 1976 , Sandusky was a linebackers coach . In 1977 , he was named defensive coordinator , the job that would make him famous around the game . Can anyone so easily believe Joe Paterno looked into the eyes of a young child pleading with him to understand what Sandusky had been doing to him and was so heartless , so cold , that he not only ignored him , but promoted him the next year ? <p> I do n't claim to have known Paterno all that well . But I have the same trouble his most devout supporters do when it comes to believing he could do that . That anybody could . <p> Right now , we have no concrete evidence he did . And yet , I do n't know what to think about Paterno . How sad is that after nearly five years ? How can we not smell the smoke and think there is n't a fire ? How are we to reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't catch wind of or grasp Sandusky 's ways in any of four different decades in which we 're now hearing there were concerns ? <p> It 's why I 'll listen to the arguments by those who fight to restore Paterno 's legacy , but still struggle to understand why so many want to see a statue rebuilt , or the name of a stadium changed , to honor a man we should all have serious questions about . We may never get the information we need to feel comfortable doing any of that , fair or not to Paterno . <p> Try to understand every side to this issue when it comes to Paterno , every complicated facet of a tragedy that played out in front of us longer than we knew . But , what would that even solve ? Does understanding and accepting get us anywhere but back to where this all started ?

 the conscience of the community <p> After a long day , you check the mailbox to find an " Official Jury Summons , " directing you to appear for jury duty . Because you are juggling a demanding job and family obligations , your first reaction may be to think of ways to avoid jury service . The reality is , other than serving your country in war , there is no more important civic duty than to serve on a jury . <p> Why is jury service so vital to the American system of justice ? For an answer , let 's start with historical perspective . In the Middle Ages , criminal guilt or innocence was determined by " Trial by Ordeal , " typically water , fire or combat . For example , a person was tied up and thrown into water . If he sank , he was innocent and would be pulled from the water ; if , however , he floated , he was guilty and often executed . <p> Does that sound like a fair system ? <p> Fortunately , because the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , no one has to face trial by ordeal , only trial by a jury of our peers . The modern process is founded upon the principle that a jury can listen to the evidence , determine which witnesses are believable and use collective wisdom to determine the appropriate outcome . <p> Make no mistake a jury represents the " conscience of the community , " and jurors hold tremendous power . A jury has the power to determine guilt of persons accused of crimes , resulting in possible imprisonment , or even death . It also has the power , by its decision , to determine what will or will not be tolerated in our society , which carries with it the power to change behavior . Ford may never have changed the design of its defective gas tank in its Pinto cars if a jury had not made a multimillion-dollar award . <p> Jurors are selected from a number of sources , including driver 's license records , voter registration records , and state tax and welfare rolls . <p> ?

Federal court in our area exempts members of the military , police or fire departments , and public officials , and excuses other categories of persons , unless they choose to serve . <p> Here 's what to expect when you report for jury service : <p> ? You and the other prospective jurors will be given an orientation . <p> ? Prospective jurors are brought to the courtroom for " voir dire , " which means " to speak the truth .

You will not be permitted to speak with anyone , including other jurors , about the case until you decide the case at the end of the trial . <p> ? Your decision must be solely based on the evidence presented at trial . You can not perform your own investigation , such as visiting the scene or researching on the computer . <p> ? You will hear opening statements by the parties ' lawyers , followed by testimony of witnesses from each side and then closing arguments by each lawyer . <p> ? The judge will instruct you on the law that you must follow in making your decision ( even if you disagree with the law ) . <p> You will discuss the case with the other jurors ( called deliberation ) and come to an agreement on the verdict . Criminal trials have 12 jurors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county court , only five-sixths ( 10 out of 12 ) of the jurors must agree .

In federal court , you will be paid for the first 10 days ; a day thereafter , plus mileage and parking .

 number of workers eligible for overtime pay <p> COLUMBUS , Ohio ( AP ) More than 4 million U.S. workers will become newly eligible for overtime pay under rules issued Wednesday by the Obama administration . <p> The rule seeks to bolster overtime protections that have been eroded in recent decades by inflation . A diminishing proportion of workers have benefited from overtime regulations , which date to the 1930s and require employers to pay 1 ? times a worker 's wage for work that exceeds 40 hours a week . <p> Vice President Joe Biden announced the changes at Jeni 's Splendid Ice Creams in Columbus , Ohio . <p> Being overworked and underpaid is preventing middle-class Americans from improving themselves and from spending time enjoying their lives and families , Biden said . <p> " You 're deprived of your dignity when you know you 're working much , much harder and much , much stronger than you 're getting compensated for , " he said . <p> In the fast-food and retail industries in particular , many employees are deemed managers , work long hours but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hourly workers they supervise who receive overtime pay . <p> Under the new rules , released in draft form last summer , the annual salary threshold at which companies can deny overtime pay will be doubled from to nearly . That would make 4.2 million more salaried workers eligible for overtime pay . Hourly workers would continue to be mostly guaranteed overtime . <p> The White House estimates that the rule change will raise pay by billion a year over the next decade . Some employers , though , might choose to reduce their employees ' additional hours to avoid paying overtime , thereby making the workers ' schedules more consistent . <p> " Either way , the worker wins , " Biden told reporters Tuesday . <p> Business groups , however , argued that the changes will increase paperwork and scheduling burdens for small companies and force many businesses to convert salaried workers to hourly ones to more closely track working time . Many employees will see that as a step down , they said . <p> " With the stroke of a pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David French , a senior vice president for the National Retail Federation , said . " Most of the people impacted by this change will not see any additional pay . " <p> The overtime threshold was last updated in 2004 and now covers just 7 percent of full-time salaried workers , administration officials said down from 62 percent in 1975 . <p> The higher threshold , to take effect Dec. 1 , will lift that ratio back to 35 percent , Labor Secretary Tom Perez said . Perez has spearheaded the administration 's effort and has worked on formulating the rule for the past two years . <p> The new rule is intended to boost earnings for middle- and lower-income workers , Perez said , which have been stagnant since the late 1990s . Overtime pay has n't received as much attention as nationwide efforts to increase the minimum wage , but it could have a broad impact . <p> " This , in essence , is a minimum wage increase for the middle class , " Judy Conti , federal advocacy coordinator for the National Employment Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making more than may still be eligible for overtime pay , unless they perform management , supervisory or professional functions the so-called " white collar " duties test . <p> The liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates that 4.9 million people will become newly eligible for overtime , slightly more than the government 's figure , and that an additional 7.6 million will benefit because they have previously been denied overtime pay as white collar workers . Yet with salaries below the new threshold , they will now have a stronger claim to overtime pay . <p> Overtime has become a sore point for many managers , assistant managers , and management trainees in the fast food and retail industries . <p> Despite their titles , they have complained in lawsuits against such chains as Chipotle and Dollar General that they spend most of or 60-hour workweeks staffing cash registers , mopping floors , or performing other tasks typical of regular employees . Yet they do n't get paid time and a half when they clock more than 40 hours in a week . <p> The retail federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours reduced to below 40 hours a week . Others might receive overtime pay but would have their base wages reduced so their overall income would remain the same . <p> Tammy McCutchen , a lawyer who represents employers , contended that that workers converted to hourly pay from salaried status will likely have less flexible schedules . <p> An hourly worker " who takes an afternoon off to attend a parent-teacher conference will not be paid for that time , but an employee ( who is exempt from overtime ) will be paid her full guaranteed salary , " McCutchen said in congressional testimony last week . <p> Joe Kukla , general manager of the 501 Bar and Grill in Flint , Michigan , said he has mixed feelings about the new overtime rule . It benefits him personally , but will also " hurt the business . " Kukla , speaking from behind the bar , predicted 501 will be forced to raise its food prices . <p> Perez said the administration took steps in the final rule to address business concerns : The threshold was lowered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the threshold . And the rule will have a long phase-in before taking effect Dec. 1 . <p> Mara Fortin , CEO of seven Nothing Bundt Cakes bakeries in San Diego , said she might give raises to her " superstar " managers to lift their pay above the overtime threshold . But she said she 'd have to reduce end-of-year bonuses she frequently pays to offset the cost . <p> Fortin has 14 salaried managers and assistant managers among her 110-member staff . The new rule will create problems for managers , some of them newer hires , who take longer to get their work done , she said . She might have to cut their base pay , meaning they would earn about the same income they do now , even including overtime . <p> " We ca n't pay you time and a half because you 're slow , " she said . " This is extremely frustrating for me . " <p> Q&amp;A : How new US overtime rules could help or hurt employees <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) More pay ? Or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama administration issued Wednesday could mean thicker paychecks for some Americans who work longer hours -- or , just reduced time on the job . <p> The rule doubles the salary level that employees must receive to be ineligible for overtime pay . If they earn less than the new threshold , they get 1 ? times regular wages for any work done beyond 40 hours a week . The threshold will be a year , up from the current . Hourly workers are already entitled to overtime pay . <p> Labor Secretary Tom Perez said the change , which will take effect Dec. 1 , will qualify 4.2 million more workers for overtime pay . The higher level is intended to offset inflation , which has eroded the old limits . Some retail and restaurant chains pay low-level managers as little as a year and no overtime even if they work 60 hours a week . <p> Business groups argue that the rule will raise compliance costs and paperwork because companies will have to track workers ' hours more meticulously . They also contend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' salaries above the new threshold or pay them overtime . <p> Here are some questions and answers about the new rule : <p> <p> Q : I 'm a manager at a fast-food restaurant and frequently work 50 or 60 hours a week . Am I now going to get paid for the extra time ? <p> A : If you make more than but less than , you will now be eligible for overtime pay . But that does n't mean you will necessarily get it . <p> The National Retail Federation said about one-tenth of salaried employees newly eligible for overtime will probably receive raises high enough to lift them above the threshold . They will make more money , but wo n't qualify for overtime pay . Managers paid more than the threshold are ineligible because they fall under the so-called white-collar exemption that excludes supervisors and professionals from overtime . <p> <p> Q : What if my salary is still below the threshold and I work overtime ? <p> A : Then you might get time and a half . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of salaried retail and restaurant employees who earn less than the threshold will probably have their base wages cut . As a result , even after receiving overtime pay , their overall income wo n't change . And an additional one-third will probably have their hours cut to below 40 hours a week , the retail federation estimates . <p> Administration officials disagree that pay cuts will be so widespread . <p> " These are their most valuable employees , " Perez said Tuesday . " They go to the bank and deposit the money . ... It 's irrational to lower the salary of your most trusted employees . " <p> Gene Martin , a 26-year-old manager at a suburban New Orleans Burger King , said she would appreciate the opportunity to earn more for working longer hours . <p> A : It could , if your employers cuts your hours rather than paying overtime . But if you 're a doctor , lawyer , software engineer or other highly paid professional , the new rule wo n't affect you . Doctors and teachers are specifically excluded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threshold . The rules assume highly paid workers have the ability to bargain for either larger salaries or more time off . <p> <p> Q : Does this mean I will have to punch a time clock and get paid hourly ? <p> A : If you are below the threshold , business groups said that could happen . Companies will convert you to hourly status and closely track your hours to avoid paying overtime . <p> " For most employees , that 's viewed as a demotion , " said David French , a senior vice president at the National Retail Federation . <p> Hourly workers typically receive fewer benefits and are unlikely to have paid vacation . They also are n't paid if they leave early to attend a parent-teacher conference or other family event . <p> But supporters of the overtime rule respond that it does n't force companies to do any of this . Employees who are eligible for overtime can still be paid a salary and given flexibility over their work time . <p> <p> Q : Who else might be affected ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to boost pay for researchers and teaching assistants . Coaches and athletic staff , as well as admissions officials , will probably have to travel less to avoid incurring too much overtime on the road . <p> Melissa Bard , chief human resources officer at East Carolina University , said the school has 286 employees who currently do n't receive overtime but would become eligible under the new rule . If they are close to the threshold , she said , they could get a raise to lift them back above it . <p> " For the smaller colleges like us , it 's going to have a significant impact , " said Scott Miller , president of Virginia Wesleyan College . " The immediate doubling of the threshold is way too high . It 's too expensive , and it 's happening too quickly . " <p> Nonprofits will also be affected . <p> Bill McKinney , director of research and evaluation at The Food Trust in Philadelphia , said his group already seeks to limit workers ' overtime hours . <p> Fluctuations in pay " can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large stores of reserves , " McKinney said . <p> The liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates the new rule will benefit roughly a third of salaried employees in the agriculture , restaurant and hotel , construction and retail industries . <p> <p> Q : How easy will it be to track employees ' hours ? <p> A : Not as easy as it used to be . Andrew Volin , a lawyer in Denver who represents employers , said current work habits could make it difficult . How will they count time that an employee spent reading an email after-hours , at home ? How will they know when he or she even saw it ? <p> " This is going to create a new cottage industry for companies that have technology to track work time , " he said . <p> <p> Q : What will the other impacts be ? <p> A : Labor Secretary Perez said the rule will collectively raise workers ' pay by billion annually , though that is just a fraction of the trillion in wages and salaries Americans will receive this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers to avoid overtime pay , they could be forced to step up hiring to ensure that necessary work is done .

 short of targets <p> In November 2014 , Sheri G.

In recent years , the 18-year educator had been labeled " flawless ' ' by her superintendent and rated as one of the best by her principal , while her students had consistently exceeded the state 's average on mandated tests . <p> Dr. Lederman sued the state over her rating and won recently . The New York state Supreme Court in Albany recently threw out her evaluation , ruling that it was " arbitrary and capricious .

In addition to value-added measures , a host of bad ideas , such as merit pay , vouchers , tax credits for private schools and charter schools have been introduced over the last three decades by education reformers . <p> It is easy to find dozens of studies that explain why such ideas do not improve public schools , but in a nation that increasingly rejects science , research-based facts are no contest against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many parents who opted their students out of standardized testing , New York 's Board of Regents approved a four-year moratorium on using students test scores to evaluate teachers , a move that dramatically reversed Gov .

Or , the time he guaranteed at a dinner the night before the Final Four that anyone not wearing purple and traveling from Scranton were all competing for second place . <p> And , Bob was right , of course . <p> But ask those players to encapsulate 's influence on their lives in a few words , and it 's not as easy . The impact of good , impactful coaches sometimes takes years to fully understand . In the grand scheme of their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , a basketball coach was part of it for a very short time . Six months a year , for four years , really , during a time when they were not the grown , mature people they 'd become . <p> Mark Hutchinson has to give the question some thought even now . The dazzling senior point guard struggles to define in a simple turn of phrases what meant to him , how he helped mold a man out of a young basketball player . These are relationships that should n't be easily defined , after all . But 33 years later , Hutchinson still has a clear idea of how his coach made him feel all those years ago . <p> " Playing the point guard position , once I earned his trust , he let me run the show , " Hutchinson said . " It fell on my shoulders . He would give me credit when things went well . But , I had to take the blame when things did n't go well , and I was fine with that . Versus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say was trying to micro-manage . He was giving you a responsibility and saying ' go do your job . ' <p> " I respected the heck out of that , and his style . ...

Bess is more than just tuxedos and leather pants and Jumpin ' Jack Flash blaring on the public address system . He 's a teacher , a relentless giver when it came to the university and athletics , even long after his 2001 retirement . <p> " He has been a mentor to me , " said Canio Cianci , his longtime assistant who has coached basketball with the men 's and women 's programs for 20 seasons . " He really taught me how to deal with people . When I got to the University of Scranton , it was my first opportunity to work with college kids . He just showed me the way , how to approach it . It was a great opportunity . " <p> Hutchinson said he never played for another coach like Bess . Cianci said he never met another coach like him .

But when called him that day to congratulate him , he said he wished he 'd solicited it anyway , because he 'd have been happy to give it .

UK membership in the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done at the same time as the UK must negotiate a deal with the EU . A start on this work will be postponed until the Conservatives decide on a leader . <p> Basically the UK government will have to choose among three options : <p> ? Leave the EU and , like Norway , apply to join the European Economic Area . <p> ? Negotiate a new special trade agreement , like the agreements Canada or Switzerland have with the EU . <p> ? Leave the EU without any trade agreement and apply , as a separate country , to join the WTO . <p> The European Economic Area option could be put in place quickly and would not disrupt trade all that much . <p> The EEA is a ready-made model for external association by a nonmember with the EU . But , as an EEA member , the UK would still have to implement EU regulations and contribute to the EU budget . It would not allow curbs on EU immigration . <p> If the UK experiences severe balance of payments problems over the summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a big balance of payments deficit and capital inflows may be inhibited by the vote . The EEA option would buy time . <p> The second option , a special trade deal , would be much more difficult . <p> It would require a detailed negotiation on every type of product or service sale between the UK and the 27 member countries of the EU , including across the Irish border , which will become the only land boundary of the UK with the EU . <p> Such a trade agreement probably would take seven or eight years to negotiate , because it would be subject to domestic political constraints and political blackmail attempts in all the other EU countries , each of which would have to ratify it . If it proposed curbs on immigration from the EU , the affected EU countries would make difficulties with other aspects of the deal as a bargaining tool . <p> It is unlikely that a trade agreement would allow the UK to sell financial services into the EU . Indeed it would be in the interest of EU countries hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few concessions . <p> The third option , leaving the EU with no agreement , could come about because that was what the UK chose or because the negotiations on a special trade deal broke down or were not ratified by one or two EU states . <p> It would require the application of the EU common external tariff to UK or Northern Irish products crossing the border into the Irish Republic . <p> Average EU tariffs are around 4 percent but on agricultural goods the mean tariff is 18 percent . The imposition of these tariffs is a key part of an agricultural policy protecting the incomes of EU farmers . We would have no option but to collect them at customs posts along our border . All forms of food manufacture and distribution within Ireland and the UK would be disrupted . <p> The disruption of the complex supply chain of the modern food industry would be dramatic and the knock-on effects impossible to calculate . <p> I do not believe these complexities were adequately consider by UK voters , who made their choice to leave the EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about immigration , which took insufficient account of the valuable contribution immigrants make to the UK economy , paying taxes and staffing vital services . <p> I believe UK voters did not consider the role the EU has performed in providing a democratic home for the former communist countries of Eastern Europe .

A World Refugee celebration , including people from Bhutan and Nepal , will be held today at Nay Aug Park . <p> The University of Scranton 's Schemel Forum , in collaboration with its Office of Community and GovernmentRelations , presented a lecture titled " Strategizing Scranton 's Recovery " by Henry Amoroso , budget consultantto the City of Scranton and executive director of HJA Strategies . Pictured are , from left , Julie , director of community and government relations at the university ; Mr. Amoroso ; Sondra Myers , directorof the Schemel Forum at the university ; and Evan Weiss , senior analyst , HJA Strategies . <p> In the wake of the Orlando mass shooting that claimed 49 lives in a combination of gun violence , hatred of gay people and ISIS-inspired terrorism , Syrian refugees who are fleeing a civil war fueled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group now may find themselves even more unwelcome in the United States . <p> In a Brookings Institution survey in May , a majority 56 percent of Americans support accepting Syrian refugees , and half -- 51 percent believe we have a moral obligation to accept them . As Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of the Eastern Orthodox church said during an April visit with Pope Francis to a refugee camp in Greece : " We will all be accountable for the way we respond . " Yet , just hours after the attack in Orlando , Florida , there were calls for rejection of refugees and particularly Syrian refugees . <p> Orlando reignites a polarized debate , which from its outset has contrasted the history of the United States as a haven for those fleeing violence against the security of Americans in the face of terrorism with a sense that the two aims are mutually exclusive . <p> Here in Scranton , most do not adhere to an either/or distinction and true to our city 's immigrant roots and friendly spirit , we have welcomed our newest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congo and now , Syria . <p> At a May event coordinated by the University of Scranton , Terra Preta restaurant , Catholic Social Services and other partners , two local Syrian refugee families created a unique pop-up restaurant , preparing authentic Syrian cuisine , sharing their culture and most significantly , opening their hearts . The event , part of an ongoing " In Solidarity with Syria " university initiative , quickly sold out with more than 100 attending and " refugees " soon became friends with one another . <p> Amid social media posts of solidarity and gratitude following the restaurant event there some who were hostile , including " Get them out of America " or " Go back to where you came from . " The attitudes that drive this thinking may become more prevalent after Orlando , even though the attacker was neither Syrian nor a refugee . <p> In fact , most Syrians can not simply " go back . " Their nation is a war zone with as many as 470,000 estimated dead already , according to the Syrian Centre for Policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 4.8 million Syrian refugees -- half of whom are children . <p> When Pope Francis spoke to Congress last fall , he prioritized the global refugee crisis as presenting us with " great challenges and many hard decisions , " and invoked the Golden Rule , saying : " In a word , if we want security , let us give security ; if we want life , let us give life ; if we want opportunities , let us provide opportunities . " <p> If we follow the pope 's advice , our conversations now about security for Americans must be courageous not myopic . Our need to be secure is fundamental and universal . The danger lies when this necessity rises above all other needs and goods , turning us in on ourselves . Archbishop Oscar Romero , recently beatified by the Catholic Church for his martyrdom during El Salvador 's civil war , expressed this idea in a different context , but one that has applicability here , when he referred to national security becoming " perverted " and " ... demands the daily sacrifice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global refugee crisis continues to claim victims , including nearly 3,000 migrants and refugees who have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea this year . <p> We have a responsibility to honor the refugees ' courage by showing courage of our own and choosing not to give into fear . As Stanford theologian Lee Yearley explains , " Fortitude is clearly realized in its essence because the difficulty of fear can be overcome only be marshaling one 's powers to love and hold to a good . " Courage is not about toughness and bravado ; it 's also not about foolishness . <p> Contrary to some claims , there is no flood of Syrian refugees the United States accepted just 4,500 this fiscal year , compared to the hundreds of thousands settling in Europe . Moreover , the U.S. government puts Syrian refugees through a rigorous nine-step process , making them the most security-vetted population to enter our country . Once arrived , refugee communities are often entrepreneurial , bring rich cultural traditions and help us buck a trend of population decline in Northeast Pennsylvania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration to be marked for the first time in Scranton today in Nay Aug Park we have an opportunity .

Another way is to listen for the creatures . <p> That 's what Mr. Fritsky was doing recently , and the reason he was driving from Hop Bottom in Susquehanna County to Falls Twp. in Wyoming County . <p> His route was random , originally created for another biological survey the North American Breeding Bird Survey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the game commission randomly selected routes for biologists to use for its own purposes . <p> As he drives , a faint buzz comes from his computer . A program called III is scanning the night skies for sounds that humans ca n't hear . The computer mostly just buzzes , but occasionally he picks up something : a high-pitched chirp from a bat using echolocation to hunt insects at night . The computer repeats the sound , the screen lights up and the software marks the data . <p> After the drive is finished , he 'll use another software program to sort out the sounds of bats . <p> Species make different sounds , some changing pitch up or down , or changing the length of a squeak , or repeating noises . His computer matches the sound with a library of bat noises and tells him the likelihood that a particular species of bat is flying through the summer night . When he 's finished , he 'll have a map showing where he heard the bats . <p> The equipment and the software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has performed years of bat surveys , but searches using this method are only four years old . <p> Humans are still an important part of the process . <p> Biologists go through the sound files to make a second check of the recordings the computer threw out as not containing bat noises . <p> The goal is to map the bats ' locations and better understand them . With that information , biologists can try to protect the animals , which are in an ongoing crisis . <p> Major decline <p> The software buzzes quietly inside Mr. Fritsky 's truck as he completes the survey . <p> A chirp is cause to take notice . <p> He points at the curves of data that appear on his computer screen . They are signs of bats . <p> Biologists are encountering far fewer bats these days . <p> The animals pollinate crops , disperse seeds and eat millions of insects , but some species in Pennsylvania and other eastern states have suffered major declines . A disease called white-nose syndrome is to blame . <p> A fungus invades the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle , according to Bat Conservation International . Instead of hibernating normally , infected bats repeatedly wake during the winter , burning up limited fat reserves . By the time they leave hibernation sites , they are hungry , thirsty and dying . <p> Scientists in New York State found bats with the disease in 2006 . By 2008 , it had spread to Pennsylvania including Luzerne and Lackawanna counties . <p> One site Mr. Fritsky checks , on a river island in Northumberland County , used to have about 4,000 bats . On a recent check , he counted 35 . <p> " That 's a good example of how devastated these bat populations are from white-nose syndrome . We 're talking 99 percent drops , " he said . <p> Even considering the population decline , the survey is a quiet one . Routes past an old barn and near wetlands produce few chirps from the computer speakers . <p> Imagine , he said , what a driving survey would have been like before the decline . <p> " It would have been crazy , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker so you could think straight . " <p> The survivors still show lesions on their wings and suffer from dehydration , which weakens the bats . <p> Biologists hope the survivors may have a natural resistance to the fungus that they can pass on to their offspring . <p> Even if that happens , it will take decades for the populations to recover to the numbers they had before the disease . Bats produce offspring when they are two or three years old , and only produce one child per year . <p> " We think it will take well beyond our lifetimes , " he said . <p> Call to action <p> Piece by piece , the data gathered by Mr. Fritsky and other biologists grows . What it says is part of what moves the state and federal governments to action . <p> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service leads a network of organizations , including the Pennsylvania Game Commission , that investigate the disease and try to manage it . Since 2008 , the service has granted more than $24 million to institutions and federal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A lot of it is finding out what we know , " said Greg Turner , a game commission biologist . <p> That information is gathered through methods like the survey Mr. Fritsky employed and other research , such as by tagging and tracking bats on airplanes to find their new roosting sites . <p> Besides studying the animals , the game commission also protects them . That involves buying land to protect the sites where bats hibernate and the maternity colonies where many females give birth . Other methods include building bat boxes , where the animals can sleep , or constructing bat-friendly barriers at existing colonies that do n't disturb the hibernation conditions but still keep out humans . <p> Sometimes , the computer identifies a bat as an especially rare one for the state . <p> When that happens , biologists set traps in the area to see if they can confirm the species is there . If the computer detects a federally protected Indiana bat , for example , and state biologists find one , they submit a record to a database called the Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a project , they must check their project boundaries against the inventory , which can create regulations for the work . <p> In the case of an Indiana bat , projects follow a summer timber cutting restriction because the bats roost in trees during the summer , Mr. Fritsky said . <p> Protecting an animal costs money for researchers to study and interpret data , for land purchases that protect or develop suitable habitat , and for initiatives that educate the public about that particular part of the ecosystem . <p> The game commission 's research informs its own decisions and the policy of other states . White-nose syndrome has n't advanced to some of them , so the Pennsylvania data gives them an idea of what to expect and a warning to start preparing . If they survey now , before the disease advances , they 'll have a baseline idea of what the population looks like . <p> The commission has been a major player in white-nose research since 2008 , Turner said , either by supporting other efforts or doing the actual research to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think there 's ever been a wildlife disease taken care of without a vaccine , and you ca n't vaccinate millions of bats , " Mr. Turner said .

 . <h> Article Tools <p> HARRISBURG A new federal overtime rule will offer some complications at the very least as officials look for ways to curb mounting costs for overtime pay for state government employees . <p> The update to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act will increase the amount of wages an employee must make to be exempt from receiving overtime pay . It doubles the annual salary limit at which companies may deny overtime pay from $23,000 to $47,000 , thus making millions of workers eligible for time and a half if they work more than 40 hours a week . <p> President Obama pushed for the rule , saying it will strengthen the middle class and help the economy grow for everyone . <p> Some 500,000 Pennsylvania workers in the $23,000 to $47,000 income category will be eligible for overtime when the rule takes effect Dec. 1 . <p> But whether they will all have an opportunity for overtime is uncertain . Employers could put limits on hours to make sure employees do n't exceed the 40-hour threshold or distribute workloads to reduce the need for overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's impact is focused on the private sector , it affects state government too . There are differing views regarding how much the impact will be . <p> Sen. Lisa Baker , R-20 , Lehman Twp. , thinks it could have a significant impact on the $31.5 billion state budget . Besides overtime work by state employees , the rule will apply to work done by state-hired contractors , she said . Of special concern are nonprofit employees who provide social services to the disabled and poor under state and county contracts . <p> Ms. Baker chaired a Senate Labor and Industry Committee hearing on the overtime issue in June . <p> " We anticipate the fiscal impact resulting from the FLSA overtime changes will be minimal to the commonwealth , " said Daniel Egan , spokesman for the Office of Administration . <p> The overtime rule will affect nearly 2,000 state employees in management positions or not represented by a union who earn less than $913 a week , he said . More than 82 percent of the nearly 80,000 state employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scheduled hours . <p> State agencies will have options to mitigate the need to pay overtime to the affected employees , added Mr. Egan . <p> Pennsylvania state workers took home a two-decade record-high $250 million in overtime pay in 2015 . Overtime pay increased $24 million or nearly 10 percent from 2014 , with the Corrections Department accounting for much of the increase . <p> Gov . Tom Wolf said last week his administration is looking for ways to reduce overtime costs as part of an overall effort to save costs . <p> Human service nonprofits were at the center of the nine-month budget stalemate in fiscal 2015-16 . They went without state aid for six months until an interim budget was passed and got by through reducing services , borrowing money and , in some cases , employee layoffs . <p> Now , nonprofits are worried about their ability to absorb higher costs for overtime paid to employees affected by the rule . <p> " The providers RCPA represents are 100 percent publicly funded or largely publicly funded , " testified Richard S. Edley , president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They are what is often referred to as the ' safety net ' providers . Unlike the commercial industry , they can not adjust their business model , raise prices and meet these mandates . " <p> He said the providers will respond by moving salaried employees to part-time status or changing them to hourly status to control overtime hours , reducing staff , eliminating supervisor positions or eliminating or reducing programs . <p> Ms. Baker is preparing legislation to take a first step to address the impact of the overtime rule .

Fenwick Cabel went to court and won once . <p> The Scranton woman , known to most as Madame Fenwick , ran a successful beauty empire , with salons around the region as well as the Fenwick Beauty School , 508 Lackawanna Ave . in Scranton . In 1952 , she was embroiled in a scandal over an unpaid speeding ticket that left her with a suspended driver 's license . She appealed the suspension , claiming her friend , a wealthy widow named Betty Seip , was the driver and promised to fix the ticket if Madame Fenwick claimed to be the driver . <p> After a rollicking , multiday hearing , Lackawanna County President Judge T. Linus Hoban overturned the hairdresser 's license suspension and declined to rule on who was actually behind the wheel of the speeding car . <p> Though far from , Madame Fenwick undoubtedly counted the ruling as a win . It did n't take long until she was back in court again , though . <p> In December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regina Zack , a supervisor at Fenwick Beauty School , on 11 criminal counts . All stemmed from allegations that the pair defrauded the government of about $700,000 by inflating the number of veterans who attended the school regularly , according to a Dec. 5 , 1955 , Scranton Times article . <p> The fraud revolved around the GI Bill , which provided money for veterans to further their education , among other things . Madame Fenwick and Ms. Zack were accused of submitting false forms to the Veterans Administration . Prosecutors said the school received $30,000 a month for veteran students who did n't attend classes regularly . <p> The indictment came nine months after Fenwick Beauty School was yanked from the list of approved schools for veterans hoping to pay for classes through the GI Bill . <p> The criminal trial began in March 1957 . Philip Maher , a representative of the Veterans Administration , testified that he visited the school on several occasions and believed it was poorly run . <p> " His testimony disclosed that Madame Fenwick and her supervisors and teachers failed to inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the March 27 , 1957 , Scranton Times article .

When Federal Judge Frederick V. Follmer asked the man how often students would leave and go see a movie , the veteran replied , " Oh , about twice a month . " <p> Mr. also said he would sign absent GI Bill students into class and confirmed that no records were kept for tardiness , the March 28 , 1957 , Scranton Times article reported . <p> Madame Fenwick took the stand in her own defense on March 30 , 1957 and explained that VA rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She also said she went to the VA in Wilkes-Barre to " straighten out irregularities called to the school 's attention " by the federal agency but left without getting any information , according to The Scranton Times ' coverage of the trial . <p> She also said she was rarely at the beauty school because she was conducting student interviews . She said she signed various papers for the VA but claimed she did n't know what she was signing . <p> The jury found Madame Fenwick guilty of nine counts , including submitting false records to the VA . Judge Follmer sentenced her to two years of probation and a $1,000 fine , far less than the five years in prison and $100,000 fine she faced . <p> " In pronouncing sentence , Judge Follmer said he understood Madame Fenwick 's financial situation was ' not too good ' and that there were mortgages against her business properties here and in Wilkes-Barre and Stroudsburg .

 . <h> Article Tools <p> In the last 15 seasons of IL baseball , 210 teams have taken the field on opening days , striving to win every time they crossed the lines . <p> Only two of them have won 90 times . <p> Both of them played here in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre . The 2002 Red Barons , and this year 's RailRiders , who started their quest for the franchise 's second Governor 's Cup on Wednesday night at Coca-Cola Park in Lehigh Valley . <p> Both won 91 games . Both played in what turned into the most competitive division in the league , and both wound up winning the North going away ; the Red Barons by four games over Buffalo , and the RailRiders by six over the IronPigs . <p> All this is why there is a more intriguing question than whether the 2016 RailRiders can still win the Governor 's Cup without most of the bullpen and the middle of the batting order and the league MVP that helped them get there : Are they or those ' 02 Red Barons more deserving of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in franchise history ? <p> For fun , let 's break it down , position by position . <p> First base : J.P . Roberge ( RB ) vs . Chris Parmelee ( RR ) <p> Roberge ( ) turned into a fine stick , clubhouse influence and especially defender during his season serving as the Red Barons ' underrated veteran presence . As good as the RailRiders have been defensively at first , Parmelee is n't the glove there Roberge was . But , Parmelee is a middle-of-the-order presence with the bat . Roberge was a bottom-of-the-order guy . SLIGHT EDGE : RailRiders . <p> Second base : David Doster ( RB ) vs . Donovan Solano ( RR ) <p> These two teams were so similar in so many ways , and these four players really typify that . It was difficult to watch Solano systematically pick apart the IL this season without being reminded of Doster . Solano had a .319 average and .785 OPS to Doster 's .290 and .774 , though , and had more homers and RBIs . Both so consistent , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Nick Punto ( RB ) vs . Pete Kozma ( RR ) <p> Again , very similar players . Supreme , top-of-the line defenders . Kozma is better with the glove , but not by much , and that 's saying something . Big difference here is Punto hit leadoff and ranked as one of the best in the league . Punto had an OBP more than .100 higher than Kozma , and he stole 42 bags . HEAVY EDGE : Red Barons <p> Third base : Chase Utley ( RB ) vs . Rob Refsnyder ( RR ) <p> Almost exactly the same situation : A prospect both teams really like offensively , playing a position at which they are n't a natural . Utley is an iconic player in franchise history , but even though he hit that season , he was a brutal defender . He did n't really become a franchise immortal until he dominated in 2003 . Refsnyder was probably a better defender at third by the end of 2016 than Utley was at the end of 2002 . Refsnyder also had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers skew this toward the Red Barons , but it 's closer than you 'd think . SLIGHT EDGE : Red Barons <p> Whatever you think of how things turned out with Byrd , he became a really solid player though , hardly a perfect one -- for the Red Barons , He hit .297 that year , and I do n't remember his average being that high . Valent was a good prospect at the time , but that was really a down season for him . He had to get hot late to hit .251 . Simply put , though , the best hitter in this group is Judge . The best defender is Williams . And Gamel won the IL MVP in 2016 . HEAVY EDGE : RailRiders <p> Catcher : Johnny Estrada ( RB ) vs . Gary Sanchez ( RR ) <p> Unashamedly , I offer that Utley is the best player I 've ever covered for an extended period , regardless sport . Sanchez might be No. 2 on that list . As good as Estrada was , and he was an All-Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baserunner or as it turned out the defender Sanchez blossomed into this season . HEAVY EDGE : RailRiders <p> Aven had pretty good pop back then for the RailRiders , but although Francia and Knupfer had some huge hits for the franchise , they and Salazar were better known for defense . Higashioka and Austin had breakthrough offensive seasons , though . Diaz is a tough out , too , as well as a prime utility man . HEAVY EDGE : RailRiders <p> As far as raw stuff goes , the RailRiders are better top to bottom . Green and Enns both had 1.52 ERAs this season . Severino was 8-1 , and I 'm not convinced Cessa is n't the best pitcher the RailRiders had despite all that . But the top four starters in the Red Barons ' rotation that season went 45-14 with a 3.28 ERA and 1.16 WHIP , throwing a lot more innings ( 532 ? to 314 ) than the RailRiders ' top four . SLIGHT EDGE : Red Barons <p> This is really where the Red were a lot better than everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so dominant in the eighth and Santiago in the ninth that they turned games into six-inning affairs . No question , the RailRiders pitchers have bigger fastballs , more dynamic stuff . But the Red Barons had veterans in the back end of the pen . SLIGHT EDGE : RailRiders <p> Conclusion : Those Red Barons had the advantage of time to cement their legacy . These RailRiders have not . Who knows what would happen if these teams could magically face each other in a series . The Red Barons largely relied on the art of pitching , while the RailRiders could blow teams away in the bullpen . The RailRiders would hit for more power , likely . The RailRiders would be more effective on the bases , probably . How similar were the results for these teams ? The Red Barons scored 50-some more runs , but both teams had a .732 OPS . <p> DONNIE COLLINS is a sports columnist for The Times-Tribune .

She found inspiration to join the fray after accompanying her sister-in-law to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting . <p> " It is pretty much a calling , believe it or not , for me , " Miss Battaglia said . " At the meeting , I was struck with this overwhelming desire to help people in recovery . <p> " It was something I never thought I would do , and my biggest road block with that desire was how I would be received if I 've never been through what they 're ( addicts ) going through , " she admitted . " I struggled with this roadblock of my mind for about eight months . When I discovered YPR , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May of this year . " <p> Door opened <p> Armed with a bachelor 's degree in life coaching and psychology from Liberty University , Miss Battaglia tackled the process head-on . She discovered YPR , a nonprofit national advocacy group founded in 2010 in Colorado , via Facebook . <p> She filled out an application online , interviewed over the phone , and completed online orientation to familiarize herself with the program . At that point , she reached out on social media and at church for others to join her cause . <p> One of the people who answered the call was Marvin McCloe , a 30-year-old Dickson City resident and former drug addict . He 's one of half a dozen or so members on Miss Battaglia 's team who work to spread the word about YPR . <p> He remembers clearly what it felt like to be in total despair , and hopes to save someone else from the hard lessons he 's learned . <p> " I felt like I was going to die if I did n't stop . I felt like I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCloe said , pointing to drinking , pills and smoking drugs as his downfall . " It was affecting my relationships , job , my communication with people . I was depressed , sad , lonely . <p> " ( Drugs have ) been around my whole upbringing , " Mr. McCloe added . " I hid who I am behind drugs . It was the cool thing to do . But they do n't tell you the part where you get hooked on it , when no one wants to be around you anymore , where you 're stuck in this maze and it 's hard to get out . " <p> His recovery started with daily prayer , he said , and as a couple days of sobriety turned into a week , he began to rebuild himself as a person . Now , Mr. McCloe cares for his son , is set to be married , remains active in church , and has held the same job for a while . <p> " I ca n't say I know what it is to be on heroin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. McCloe said . " Even if we can affect five , maybe ten percent of the population of Scranton , for them to see a different outlook and not hide from their problems behind drugs ... I just want to try to save even one person . " <p> As chapter lead , Miss Battaglia believes this goal can be accomplished by giving people a centralized organization of local resources for their variety of needs in addiction and recovery . <p> " My journey began to see what 's in place , " she said . " What we 're going to be doing is reducing stigma in the community and connecting resources regarding employment , housing , education , etc . There 's a lot , so my chapter will be the glue . " <p> She devotes hours a day to , whether it 's touring sober houses , developing monthly workshops , gathering information into a database or networking with other organizations in the recovery community . <p> " We 're going to tailor to the person 's needs , " Miss Battaglia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's there for the journey , walking side-by-side , meeting them where they 're at in sober houses or treatment centers . " <p> She plans to teach young people the life skills they failed to learn during their addiction , while also providing awareness in the school systems for students and parents . <p> " A lot of people that have been addicted through adolescence into their early twenties really do n't have the skills necessary to have a plan for themselves , " noted Mr. Harris . " We would come in to provide a support system to get plugged back into society . <p> " This could be our next senator , our next fire chief , " Mr. Harris added . " There 's so much potential there with these young people coming out of recovery . " <p> Potential is exactly what Miss Battaglia intends to salvage from what she sees as a growing drug problem in her adopted home of Scranton . Though she feels a bit out of her element , she 's dedicated to the cause , and knows the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you do what you 're supposed to do in life , things just happen really easily . It 's really odd , " Miss Battaglia laughed . " I had a two-second panic attack after I started the chapter , ' What am I doing ? I 've never done anything like this in my life . ' <p> " But this group is hard workers . They 're solid , " she said . " We 're ' open for business , ' so the next step is to get out in the community , get our faces out there , and let people know it 's a go-to for resources because of the relationships I 've been building .

Jurors will have to decide how much her pain and suffering should cost the hospital , he said . <p> Geisinger 's Scranton-based attorney , Mark T.

He also noted 15 million new jobs that have been created during President Barack Obama 's administration . <p> Mr. Pence teased Mr. Kaine , saying he and Mrs. Clinton used that line a lot . <p> That 's when they really got going . We took this from the Washington Post transcript of the debate : <p> Mr. Pence : Look , what what you all just heard out there is more taxes , $2 trillion in more spending , more deficits , more debt , more government . And if you think that 's all working , then you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the truth of the matter is , the policies of this administration , which Hillary Clinton and Sen.

A candidate injects Scranton into a presidential debate again . Not only that , he mentions it next to his home state . <p> A day later , CNBC columnist Jake Novak turned Mr. Pence 's Scranton name-drop into an intentional act an appeal to Scranton voters because the Trump campaign knows it can win the state if it can win Scranton and Lackawanna County . <p> On its face , the idea that if Mr. Trump can win Lackawanna County he can win Pennsylvania is almost undoubtedly true , but as often happens with national reporters , the nuance gets lost . <p> Mr. Novak also wrote that Scranton is " very close " to Reading . Maybe from his vantage point , but we found Reading is a drive from downtown Scranton , Philadelphia a drive . <p> As a famed New York sports announcer used to say , let 's go to the videotape . <p> If Mr. Trump wins Scranton and Lackawanna County , he probably will have won a landslide victory nationwide . <p> Since 1960 , when John F. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican has won Lackawanna only twice -- 1972 and 1984 . <p> In 1972 , President Richard M. Nixon routed Sen. George McGovern nationwide , winning 49 of the 50 states and Lackawanna by 13,073 votes . <p> In 1984 , President Ronald Reagan destroyed former Vice President Walter Mondale , also winning 49 of 50 states , and Lackawanna by 2,281 votes . <p> That 's it . <p> The county has gone with the winner of the presidential election 12 of 14 times since 1960 , missing only in 1980 ( President Jimmy Carter won the county , Ronald Reagan won the election ) and 1988 ( Michael Dukakis won the county , the first George Bush won the election ) . <p> Luzerne County is 14 for 14 since 1960 , and its accuracy actually goes back to 1932 . <p> Between 1932 and 1956 , Lackawanna also missed in 1952 , backing Democrat Adlai Stevenson while the nation went for Republican Dwight Eisenhower . <p> This says to us that perhaps Mr. Pence might have sounded more accurate if he said Wilkes-Barre instead of Scranton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since 2008 , Lackawanna County almost always has finished second behind Philadelphia in percentage of the vote that goes to the Democratic candidate . <p> That 's partly because the Democratic voter registration margin here is about 2.3 Democrats for every one Republican ( down from about 2.5 to 1 a year ago ) compared to 1.6 to 1 in Luzerne County . <p> President Obama walloped John McCain and then Mitt Romney in Lackawanna County by more than 26,000 votes both times . No doubt Vice President Joe Biden 's Scranton roots played a role , but Mr. Obama won Luzerne , which has far more voters , by about 11,000 in 2008 and only about 6,000 in 2012 . <p> Of course , you could also argue Mr. Pence should have mentioned Scranton . <p> Mr. Trump needs to cut down Mrs. Clinton 's margins in Lackawanna County , where Democrats dominate . <p> For example , the closest a Republican has come to winning Pennsylvania since President Bill Clinton 's 1996 election was 2004 when President George W.

" <p> Helen Lavelle , the firm 's CEO , has a relationship with the district attorney 's office and the county judicial system dating back 30 years , including putting together other substance-abuse education and awareness projects , Mr. Scanlon said . <p> When he started considering an opioid abuse awareness program , bringing Ms. Lavelle and her agency on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the office and their experience in dealing with drug and alcohol issues , he said . <p> He told the firm his office would commit up to $125,000 to the project , and " Heroin Hits Home " evolved from there in what Mr. Scanlon described as a fluid process . <p> Ms. Lavelle said that given the client and the type of project , the lack of a contract was not unusual for her firm . <p> " There are certain clients that we have done business with in the past , over the years , where there is a level of complete trust . ... Especially if it 's an advocacy situation like this is , we do n't require a contract , " she said . <p> Mr. Scanlon said he sees no downside in not having a contract . He also has not signed a contract with the agency for his political campaign , and so far neither party requested one , he said . <p> " I mean they 're not going to stiff the district attorney 's office , and I 'm certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If this was somebody we brought in from Florida and never had any dealings with before to design and do all this , maybe there would have had to have been concrete parameters . <p> " But in dealing with Helen and her team , I would call up there and say , ' I do n't like this , ' or , ' This has to change , ' or , ' Here are my concerns . ' Everything was just so easy , and I 'm not concerned in the least bit that there is not a contract . " <p> Others do n't share that view . <p> Mr. Kauffman , the Common Cause executive director , said contracts are necessary to ensure accountability . If he were a Lackawanna County official , he said , he would be pressing the district attorney for an explanation . <p> " The public has a right not only to make sure he acts as a good fiduciary of public funds , there ought to be right up front an understanding of what those funds are paying to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have contracts . " <p> County Controller Gary DiBileo , whose department audits accounts in the district attorney 's office , said he was unaware Mr. Scanlon had no contract with the Lavelle firm but called it concerning . <p> " I would think that a contract would be in order , " he said . <p> Mr. DiBileo said he will recommend to Mr. Scanlon that the district attorney 's office enter a contract with the agency and do the same with any firm it might select in the future to do similar work that is funded with drug forfeiture money . <p> Although it appears the controller 's office does not have purview over how the district attorney 's office spends those funds , Mr. DiBileo said , " We do believe he should enter into a contract with any firm he might be dealing with , especially here where the same firm is handling his campaign . I think that will alleviate any confusion between one aspect of their spending and their others . " <p> By statute , the controller 's confidential audit of expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sources of the " Heroin Hits Home " funding must be submitted to the state attorney general 's office , which in turn makes a confidential report to the state Legislature . <p> Asked about the absence of a contract for " Heroin Hits Home , " Chuck Ardo , spokesman for Attorney General Bruce Beemer , said in an email he did not have enough information to offer an opinion " on how and why the DA 's office chose the course it took , " but added : " Having an agreement in writing is always the best practice . " <p> The initiative kicked off with the activation of a website , , followed by an extensive public outreach campaign during which area residents have been bombarded with messages on television , outdoor media and social media , most featuring photos or footage of Mr. Scanlon . <p> Through mid-September , the four local network television affiliates alone broadcast 675 ads for " Heroin Hits Home , " according to the district attorney 's office . At least half of those aired for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional spot at no cost for every paid spot scheduled . <p> Similarly , for every paid billboard spot , the participating outdoor advertising companies agreed to donate space for two additional boards . <p> Mr. Scanlon defended his prominence in the media campaign , saying it is his job as the county 's top law enforcement officer to protect lives . Although someone else could have been the face of the campaign , he said , it would not have had the same impact as the district attorney " really ringing bells and screaming that we have to do something about this . " <p> " Having the district attorney behind it legitimizes the effort . It tells people how significant the problem truly is , " Mr. Scanlon said . <p> Dr. Baldino , the Wilkes professor , agreed the television ads in particular might not have carried the same weight without Mr. Scanlon . At the same time , because Mr. Scanlon knows he is a likely candidate , his presence opens the door for accusations that public money was expended for a political purpose , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would be saying , ' Avoid any appearance of impropriety . ... Do n't raise the possibility of calling into question your integrity , ' " Dr. Baldino said . <p> Mr. Scanlon said he and the Lavelle agency discussed at the outset the importance of maintaining a " bright line " between " Heroin Hits Home " and his pending political campaign . <p> An email exchange between Mr. Scanlon and the agency , which the district attorney released at the request of The Sunday Times , suggests there were still questions about the degree of separation as late as July 6 , a few days before the launch of " Heroin Hits Home . " <p> In an email to Ms. Lavelle , a member of the agency team working on the initiative passed along Mr. Scanlon 's concern that using his " political " photo and logo on the " Heroin Hits Home " website " may create an issue . " <p> Ms. Lavelle , in a response directed to Mr. Scanlon at a nongovernmental email address , strongly recommended " identifying you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity for residents to experience a direct connection to you , your name , your face , your brand as soon as possible , " she wrote . <p> " I defer to you on using the ' brand , ' " Mr. Scanlon wrote back . " If you say it 's OK , I 'm good with that . " <p> Mr. Scanlon conceded others may see it differently but said the exchange concerned his " brand " as district attorney , not as a candidate . <p> It speaks directly to the fact that " everyone needs to know this is the district attorney 's office saying we have a damn crisis on our hands , and if you have problem , see us , " he said . <p> Gene Talerico , the former first assistant district attorney who is expected to oppose Mr. Scanlon for the GOP nomination in the primary , said no one would dispute that opioid addiction is a critical problem or that educating the public about it is a laudable objective . <p> The email exchange , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mix inappropriately politics and public awareness , he said . <p> " There is verbiage from folks in the confines of a political campaign that says the goal is not to miss an opportunity to draw a connection to a face and a brand , " Mr. Talerico said . " Until there is an adequate explanation for that intention and motive , that remains a consistent question : What is the true motivation ? " <p> Ms. Lavelle said she is confident neither Mr. Scanlon nor her agency crossed an ethical line . In her former position as chairwoman of the American Advertising Federation 's Council of Governors , she said , she helped the organization 's 50,000 members navigate ethical practices and government relations issues . <p> " You 're looking at someone who is really aware of the line , who is really aware of what my responsibilities are ethically , and there is absolutely no breach of ethics here at all , " she said . <p> Mr. Scanlon said if he had not been appointed district attorney but had taken office in January after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have undertaken " Heroin Hits Home " and he would have done it the same way . <p> " I have no concerns , " he said .

Describing it as one of the most difficult poems he has written , Mr. Fanelli said the piece draws on the death of his father , Frank , and " some of the anger I felt after he passed away when I was a young guy in college , trying to process that grief and also ... these big questions we ask : What is my faith ? What do I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really one of the most confessional , exploratory poems I 've ever written , " Fanelli said . " It was really difficult to write . " <p> The Scranton native drew on other elements of his life , his experience growing up in the city , broader issues and recent events such as economic inequality and the troubles in Ferguson , Missouri for the new collection , which New York Quarterly Books published last month . Some poems are " very specific to this area , " Mr. Fanelli said , and local audiences will relate to them . <p> A two-time Pushcart Prize nominee who now lives in Dunmore , Mr. Fanelli earned a master 's degree in fine arts from Wilkes University and a doctorate from Binghamton University .

" I think I really took my time with this . " <p> " All That Remains " helped him land readings in New York City , New Jersey and Philadelphia and put him in touch with what he called " the broader literary community in the tri-state area . " Mr. Fanelli will build on that with his new tour , which included a stop in Scranton last week and will take him back to New York and Philadelphia plus Boston , Harrisburg , Reading and Lancaster . <p> Poetry 's oral tradition traces back to Homer in ancient Greece , Mr. Fanelli pointed out , and he believes writers today need to share their work at readings . He expects that people who attend his readings will learn more about his upbringing , some of his beliefs and a little bit about his past relationships . <p> " I love getting out there and reading in front of people , " he said .

I 'm sure you 've all seen local celebrations that shared the title , but in truth , they are just celebrations of the real one that happens in Munich . Oh , and the original celebration had a lot more to do with horses than beer . And , no , the horses were n't drinking . <p> Oktoberfest traces back to 1810 , when King Ludwig I married Princess Therese of , and they held some horse races to celebrate . It was fun enough that they decided to repeat it the next year and most every year since , barring time off for war and disease . They also started sampling beer and added swings , tree climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hell of a party . Toward the end of the 19th century , they started serving bratwurst and beer in glass mugs . It started to look like the Oktoberfest we know and love . <p> The beer we refer to as Oktoberfest is actually called Marzen , whose name comes from the German for " March , " when its brewers traditionally made it . Marzen was , like many things , an invention of necessity . Unlike most lagers , Marzen was made to last a bit , as brewing used to be forbidden in the summer . <p> Brewing in hot weather was risky business . Higher temperatures provide a great environment for nasty organisms to colonize , nothing anyone wants . To avoid that , brewers made Marzen in March and drank it until the cooler temperatures came back . <p> Marzen and Oktoberfest became tightly linked since the celebration serves Marzen . The beer generally ages in cellars until late summer , with the last of the bottles served during the festival . That aside , I enjoy Marzen just because it is delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lagers go , it <p> is one of the best . I always grab a few every September to sample before pumpkin beer kicks it all off the shelves . <p> This week , I had a bottle of Dominion 's Octoberfest to celebrate . The golden orange color had a slight head . It was the perfect shade and smelled of malt more than anything else . There was a bit of caramel and a little bit of floral hops . The lager yeast also came through in the nose . <p> The brew tasted just like it should . It was like drinking a pretzel . The malt was in the forefront , making each swallow delicious and savory . It has a slightly sweet finish with a hint of caramel . It was enough to cut the savory but not enough to be a turn-off . <p> This beer was n't really a variant on the theme , but it does n't need to be . It 's a solid Marzen that does exactly what it should .

But King said that was the first time he 'd become aware of the plan , when an already-completed championships memo with the meet 's information was presented . <p> He was also unaware of course previews being held at Elk Lake in past seasons -- King said the practice was n't allowed when the meet was held at Scranton Municipal Golf Course , and he never knew of the change after Elk Lake took over . <p> So , the availability of a preview day was put to vote when the district committee heard of it . King said that while he understands coaches would like to see the course beforehand , concerns of liability issues were raised by district members . <p> " What if kids show up without coaches ? And who 's going to show them what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King said . " That led to a decision by the committee . " <p> Ultimately , the committee vote unanimously against allowing a walk-through day . <p> Lake-Lehman coach John Sobocinski said his school sent Elk Lake a liability form before touring the course in years past . He said he 'd have no problem doing the same for Lakeland . <p> " We made a night of it . We 'd come up , we 'd stop on the way back for pizza , " Sobocinski said . " The kids liked it , and I found myself at peace because the kids knew the course .

There 's also a window between 10-11:15 a.m. on race day teams can tour the course . <p> A downside , Sobocinski said , is that by only seeing a course map before Wednesday 's meet , course-specific training opportunities may be missed . If a team knows there 's a challenging hill in the final mile of a race , it can alter practices to get ready for that late-race grind . <p> " It 's such a mental sport .

As recipients show up , volunteers guide them through the process of gathering the 30-pound turkeys and canned goods and pies that will fill their dinner table the next day . <p> Schiff 's Food Service has helped with the program since its early days . It orders most of the food , stores it in its Taylor warehouse and donates its time and some of the produce . The man behind the ordering , general sales manager Ryan Yeager , started volunteering with the program as a kid and today organizes and directs the volunteers during the giveaway , a job he took over last year . <p> " It 's good to give back to the community , " he said . <p> Now in its 30th year , the program started as a family project after Jim and Mary Lou Burne saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they learned she and many others could not provide Thanksgiving meals for their families , the Burnes asked 50 of their friends to donate $25 which would cover the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for a family and to in turn ask one of their friends to donate as well .

And there to help are everyday community members , students from more than a dozen local schools and even people who , at the end of the day , get in line because they need one of the meals , too . <p> When he started volunteering as a high school freshman , attorney Joe Price recalled , " the operation was still large-scale , but now there 's so many more people coming through .

Anyone can show up to help , and many have done so year after year for decades . <p> Volunteers begin the day unloading the trucks around 5:30 a.m. , because people start picking up dinners at 9 .

 . <h> Article Tools <p> American consumers can drive a hard bargain when shopping for big-ticket items such as cars , appliances and home improvement . Yet , few price out an increasingly expensive item : health care . <p> Some health care providers and insurers are trying to change that . <p> " When you think about it , what other industry do you interact with where you do n't know the cost of something before you agree to have it done ? " asked Stacy Byers , director of digital marketing for Highmark Blue Cross/Blue Shield . " If I take my car to a mechanic , he may say it looks like it will be this much , do you want me to do it ? ... Health care is the last thing I can think of where we do n't have that kind of clarity . " <p> Highmark and three other large health insurers , Aetna , United Health Care and Cigna , created online cost estimators that allow their subscribers to compare prices among various providers . <p> The tools estimate costs based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copays and coinsurance to provide a total out-of-pocket estimate for hundreds of procedures . <p> For Aetna , United Health Care and Cigna , the estimates include the physicians ' charge and other services that may be associated with a given procedure , including anesthesia , X-ray , pathology services and use of the facility at which the procedure is performed . Highmark 's estimate includes associated charges other than the facility fee . Ms. Byers said the insurer is working to improve the tool to include that information . <p> Geisinger Health System also has a cost estimator , " My Estimate , " that allows clients of several major health insurers to obtain an estimate of a procedure at any of the system 's hospitals in Scranton , Plains Twp. and Danville . It also provides a general estimate if the procedure is at an outpatient family practice , but does not specify a list of providers . <p> Geisinger and the insurance companies developed the tools several years ago to increase awareness of price disparities and help patients make more-informed decisions . <p> " Providers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Charity Boutte , director of core transparency products for Aetna . " That 's why it 's so important to use this tool . " <p> Closing a gap <p> Online cost estimators provide valuable information , but only a handful of insurers offer the tool . <p> Several websites seek to breach that gap through programs that allow patients to get cost estimates for a particular medical procedure within a specific ZIP code . <p> Advocates caution that the national cost estimators have limits . They can give patients a general idea of what they might expect to pay , but are not specific to each patient . <p> " It gives you a benchmark ... but that does n't tell you which provider offers the best price , " said Lynn Quincy , associate director of health reform policy for Consumers Union in Washington , D.C. <p> Patients who do not have access to cost estimators can try to get an estimate by calling their insurance company or medical provider . However , that may be easier said than done , advocates say . <p> " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a straight answer , " Ms. Quincy said . " They are not set up to give price quotes . They will say it depends on how long you are there . " <p> Staying informed <p> There are ways to help improve the odds of getting accurate information . <p> A guide published by the Healthcare Financial Management Association recommends patients obtain as much information as possible in advance from the health care provider or insurance company , including medical procedure codes . However , the association warns that can be tricky because there are dozens of different codes that can apply to a given procedure . Often the provider wo n't know which one to submit until the procedure begins . <p> Patients also need to recognize they may incur charges from a variety of providers for a single service . For example , a patient who goes in for an endoscopy or colonoscopy will incur charges from the doctor who performs the procedure , the anesthesiologist and the pathologist who examines any collected specimens . There also may be a separate charge for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's unlikely you can figure out all the providers that will touch your case before you are done ... ( and ) figure out who you will get charges from , " Ms. Quincy said . <p> Deborah Chollet , Ph.D. , a health insurance researcher with Mathematica Policy Research in Washington , D.C. , wants more states to follow the initiatives of Vermont , New Hampshire and Colorado , which developed statewide cost estimators . <p> " All insurers in the state report what they pay for a service , " Dr. Chollet said . " You can see a price comparison on the state 's website . " <p> Those efforts increased transparency , but the bottom line is patients need to be their own advocates when it comes to purchasing health care . <p> " Doctors do n't think in terms of what it 's going to cost you out-of-pocket , " Ms. Quincy said . " Whoever is directing your treatment overall , tell them you face a high deductible and need help to find affordable service .

The religiously affiliated organization , whose origins trace back to 1865 England , uses the money raised during the six-week campaign that leads up to Christmas to provide services to people in need . The funds ensure local children receive Christmas gifts , but the proceeds also feed the hungry and keep the heat on for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract between utility company UGI and the Salvation Army . <p> The bell-ringing serves as the group 's largest single fundraiser of the year , though the programs benefit area residents throughout the year . <p> At the Scranton outpost on South Washington Avenue , up to 36 clients sit down for appointments each week to explain their hardships and seek help . The staff addresses food issues in the morning and utility shut-off notices in the afternoons . <p> This year 's fundraising goal is $175,000 , said Capt . Lawrence Shurtleff , the commanding officer for Scranton Citadel Corps . He 's been stationed in the Electric City for three years with his wife , Jeny , also a captain in the office , but has observed the red-kettle campaign for each of his 37 years . Raised as an Army brat and a military veteran himself , Capt . Shurtleff is in the fifth generation of his family to serve in the Salvation Army ( his four children , ages 3 to 13 , represent the sixth ) . <p> He described how the Scranton location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , noting that " people come to us at the bottom , because they need help getting up the hill . " <p> " You get real strong cases , where they were at rock bottom , and they tell their stories and tears start flowing and they ca n't get through it . There 's gratitude , " Capt . Shurtleff said . " Clients we deal with have a certain amount of pride and do n't want to ask for help , so when they get to us , it 's a last measure . " <p> The biggest misconception about the money gathered in red kettles is that it goes to bigger cities or neighboring states , he added , but it really remains with people in Lackawanna County , where plenty of need exists . <p> Scranton resident John Harrison understands how it feels to be on the receiving end of the Salvation Army 's help , having been a client this past summer and fall following a four-year prison stint . Come this bell-ringing season , he 'll know what it is to volunteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , and they literally helped me out when no one else would , " Mr. Harrison , 32 , said . " They 've helped me out with food and getting work clothes , transportation , furniture in the apartment . <p> " I just started volunteering by giving time back . I always wanted a way to help others in need , and they gave it to me . It gives me a sense of purpose , an ability to reach out to other people where people reached out to me . I 'm more outgoing and more willing to help . It 's been all kinds of blessings for me . " <p> Aside from any monetary donations , the Salvation Army sorely needs more volunteers to maximize its coverage at its 25 bell-ringing spots in Scranton , Taylor and Dickson City . Capt . Shurtleff estimated that each station had full coverage throughout the 10-hour bell-ringing day for only three days of last year 's entire season . <p> " I ca n't imagine what would happen if we had them all covered every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " <p> Volunteers come from all ages , races , genders and beliefs .

" <p> Whether they dress in costume , sing carols , play music on a stereo or simply maintain a friendly smile , volunteers need only some charisma and a desire to help in order to succeed . Capt . Shurtleff plays tuba whenever he mans the kettle , but he said people of all abilities can make a difference . <p> " Our volunteers ca n't wait to help . Many count down to it , " he said .

He counts his blessings for always having a roof over his head , food in his belly and an education others did n't receive . <p> " I was growing up in an atmosphere where people were helping me , " Mr. Via said . " I was helped when I was little . I was n't homeless , and they made sure I was n't homeless , so I think now it 's my turn .

The issues prompted police to file multiple complaints with the state 's Judicial Conduct Board . <p> Details of the allegations against Mr. Mikulak remained secret until Monday , when Mr. Donahue attached a copy of Ms. Edwards ' letter to Judge Hamill to his motion to dismiss . <p> The letter cites a litany of alleged improper behavior , including that he : <p> * Pressured police officers to allow motorists charged with speeding to plead to a lesser charge .

Ms. Edwards confirmed complaints were made against Mr. Mikulak but did not address whether she felt he was biased .

 . <h> Article Tools <p> Let 's get this much straight : If Penn State finished 11-1 and won its conference , its fans would n't want a 10-2 team that won another conference to get into the College Football Playoff ahead of it . <p> Remember that . <p> Because , what 's fair is fair , and Sunday afternoon , the College Football Playoff committee may not have done the right thing or the correct thing , but it did do the fair thing . <p> It placed unbeaten Alabama , and the three Power 5 conference teams that finished with one loss , into the four-team tournament that will decide the 2016 national champion . <p> That Penn State is not one of those teams can and almost assuredly will be debated for as long as there is Nittany Lions football . But these No. 5 Nittany Lions are going to the Rose Bowl against No. 9 USC , and that should hardly be considered a disappointment . It 's a 99.9th percentile result , in fact . It 's the granddaddy of them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's goal . And like most goals worth having . <p> But let 's break this down , CFP participant by CFP participant . Which one should be left out so Penn State can get in ? <p> ? Alabama ? The Crimson Tide are No. 1 in the nation , won their conference handily , and are undefeated . Even in a shaky SEC , and even in college football in a day and age where losses do n't doom champions like they used to , there 's a big difference between an unbeaten Power 5 team and a two-loss Power 5 team , resume-wise . <p> ? Ohio State ? OK , so Penn State beat the Buckeyes . And it 's a worthy debate whether Ohio State really is as good as its perception indicates . It struggled with Northwestern . It came a failed two-point conversion against Michigan State away from losing . It probably got handed the Michigan game through the Wolverines ' poor play in the clutch . It could n't even get into the game Penn State won Saturday night . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranked in the top 10 of the CFP rankings . Penn State has two . <p> The Buckeyes have only lost once . Penn State has lost twice . <p> And it 's not like there are four unbeaten teams plowing through power conferences . A one-loss season , in a conference like the Big Ten , is a pretty impressive thing , conference title or not . <p> ? Clemson ? This has been a top-five team pretty much all season . It won its conference . Sure , the ACC is n't the Big Ten . But , Clemson has one loss by three points to Pitt . <p> Penn State has two losses a three-point loss to Pitt in addition to a 39-point loss to Michigan . <p> ? Washington ? This is a team that worked its way into the top four , won its conference impressively , and had just one loss . <p> Sure , the Huskies are n't a team that can match Penn State 's top-10 wins , and the Pac-12 championship does n't and should n't carry the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a team devoid of impressive wins . It blasted No. 8 Colorado in the Pac-12 title game . It beat ranked Utah . It crushed ranked Washington State . It dismantled Stanford . <p> It played its schedule . It won rather impressively , week after week . It won a Power 5 conference . At some point , the fair thing to do is take a team like that , because those are largely the attributes Penn State fans are asking the committee to understand about their team . <p> Instead , Penn State will go to the Rose Bowl . It will play USC , a team getting some push to have been ranked higher . A team that , like Penn State , has n't lost since September and has been coming into its own . It would be a terrific game , a tremendous challenge for a young Penn State team looking to cap off a magical season in the best way possible . <p> Some will say that , for one of the few times ever , the Rose is not the best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a young team , with almost everybody returning next year . <p> This team has a legitimate shot -- Big Ten East or not , Michigan or not , Ohio State or not -- of competing for the College Football Playoff again next year . Maybe , having that carrot dangling in front of them is n't the worst thing for this program , which has developed so much more quickly than anybody could have imagined these last two months . <p> DONNIE COLLINS is a sports columnist for The Times-Tribune .

The postmarks -- Honolulu , Hawaii , at 6 p.m. on Dec. 6 , 1941 -- foretell a date , a place and a tragedy Americans would soon know too well . <p> About 14 hours later , shortly before 8 a.m. on Dec. 7 , 1941 , Seaman 2nd Class Walter Joseph Paciga would be aboard the USS West Virginia when the Japanese surprise attack on the Pacific fleet moored in the tranquil waters of Pearl Harbor thrust the United States into World War II . <p> He did not survive . <p> The only person from Lackawanna County believed to have been killed at Pearl Harbor , Seaman Paciga became the county 's first casualty of a war that would claim more than 400,000 American lives over the next four years . <p> Early life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paciga comes from a handful of cards , letters and other documents , along with the sometimes vague and often conflicting recollections of family . <p> He was born in Simpson on Feb. 8 , 1918 , the third child and second son of Thomas Sr. and Regina Pavlica Paciga . Both his parents immigrated to the United States from Austria , although when and how they arrived is not clear . <p> Thomas Paciga Jr. , 84 , Walter 's only surviving sibling , said his father already was living in Simpson by the time his parents were married in Chicago sometime before their first child , Agnes , came along in early 1915 . <p> Thomas Sr. worked as a laborer in the anthracite coal mines while Regina , eight years younger than her husband , tended to their family , which would grow to include four boys and four girls . <p> Early in their marriage , they lived on Homestead Street in what Thomas Jr . described as a small cabin . It was there the older children , including Walter , were born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home was destroyed in a fire accidentally started by Walter and his next oldest brother , Joseph . <p> " The story is the two boys , Walter and Joe , were playing and they knocked over a lantern and burned the house down , " said Walter 's niece , Kathi Weber of Richmondale . <p> Needing shelter quickly , Thomas Sr. ordered a kit through the Sears , Roebuck and Co. catalog and put up a small house up at 17 Reservoir St. The family lived there while Thomas Sr. built a second , larger house next door at 15 Reservoir , near the intersection with Tuttle Street . <p> In early 1937 , Regina Paciga died while giving birth to her ninth child . The baby , a boy , also died . <p> Leaving home <p> With the nation in the throes of the Great Depression , many families in Simpson struggled in the 1930s , and the Paciga household was not immune . <p> Thomas Paciga Jr. , who was 3 when his mother passed away , said his father was a good man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to his children . He believes his three oldest siblings -- Agnes , John and Walter all left home by the time his mother died or shortly after , whether by their own volition or because his father ordered them out . <p> With his father the family 's sole caretaker after his mother 's death , Thomas Jr . suspects it may have been the latter . <p> " I think they were just told to leave , " he said . " Otherwise , the family could n't exist . " <p> Although the reasons are not clear , Walter Paciga had a falling-out with his father around that time , and he apparently had limited contact with the family in the years that followed , said Thomas Jr. , who has no personal memory of his brother . <p> By his late teens , Walter was living in Chicago , where the family had relatives . <p> Although he attended Fell Twp. schools , Walter never received a high school diploma . He found work in Chicago as a salesman for the Fuller Brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to California . <p> A brief essay about Pearl Harbor and her brother 's death prepared in the 1990s by Mrs. Weber 's mother , Jean Paciga Rupp , who was known as Virginia in her youth , says Walter signed his enlistment papers in California in 1939 . <p> However , an application for military death benefits filed by Thomas Sr. in 1950 indicates his son entered active service at San Diego on Oct. 4 , 1940 . That was 14 months before Pearl Harbor . <p> Cards back home <p> The four Christmas cards Walter Paciga is known to have mailed in Hawaii the day before his death three to siblings , the other to his father each contain undated handwritten notes of varying lengths , all rendered in neat cursive with occasional misspellings and skipped words . <p> In likely deference to military censors , he makes no reference to the Navy or to his life as a sailor . <p> " I bet you all wonder why I do n't write . Well , there ( is ) a long story to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister , Martha , before urging her to keep her future correspondence " a little social ( if ) you know what I mean . " <p> As he wished the recipients a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and expressed his hope to see them again , he also raised the mysterious rift with his father . The words hint at regret . <p> " I bet Dad does n't like me very much , " he wrote in the card to Martha . " I know ( I 've ) been a bad boy . " <p> He used similar language in his card to Thomas Jr. , then 9 . <p> " Hiya dear Brother , " he said . " Well , I hope you 'll be a good boy and do n't take the steps I took .

" She rested outboard of the USS Tennessee with 40 feet of water beneath her keel , making her an inviting target for the Japanese . <p> Just before 8 a.m. , seven 18-inch torpedoes ripped into the West Virginia 's port side , seriously damaging the battleship . Two bombs later hit , although at least one fell unexploded . <p> As the West Virginia started to list dangerously , Lt.

Volunteers later returned to battle the flames , which continued to burn for nearly 30 hours . <p> Walter Paciga was among the more than 100 crew members who perished . <p> More losses <p> The Paciga family eventually received confirmation of Walter 's death from the U.S. Department of War . Thomas Jr . recalls it came via a telegram , although the date is not known . <p> In her essay , Jean Rupp says the family was notified in the first week of January 1942 . <p> Mrs. Weber , Mrs. Rupp 's daughter and Walter 's niece , said the story she heard is the family did not know for certain her uncle had been killed at Pearl Harbor until years after , although they always suspected the worst because there was no communication . <p> " They probably figured it when they did not hear from him , " she said . <p> However , Lackawanna County records show Thomas Sr. filed an application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register of wills office on March 25 , 1942 . The document indicates Walter had less than $1,000 in assets . <p> Regardless of when the news arrived , it came as a blow to a family already dealing with tragedy after Walter 's sister , Rose Marie , died in December 1941 , at age 18 , of a liver ailment . <p> Another would follow before the end of the war . Walter 's younger brother , Joseph , who had enlisted in the Marine Corps in March 1942 , was killed in action March 2 , 1945 , during the battle of Iwo Jima . He was 24 . <p> Both brothers were awarded posthumous Purple Hearts . <p> In November 1945 , when Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 4712 was organized in Simpson , it was named for Walter Paciga . <p> Double funeral <p> Walter was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu until 1948 , when his father decided to bring both his and Joseph 's bodies back to Simpson for a double funeral . <p> The family held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reservoir St. Thomas Jr. , who retired in 1989 as a school teacher in Callicoon , New York , now lives there with his wife , Veronica . <p> Navy Chief Petty Officer Daniel Marsalla and Marine Corps Sgt.

Thomas Jr . recalls the honor guards remained on duty at the home throughout the night until the caskets were removed to Holy Trinity Church for Mass the following morning . <p> Small black and white snapshots taken at the time show a large crowd outside the home . <p> " Simpson made a pretty big deal out of it , " Kathi Weber said of the funeral . " The whole town came out . " <p> Thomas Jr . said he most remembers the mourners processing to Holy Trinity . <p> " There was a long line behind the hearse of people walking to the church , " he said .

Its origin , like so many details of Walter 's short life , is wreathed in uncertainty , lost to the passing of time and memory . <p> Mrs. Weber said when her mother , Jean Rupp , moved back to Simpson from New York City in 1969 , the first thing she did was join the VFW auxiliary , intent on making sure Walter was remembered . She served for several years as the auxiliary president and always made it a point to get her family to Memorial Day services at the post . <p> In December 1991 , Mrs. Rupp and her sister , Martha Epps , went to Hawaii for the 50th anniversary observance at Pearl Harbor . <p> " She kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Weber said her mother , who died in 2001 .

( read more ) <h> Article Tools <p> JESSUP Throughout the process that brought an Invenergy power plant to the borough , plant opposition group Citizens for a Healthy Jessup implored borough council to take steps to protect residents in the event the plant brings down property values . <p> The group revived this argument in light of a November deal reached between Invenergy and the town of Burrillville , Rhode Island , that includes a property value guarantee agreement . Invenergy wants to build a 1,000-megawatt power plant in the Rhode Island community . <p> Jessup officials maintain there is nothing to suggest the Lackawanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an agreement was " not applicable " to the situation in Jessup . <p> Other terms of the Burrillville agreement , including the payout , have members of Citizens again questioning whether or not Jessup was shortchanged . <p> Jessup solicitor Richard Fanucci , who negotiated the host agreement , and other officials continue to argue that , when comparing " apples to apples , " Jessup secured one of the most lucrative deals in the country . <p> While Jessup 's is a done deal , Citizens remains vocal so other communities that may eventually host power plants , like Archbald , are prepared . <p> Property protection <p> While an study did not suggest the proposed Burrillville plant negatively would affect property values , Invenergy offered property owners living as far away as 1.2 miles from the proposed plant property value protection agreements in case of diminution . <p> Under these agreements , certain Burrillville property owners in the vicinity of the plant will be compensated if their property sells for less than an initial appraisal . Moreover , Invenergy will pay eligible homeowners $1,500 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain conditions . <p> " One of the things the town negotiated and felt very strongly about was the addition of the property value guarantee , " said Dyana Koelsch , a spokeswoman for Burrillville Town Council . " So , the town pushed for that piece on the request from the residents of town who felt very concerned that the values may drop . " <p> Members of Citizens take this as proof that property value diminution is a legitimate concern . They regularly argued at Jessup council meetings that scholarly studies showed a correlation between power plants and reduced property values relying heavily on two studies by Lucas Davis , one published by Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2008 , and another published by the University of California Berkeley in 2010 . <p> " When you have made the case repeatedly by providing peer-reviewed , scholarly research that said property values are a concern ... and then Invenergy and their counsel ... dismiss it , then you see Invenergy give that property value protection to another community . ... How 's that possible ? " Citizens member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the Davis studies " completely non-credible " in that they were based upon " self-reported " home values , not upon " any empirical studies or actual appraisals . " <p> Ultimately Jessup relied on Invenergy 's report and testimony from two expert witnesses provided by the developer , and determined that property values were unlikely to decrease because of the plant . <p> " ( Citizens for a Healthy Jessup ) never produced any evidence , " Mr. Fanucci said . " If there was any merit to the argument that property values would depreciate , I 'm sure they would have found someone local who would have given such an opinion . " <p> Moreover , Mr. Fanucci maintains that , after studying property protection guarantees elsewhere , such agreements were not applicable in Jessup because of the power plant 's geographic location . <p> Apples and oranges ? <p> Jessup officials argue that comparing their agreement to Burrillville 's is not comparing " apples to apples , " because of stark differences in tax structures , regulatory schemes , energy markets and the different state laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community host agreement , which is fundamentally different from the payment in lieu of taxes ( PILOT ) agreement Burrillville secured . Because of the high tax rates in states like Rhode Island , developers enter into tax reduction agreements with host communities to incentivize development . <p> While the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board ultimately decides whether the plant may be built on the isolated area in the tiny state 's northwest corner , Burrillville controls its taxes . <p> Because power plants use staggeringly expensive equipment to generate electricity , and Rhode Island taxes personal property , such as equipment , paying the default rate makes it difficult to stay in business , so they are allowed to negotiate tax terms . <p> At the default rate , Invenergy likely would have paid millions of dollars more in taxes annually . On the other hand , Burrillville benefits by having a chance to apply its own stipulations to the agreement , and gains control over any loopholes the company might use to get out of paying taxes altogether . <p> The tax agreement Burrillville negotiated ensures tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year , depending on the price of electricity and the type of plant that is ultimately built . The tax receipts increase by 2.5 percent annually . <p> Jessup 's $1 million host agreement , which increases 10 percent every decade , represents a voluntary agreement that council included as a condition of Invenergy 's conditional use permit . Pennsylvania law does not mandate power plant developers enter into host agreements . <p> " You can not compare other states with Pennsylvania , " said Mr. Fanucci . " Rhode Island is one of the highest taxing rates in the country . ... Their whole structure on how they go about approving these things is completely different . " <p> Citizens does n't deny the differences between the states , but believes Jessup should have pursued a payout based on the megawatt output of the plant . Megawatts are where Invenergy will realize its profits , so , the group argues , size and output should have influenced payout . <p> " We wholeheartedly agree that different states have different tax regulations , " said Citizens member Tom Fiorelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligence we retained professional , independent consultation from Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services , who advised us that it is completely appropriate and acceptable to craft a host agreement based on the size of the facility . " <p> " We did that to provide council with a tool , " Mr. Petrochko said . " They took nearly an hour of time attempting to discredit what we bought for them . ... What they did , in essence , is the work of the people sitting on the other side of the table . " <p> Mr. Fanucci maintains there is no precedent anywhere suggesting that a host agreement payout should be based on megawatt output . <p> By the numbers <p> Burrillville expects its tax agreement to net between $92 million and $182 million over 20 years , while Mr. Fanucci estimates total payouts from the Jessup plant will total about $86.2 million over 45 years -- a combination of host agreement receipts and taxes . <p> Jessup will receive $2.5 million in guaranteed initial operating period and construction period payments , the first $250,000 of which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial fees . <p> The host agreement alone should net Jessup about $56.2 million over 45 years , Mr. Fanucci estimates . The Jessup plant property 's tax exempt status expires in 2023 . The property will then be taxed based on the assessed valuation as determined by the Lackawanna County Assessors Office , which has yet to be determined . <p> Assuming an assessed valuation of $4.1 million and current tax rates , the borough would collect $3.5 million , and Valley View School District $17.2 million , in taxes over 45 years , according to Mr. Fanucci . <p> Numbers crunched by Jessup 's engineering firm KBA suggest total tax and host payouts will garner Jessup between $1.1 million and $1.5 million per year for town functions , depending on the property assessment . In Burrillville , where the town 's school system accounted for 65 percent of its budget this year , a $5 million Invenergy payout would leave about $1.75 million per year for town functions . <p> Negotiating strength <p> Communities that do n't want a power plant have a built-in advantage in negotiating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation in Rhode Island . <p> In a September blog post , Mr. Elmer notes that Burrillville officials seemed supportive of Invenergy 's project at first . The town since has come out in opposition to the plant a luxury afforded by the state siting board 's sweeping authority . Ms. Koelsch , Burrillville Town Council spokeswoman , said the town actually is using some of its initial fees Invenergy is paying per the tax agreement to beef up its legal defense to fight the project . <p> Mr. Fanucci said Jessup never had that luxury , starting with Invenergy 's initial challenge to the borough 's zoning code . <p> " When council heard that application , they were sitting in what is a quasi-judicial capacity , like a zoning board , " Mr. Fanucci said . " They had to do what is right , they had to be fair and impartial . They were put in a position where they could n't be oppositional . Even if they hated the project , they had to be fair and impartial . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passed , permitting power plants , Jessup could do little besides negotiate in good faith with the developer . Council President Randy Santarelli remains adamant that the borough did everything it could to protect residents , and calls the notion that council wanted the plant a common misconception . <p> " If somebody had come here five years ago and said ' Hey , do you guys want a power plant ? ' I do n't think anyone sitting behind that table would have said ' Oh , yeah . How do we do that ? ' " Mr. Santarelli said .

Because of that , Mr. Black remained on the job and continued to abuse other inmates until 2013 , when an investigation was launched after another inmate accused him of abuse . <p> Mr. Black pleaded guilty in 2015 to sexually abusing five inmates and was later sentenced to 45 months to eight years in prison . <p> The Times-Tribune does not identify victims of sexual assault . <p> In a reply filed last week , Ms. Calpin 's attorney , Cynthia Pollick , says the county , not Ms. Calpin , is to blame for allowing Mr. Black to remain on the job so long . <p> Ms. Pollick says prison officials first learned of allegations made by the woman who spoke to Ms. Calpin in January 2011 when a Scranton police officer reported she made a similar comment to him while he was transporting her . <p> " It was Lackawanna County that allowed ( the inmate ) to be sexually assaulted by correctional officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurring and did nothing to prevent the sexual assaults from occurring , " Ms. Pollick says in the reply . <p> Ms. Pollick contends that supports her claims that Ms. Calpin was fired for giving the deposition in Mr. Comerford 's case , not because of her own alleged misconduct . The county agreed to settle Mr. Comerford 's suit in March for $750,000 . <p> Ms. Pollick also argues statements Ms. Calpin made in the deposition could not be used against her because she was reporting wrongdoing , which means the speech is protected under the First Amendment . <p> Mr. Joyce contends that protection is not absolute , however . Prior appellate court rulings held that information obtained in depositions can be used to discipline employees for egregious conduct , such as Ms. Calpin 's case , he said . <p> " Plaintiff must not be permitted to utilize the First Amendment as a shield to attempt to immunize herself from the consequences of her reprehensible misconduct , " Mr. Joyce said . <p> A judge will review the legal arguments and issue a read terms and conditions . <h> Cameron man charged

She 's very outgoing and when she messes up she makes a joke out of it . We joke with her about being very forgetful but she 's come a long way . <p> Who is the biggest surprise on your team this year ? That 's hard . A lot of people I can see have worked hard on their game over the summer , so there are a lot of people I could say that for . I would say Victoria ( Toomey ) and Gianna ( Delfino ) . They got stronger and just kind of matured . At the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had improved . <p> You were in a close game with West at halftime last week and the team made a boatload of 3s to quickly pull away . Is that something this team does better than teams past ? This has probably been the first year on the team that one through five can consistently make 3s , so I think that stretches the defense . <p> What 's the one thing your dad told you early on that still rings true today ? Probably that after missing a shot , you ca n't play discouraged . Keep shooting . He 'll say , the law of averages will work out , if you miss four , you 're making the next four .

Those were all good teams and after the first game , we just came together and it 's weird to see how much improvement we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually it takes longer than that , but after the first game we made some huge adjustments that helped us going into the West and Wallenpaupack games . <p> Expectations for this team are high every year . Talk about that . I think it 's what motivates us to work hard in the offseason because we know that expectations are so high and we want to keep that tradition going . And we are all hard on ourselves . Probably too hard . We all want to be the perfect team and keep that legacy going . <p> Is it hard to balance when to be point guard and when to score ? I 've played enough to feel what the defense is giving me and when I need to score or when Victoria and Gianna ha a mismatch inside and when I have to get them the ball somehow , or drive and kick . It 's a balance and depends on the game . This year I 'm trying to be more aggressive and get my teammates involved . <p> The league has pretty good balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

I think we all love playing each other and to have that challenge . We 've all played together at some point . We 're all in the same grade so that 's pretty rare . <p> How does this year 's team compare to the last three seasons ? I think we have a lot more versatile players who can play a lot of different roles and positions . Gianna ( Delfino ) , as a four , can step out and shoot 3s and also drive to the basket . Victoria ( Toomey ) inside , and our guards Kelly ( Quinn ) and Lisa ( Tallo ) are very quick . And Erika ( ) just does everything .

Jamie Krenitsky , despite the fact that Mr. Krenitsky pleaded guilty in 2013 to indecently assaulting the victim when she was 15 . <p> The Times-Tribune does not identify victims of sexual assault . <p> Mr. Krenitsky was sentenced to nine to 23 ? months in prison for admitting he had oral sex with the teen several times over a six-month period in 2005 . The plea did not automatically mean the woman , now 27 , would succeed in seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The civil case hinged on additional legal issues that were not present in the criminal case . To hold Mr. Krenitsky and Mr. Semenza responsible , the woman had to show not only that the acts occurred , but that they caused her emotional harm . <p> She faced a tougher challenge to hold the borough liable . She first had to prove that Mr. Krenitsky and Mr. Semenza committed the acts and used their positions as police officers , rather than private citizens , to do so . Even if she proved that , she then had to convince jurors that the borough was negligent for failing to enact policies to protect minors . She also had to prove negligence to hold the fire company liable . <p> The woman filed suit in 2012 for emotional harm she suffered . Her attorney , Matthew Slocum , alleged borough and fire company officials partly were responsible because they abdicated their responsibilities , which enabled the abuse to occur . <p> After six days of testimony , the jury found Mr. Chiavacci , who pleaded guilty in 2012 to indecent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2004 and awarded her $20,000 in damages . <p> The panel absolved Mr. Semenza , finding he did not commit any sexual acts against her when she was a minor . The panel found Mr. Krenitsky , who admitted to the conduct , had abused her . It did not hold him liable for damages , however , because it determined the woman suffered no emotional harm from the conduct . <p> Mr. Krenitsky 's attorney , James Doherty III , said he believes the jury 's finding was based on the testimony of the plaintiff , who acknowledged she did not consider the relationship with Mr. Krenitsky , which she described as being a " friend with benefits , " to be traumatic at the time it was occurring or in the years after it ended . <p> " Her testimony in the case was ... even after the relationship ended , she viewed him as a friend , " Mr. Doherty said . " She did n't establish she had any resulting harm . " <p> Mr. Semenza 's situation differed . He was convicted in 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusing the woman starting in 2004 , when she became a junior firefighter with the Old Forge Hose &amp; Engine Company , and ending in 2007 . That information was not allowed at the civil trial , however , because his conviction was overturned on appeal in 2015 . Mr. Semenza then pleaded guilty to harassment under a deal worked out with Lackawanna County prosecutors . <p> Mr. Semenza continued adamantly to deny claims against him at the civil trial . His attorney , Joseph Goldberg , said he believes the key evidence for the jury was a transcript of a secretly recorded call that Mr. Krenitsky , who was working with police , made to Mr. Semenza in 2012 . <p> Mr. Krenitsky tried to get Mr. Semenza to implicate himself , but he repeatedly denied any sexual contact with his accuser . <p> " He said , ' I have nothing to hide , I never touched her . ' The jury found that to be true , " Mr. Goldberg said . <p> Harry Coleman , the borough 's attorney , said he was confident the borough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman proved the abuse occurred , there was no evidence that Mr. Krenitsky or Mr. Semenza was acting in his official capacity as a police officer at the time . <p> " Just because they are employed as police officers , it does not naturally follow that ... it was done when they were exercising their authority as police officers , " Mr. Coleman said . <p> The jury agreed with that position , and therefore did not address whether the borough was negligent for not having policies in place . <p> Michael Patterson , attorney for the fire company , said he believes the jury was influenced by the woman 's admission that she did not tell anyone of the abuse , so she could not show officials were negligent .

" So getting it electronically is a big step for Pennsylvania . " <p> The maps can inform unaware homeowners that their houses might sit atop cavernous voids and whether to buy subsidence insurance . <p> " A lot of people do n't even know that they 're above mines , and they 've had their houses for years , " said Kelsey Biondo , the mine map program coordinator . <p> Northern coalfields <p> To date , EPCAMR 's staff has scanned more than 10,000 maps . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Forest City area down to Shickshinny .

The Wilkes-Barre bureau office started scanning and digitizing maps in 1998 , using interns and available staff when time allowed , DEP spokeswoman Colleen Connolly said . However , with too few staff dedicated to the job , the department opted to contract out the work to get it done faster , she said . <p> Scanning history <p> On a recent morning , six long boxes containing maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work table to be fed into either one of a pair of large document scanners . <p> Maps arrive from a number of sources , like environmental nonprofits , developers and people who discover them in attics or basements . <p> The old documents reveal that coal mining , in its heyday , was ubiquitous . <p> On the map atlas screen , crisscrossing maps outlined in pink turn the Wyoming and Lackawanna valleys into a giant , neon smudge . <p> Coal operators followed some best practices to define their mine workings , but each had their own systems , so there 's inconsistency in how they drew their maps . <p> Some stretch across the room , printed on stiff , wax-coated linen held down by iron relics of the mining days given new life as paperweights . <p> On topographical maps , jagged in-and-out markings show coal miners ' methodical tactics for scavenging all the available coal .

Others do not , though the voids actually may have been filled and the maps simply are outdated . <p> Massive water basins <p> Using 3-D modeling , EPCAMR used the data to show how much water lies in the canoe-like void below the Lackawanna Valley . <p> Two basins make up what McGurl calls the canoe . The first one , from Old Forge to Archbald , holds about 140 billion gallons , he said . That is twice the volume of Lake Wallenpaupack . The second one , from Jermyn to Carbondale , holds about 70 billion gallons . <p> " It would take a lot before you could say it would be drinkable , " McGurl said , adding that with a little treatment it could have industrial use .

 . <h> Article Tools <p> Lackawanna County President Judge Michael J. Barrasse succeeded in convincing a county official to withhold his name on a public deed for a Benton Twp. home he just bought . <p> The judge and county Recorder of Deeds Evie Rafalko McNulty cited exceptions to records disclosure in a state law , but a media lawyer said no one has ever applied the exceptions to real estate deeds . <p> The Times-Tribune regularly publishes property transactions in its Lackawanna County Notes , including those involving other law enforcement officials . The published information , which is public and obtained from the recorder of deeds office , includes seller and buyer names , street addresses and sale prices . <p> McNulty and Barrasse confirmed to the newspaper that the judge made the request to block disclosure of his name as the home 's new owner . They also confirmed he bought the home . However , McNulty said online searches of her office 's database for the property deed would not show the judge 's name and in-person requests would be denied . <p> McNulty and Barrasse cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing that . <p> One exception specifically allows public agencies to refuse Right to Know Law requests that ask for disclosure of the home address of a law enforcement officer or judge .

" <p> Attorney Melissa Melewsky , media law counsel for the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association , decried the withholding of the deed as unprecedented . <p> The state county code requires recorders of deeds to disclose deeds and for the deeds to identify owners and <p> addresses and allows for no exceptions , she said . Beyond that , numerous other public records , including voter registrations and judicial candidate filing documents , already disclose addresses . <p> " Right to Know Law exemptions have never been applied to deed records , " Melewsky said .

MULLEN / TIMES-TRIBUNE FILE Scranton City Council will vote Thursday during its meeting at 6:30 p.m. at City Hall on the introduction of Mayor Bill Courtright ? ? ? s $108 million budget for 2017 . <p> Bob Bolus stubbornly persists in the notion that Scranton 's citizens should elect him to public office . <p> If you have n't heard , Bolus officially launched another campaign for mayor this week . He filed petitions for the Republican nomination . <p> For reasons that few other than he understand , Bolus , 74 , keeps running for public office , even though : <p> ? He 's never won in seven previous tries . <p> ? He lost the 2009 Republican nomination for mayor , even though he was on the ballot , to the Democratic nominee , Mayor Chris Doherty , who beat Bolus for the Republican nomination with write-in votes . <p> ? His 1991 and 2012 criminal convictions likely would prevent him from serving should he shock everyone and win election . <p> He hopes to win the Republican nomination in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Bill Courtright , unopposed for the Democratic nomination , in the Nov. 7 election . Bolus ' Republican opponents are attorney Jim Mulligan and pizza shop owner Giovanni Piccolino . <p> Bolus gained international publicity last year with his ubiquitous tractor-trailers devoted to boosting President Donald Trump and advocating prison for former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . <p> He said an HBO crew plans to interview him today about his Trump trucks for a program that will air on the cable channel in Europe . <p> " I 've already had them ( reporters ) in from Dubai , I had them in from Saudi Arabia , from Germany , from Slovakia , from Sweden , from Switzerland . I 've had more countries come in here , Japan , Russia . They came here for the trucks , " Bolus said . Good thing Trump 's travel ban was n't in effect back then . <p> " Then I would have had to go there ( to the other countries ) , that 's all , " he cracked . " We would have taken them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we 've got boats . " <p> Now , if foreign reporters need to get here , he might get them " a special visa to ride in the truck trailer , " he joked . <p> They usually do n't mention his criminal convictions in their reports . <p> State police charged him in 1991 with illegally obtaining a track loader , a truck tractor and a trailer that carried heavy machinery stolen from a Flushing , New York , demolition company . <p> A Lackawanna County jury convicted Bolus in September 1991 of receiving stolen property , tampering with or fabricating physical evidence and criminal solicitation . The receiving charge was a third-degree felony . Under a state Supreme Court ruling , a felony conviction constitutes an " infamous crime . " Under the state constitution , no one convicted of an infamous crime can hold public office . <p> Sentenced to four months to two years in county prison , Bolus served his time in a work-release program . <p> In March 2012 , another county jury convicted Bolus of insurance fraud and attempted theft by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filing an inflated insurance claim for a truck damaged in a crash . Sentenced to six to 23 months in prison in that case , he served part of that sentence in the county prison . He 's still appealing that . <p> In December , the state attorney general 's office dropped health care fraud charges filed against him in Montour County . <p> Bolus insisted he 'll win the appeal of the 2012 conviction and that the 1991 conviction would not prevent him from serving because it will be " out of the way . " He refused to say how that will happen , but he has lost multiple appeals of it already . <p> " ' 91 is going to be history , " he said Friday . " I wo n't tell you today . Take my word , it 's going to be history . I 'm not going to tell anybody anything , but I can guarantee you , as of today , that I 'll be in the race . And there 'll be accountability especially with Courtright . ... The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> A few weeks ago , we theorized that perhaps Trump could pardon his zealous supporter to make Bolus eligible to serve in elected office . <p> Attorney Joseph O'Brien , the former county and county election board solicitor , reminded us presidents can only pardon people found guilty of federal crimes . <p> Former District Attorney Andy Jarbola twice went to court to remove Bolus from the ballot . In 2007 , Jarbola succeeded when Bolus tried to run for city council . The district attorney failed in 2009 because he filed his case a day late . <p> District Attorney Shane Scanlon said he will ask the state attorney general to determine whether to try to get Bolus off the ballot because Mulligan is a deputy district attorney in his office . <p> Piccolino was unconcerned that Bolus will join him and Mulligan on the ballot . <p> " I just worry about myself .

Instead , workshop and center operators would be required to offer that voluntary option to anyone who wants it starting in September 2018 , he said . <p> " We definitely heard you , " said Dallas referring to critics of the proposal . " The decision whether to access those ( community ) services rests with the individual , their families and their ( services ) team .

Inside , owner George Slocum manned the register , selling newspapers , soup and sandwiches to those braving the winter barrage . <p> " I have no idea why , I just decided to stay open , " Slocum said .

Slocum also prepared a lunch special of chicken noodle soup and a roast beef sandwich , which he served throughout the day . <p> " I 've probably had a half a dozen plow guys ( in ) for lunch , " he said . " I 've been very happy with what we 've done over the past four or five hours since we opened . " <p> Slocum , a volunteer with the Dalton Fire Company , did n't know how late he would remain open , but said he was n't going to try to make the 3-mile trip back to his home in West Abington Twp . <p> " I 'll go over ( to the fire hall ) and sleep for the night , " he said . <p> Up the street , borough resident Chris Slezak used a snowblower and an ATV to clear drifts from his driveway . The snow was still light and fluffy , but Slezak hoped eventually to exchange his snowblower for a snowmobile and do some riding with his wife . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too light , " Slezak said , noting that wetter snow will pack down and provide a hard base for snowmobiles .

" ( Disney via AP ) <p> The Disney " live-action " remakes , of which the new " Beauty and the Beast " is but one in an assembly line , are starting to resemble an iPhone software update . Click a button and that old cartoon interface changes Belle into Emma Watson , the Beast into Dan Stevens and maybe fixes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beast , " that " tale as old as time " ( or , to pinpoint it , 1740 , when the French fairy tale was published ) , could certainly use a few tweaks . It is , after all , a fable about finding beauty within that ends , curiously , with the once superficial prince falling for a beautiful woman he 's kidnapped , whose name literally means beauty . If you 'd like to untangle those ironies , please , be our guest . <p> Director Bill Condon 's film let 's call it " Beauty and the Beast 2.0 " -- often feels in search of a purpose beyond the all-but-certain dollar signs . Much of the live-action/digital effects makeover is less lifelike than the Oscar-winning 1991 animated film : It 's gained a dimension but lost a pulse . The merely fine acting and the lavish production design ( the sumptuous sets nearly swallow the performers whole ) dutifully strive to make this a worthy enterprise . <p> Opposites attract , of course . And this " Beauty and the Beast " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft but missing a spirit inside . Howard Ashman and Alan Menken 's songs still have their infectious kick , but most of the big musical moments feel more like very good covers of the originals . ( There are also three less-memorable new songs by Menken and Tim Rice . ) <p> And yet " Beauty and the Beast " finds its own verve or , to quote Lumiere , " reason d'etre " late . Condon ( the " Dreamgirls " director who , having helmed much of the " Twilight " saga , knows a thing or two about young love and monsters ) , working from a script by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos , has taken many of the old tale 's more cringe-worthy gender roles and mixed them up in the movie 's bright swirling medley . <p> Belle 's bookishness is more pronounced , thanks partly to the " Harry Potter " credentials of Watson . Her performance is a little minor key , still , but Watson lends Belle an intelligence and agency that she has lacked . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girls ' admiration . And the Beast , a pile of horns , makeup and effects on top of the former " Downton Abbey " star Stevens , is more haunted and melancholy . <p> But as the film nears its celebratory coda , a buoyant pluralism bursts forth . Characters -- large parts and small are freed from their prescribed roles in a glorious dance , shortly after Mrs. Potts ( Emma Thompson ) , Cogsworth ( Ian McKellen ) , Lumiere ( Ewan McGregor ) and the rest come to life . ( Be sure to shake your living room and see which British star tumbles out of the furniture . ) Here is where that already much discussed " gay moment , " as Condon has called it , arrives . It comes and goes in a flash . <p> Josh Gad , the MVP of many a Disney movie , plays LeFou , the doting sidekick of the caddish Gaston ( Luke Evans ) , the dopey pursuer of Belle 's hand . LeFou spends much of the movie hinting at his affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance for redemption toward the end . That 's all it is -- an easy to miss suggestion that LeFou might find another love . And yet this slightest wink of homosexuality has drawn the ire of some who , it 's worth noting , raised no concerns over a romance between an imprisoned girl and a beast or , for that matter , a candelabra and a feather duster . <p> In fact , " Beauty and the Beast " would be better if it dared more such moments and went further with them . Nevertheless , the uproar suggests even this must count as progress . Perhaps we 'll be ready for a truly up-to-date " Beauty and the Beast 3.0 read terms and conditions . 
 . <h> Article Tools <p> WILKES-BARRE You know a line is clicking when the beat writers in Pittsburgh start trying to come up with a nickname for it . <p> Here 's an example : The " HBK " line , which consisted of Nick Bonino , Carl Hagelin and Phil Kessel , rose to prominence during the Penguins ' Stanley Cup run last season . <p> Having Sidney Crosby , Evgeni Malkin and Kessel all skate on different lines created matchup nightmares for opponents and gave Pittsburgh a monster third line it could count on to produce points , especially in unfriendly confines . <p> During this season , the HBK line has not been able to consistently recreate its playoff magic . <p> Normally , that would be a big issue . However , Pittsburgh has another combination brewing . One with the potential to be even better once postseason play kicks off a month from now . <p> And here 's the thing : This line consists of the best player in the world and two young guns that Wilkes-Barre/Scranton fans should be pretty familiar with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Conor Sheary and Crosby . Whether they end up being called the " GCS " or " CGS " line , one fact is beyond dispute . <p> They 're fast becoming one of the most-feared trios in the NHL . <p> In their first three games together , Sheary , Guentzel and Crosby have combined for four goals and eight assists and a plus-8 rating while generating 45 shots . <p> Asked if he was surprised to see Sheary and Guentzel have such success skating with Crosby , Wilkes-Barre/Scranton captain Tom Kostopoulos shook his head . <p> " Not really , " he said . " I was fortunate enough to play with both of them , and they can do everything . They both have great speed and are good passers , good shooters , and they both have really good hockey sense . I thought if they played together that they would do well , and then you put them with Crosby , the best player in the world , ( and the rest is history ) . " <p> Kostopoulos was able to watch Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came away from it really impressed . <p> " I thought they were the best line on the ice by far , just generating so many chances , " he said . " I think Guentzel hit two crossbars and Sheary had that nice goal , and then they got the other one off a Crosby tip-in . It 's impressive . <p> " They 're both really good people too , " Kostopoulos added of Guentzel and Sheary . " They work hard , they 're great guys , and it 's great seeing them have so much success . " <p> Pittsburgh head coach Mike Sullivan first paired the three together on March 10 , swapping Guentzel ( who had been skating on the third line ) and Chris Kunitz . <p> After all three posted zeros across the board on their first night together , Sheary and Guentzel found the back of the net in their second time out in a 3-0 win in Vancouver . Crosby added two assists and nine shots . <p> The Calgary game Kostopoulos referenced was their third together . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could hold its own defensively , with both Guentzel and Sheary checking in under 5-feet-11 . <p> That has n't been an issue through three games , with just one goal being scored while the three were on the ice thanks to their high rate of puck possession . <p> " All three of them move the puck well , " Kostopoulos said . " The one thing that Jake and Conor both do that not everyone picks up on is they 're really good on the forecheck . When Jake was here , he was probably the best forechecker on our team . He just creates turnovers and is a pain in the other team 's butt . They ca n't break the puck out because he 's all over them . <p> " If you have guys that are forechecking hard and turning pucks over that can get the puck to Crosby , the offensive chances are going to come , and all three of them can finish .

 our mobile apps . <p> Gene Reed 's high-pitched , ever-encouraging voice is unmistakable . It is as much a part of a boxing venue as the ropes , the turnbuckles and the bright lights . It is as much a part of Scranton as the Electric City sign . <p> Nights like this are nights made for Reed , and not because it 's St. Patrick 's Day weekend , not because he 's so Irish it was his nickname , or because the green lines that dot the downtown route on Parade day are there because he painted them . Nights like this are made for Reed because there 's a ring and there are lights and there are fans and this is his city . And because he has done as much as anybody to help make this possible . <p> More than 800 people crammed inside a ballroom at the Hilton Scranton &amp; Conference Center on Saturday night to watch the Pennsylvania Golden Gloved Central District Semifinals , and it was unmistakably about the kids in the ring . The future of the sport not just locally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fans also saw a short , but poignant , reminder of Reed 's dedication to the sport and this city . The Pennsylvania Golden Gloves rightly inducted him into its Hall of Fame , an honor reserved for fighters or coaches who have demonstrated outstanding service and dedication to the youth of Pennsylvania . <p> Reed did so as both a fighter and as a coach , a venture to which he has volunteered his time for more than three decades . <p> Understand , there is no future of boxing in Scranton without Reed . Because without Reed , there 's nobody to fill in the gaps . <p> " I 'm honored . I 'm humbled , " Reed said , his loud in-fight voice giving way to a more reserved tone . " I 'm proud that our area is doing good , and that I am a part of it . " <p> There are still people around the state who know Scranton as a fighting town , the place where Larry Holmes came through on the way up and the city that proved adept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters over the years -- guys like Chris Walsh and Jason Gavern and Marty Flynn and Chris Mills and too many others to count -- that brought notoriety to the city during their careers . <p> But a sport does n't thrives by its stars . It thrives because those stars inspire the youngsters to give it a try . The ring goes dark only when nobody is in it . <p> There have been times over the years , even in the fighting city , where it appeared the ring might go dark . And just as the lights dim , there 's Reed with the next fighter carrying some excitement , the kid with the heart or the chin or the thunder in his hand to make Scranton notice again . A Ryan Wilczak or a Jimmy Kelleher . A kid who came to him to get to the next level or the one who walked into his Irish Boxing Club looking for something to do , something at which to be great . <p> " He helped me change my life around , for the better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-0 as a pro and due for his third fight in April . " He taught me not only how to box , but about life , and how to be a good person . <p> " Besides what I saw on TV , he taught me everything I know . " <p> Reed had the magic touch Saturday night , too , as he either trained or worked the corner for six of the 11 bouts held in the semifinals . His fighters won four and lost one , with a no contest declared in the other . <p> His success does n't come through preaching a style , but by finding one that already exists and developing it , not an easy job for a coach these days to do . <p> " Some coaches try to change you , to either be like a brawler or a traditional boxer , " said 14-year-old Daniel Kelleher , shortly after he outpointed Jamie Gomez in a 125-pound bout to advance to the finals . " He kind of just throws you out there and sees what you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beamed about his induction into the Hall of Fame , but he took more pride in the record of his fighters on another successful Saturday night for boxing in Scranton . The more of those there are , he said , the happier he 'll be . <p> And that about sums it up for Irish Gene Reed . The man who developed the fighters . The man who kept the sport going . Scranton 's jack of all trades . The man who even helped clean up the ballroom after the final bell rang . <p> DONNIE COLLINS is a sports columnist for The Times-Tribune .

Luckily , the PIAA did n't have to worry so much about that , and it even got the gift of realizing the overwhelming need for a contingency plan in the future . <p> What it really should be most concerned about , though , is that while the may have crowned more hoops champions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball . <p> Lopsided scores <p> The PIAA finals in Hershey lasted a day-and-a-half before it finally produced what one might consider a close game , a five-point win for District 7 champion Sewickley Academy over District 12 runner-up Constitution for the boys Class 3A title . <p> The first five finals leading up to that one were decided by 12 , 14 , 17 , 19 and a whopping 31 points . The issue there is n't so much that the championship games were lopsided , because that can happen any year . The issue is that it continued a trend that started from the beginning of this tournament and extended through the end , encompassing pretty much every classification . <p> " There have been a lot of blowouts , " that man told me during our brief halftime conversation . A quick glance at some scores proved him correct , but a deeper study of each of the 12 tournaments showed he might have even been underselling it . <p> The average first-round game in the boys tournaments was decided by , get this , 15 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had the average second-round game in those tournaments not been decided by 17.3 points . <p> In the 1A , 2A , 3A and 4A classifications , the quarterfinals were largely lopsided affairs , as well . <p> The girls tournaments were little better . The first-round games averaged a 19.1 ppg blowout . The second round ? Try 16.3 . And in the first five classifications , the quarterfinal rounds were dictated by a margin that ranged between 13.8 and 16.8 . <p> With the exception of the 6A boys and girls tournaments , which statistically were much more competitive , and the 5A boys bracket helped immensely by Abington Heights ' gritty , back-to-back double-overtime win to reach the semis you were more likely to walk into a gym and see a lopsided game than you were even a somewhat close one . <p> The boys tournament , before the finals were played , saw just 67 games decided by fewer than 10 points . Meanwhile , 47 were decided by more than 20 . In the four smaller classifications , 37 games were decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the entire girls tournament leading up to the finals , including the significantly more competitive 6A classification , 54 games were decided by more than 20 while 52 were decided by less than 10 . <p> All of it begs the question : Is this really a championship experience for the kids playing , or is it just a glorified district tournament on a statewide scale ? <p> Blame the system ? <p> Last fall , I wrote a column on the six classification system 's affect on football , determining that football is well-suited to the change . Similarly sized schools faced each other . There were more opportunities , better ones , for really good programs that simply could n't get around a dynasty in their area in the past to try their hand at championship-level football . When the PIAA championships wrapped up in December , it still seemed like a pretty good deal , one year in . <p> It has n't translated , at least initially , to basketball . <p> Guess the fair question is , are the blowouts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early to say , but there should be concern it is n't helping . <p> What 's indisputable is the six classifications only strengthened the primary reason there have been so many blowouts : The very good private school teams , on the whole , are better than the ones produced public schools . Add a few more of them , and a few schools that had never been on this stage before , and that 's a recipe for a laugher . In fact , 15 games on the boys side and 20 on the girls were decided by 35 points or more . <p> Sixteen of the 24 teams that competed for championships this weekend are either college prep schools , a religious academy or a charter school . We certainly do n't have to discuss how they have some advantages , especially in sports like basketball , that typical public schools do not . <p> The PIAA really should consider a private school and public school division , as states like New Jersey do . That provides as many , if not more , chances for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations in which they simply ca n't compete . That would make these tournaments more competitive , more fun to participate in for the players and to watch for the fans , increasing the overall experience . And hey , if they want to pit the private school and public school champions against each other at the end , there would be some intrigue in that . <p> What there 's no intrigue in is watching the same issues with the state tournaments perpetuating themselves , over and over again , with no end in sight for the types of schools that simply have the odds stacked against them . <p> For that , it 's probably not fair to blame the change the PIAA made . The issue is the one it has n't made and needs to seriously consider . <p> DONNIE COLLINS is a sports columnist for The Times-Tribune .

Residents want to see the tradition continue , but the structure sits on federal land and requires a special permit to be lit . <p> MILFORD A lighted religious landmark on federal property in Pike County may remain dark this Easter season for the first time in decades . <p> The metal structure , which is wired to display a glowing cross around Easter and a glowing star around Christmas , sits atop an area known as the Knob in Milford . For generations , the Milford Lions Club has lit the structure during the holiday seasons , but have thus far been unable to secure a key permit to continue that tradition this year . <p> The National Parks Service , which in October 2015 obtained the land on which the sits , requires the Lions Club to obtain a " special use permit " to illuminate the cross , according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokeswoman Kathleen Sandt . <p> " Special park use permits authorize activities that benefit an individual , group or organization , rather than the public at large , " part of the statement reads . <p> The Lions Club applied for a permit to light the star and the cross in November but was told to separate the two and reapply , according to club President Jeffrey Phillips . <p> A permit to light the star this past Christmas was granted . However , after an official " said he could n't sign " a permit application to light the cross , the Lions Club withdrew the application amid concerns that pressing the issue would affect its ability to light the star in the future , Phillips said . <p> Seeking solution <p> In an email Tuesday , Milford Mayor Sean Strub wrote that he , borough council , the Lions Club and others are working to find a solution to preserve the tradition . They will meet with recreation area Superintendent John J. Donahue next week to explore possible solutions , according to Strub . <p> Many in Milford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitful . <p> Being on federal land , however , the structure is now subject to National Park Service rules . <p> Federal regulations <p> " There are existing federal regulations concerning religious service and all other like forms of conduct that involve the communication or expression of views or demonstrations , " Sandt 's statement reads . <p> Still , some residents regard the cross as part of Milford 's identity . <p> " This is n't really about religion . It 's about hope , " said Phillips , who plans to continue to fight for the cross even if it is n't lit this year . " People see that and people ( feel ) hope . " <p> Resident Kevin Holian expressed a similar sentiment Tuesday . <p> " It 's been part of our fabric , " he said . " It 's something we can kind of latch on to .

Drapek , president and CEO of United Way of Lackawanna and Wayne Counties , and also honors the group 's own beloved " Mr. Kiwanis , " William J. Nellis . Philip P. Condron serves as master of ceremonies , and proceeds from the dinner benefit the club 's charitable efforts for the upcoming year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several Kiwanians reflected on what the club has meant in their lives as an outlet for volunteering and friendship . <p> " The ability to see the joy of helping other folks , it conversely comes back to yourself , " said Clarks Summit resident Bob Sproul , a second-generation member after his father , Allen . " To know you helped makes it all worth it . " <p> Sproul 's father-in-law , George Fletcher , was a past president , and Sproul held the title himself in 1970 . He has served in almost every other office during his tenure with the club , which he joined in 1963 . Now a widower with a dog at home , Sproul enjoys attending the weekly gatherings . <p> " I come now for the fellowship , " he said , recalling that the group was founded on the premise of building up the lives of others . <p> The Kiwanis Club of Scranton is a multi-generational family affair for many others as well , including Alan Hughes of Clarks Green , whose paternal grandfather , Hugh Hughes , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was active in the 1920s ; and father , Wortley Hughes , was president in 1954 . <p> Alan Hughes took a turn at the club 's helm in 1986 and said his vote to include women in its membership during his final meeting as president is one of his proudest moments . Until then , the Kiwanis Club of Scranton was a mens-only league , but as the rest of the professional world began to embrace female workmanship , he felt the time was right to change the rules . <p> " I have two daughters . It was obvious to me it was very short-sighted not to include them , " Hughes said . " As a result , we were able to get into our membership the cream ( of the crop ) of professional women in this area . They work harder for a lot of reasons . The women in this club are exceptional . " <p> In September 1987 , the club inducted its first two women members , and a month later , Alexandra " Sandy " Yantorn joined the club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100th charter year her second term after a turn in 2007 . She recalled how , in 1987 , there were many times when she was the only woman in the room for meetings and functions . The club quickly adapted to the new co-ed arrangement , however , and felt at home in the group . <p> " When I started getting involved and saw what they did in the community and the camaraderie , and that they did n't take themselves too seriously , they made it very welcoming , " she said . " I found my space . <p> " I think women bring a different perspective , so I think it was good for all of us in blending . The big concern recently is who is going to be our next generation bringing in young blood so the club will be here in another 100 years . " <p> People are nominated and sponsored to join the club , which now boasts about 64 members , 47 percent of whom are women . Among the recent inductees is 30-year-old Scranton resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July . <p> " I think that they 're such a positive , fun-loving group of people . I was swept right up , " Ellard said . " I was looking for different volunteer opportunities , a way to help children in the community the way I want to . It 's a nice way to reach other people in the area , and it 's good for me . I get a sense of community , of being part of something bigger than myself , being able to work on shared goals with like-minded people . " <p> The club 's dedication to kids goes back to the Kiwanis organization 's beginnings in Detroit in 1914 , when the original members " adopted " the son of a struggling single mother and oversaw his being raised in foster care until his mom could resume responsibility for him . Since then , all Kiwanians strive to support local youth in their philanthropic efforts , from volunteering at summer camps to raising money for sick kids to gathering coats and gloves in winter or helping other charitable groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfless heart , Yantorn explained . <p> " We want good character , someone who wants to give back and wants to participate in something , " she said . " It 's a rich tradition we respect and carry on .

MULLEN / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Mountain Top mom of three Ariell Stewart launched her own art business , Mandalas by Ariell , as a creative outlet to help cope with her post-partum depression . <p> Creative inspiration came to Ariell Stewart just when she needed it most , and now the Mountain Top mother of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths to inner peace . <p> A Scranton area native , Stewart , 32 , always painted and drew , though it never took off as a serious pursuit until almost three years ago , when she launched Mandalas by Ariell , a painting business . At the time , it gave her relief from the struggles of post-partum depression . Now , it serves as a livelihood and a form of outreach . <p> Before she started her family , the Dunmore High School graduate , who now lives in Mountain Top , worked a series of jobs , including nanny and salon receptionist , and studied at Keystone College for a time after passing up acceptance into a New York architecture school . When her first child , Jacob , was born 11 years ago , her passion for art slipped further into the background as she adjusted to motherhood . <p> When Ayla , now 6 , entered into the picture , Stewart was managing a Forty Fort yoga studio for the mother of one of her former nanny charges , and she used the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . <p> By the time Zoey , now a handful at 3 years old , came around , Stewart found herself in the throes of PPD . <p> " It was really , really difficult . When you have kids , you lose part of yourself every time , " Stewart said . " I needed something to keep me busy . " <p> Different pieces of her past combined to offer the solution . Working in a yoga studio , concentric shapes like those in mandalas always were in the background as part of the culture . Stewart also recalled the mandala coloring books her math-teacher mother used to employ in learning , and she revisited her own furniture-making skills to apply her designs to wood . She painted her first mandala onto floorboards from her old home , and an idea took hold . <p> " I have a big love for wood because it 's raw and natural , and I think it 's cool that every piece is different , " Stewart said . " The architect came out in me . I built my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ console and kitchen table . I just drew plans and figured out what I needed . " <p> Commissions rolled in from her previous employers , and the demand snowballed from there . Between October 2014 and June 2015 , Stewart estimates she painted more than 100 mandalas , which led to her first art show . She learned the ropes of the art business quickly and focused her designs from large-scale pieces into smaller items , such as mugs and keychains . <p> A year after she started , she quit her job and made Mandalas by Ariell her full-time occupation , thanks in part to successful paint nights ( her first sold out in three days ) . Now , she holds a monthly paint night at , 515 Center St. , Scranton , and other locations throughout Northeast Pennsylvania , including Wonderstone Gallery in Dunmore and Anahata Living in Scranton . She also plans to branch out to restaurants soon . <p> " Paint nights are great because I do them differently than any other , " Stewart said . " I do n't instruct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . I wanted people to experience what I experience when I paint , which is meditative . <p> " Painting became therapeutic . Buddhists believe mandalas represent life and the earth . They can be found in nature and all aspects of our lives . The repetitiveness is soothing . There 's definitely some sort of energy that comes from painting or making them or staring at them . " <p> During the paint nights she hosts , Stewart takes note of the moment when the room goes especially quiet as the students concentrate on their work . By the end , each person has interpreted the mandala in a different way , which inspires Stewart . Many of her regular painters have become her friends . <p> Mandalas by Ariell continues to assuage her PPD , too . Stewart often discusses with her students how the business came out of her own battle to open up a dialogue about the issue . <p> " I used to be embarrassed talking about all these feelings after a baby . Some of it 's dark . I talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing and you can get past it , but if you do n't find a way to get yourself unstuck , it 's going to take a lot longer to heal , " Stewart explained . " As hard as it is , you have to find time for yourself . That 's the only way I got out of what I was experiencing .

 our mobile apps . <p> Most serious gardeners already have designed their plots and determined what flowers and vegetables go where . They have turned the soil , prepping it with fertilizer and compost . Some already have planted lettuce , broccoli and cauliflower , which are hearty and able to survive these cold nights . <p> The mercurial nature of the weather in Northeast Pennsylvania challenges even experienced gardeners . Locally , the rule of thumb is not to plant until Memorial Day , although my nurturing instinct makes me impatient this time of year . I start to get this uncontrollable itch right after the winter thaw which , thanks to global warming , is harder than ever to determine . <p> The zaniest gardeners consult astronomy and Ouji boards . I 'm not quite there yet . For now , the Farmer 's Almanac does fine . Last year , I finished the Penn State Master Gardener course , with several classes focused on all the bugs , diseases and animals that can destroy your garden . Learning about all the things that are deadly to plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I hail from a long line of Italian gardeners . My grandfather and several uncles from South Scranton approached gardening with a strict discipline . They toiled endlessly to ensure their rows of vegetables were straight and neat . Their gardens were well landscaped and pleasing to the eye . Our neighborhood might smell like a toilet with all the cow manure they used for fertilizer , but we patiently endured such suffering in the anticipation of delicious tomatoes , eggplant , zucchini , cucumbers and other produce . <p> As long as we are on the subject of manure , who from my grandfather 's generation could have guessed that it would become such a precious commodity ? With demand so high , most local farmers guard it like gold , which means I 'm reduced to buying it from retailers . My grandfather would be amazed and appalled to discover how much people pay for good manure . It might be easier to get my hands on some pure grade plutonium than to acquire cow manure from a farmer . For sure , my grandfather never would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He believed that the only stuff you need comes out of the back end of a cow . <p> Gardening was serious business during the Great Depression . People in Scranton and around the country did not grow food as a hobby , but to survive . Any plot of land available was used to plant vegetables , not flowers . In fact , for most of their lifetime , the older local Italians never went to the grocery store for fresh produce . That would have been wasteful and embarrassing to them . <p> Things were tough growing up before World War II . My older Italian neighbors told stories of how they hunted rabbits , squirrels and birds for meat . Many of these creatures unlucky enough to travel through the neighborhood were destined for the sauce pan . They also would say that , from the early 1930s until after the war , few birds could be heard chirping on Prospect Avenue . <p> Italians , as many know , are inclined to argue over everything . They argued over the best ways to grow vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , testosterone-filled 4-H competition . A fistfight could break out at any time over the wrong remark about the size or color of someone 's tomatoes . They also argued about who made the best wine , tomato sauce and soppressata . <p> Having an opinion or suggestion , no matter how well-intentioned , could lead to expulsion , after a period of verbal torture . Instead of voicing any thoughts , I learned early that my mouth was best suited for chewing , especially since it all tasted great anyway . <p> So , again this year , I prepare to battle with aphids , slugs and other critters that will try to attack my garden and ruin all my hard work . I 'll plant marigolds around the borders and even spray fox urine to fend off rabbits and squirrels that are intent on gobbling up my vegetables . I 'll admit that gardening has hardened my heart . In my mind , those cute bunnies have become sinister , dire enemies bent on stealing the fruits of my hard labor . After all , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed the animals . Should they try , I 'll be tempted to include them in a pot of sauce . <p> Knowing how easily a hailstorm or blight or those greedy varmints can obliterate my little plot of paradise , I will treat my vegetable plants with tender care in hopes of being rewarded with fresh produce worthy , at least to some degree , of my Italian forebears .

His administration estimated for nearly a year that the $195 million sale to Pennsylvania American Water would yield $96 million for the city government . So far , it has produced $70 million and the best-case scenario is $83 million , and there has been no detailed accounting for the difference . <p> The Courtright administration and the Scranton Sewer Authority " lawyered up " as the sale progressed , producing $4.2 million in fees -- mostly legal fees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed primarily by Courtright and directed by former Courtright solicitor Jason Shrive , refused to divulge any information about what the lawyers did for the money . <p> As several Green Ridge residents sue the city for damage to their properties , the administration has yet to reveal how it plans to deal with stormwater management .

The counties of Northeast Pennsylvania average about 8.5 , according to Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care . Moreover , the psychiatrists we have must cope with three of the top 10 diseases most associated with lost quality of life . According to the World Health Organization , " unipolar depressive disorders " are the No. 1 cause of medical disability in the United States . Dementias , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 and No. 4 . The escalating opioid crisis , no doubt , claims its place as it climbs the rank order . <p> Despite the suffering and lost years of life caused by ( often undiagnosed ) behavioral and mental health diseases , we cling to outdated ideas about psychiatry in a fragmented health care system built not on resiliency , but on brokenness . If people just had more willpower and determination , they would " snap out of " their depression . Addiction is a sign of moral weakness , so patients have only themselves to blame . The persistence of these discredited notions about mental health has led to what should be a national wake-up call -- for the first time in decades , mortality rates for a certain U.S. demographic ( whites aged 45 to 54 ) rose by half a percent a year since 1998 . The cause of these deaths is overwhelmingly attributed to suicide and addiction . No other rich country has experienced anything like these " deaths of despair . " As Angus Deaton , an economist , Nobel laureate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told The Washington Post , " That means half a million people are dead who should not be dead . That 's about 40 times the Ebola stats . You 're getting up there with HIV-AIDS . " <p> Although Deaton 's groundbreaking report was published in 2015 , a Community Health Needs Assessment conducted by the Institute for Public Policy and Economic Development in 2012 identified mental and behavioral health challenges , including **28;374;TOOLONG suicide rates , in our region . That 's when Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine convened an advisory group for the school 's Behavioral Health Initiative . The advisory committee 's charge was to identify gaps in access to mental health services in counties of Northeast Pennsylvania . Market intelligence firm Open Minds , working on behalf of the initiative , concluded that a seven-county region of NEPA would need to increase its number of psychiatrists by 40 percent to meet current need . With that data , at the time of its formal launch in 2015 , the initiative generated a key recommendation : The school of medicine and the Wright Center should create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately needed specialty . All parties humbly recognized a new psychiatry residency could serve as an educational fulcrum for much larger interprofessional workforce development initiatives by leveraging this powerful , inclusive partnership . <p> In July , just two years after the initiative 's 2015 launch , we are proud to announce that the Wright Center will welcome four residents to its new , Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accredited psychiatry residency program . The fact that one of these new psychiatry residents is also a 2017 graduate of Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine makes this accomplishment more meaningful . Psychiatry training takes four years , so once all four classes are filled , we will train 16 residents here in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and graduate four new psychiatrists per year . <p> The school of medicine and the Wright Center have long been partners committed to addressing specific health needs of our community , with a formal commitment solidified in 2015 . That 's why we and our initiative partners worked swiftly to establish the psychiatry residency program despite the significant challenges of funding and accreditation . Wide-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time and the expertise of Sanjay Chandragiri , M.D. , our pioneering program director , has generated the opportunity for four new doctors to learn how to treat and heal patients struggling with behavioral health issues . In this way , our community will take an important step toward reducing " deaths of despair " in our region , replacing years lost to disability with years read terms and conditions .

Williams was stabbed more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an attack that left him unrecognizable because Con-ui felt disrespected over an earlier cell search , according to prosecutors . <p> Prosecutors argued the brutality of the attack , as well as Con-ui 's violent past , warranted the death penalty . Con-ui , a member of the New Mexican Mafia , is already serving life in prison for executing a gang member in Phoenix in 2002 . At the time of Williams ' murder , he was also serving an 11-year sentence for trafficking 33 pounds of cocaine . <p> During his time in prison , Con-ui has threatened correctional officers and attacked other inmates , according to prosecutors . <p> The defense countered that jurors should have mercy on Con-ui , parading a series of his family members -- including his young sons -- to show the impact his death would have on his loved ones . <p> Defense attorneys also argued Con-ui has already been punished for the crime .

" Of course he knows why he did it . He 's the most calculating individual you 're going to run into . " <p> Darrell Palmer , northeast regional vice president for the prison union , Council of Prison Locals C-33 , said he was concerned that the jury 's verdict would allow Con-ui to one day be removed from isolation and allow him to attack someone else . <p> " How could we allow this , for someone to take ( those ) actions against law enforcement and basically do nothing ? " Palmer said . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's OK to kill a federal correctional officer . It 's OK to do anything possible , but when it comes to justice for us -- for my brothers and sisters -- nothing 's being done . " <p> Palmer and Don Williams both expressed an interest in continuing to improve correctional officer safety because of the murder . Already , the death has led to the Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act , allowing thousands of federal prison workers to be armed with pepper spray . <p> Other changes implemented since the stabbing include the addition of a second officer in housing units -- Williams was working alone in a unit housing approximately 130 inmates when he was killed -- and equipping employees with stab-resistant vests . <p> In a statement released in response to the verdict , Sen.

His claim is exaggerated by about $26 million , a Sunday Times analysis found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant Henry Amoroso of HJA Strategies each cited unloading the $140 million mandate , called a consent decree , as a main reason for the sewer sale , which they hailed as a historic deal that saved the city from receivership .

" <p> At a June 22 town hall forum held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor also claimed the water company is on the hook for the $140 million in upgrades . <p> Under the sale , the water company got the authority 's $38 million in cash reserves . <p> In a phone interview , Courtright said he used the $140 million cost-shift figure because that was the estimate of the mandates all along , going back several years . <p> " The $140 million was the original consent decree , " Courtright said . <p> Asked why he and Amoroso did not take into account work done by the authority before the sale closed , Courtright bristled and repeated that $140 million was the original number . <p> Efforts to reach Amoroso were unsuccessful . <p> Sewer Authority Executive Director/Solicitor Jason Shrive dismissed the newspaper 's analysis on Aug. 19 as a matter of semantics . He said he needed more time to come up with figures to back his challenge . The newspaper granted him additional time ; he responded six days later in an email but failed to provide specific costs . <p> " It would always be called the $140 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Shrive said . " The biggest issue with your analysis is that the cost of consent decree projects were more often than not paid by capital funds ( including bonded debt and PENNVEST funds ) . So , the cost in any given year was not the sticker price of a given capital project , but rather the cost of repayment on debt and loans -- which is far less . " <p> ' Not as sweet a deal ' <p> When the sewer deal closed , it delivered lower-than-anticipated net proceeds to Scranton and Dunmore . The mayor and other officials partly attributed the lower proceeds to the transaction taking longer than expected and the mandated upgrades . <p> In January , Scranton City Council asked for an accounting of authority spending on mandated projects during the prior year -- from the time the sewer sale was announced on Dec. 9 , 2015 , and closed on Dec. 29 , 2016 , -- but never received it . <p> After the mayor said at his town hall that authority work had all been documented , Councilmen Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council meeting for the mayor to document work done by the authority that contributed to lower sale proceeds . <p> After again receiving no reply , Evans at the July 20 council meeting repeated the request . <p> " I thought finally after asking that question for nearly six months , we are going to have the answer we are looking for , " Evans said . " Well , here we are four weeks after the town hall meeting , nearly seven months after the close of the transaction , and still no documentation and I feel like we are nowhere .

Organizers say they will not allow Nazi memorabilia to be displayed at this year 's fair . <p> BLOOMSBURG -- When the 162nd Bloomsburg Fair opens next month , Nazi flags will not be among the items on display to the public , according to organizers .

 <p> It is widely believed that Lewis Carroll was hopped-up on hallucinogens when he penned the story of a girl who tumbles down a rabbit hole and meets a dope-smoking caterpillar , a rabbit who hosts tea parties and a feral cat who vanishes at will . <p> It was pretty visionary for the Victorian Era , despite the availability of heroin , cocaine and " magic " mushrooms at the corner store . <p> Those high times are long gone , but intoxicating stories abound , especially here in Our Stiff Neck of the Woods . Every time I write about the plot holes in the official narrative of the $195 million sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority system , I get dizzy . <p> The further down the rabbit hole I travel , the curiouser and curiouser the story becomes . You may recall that back in June , Scranton and Dunmore councils asked state Attorney General Josh Shapiro for an independent investigation of the SSA sale . <p> Shapiro 's office said it handed the issue off to the agency 's Bureau of Consumer Protection . Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a faint chill in the air and a nagging sense that the authors of the SSA deal and Scranton Mayor Bill Courtright hope to run out the clock until Nov. 7 . In Alice 's adventures , the March Hare has no concern for time . Courtright is the November Jackrabbit . Election Day ca n't come fast enough . <p> So it seemed an opportune moment to ask for an update on the independent investigation by the Bureau of Consumer Protection . The attorney general 's paid mouthpieces were n't feeling it . <p> I waited all day Thursday for an update . None came by my 5 p.m. deadline . I complained and was sent an email from Director of Communications Joe Grace . <p> " There is nothing new to report , " he wrote . <p> My response : " Joe , please tell me I did n't blow deadline waiting for a brush-off that would insult a summer intern . I have questions only your office can answer . I will call first thing Friday expecting better . " <p> I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still reviewing the transaction , " he said . <p> I pointed out that Joe 's second statement was as worthless as his first . I accept that the core duty of a public spokesman is to say nothing of substance , but it 's really irritating with yet another deadline looming . <p> Joe would not budge , even when I dropped the name of the deputy attorney general in charge of the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Scranton office -- Thomas P. Cummings III . <p> Joe said he was unfamiliar with the name , but locals likely are : Thomas P. Cummings III is the son of Thomas P. Cummings Jr. , the Dunmore borough solicitor who made on the deal and provided scant documentation of his work , even when more was demanded by Dunmore Borough Council . <p> " That 's the first I 'm hearing that , " Joe said . He also said he was unaware that Mayor Courtright 's wife , Mary , also works in the attorney general 's office in Scranton , although for many years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . When I identified myself , the woman who answered became audibly uneasy . <p> " Does he know what this is in regard to ? " she asked . <p> " No , " I replied , " but I 'll bet he can guess . " <p> The second time , I left Cummings III a message . I also left a voicemail for Ryan Nelson , a deputy attorney general in the Scranton office . Nelson is the stepson of Lackawanna County Senior Judge Carmen Minora , whose brother , Amil , is the Scranton City Council solicitor . Amil Minora has already judged the SSA sale legit , and Judge Minora was assigned to preside over a condemnation lawsuit against the zombie remains of the sewer authority . <p> Neither Cummings nor Nelson called me back . <p> DISCLAIMER : I am not suggesting that there is any connection between these public servants and the glacial pace of the attorney general 's alleged probe , but the longer this story drags on , the worser and worser these curiouser and curiouser connections look to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal judge rebuked a Scranton law firm for failing to keep track of billable hours and then doing a sloppy job of creating them from memory .

" Assuming an eight-hour billable work day , this would mean that the plaintiff 's counsel worked on nothing else but this case , every day , for approximately 323 days . " <p> Judge Mannion blasted the lawyers ' fees as " mind boggling , " " outrageously excessive " and not supported by documentation . He was so outraged that he plans to refer the matter to the state disciplinary board .

I asked whether he has any concerns about the legality of the SSA sale , particularly under the state Municipal Authorities Act , which seems to read terms and conditions .

" <p> As a child , Hill said , students bullied her at school in Easton , and teachers resented her because they thought she should go to a school specifically for blind students . <p> Hill learned to be as independent as possible and resisted special accommodations , such as getting a guide dog , until she was 21 , studying at East Stroudsburg University . <p> " I did n't want one .

 <h> Article Tools <p> Pope Francis gestures in at St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome as he presides over a vigil prayer , Saturday , April 8 , 2017 . ( AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino ) <p> First celebrated in New York City on Sept. 5 , 1882 , Labor Day became a national holiday in 1894 . <p> In that same period the encyclical of Pope Leo XIII , Rerum novarum ( 1891 ) , addressed labor-related issues . On the basis of Catholic principles , it steered a course between Marxism and the excesses of capitalism by espousing the right of private property , a living wage for workers and the right of labor to organize and strike . Over the next 125 years , Catholic social teaching has upheld and elaborated on these principles . <p> In the course I teach at the University of Scranton called " Theology of Work and Rest , " one of the texts is Laborem exercens ( 1981 ) by St. John Paul II . John Paul writes that " a principle that has always been taught by the church is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In his first annual message to Congress in April 1861 , Abraham Lincoln said the same : " ... Labor is the superior of capital , and deserves much the higher consideration . " ) <p> John Paul insists that the dignity of the human being is paramount . He is critical of " the error of early capitalism " which " can be repeated wherever man is in a way treated ... as an instrument and not in accordance with the true dignity of his work ... where he is not treated as subject and maker , and for this very reason as the true purpose of the whole process of production . " <p> For John Paul and Catholic teaching , " a just wage is the concrete means of verifying the justice of the whole socioeconomic system . " He further observes that " just remuneration for the work of an adult who is responsible for a family means remuneration which will suffice for establishing and properly maintaining a family and for providing security for its future . " <p> According to the Living Wage Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Scranton , a family of two adults and two children requires a annual income to meet the living wage threshold in Lackawanna and Luzerne counties and a family of one adult and one child requires , yet 40 percent of households earn less than $35,000 . <p> The minimum wage fails to allow a full-time worker with a family to meet basic needs like health care and child care . <p> Many people in our region who work full-time are not earning enough to allow their families to lead lives of basic dignity . <p> The idea that a more just economy will be brought about naturally by means of a stronger GDP is often put forward by those who style themselves " realists , " but as Pope Francis points out in Evangelii Gaudium ( 2013 ) , it is the defenders of " the absolute autonomy of the marketplace " whose approach has proven na ? ve : " some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth , encouraged by a free market , will ... succeed in bringing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has never been confirmed by the facts , expresses a crude and na ? ve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system . " <p> Catholic social teaching astutely perceived that the proper response and best antidote to godless communism was not to make capitalism into a god but to curb its excesses . This Labor Day , we can honor the dignity of those who work by supporting policies and policy-makers that take seriously the basic moral insight that a just economy is one in which those who work for a living are paid a living wage . Such justice finally serves everyone , including the most economically secure , by making conditions that much less ripe for the kind of political instability and exploitation of which we have recently seen too much . <p> As the late Sen.
