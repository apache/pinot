Could it be a dreaded chest cold , sometimes called acute bronchitis ? Read on to find out if you 're showing the early signs of this nasty cold , and what you can do to get some much-needed relief . <h> Sore Throat <p> One of the earliest symptoms you 're likely to notice when you catch a new cold is a sore throat . It develops as the offending cold virus starts to infect and attack your respiratory tract , triggering an immune response . The infection ( and your immune system ) causes the tissues in your throat to swell up , leading to that characteristic discomfort . To help relieve these symptoms , consider drinking liquids ( like tea with honey ) , although know that the drinks wo n't help with the underlying chest cold . <h> Low Grade Fever <p> As your body mounts an immune response against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever- " - up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit . A fever is your body 's way of naturally " burning " out a fever . Germs , like those that cause chest colds , work best at your normal body temperature , which is around 98.6 degrees F. Raising your body temperature keeps germs from working as effectively , so your body has an easier time fighting them off . <h> Excess Mucus <p> Perhaps one of the most recognizable signs of a developing chest cough is excess mucus . While unpleasant , mucus actually plays an important role in protecting your respiratory tract . It works as a trap for harmful particles like germs and helps remove them from your system . So it 's no surprise that a chest cold comes along with plenty of excess mucus , designed to get those nasty germs out of your airways .

The presence of extra mucus trips up nerve endings , called mechanoreceptors , and activates your " cough reflex " that ends up as " you guessed it " a pesky cough . While disruptive and uncomfortable , coughing up mucus actually helps remove germs from your airways , so you can stay on track for recovery . Do n't be surprised if your coughing starts early and continues even after your other symptoms have subsided . Depending on the severity of your chest cold , coughing might last for up to eight weeks , notes Hope College . <h> How to Get Relief <p> Your impending chest cough might feel unstoppable , but many of your symptoms are n't .

Approximately 90 percent of acute sinus infections are caused by a virus . Although such infections tend to last only about a week , the stuffy nose , sinus pressure , headache , sore throat and general lack of energy can interfere with your life in the meantime . You 'll want to manage your symptoms " and steer clear of anything that might make them worse " as the infection runs its course . Here are five ways you might be making your sinus infection worse , and tips on how you can avoid them to get better faster . <h> 1 .

Humidified air promotes drainage , soothes sore throats and helps ease coughs . If you do n't have a humidifier , you can promote drainage by running a hot shower in a closed bathroom and inhaling the steam two to four times a day . <h> 4 . You 're Exposing Yourself to Irritants <p> Dry air is n't the only thing that can irritate your nose and make your sinusitis symptoms worse .

Their concentrated mist are good at breaking up mucus and helping it flow , allowing you to breathe easier in an instant .

Whether caused by a cold or not , irritated sinuses can trigger symptoms similar to a tension headache , and might come paired with other cold and flu symptoms . <h> The Root Cause : a Sinus Infection <p> Not surprisingly , you can blame the pain of a sinus headache on something bad happening in your sinuses . That underlying cause is usually a sinus infection ( also called sinusitis ) and the resulting irritation and swelling .
