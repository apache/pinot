@@96757057 @957057/ <p> To determine whether or not it is a good idea for you to refinance , you should look at your specific situation and your motivation for refinancing . The most common reasons to refinance are to reduce your rate and/or payment , convert from an adjustable to a fixed rate , or pull cash out of your equity to consolidate debt or improve your home . If your objective is to reduce your rate and payment , you should review your current interest rate and see how much you can save with a 0 point loan and then determine if it makes sense to pay points to reduce your rate further . If you are converting your adjustable rate into a fixed rate , you may actually see an increase in your rate and payment but you 'll get peace of mind knowing your rate will never increase again . If you are using the equity in your home to consolidate debt , your overall loan balance and payment may go up , but you will save monthly because you will eliminate the monthly obligations that you are paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine whether or not refinancing makes sense for you . <p> Question : How much can I save if I refinance ? <p> Every situation is different . It depends on what your current interest is and what your motivation is for refinancing . If your current rate is higher than what is available in the market , it probably makes sense to refinance . To get an idea of what you could save by refinancing , check out our calculators and enter numbers specific to your situation or call one of our experienced Mortgage Loan Officers for some expert advice . <p> Question : What if I have a second mortgage on my home ? Can I still refinance ? <p> Typically , any second mortgages are paid off through the refinance . We will consolidate both loans into one new first mortgage and you will only have one payment each month . If you 'd prefer to keep your second mortgage intact , we may be able to ask your second mortgage lender to remain in second position and allow us to refinance the first loan . This process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the second mortgage lender <p> Question : What are the costs associated with refinancing ? <p> Fees associated with refinancing vary from lender to lender but there are standard fees that are typical across the board . These fees include 3rd party fees such as credit report , title , escrow , notary , and recording fees . Other fees include the appraisal fee and lender fees such as processing and underwriting . If you are paying points to lower the rate , the cost of each point that you pay equals 1% of your new loan amount . Aside from the closing fees , there will be prorated pre-paid costs for items such as property taxes , interest , and homeowners insurance ( if applicable ) . If you have enough equity in your home , you can add all fees and pre-paid items into your new loan . <p> Question : What type of documentation do I need for refinance ? <p> Standard documentation collected for a refinance transaction includes information regarding your income such as paystubs covering the most recent 30 days and W-2s for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual fund/stock statements covering the last 60 days and current loan information such as your most recent mortgage statement and homeowners insurance declarations page . <p> Question : Is it true that you should only consider refinancing if you can lower your rate at least .5% ? <p> There is no rule-of-thumb when it comes to refinancing because there are different reasons to refinance . If you are currently in an adjustable rate looking to get into a long-term fixed loan , your rate and payment may actually increase , but you will be in a better long-term situation knowing your rate and payment will not change . If you are looking to consolidate debt , your loan amount and mortgage payments may go up but your overall monthly outflow will decrease because you will have eliminated some or all of your credit card bills and other monthly obligations . It is a good idea to go over your specific situation with an experienced Mortgage Loan Officer to determine whether refinancing makes sense or not <p> Question : How long is the refinance process ? <p> Most refinance transactions close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you do your part in delivering the documentation that we need in a timely manner , we should be able to close your loan within 45 days . <p> Question : What happens at the loan closing ? <p> Depending on the state where your property is located , you can either sign in one of our local branches or at a designated settlement location such as an escrow office or attorneys office . In the presence of the signing authority , you will review and sign all your loan documents and then present a certified or cashiers check to pay the closing fees and other applicable closing funds unless you decided to finance the closing funds into your new loan .

Total average earning assets increased $2.0 billion or 10.2% , mostly due to the benefit of acquired Yadkin balances , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $612 million increase in the securities portfolio in anticipation of the Yadkin closing and some planned growth . <p> Average loans totaled $16.2 billion and increased $1.4 billion , or 9.2% , reflecting the acquired Yadkin balances and the solid organic loan growth in the commercial and consumer portfolios . Average organic commercial loan growth totaled $89 million or 4.2% annualized , with much of the growth concentrated in the Pittsburgh , Maryland , and Cleveland markets . Average organic consumer loan growth was $117 million , or 7.8% annualized , led by strong demand and increased origination volume for indirect auto loans and continued growth in the residential mortgage portfolio . <p> Non-Interest Income Non-interest income totaled $55.1 million , increasing $4.1 million , or 7.9% , and included $2.6 million in net securities gains related to the sale of certain acquired Yadkin securities after the closing of the acquisition to align the portfolio with FNBs investment profile . The increase in non-interest income was due to positive performance in capital markets , insurance , and wealth management , as well as a slight benefit from a partial quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on increased interest rate swap activity with commercial customers across our existing and newly acquired markets . Wealth management showed positive organic growth results and was supported in-part by favorable stock market conditions . Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense totaled $187.6 million , increasing $63.7 million and included a $51.1 million increase in merger expense compared to the prior quarter . Excluding merger-related expenses , expenses would have increased $12.7 million . The efficiency ratio ( non-GAAP ) was 57.2% , compared to 55.4% . The increase was primarily due to infrastructure investments , pre-hiring in advance of the acquisition close , as well as seasonally higher expenses . Credit Quality The ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO improved 2 basis points to 0.77% . For the originated portfolio , the ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO increased 21 basis points to 1.12% and the increase was mostly driven by an estimated fair value of $19.4 million of acquired Yadkin OREO . The increase in total delinquency levels reflects the addition of the acquired Yadkin balances .

The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans and leases decreased 26 basis points from December 31 , 2016 , to 0.80% at March 31 , 2017 , with the decrease primarily due to the preliminary estimated fair value of $5.0 billion in loans from the Yadkin acquisition without a corresponding allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting for business combinations . For the originated portfolio , the allowance for loan losses to total originated loans was 1.19% , compared to 1.20% at December 31 , 2016 . The total provision for loan losses totaled $10.9 million , compared to $12.7 million in the prior quarter . <p> Average loans totaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22.3% , due to the benefit from continued organic loan growth and previous acquired balances . Organic growth in total average loans equaled $786 million , or 5.6% . Total average organic consumer loan growth of $594 million , or 10.7% , was led by strong growth in residential mortgage and indirect auto loans . Organic growth in average commercial loans totaled $193 million , or 2.3% . Organic commercial loan growth compared to the year-ago quarter was somewhat offset by accelerated prepayment activity in the commercial acquired loan portfolio experienced in the second half of 2016 . Average deposits totaled $17.1 billion and increased $2.9 billion , or 20.7% due to the benefit of previous acquired balances and average organic growth of $317 million or 2.1% .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators We use non-GAAP financial measures , such as operating net income available to common stockholders , operating net income per diluted common share , return on average tangible common equity , return on average tangible assets , tangible book value per common share , the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets , efficiency ratio , and net interest margin to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends , and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers .
