One way- to make this transition from party season to 2017 easier is by investing in a brand new wardrobe ! <p> Remember when going back to school meant you were treated to a new ( probably fluffy ) pencil case and a backpack ? Bring those old-school treats bang-up-to-date by updated your 16 look with a few select staples . <p> A white shirt is a works-with-anything kind of piece , but rather than opting for a standard shape , choose one with a tailored twist . <p> Been holding on to your boring navy suit forever ? Give your look a much-needed update with a gorge on trend pink co-ord . As well as working perfectly together , a matchy two-piece can be separated , thus making it one of the hardest working outfits in your closet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sweet ! Celebrate with a pair of- leather skinnies . Worn with a luxe shirt and gold-studded trainers , these trews- will be a welcome addition to your weekday wardrobe . They 're also the ideal day-to-night option if you have evening plans with the girls . Just switch your trainers for heels and add a slick of lippy to finish. - <p> Work-style dresses have come a long way since the merry old age of shifts . Nowadays , frocks worn loose and to the calf are just as smart and way more flattering . Were especially keen on pretty printed wrap dresses- like this one . Add some tights and pair with heels or boots to make the perfect ensemble . <p> One of the easiest ways to change up daywear is by picking up a few printed blouses , particularly the silky kind . Think Gillian Anderson in The Fall . <p> Lastly , a new bag will make you feel better about returning to work while keeping you organised and accessorised .

But after collecting information from many interviewers , they have multiple dos and donts in common . Pay attention lovelies , as you may be doing one of the following , be it consciously or not <p> 1 . Do n't  make your resume 3 pages long : interviewers are n't  interested in your life story , they want the most relevant and important information only . A simple , structured CV showcases your level of efficiency and capability of highlighting key data . Always bring a printed CV to an interview . <p> 2 . The energy you project in your first interview matters : nobody is going to hire someone who seems glum , as if they want to be anywhere but in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become tiring .

A more difficult tasks than it appears to be . Well , the same happens to tall- women , we both do n't  seem to find items that fit us in the same way as they would the average size woman , which by this I mean the general- height and body size calculated for females . <p> So , in order to help you taller SF tribe individuals figure out what suits your lovely figures the best , and how to style something without making yourself look like a friendly giant , Ive come up with 6 tips to make shopping a little easier ( hopefully ! ) . As there could be certain styles you have n't worn that much which really flatter your body shape , ways of manipulating clothes to your body types advantage and styles you might want to steer clear from . Have a look <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , skirts can appear oddly designed , as if they are not one length or another , like they do n't sit on the hips or the waist in order to avoid this , high-waist is the best way to go . It can allow you to experiment with different lengths but still keep you in your comfort zone and make you feel assured it will look trendy no matter what . For a more androgynous- look , try shorter lengths and hip-line height . <p> As people with petite figures sometimes have to do , we recommend you roll up the ends or your bottom half , to create cropped- trousers/jeans . By doing this you 're avoiding all the length issues ( too short , too long , too baggy ) , while keeping your outfit looking cool and totally planned . <p> One of the advantages you have , which many smaller people admire you for , is the possibility of wearing long maxi clothing ; coats , dresses and skirts . You can rock a long stylish coat without dragging it on the floor behind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your legs will look as if they go on forever ; and skirts , well if you have a split up the side with your infinite legs on display , say no more . <p> When it comes to- heels , most of you will possibly want to stick to the 3 inch heel rule . Many of you ladies might not be huge heel fans anyway , but sometimes with a taller frame it looks more sophisticated if you keep your heel under a certain height , as you do n't  need that extra leverage , your already gorgeous height does that for you already ! <p> Shirts , t-shirts and jumpers that come to the hip-line look ultra-cool on longer bodies . When you have a long frame , a slightly cropped top half garment will make your body look slimmer and give your legs room to speak for themselves . Oversized is super stylish too , but if not styled correctly it can sometimes look drowning . <p> Last but not least , two very hot trends right now , that look flawless on all body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - They accentuate one of your loveliest assets and look great with a high waisted skirt and cropped tee or with a cute dress .

I 've had it many a times where something will fit my waist but not my bust , something is figure-hugging for my body but too small for my butt there are countless scenarios we come across when shopping . <p> So , in order to clear up any confusions or dilemmas you have , here are a few of my top tips for your petite figure , which brands SilkFred have that are XS friendly and what will bring out the best of our figures . Have no fear ! <p> Cropped trousers do just the trick. - The best route to go down with trousers is choose a pair that are cropped length wise , that way you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into place . <p> Accentuate your waists ladies . If you 're a busty petite woman , when it comes to flaunting your features , a cinched in waist does just the trick . As it will elongate your body and emphasise your voluptuous features . <p> When maxi , think sexy. - Maxi dresses can make us look like were drowning , so a good choice is a rather feminine maxi ; a cinched in waist , accentuated bust area , slit up the side this will avoid you- looking like you 've wrapped a be sheet around your body . <p> Youd be surprised what you can find in the kiddies section . Yes , I said it , the kids section has some cool pieces . I 'm not talking for anything special , but basic t-shirts and shorts are half thre price and could even fit better. - ( This is also a great idea for you small footed lovers ) . <p> Layer all the way. - Mixing different lengths of clothing , as well as fabrics is a trend that suits smaller people ( and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waisted. - When it comes to- skirts and shorts , high-waisted or low-waisted are the most figure flattering . In between can sometimes make the torso and lovely legs look shorter than they are . ( Not too short though , we want to look classy and stylish !
