There are many factors to consider and even more opinions about which ones are worth following . <p> Whether purchasing a welder to use at home for the first time or upgrading to a new machine , welders need to know how they can safely operate it and what they 'll need to have on hand to weld . The following guide will outline some of the essential guidelines for welding at home in order to avoid tripping a breaker , damaging a home/shop , or stopping mid-project in order to run to the store for an unexpected tool . <h> Electrical Set Up for Welding at Home <p> Before purchasing a welder and especially before running it the first time , it 's critical to first learn whether a garage or shop can handle the electrical current a welder requires . Presuming the lights will be on while working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welders are designed to work in a home outlet , while the higher voltage models need higher capacity plugs such as the kind used for electric driers . <p> Many welders recommend starting home projects with a Millermatic 135 or Millermatic 140 MIG welder since it does n't require more than 120V and runs fine on most home electrical outlets . However , always consult the welder 's manual and an experienced welder or electrician before starting . There are so many different exceptions to take into account that no one online article can take all of them into account . ( While TIG welders are popular among skilled welders , home welders , especially those just starting out , tend avoid TIG welders because they require more time to learn . Therefore this article resource will focus on the basic use of MIG and stick welders at home , though there are exceptions . ) <p> A welder such as a Millermatic 140 MIG welder is typically able to handle most household projects , but some welders prefer to use a 220V welder at home so that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a strong weld . Less power means less heat , and welding thicker metal requires a lot of heat . <p> For a 220V welder , an electrician will have to install a plug that can handle the extra amperages it requires . <p> In the case of welders who ca n't modify their home set ups or want a little more portability , there are generators and welder/generator combinations that may cause some extra noise but will put out 3000 , 4300 , or even 4500 watts of power . Welders renting a home may find that this is the best solution if they ca n't plug their welders into wall outlets . <h> The Gas Set Up for Home Welding <p> After selecting a welder , gas may or may not be required for shielding the weld pool . Stick welders create a weld with a flux-coated electrode that protects the weld pool instead of a shielding gas . The flux-coated electrode makes stick welding a cheap and simple process , but it 's quite messy and requires more skill than MIG welding . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affordable way to make simple repairs around the house . <p> MIG welding is an easier process to learn , and it offers two options for its filler wire . There are flux cored filler wires and solid filler wires that are used to make welds during the MIG process . The flux cored MIG wires do n't require shielding gas . Much like stick welding electrodes , they provide welding filler material and use the flux to create a protective barrier around the weld as it cools . This saves on both the cost of shielding gas and the need to store it in the garage , but the slag created by the protective flux needs to be chipped away and therefore does not create as clean a weld . <p> Many home welders pick up a MIG welder because it 's simple to learn and offers a versatile and neat weld . MIG welding with solid core wire requires a shielding gas in order to protect the weld that is typically a mixture of argon and CO2 or sometimes simply argon depending on the material being welded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire and a shielding gas is a very neat process that is particularly useful for automotive repair . <p> It may be tempting to buy a smaller 20-cf fuel cylinder , but consider the potential cost savings of a large bottle . An 80 or 125-cf tank will save on refill costs and saves a trip to the store . Smaller cannisters are useful to have on hand if the shielding gas runs out on the weekend , but buying more fuel at once will save both time and money . <p> When storing gas in your home workshop or garage , make sure the gas cannisters are upright and secure so that they can not fall over . Make sure gas and fuel containers are stored a safe distance away from all welding work and sparks . <p> Gas can also present problems with some home insurance and rental policies . Before making a purchase , learn about the restrictions at your property and take extra care with your gas storage by having them inspected and serviced properly . Some home insurance policies have limits and exclusions that get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas tanks . <h> Essential Home Welding Products <p> Besides a welder , electrode , and shielding gas , welders will need to consider a metal cutting product , which may be anything from a chop saw to an acetylene torch setup or plasma cutter . Acetylene is quite flammable and should only be used by those who are aware of the safety issues it presents . A chop saw with a strong base and solid rear hinge pin will serve most welders very well for many of their cutting needs . <p> An angle grinder is also essential for prepping metals prior to welding--something that is critically important for creating a clean , strong , safe weld for MIG welding . Some welders suggest ultra thin cutting discs for grinders in order to minimize the amount of material wasted during the grinding process . Flap discs in an angle grinder are useful for smoothing out metal prior to painting . <p> While some welders can be purchased with a cart included , welders have been known to pursue any number of creative solutions from adapting a tool cart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welding cart is particularly useful in both safely storing a welder and allowing welders to work in the safest and most convenient location . <p> Work clamps will keep the welding materials in place and ensure that the weld is straight and neat . Welders have hit points in their projects where they could not proceed without additional clamps . Clamps are small items that can make a huge difference in successfully completing a weld . <p> An auto-darkening welding helmet , gloves , leather shoes , and protective clothing are critically important safety gear that every welder needs . These are all explained in detail in Baker 's guide : Basic Welding Equipment and Gear . <h> Safety for Home Welding Projects <p> Safety is the most important aspect of welding at home since a tiny spark can burn down a garage or shop . Remove flammable materials such as rugs out of the vicinity of the welder as well as any other fuels or gases that are n't  in use . <p> For the greatest possible safety in your welding space , create a welding " shield " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets . This will protect the garage from sparks and also prevent spatter from ruining items stored in the garage or shop . For welders who want to work with the garage door open but fear exposing passersby with UV rays , there are clear screens that can be put up across the garage opening that allow in light but block the rays . <p> Keep at least two fire extinguishers on hand , not tucked away in a corner . If possible , only do metal working in one space and wood working in another . The accumulated saw dust in cracks and gaps in the walls only need one spark to begin smoldering . <p> Welders with mixed use spaces use air blowers to clean their work spaces and frequently check for any smoke or smoldering after completing their projects , but any cardboard boxes , scraps of wood or sawdust can catch fire , so check back an hour or two after finishing a project . <p> In the case of attached garages , take into consideration the ventilation needs , especially for the winter . Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ventilate a welding area , but check with a welding professional before starting a project . <p> Typical welding safety includes being sure a welder is appropriately grounded and that the work area is free from clutter such as unnecessary hoses and power cords . In addition , check the hoses routinely for leaks and kinks . The best welding set up is one that minimizes distractions and hazards that can get in the way while working on a project.Learn More About Welding Safety and Equipment:Basic Welding Equipment and Gear 
@@25165804 @5165804/ <h> Stick Welding Tip : What to Do with a Stuck Electrode <p> If you 've ever tried stick welding , you may wonder if it 's called that because you get stuck all of the time . One of the most common complaints among stick welders is a stuck rod . When a rod stays stuck too long , it could overheat and no longer be useful for your welding projects . A stuck stick welding rod keeps you from working and could add up to a lot of wasted materials . Here are some stick welding tips for how to handle a stuck rod : <h> Keep Your Amperage High <p> One of the most common welding instructors ' tips you 'll find both in welding shops and online is to keep your amperage on the upper end of what 's recommended . That means you wo n't have a huge margin for error . You need to strike up and get moving before you burn through , create too much spatter , or lose control of your puddle . <p> However , once you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weld efficiently , you 'll find that your rod will- stick far less . Running too low an amperage is typically one of the most common reasons for a stuck electrode while stick welding . <h> Too Short an Arc <p> Another reason for a stuck electrode is you 're welding with too short an arc . Pay attention to your spatter if you get too far from your work piece . Recommendations vary depending on the thickness of your electrode and could be anywhere from a quarter to a half inch . If you keep getting stuck , try pulling back a little bit with the arc . <h> Do n't Use a Hot Rod <p> We 're getting to the part about how to remove a stuck electrode soon , but here is another tip that may save you a ton of aggravation . If you do get stuck while you 're welding and your rod heated up , a really hot rod will stick all of the time " you want a dry rod but not a hot rod . So give your rod time to cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a beginner , keep a bunch of dry rods handy so that you can keep learning from your mistakes as you adjust your settings and welding technique . Sometimes a rod will be ruined if it gets too hot , so be prepared to toss a rod if it overheats . <h> Pulling an Electrode from a Work Piece <p> The most common way to remove a stuck electrode is to give the electrode holder ( often called a stinger ) a sharp jerk . Do n't let it stay put too long . As soon as you 're stuck , get the electrode off because it 's going to draw a lot of current and heat up . If your first jerk does n't work , twist it back and forth to try to work your rod loose . Sometimes the first twist will loosen it up enough that a few more twists can make the difference . <p> If you ca n't get it loose , try depressing the rod release lever at the same time that you pull the holder quite hard . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you want to avoid touching the rod or work piece . <p> Remember that your metal work piece has an electrical current running through it from your welder . So you do n't want to touch the metal unless you have a solid ground and the welding machine is off . Plenty of welders have lived to tell of pulling an electrode loose with their gloved hands while a machine is running , but it 's generally a good idea to avoid any kind of electrical shock , especially if you may have overlooked some water in your vicinity . <p> Stick welding is a simple and convenient welding process that can get quite a bit of work done . You should n't have to spend too much time stuck to your work piece while your stick welding . By adjusting your settings , paying attention to your technique , and learning how to effectively twist and jerk a stuck electrode , you 'll make sure that you 're stick welding and not stuck welding . 
@@25165805 @5165805/ <h> How to Convert from Acetylene to an Alternative Fuel <h> The Acetylene Shortage <p> Acetylene has been the cutting fuel of choice for oxy-welding , brazing , and cutting because it reaches the highest possible temperature , provides clean , efficient cuts , and offers versatility . While most welders would prefer to continue using acetylene for their oxy-fuel welding , there will be a shortage on acetylene for the foreseeable future due to an explosion at the main acetylene manufacturing plant in Louisville , KY . <p> While welders regularly debate in online forums the merits of acetylene verses the numerous alternatives available , the current shortage makes switching to alternatives a necessity for many welders who want to continue meeting their objectives . Without weighing in on the debate over which fuel is best for oxy-fuel cutting , this guide will provide information about some alternatives to acetylene in order to help welders find the best options for their projects . <h> Is It Worth Switching from Acetylene ? <p> While many acetylene welders have had to consider switching for the first time due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched from acetylene to propylene , propane , and the more recent HGX propane for cutting ( technically " oxy-cutting ) " and brazing . While some welders use acetylene for welding applications and can use MAPP as an alternative to acetylene , this guide will focus on using finding acetylene substitutes for cutting and brazing operations . <p> As with most welding decisions , fuel gas selection depends on the material 's thickness and length of cut . Therefore , switching from acetylene to one of these alternatives will sometimes be easier depending on the nature of the project . However , with a few modifications , most welders can stay on task with one of the acetylene alternatives . <p> When considering a fuel gas switch , welders will need to figure out which gas can help them achieve the desired temperature for cutting Acetylene was long the favorite because it burned hotter than any other gas ( see Bakers Fuel Comparison chart ) . However , many welders have been able to adjust their setups and techniques for alternative fuels and have been quite happy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative will also enjoy significant savings . <p> Below well outline what you need to know about the alternative fuels , compare their benefits and drawbacks , and how to make the switch from acetylene . <h> Acetylene Alternatives for Welding and Cutting <p> Propane for Oxy-cuttingPropane and other propane-based fuels are frequently used as substitutes for acetylene . In fact , many cutting operations have switched over to propane in order to save on fuel costs . While propane does n't  burn hot enough for welding , its outer cone offers a high number of BTUs . The flame for acetylene concentrates the heat inside the cone , which means that welders used to acetylene will need to adapt their technique in order to achieve the appropriate cutting temperature . <p> Welders who switch to propane may need to wait a little longer in order to heat the metal , but if they use the outer edge of the heat cone , theyll find that preheating wont take much longer than acetylene . Though acetylene tends to pre-heat faster , there are some important changes welders need to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many welders correctly note that its possible to switch over to propane by only changing a torch tip ( see below on changing torch tips ) , such a limited changeover will make the propane far less effective . Propane requires a different torch ( injector style ) because propane is a much heavier than other fuels and flows properly through a low-pressure injector torch . <p> Changing to the correct torch and torch tip enables propane to reach a higher temperature than what 's possible with only a new tip . In addition , an injector torch allows welders to make cuts that some claim to be cleaner and faster than acetylene . Propane also offers more versatility for bending and heating . <p> PropyleneMuch like propane , propylene is often misunderstood as ineffective as a fuel for cutting since it requires an injector torch in order to achieve optimal heat flow and cuts and concentrates the heat on the outer edges of the heat cone . Propylene requires different tips from acetylene , but they rarely need cleaning . The propylene tips provide eight holes for effective pre-heating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the correct torch and tip set up . <p> While propylene has some minor drawbacks and requires an investment in some new tools , no one can deny that a cylinder of propylene will outlast acetylene at about 3 to 1 , making it a cost-effective alternative for cutting . Therefore , any new equipment costs can be made up with significant fuel savings . <p> HGX PropaneHGX-3 is a new product on the market that can be added to propane in order to increase its performance , creating a mixture , referred to commonly as HGX propane , that cuts metal at temperatures comparable to acetylene . One gallon of HGX-3 can be added 1,000 gallons of propane . <p> HGX-3 increases the flame temperature of propane gas by 15% over , reaching flame temperatures of 5400F and uses less oxygen than acetylene . This makes HGX propane a viable alternative for welders used to the heat output and speed achieved with acetylene for flame cutting , brazing , and even some welding procedures such as aluminum welding and cast iron welding . Much like other alternative fuels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cleaner cut , but it also requires specific components such as compatible tips and hoses . <p> One of the biggest advantages alternative fuel gases such as HGX propane have over acetylene is its supply and storage . Acetylene must be supplied in individual cylinders with a maximum capacity of approximately 400 cubic feet per cylinder , while the alternative fuel gases can be supplied in either cylinders , bulk stations , and even from a pipeline . <p> MAPP for WeldingMAPP gas is one of the leading substitutes for acetylene in Oxy-welding . While other gases such as propane , propylene , and HGX Propane are more widely used for cutting and brazing , MAPP can be used in place of acetylene , even though MAPP does n't  burn quite as hot and can be expensive for large-scale operations . <h> Safety Concerns <p> Since the current acetylene shortage resulted from an explosion at a manufacturing plant , it goes without saying that safety is a major concern when choosing a cutting gas . One welder noted that the gas delivery driver is more than happy to switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbidethe majority of it is generated this waycan contain toxic impurities . In addition , using acetylene in a pressurized state makes it highly unstable . These reasons alone make switching to an alternative fuel preferable . <p> In addition , flashbacks and backfires , common headaches and hazards for welders using acetylene , are far less common for welders using propane-based alternatives . Leading welding industry publications such as The Fabricator are quick to point out the hazards of welding with acetylene . See the following articles : Safety : the Burning Issue in Oxy-fuel Torch Use and The Basics of Oxy-Fuel Use . <p> Propane is the most stable cutting fuel , and when HGX is added to propane , it remains stable while cutting at temperatures comparable to acetylene . In other words , HGX propane offers the safety and low cost of propane with the same cutting temperatures as acetylene . <h> Cost <p> Every business needs to weigh the cost of their materials against their performance . While HGX , propane , and propylene require some torch modifications and a slightly different position for welding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions for welders impacted by the acetylene shortage . <h> How to Make the Switch from Acetylene <p> While welders switching from acetylene to a propane-based fuel may be able to cut with a new tip , they are sacrificing the quality of their cuts , losing valuable time , and creating safety hazards . While a new tip is a given , a new torch will make effective cuts . I addition , running an R-Grade hose with an alternative fuel such as propane will deteriorate the hose over time and could lead to an explosion . <p> Here are the equipment changes you need to make in order to convert from acetylene : <p> Cylinder : Alternative Fuels are stored in different cylinders than acetylene including different sizes , wall construction , and valves . <p> Hose : There are many welders who assert that Grade " R " and " RM " hose are acceptable for acetylene , and they are technically correct as far as performance goes . However , " R " and " RM " hoses will deteriorate when used for alternative fuels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative fuels . <p> Cutting &amp; Heating Tips : Cutting and heating tips are designed for use with the related gases in order to allow for the proper level of gas flow and therefore sufficient temperatures for cutting . Learn more about the right cutting tips at The Fabricator . <p> Regulators : While some say that a regulator change is only necessary for those doing a lot of heating which requires a higher PSI , keep in mind that alternative fuel gas regulators have different pressure ranges and are marked specifically for the type of gas they service . These regulators will deliver the alternative fuel at higher pressures than acetylene which will facilitate the heating process . Once again , the old regulator may work , but using the wrong equipment with a new gas will sacrifice some of its performance . 
@@25165806 @5165806/ <h> Tips for Starting and Stopping When Arc Welding <p> When you 're welding it is expected that you will run out of an electrode before you complete the weld . It is important for welders to know how to start the weld again at the spot where they had to stop without forming excessive amounts of strike marks . Strike marks are also known as welding defects and can cause the weld area to form cracks . <p> If your electrode runs out you should stop welding immediately , and change the electrode so that you will be ready to continue welding . After you have reloaded the electrode and are ready to start welding again you will need to strike the arc . To successfully start the weld again you will need to strike the arc at a point beyond the point where you stopped . It is important that when you strike the arc it is going in the same direction that you will be welding so that it can be melted and covered by the new weld bead you will be creating . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to weld back up to the end of the bead where you stopped . Once you have reached the stop point you will now start welding at the point where you stopped and then reverse the direction of your weld and begin moving the bead forward until you cover your strike mark . At this point you should ensure that your welds are going in the same direction as the original weld . <p> When you reach the point where your strike mark is you will want to melt this area by applying the bead to the strike mark . This will melt the original strike mark and prevent cracks from forming after the weld is completed . Once the strike mark has been melted properly you should continue with the welding bead until you reach the end of the piece being welded . Once you reach the end of the metal you should then backtrack approximately 1/4 inch in order to fill in the crater that was left at the end of the metal you are welding .

I do n't  mind though , I also learned that when a welder runs out of an electrode , when you strike your next arc you should do it in the same direction to cover your weld up . <p> This is great info on welding . I did n't  realize that you should backtrack a quarter inch when you reach the end of the metal to fill the crater . Preventing cracks at the end of the weld sounds important , I will definitely keep that in mind if I am welding in the future .

The options can be overwhelming , and that is why we 've put together this welder buying guide . You 'll find important details to consider , a comparison of welder types , and information about the top selling brands from Baker 's Gas and Welding . <p> You ca n't have too much information when you 're buying a welder , but let 's begin with a few of the questions to ask prior to purchasing a welder . <p> What kind of welding work do you have in mind ? <p> Could you see yourself doing other projects in 6-12 months ? <p> Do you have the patience , desire , and ability to learn a complicated welding process ? <p> Are you looking for a quick and easy welding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Do you plan to weld only in the garage or will you work outside ? Will you travel with it ? <p> Are you able to support 220V power ? <p> How often will you use your welder ? <p> What kinds of materials do you plan on welding ? <p> Generally speaking , there are two kinds of people who weld . Some welders have a very narrow range of goalsnamely welding thin , simple metals quickly without too spending too much time learning welding techniques . Theyll read the manual and watch a few tutorials , but then they 're ready to get their small jobs done . In these cases a MIG welder in the 110 to 115v range is typically sufficient ( see this welder selection guide ) . <p> However , there are other welders who find that once they take a 110v welder home or into their shop , they soon find thick metal to weld and a 110v cant join it effectively . In addition , some welders find the lower voltage units harder to work with and feel constrained by the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wider range of materials for a longer period of time will want a higher powered unit such as a 175V to 251V MIG welder or a 220V stick welder . However , the higher powered models also need a proper power supply that can handle the higher voltage , which can add to the overall cost . <p> Cost , portability , and materials will all be important factors in determining when and what to buy for a welder . However , do n't  forget that a welder offers convenience , satisfaction , and new opportunities . There is far more to consider when looking at a welder than the price tag . <p> A welder is life-long investment that can pay off if chosen carefully for your specific needs . <h> How to Choose a Welder <p> A welder is a long term investment where many find that they get what they pay for . While it is sometimes advisable to test the waters with a used model , picking the right machine the first time around can save a lot of headaches and cash in the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of a big job or to discover that a used welder 's price can help make ends meet but the welder itself ca n't make two pieces of metal meet . <p> The best welder will complete every project that comes down the pike and minimizes limitations . This means that the most expensive welder is not always the best for each situation . However , the cheapest welding machine that ca n't handle every job a welder hopes to accomplish fails to pay for itself . <h> The Work Determines the Welder <p> One of the most important questions to consider when selecting a welder is n't what projects it will be used for in the next week , month , or even year . Those interested in buying a welder need to ask if they see themselves using it more frequently in the future for many different kinds of projects . <p> As you review your options , ask yourself , " Am I the kind of person who learns how to use a tool for as many projects as possible or am I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " In other words , using a welder for many other projects in the future will mean looking into purchasing a welder that operates with more power and has a longer duty cycleboth of which will be explained below . <p> In addition , each kind of welder has its limitations and benefits . For example , a MIG welder is extremely easy to use and quite versatile , but some welders find TIG welders even more versatile and useful for a broader range of applications , even if they are more difficult to learn . MIG , TIG , and Stick welders will be compared below . If you 're completely new to purchasing a welder , it is best to consult a professional to ensure it meets your specific needs . Contact a professional at Baker 's Gas and Welding now . <h> Welder Choices <h> MIG Welders <p> MIG Welders are extremely popular because they tend to cost less than TIG or Stick welders with comparable power and features , are extremely easy to learn , and can tackle a wide variety of projects . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welders can use both hands to hold the torch steady rather than using one hand to add filler metal , as in TIG welding . The wire feeder also makes MIG welding up to four times faster . <p> The MIG welding process uses an inert gas to shield the weld and to keep it free from impurities . This makes MIG welding very neat and easy to clean up since there is n't anything to chip away , which is typical for Stick welding . <p> MIG welding can be used on a wide variety of materials such as aluminum and is also frequently used for automotive work . However , MIG also requires the purchase of shielding gas and generally requires materials that cost more when compared to other methods . <h> TIG Welding <p> When appearance counts , TIG welding creates a high quality , clean weld that is far less likely to distort the metal by using a nonconsumable tungsten electrode . There is no need to worry about splatter because it only uses the necessary amount of filler metal needed in the welding puddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , TIG is fairly specialized and requires a good deal of training in order to master itso make sure any TIG welder purchase is paired with a plan to take welding classes . Instead of the point and shoot simplicity of MIG welding , TIG requires the use of a foot pedal to regulate the welding process . A filler rod that is separate from the torch must be fed in gradually . <p> Many professional welders prefer TIG because it can weld a wide variety of metals and because of the versatility of argon gas used during TIG welding . There is no slag to block the view of the weld puddle . Argon gas can weld any metal at any thickness with TIG welding , and therefore there is no need to change the gas depending on the project . <h> Stick Welding <p> Stick welding is one of the most effective techniques for fusing alloys and joints , but it is also the least efficient . The process utilizes a consumable stick electrode that works anywhere , inside or outside , and the welding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a shielding gas . Rather , the electrode is coated with flux that covers the weld and protects it . This layer must be chipped away when the weld is completed . <p> Because it does n't require shielding gas , stick welding remains popular and cost-effective . It 's also the most convenient since a welder can easily switch from one metal work piece to another by changing the filler metal rod in order to match it to the metal workpiece . <h> Power Options for Welders <p> Welders with a higher power output can work with thicker metals , but higher voltage welders will require special power supply set upseither generators or appropriate power outlets . A welder with lower voltage in the 100 's will not be able to handle heavy duty jobs , but it can be plugged in and operated from any outlet . Any welder with power over 115V can not run off a typical power outlet and will naturally cost more to run . <p> In addition , welders will either run an alternating current ( AC ) that reverses itself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows in one direction and does not reverse itself . DC offers a steady rate of energy that leads to hotter temperatures and deeper weld penetration . <p> AC welders usually cost less than DC welders , but the available electrodes are far more limited for AC . In fact , DC welders are more costly but remain popular because their higher power offers a wider selection of electrodes and a number of working advantages such as : simple arc striking , better penetration , and improved control . Welders who expect to work on a wide variety of projects may want to consider an AC/DC combination welder . <h> Choosing a Welder with the Right Duty Cycle <p> A duty cycle is the length of time a welder can run before it needs to be turned off in order to cool . The less expensive welders have shorter duty cycles , while the more expensive welders have longer duty cyclessome can even run continuously at a 100% duty cycle . <p> Longer duty cycles are critical when welding thicker metals that require more time on task .

During preheating and welding metal is heated to high temperatures and the welding arc emits extremely concentrated rays that can cause sun burns very quickly . <p> It 's very easy to get burned during the welding process , but thankfully , these burns are also extremely easy to prevent if you take proper precautions . If you are burned or flashed , we 'll provide some tips on treatment , though all treatment advice should be cleared with your own doctor who is able to inspect your injuries . <h> Burns and Welding Helmets <p> Depending on the type of welding you 're doing , you will need the right lens for your visor or helmet . Mig welding requires a #10 lens while arc welding generally calls for a #12 filter . TIG welding is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the right visor for the job . The ultra violet light generated from welding is extremely bright , and it can cause sever damage to your eyes if you do n't have eye protection . Retinal flash burns are common for those who do not wear the right kind of visor . <p> Goggles are sometimes used for cutting applications , but it 's often better to wear something that provides complete protection to your face and hair such as a shield or helmet with grinding and cutting screen options . There are some " hair on fire " stories out there ! There also are stories of welders who thought they could cheat by closing their eyes while making a few quick welds . The problem is , they then burned their eye lids . <p> The right helmet will have a viewing area that provides UV protection and covers your entire face . The best protection from flash will be a helmet that provides auto-darkening through a series of 2-4 sensors and a series of shade settings so that you have excellent visibility and protection whenever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you 're working and a flash occurs , an auto-darkening helmet will adapt to the brightness of the flash and protect your eyes so you can keep working comfortably . <h> Burns and Welding Gloves <p> If you search online for pictures of TIG welders , you 'll often find welders feeding in the wire with one bare hand , which is never a good idea when you 're working with the UV rays and sparks emitted while arc welding . MIG and stick welding produce sparks and spatter that can burn your hands , and if you 're feeding TIG wire , the UV rays from the arc can still burn your exposed skin . Ever try feeding a wire with sunburned fingers ? <p> There are different material thicknesses and types of leather depending on which welding glove you choose . The best glove will protect your hand from the heat , spatter , and sparks emitted while welding . Some welders add extra pieces of flame-resistant material to the parts of their hands that are closest to the welding arc . <h> Burns and Welding Clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid synthetic fabrics , since any sparks that land in synthetic clothing will catch fire and burn you quickly . 100% cotton clothing is your best option for welding since the sparks will just smolder a little in cotton . Heavy duty boots that are static electricity resistant will also keep your feet safe . If you 're working with heavy metal workpieces , then a steel toe boot will be your best option . <h> Burns and Welding Bibs , Jackets , and Aprons <p> If you weld in a colder climate , a leather work jacket is a great option for welders who want to protect themselves from sparks . If you 're working in a warmer climate there are many different kinds of flame resistant jackets available . Depending on the process you 're using , you may not need a heavy duty apron or jacket . <p> Also , if you 're welding at a work station , you can attach a bib to your helmet and wear welding sleeves to protect your arms . You can also wear an apron to protect yourself with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a warmer climate or workshop . Aprons focus the protective material where it matters most . <h> Burns and Welding Materials <p> Do not let the hot electrode come in contact with bare skin . It is extremely hot and can scorch your skin in an instant . Also make sure to remove all hot metal pieces from the work station after you are done welding a particular piece . If you need to cool off your metal workpiece , keep your gloves on until you 're done handling it . <h> Burns and Welding Workstations <p> An innocent woven rug off to the side or a pile of sawdust nearby your welder can catch sparks , smolder , and catch fire after you 're done welding . There are many commonesense practices that can protect you from burns or worse while welding , such as always making sure your work area is clear of flammable liquids or gases that could ignite while you work . <h> How to Treat Welding Burns <p> Once you 're burned , there is nothing to do other than try to make yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to treating welding burns . However , if you do get burned , you need to assess how severe it is . If you have any open wounds , be sure to treat them with disinfectant . More serious burns should be checked out by a doctor who may also be able to give you something to ease the pain . <p> In most cases , you 'll need to just apply something to cool the intense sunburn that arc welding causes to exposed skin . Some use aloe vera , but it 's generally agreed that a topical steroid will bring a lot more relief . It will be well worth going to a doctor just to get the right treatment for your burns . You may also contact your local pharmacy to find out if there are any over the counter remedies such as hydrocortinsone that may provide some relief to your burns . <h> How to Treat Welder 's Flash <p> The most important thing you can do for any eye injury that results from welding is to consult an eye doctor . There are plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an eye injury , but the problem is you need a first hand opinion on the best treatment for your eyes . Most eye doctors will give you eye drops and make sure your eye is n't infected , but other than that , you will most likely need to just keep your eyes shut and let them heal . If you are flashed , keep your eyes closed and avoid rubbing them in order to prevent further injury . <p> Some welders have found that strips of wet gauze on top of their closed eyes can be soothing after being flashed . In addition , it 's often recommended to sleep with your eyes covered just to ensure your eyes are n't exposed to any light . In addition , wear sunglasses when you go outside until you 're absolutely sure that your eye is fully recovered .

Sounds like a fair question , especially if- you have interest- in becoming a certified welder , because the answer seems to depend upon who you ask . In short , being a certified welder means you hold a certification ( as in an official printed certificate ) certifying you have the ability to produce welds according to accepted standards , formally prescribed in writing . <h> Definition of a Certified Welder <p> The governing powers in the welding trade have published a definitive series of procedures dictating the method by which various welds are to be executed . To become certified , a welder must take a test in which he 's judged and graded based on how well he conforms to the written procedure governing the type of weld he 's executing . By passing the test , the welder earns his certification . Each procedure has its own test . Pretty straightforward . <h> How do You become a Certified Welder ? <p> The 6 steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help guide you along the path to earning your welding certification : <h> Step 1 <p> Complete a welder 's training program . There are a variety of online resources which can help direct you to welding school in your area . More than likely , your local community college offers a welder 's training program that 's designed ( at least in part ) to prepare you for welding a certification test . The American Welding Society ( AWS ) is also a valuable resource , visit them online at www.aws.org . <h> Step 2 <p> Acquire a copy of the written welding procedures governing the type of welding process on the exam , and practice creating welds according to procedure . The welding certification exam is a practical test , meaning you will create a weld for the specific type of welding process you 're testing on . <h> Step 3 <p> Practice , practice , and when you think you might be ready , practice some more .

MIG and TIG welding both use an electric arc to make the weld . <p> MIG welding is a very simple and easy process to learn compared to learning how to TIG weld . The technical names for these are metal inert gas ( MIG ) , and tungsten inert gas ( TIG ) . <p> A MIG welder works by using a continuously feeding spool of welding wire that burns , melts and fuses both the base and parent metals together .

The other way is a much more fine and delicate welding technique . <p> The most versatile machine is the TIG welder as you can weld many different types of metals . The downside is that it is very slow . For anybody wanting to do some welding at home your better choice of machine to buy would have to be the wire feeding MIG welder . <p> great article . really think author is a credible source to learn . the biggest difference is the use of non-consumable electrode in TIG while the use of consistent consumable electrode which is wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> really good article , I have researched several times on differences between MIG , TIG and flux and the above information provides true understandable insights not described by others ; thanks , I enjoyed this ! <p> I have used both mig &amp; tig and I have to say that the wire feed is great for steel the hardest thing to learn was remembering what gas and type of wire for different types of meatal .

You need to have an uncontrollable desire to succeed and enjoy dealing with people . As I wrote in my book many times , people buy from people they like , and that is a fact of life . To succeed in this or any business , you need to like going out to introduce yourself to potential customers , spending countless hours bidding on contracts , and after all that , your efforts may not pay off for a long time . Besides being a people person , you need the creativity to come up with new or innovative business ideas that nobody else is doing . Any business in general is a gamble , and you need to keep a laser-like focus on the ultimate goal , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conversely , what type of individual is not suited for the role ? <p> Zielinski : I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but here is the truth . Most welders , fabricators , and machinists are not good candidates to run a business . Craft professionals do n't like getting involved in politics , nor are they the outgoing sales and networking types . If all you want to do is weld or fabricate , then a business is definitely not for you . <p> Ask yourself this : Am I willing to spend the next few months knocking on the doors of strangers ? If the answer is no , then a business is not for you . Welders need to understand that if you do n't have a paying customer , then how can you expect to strike an arc ? This simply tells you that a business is not for you ; save your time and money for things that you enjoy . <p> Question : How well should a potential owner be able to weld before considering opening his or her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are starting from and the industry they want to service . Since this is a tough question to answer , I will give a couple of examples : starting a one-person mobile welding business and starting a metal fabrication shop .

I would say you should at least be able to pass a 6G E6010 open root with an E7018 fill and cap welding certification , and a stainless 6G open root TIG all the way out certification . At the very minimum , you should be able to pass a 4G welding cert . <p> A lot of welders do n't want to hear that , but you need to remember that as a one-man shop , there is no one to turn to for help . You are on your own , and you really need to know what you are doing . Besides that , chances are that you are going to get some jobs that will require you to weld in some really tight places and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business . <p> A Metal Fabrication Shop . If you are starting a one-person metal fabrication shop , you might be fine with a 3G MIG and stick certification . In this case , the business is more about fabricating and building products . <p> On the other hand , if you have the financial freedom to hire welders and fabricators from day one , then you do n't need to know how to weld . However , you should have a strong enough industry background to understand the issues that come with working with metals . It 's my personal opinion that many engineers and project managers working these days are not qualified to manage many of these jobs . They , like a good business owner , reached their positions by networking and selling themselves to the right people , but are not truly qualified for these positions . For example , not properly understanding metals , they may rush jobs that should n't be rushed , such as welding chrome pipe . <p> When it comes to welding skills , it is not easy to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many industries .

For example , you might charge four hours of labor to weld a 5-in. pipe , but welding that same 5-in. pipe in a tight spot might require 25 or more hours to weld .

This is the best case and easiest way to get started as a welding business . It is as easy as hiring yourself out as an independent contractor to local businesses that need temporary help . All you need is the right insurance and basic personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . For under $1,000 , you could become profitable in just a few days . <p> Mobile Welding Business . This type of business typically becomes profitable in about six months . A lot of expenses need to be recouped before you see a free and clear paycheck . Your costs are the vehicle , welding and cutting equipment , insurance , living expenses , and advertising . You need to remember that the more you spend on equipment , the longer it will take to turn a profit . You can buy a used rig and equipment and cut your break-even point by a significant amount of time or spend $100,000 on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shop . Fab shops need a lot of start-up capital , so the point of profitability can range from a few months to at least five years . If you are building boat T-tops and aluminum boating accessories , then it may take only a few weeks to break even . If you are fabricating pressure vessels , the necessary equipment can cost millions , which means it can take 10 years or longer to reach profitability . <p> If you are planning to open a welding business , you need to develop a business plan . Most welders think business plans are a waste of time . The truth is , a business plan will give you a very good idea about how much money and time you need to establish your business . <p> Question : When it 's time to hire employees , what is the best way to find them and to figure out how much to pay them ? <p> Zielinski : It 's time to hire when you find yourself spending more than 40 hours a week welding and fabricating . While this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's also a dangerous time , because you are so busy servicing current customers that you lose sight of attracting new customers . <p> I do not suggest hiring employees in the traditional sense . Besides making the financial commitment , you also need to realize that committing to a full time employee is also committing to support the person and his family . As a business owner you need to understand that these people will depend on you for their survival and that should not be taken lightly . <p> I suggest hiring independent contractors or using a staffing agency . In my opinion , independent contracting is the future of jobs . They are self-employed workers that typically are paid more than traditional employees but are legally responsible for themselves . They work for a flat hourly rate agreed upon in a contract and do n't cost you anything in terms of insurance or other administrative fees that traditional employees require . They do not receive overtime wages , and once the job is done , there are no unemployment benefits . <p> Contractors earn more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the freedom to hire as many workers as needed . Contractors typically are aspiring welding business owners and are highly skilled . <p> For short bursts of extra work , I also would consider using a staffing agency that provides temporary workers before committing to any long-term financial obligations . <p> The hourly rate can be difficult to determine because of the many different areas and skill sets in welding . As a basic guideline , I would offer the going welder overtime rate for your area and industry , which should be somewhere around the time-and-a-half rate for the type of work to be performed . <p> Some suggestions for finding welders are through word-of-mouth , local schools , welding inspectors , welding supply stores , and publications such as Industrial Projects Report and Industrial Tradesman . These are all resources for welders who want to own their own businesses and are looking for a foot in the door to working for themselves . <p> Another alternative is borrowing welders from other welding businesses that are slow and giving that owner a small markup on the hourly rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break and some much-needed income . This way , everybody is happy ! <p> Question : What is the downside to starting your own welding business ? <p> Zielinski : As with all businesses , the downside is long-term commitment . This is a financial and geographical commitment that once you start , you ca n't just get up and move to another place . As an employee , you can quit and walk away at any time . Business owners do n't have that option , because it takes a lot of time , money , and work to start a business . Besides , once you get a taste of the freedom and money that can be had , it becomes an addition . <p> Question : What do you believe is the biggest reason a new welding business fails , beyond the obvious " no customers ? <p> Zielinski : Most welding businesses fail because they have no real business plan . In my book , there is a subchapter with a title that sums up business plans : If you fail to plan , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you just work as much as you want and spend whatever you feel like ? No . We all budget for what we need and want for the amount of money we earn for a certain period of time . Planning for business is no different than planning for life . We know what we need to earn and we spend accordingly to what we can afford . Many new business owners simply fail to plan , and that almost always ends in a plan to fail ! <p> Question : What aspect of business do new owners overlook the most ? <p> Zielinski : Customers are everything ! Most welders use a business as an excuse to buy personal toys " aka , welding equipment " and forget that as a business owner , you are no longer a welder . You need to focus on getting the business in the door the same way you go about finding a job by marketing your resume to hiring companies . The reality of a welding business is that you need to be a good salesperson who goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember this : You ca n't strike an arc if you do n't have a paying customer who needs your service . <p> Question : What is the single most important piece of advice you can give would-be owners . <p> Zielinski : If you want to start a welding business , you need to have a good business plan on how you are going to make it happen . <p> My book is loaded with information on how to make it happen , ranging from small , start-up independent contracting jobs all the way up to securing multibillion-dollar government contracts for well-established businesses . There 's a section on getting free government help , such as meeting face-to-face with other successful business owners that already have done what you are trying to do . <p> The Welding Business Owner 's Handbook is available directly through CreateSpace ( an Amazon Company ) and at most online retailers , such as Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble .

Here are some tips for a safe and functional garage set up for welding . <h> Welder Set Up for Garage Welding Projects <p> The best option for welding at home is to store welders on a cart that can be wheeled into the middle of the garage . This is safer , easier to clean up , and much more versatile for a variety of projects . A welding table- and cart with wheels and a lower shelf is an ideal work space solution . Be sure to choose heavy duty metal and wheels for both , as welding sometimes involves heavy materials . <h> Power Set Up for Garage Welding Projects <p> While regular power outlets are enough for some smaller welders , the larger welding machines will need a higher electrical output . One welder asked an electrician friend to install a 50 amp 220v circuit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixtures , which is a great way to improve the functionality of a work area . <h> Proper Storage for Garage Welding Projects <p> Cardboard boxes , cloth , and paper are just a few of the flammable materials that can be set aflame with the sparks from welding or grinding . Most welders suggest metal cabinets or storage containers that are n't flammable . <h> Safety for Garage Welding Projects <p> Safety is the most important aspect of welding at home since a tiny spark can lead to a lot of damage , especially if the garage is connected to the house . Remove flammable materials such as rugs out of the vicinity of the welder as well as any other fuels or gases that are n't in use . Be sure that other gas and fuel canisters are securely fastened in place and are stored properly in an upright position . <p> Keep fire extinguishers handy , not tucked away in a back corner . If possible , only do metal-working in one space and wood working in another . The accumulated saw dust in cracks and gaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Welders with mixed use spaces use air blowers to clean their work spaces- and frequently check for any smoke or smoldering after completing their projects . <p> In the case of attached garages , take into consideration your ventilation needs , especially- for the winter . Usually an open window with a box fan will be enough to ventilate a welding area , but check with a welding professional before starting a project . <p> Typical welding safety includes being sure your welder is appropriately grounded and that your work area is free from clutter such as unnecessary hoses and power cords . In addition , check the hoses routinely for leaks and kinks . The best welding set up is one that minimizes distractions and hazards that can get in the way while working on a project . <p> While a mobile welding table or welding cart needs locks that will keep it in place , some welders- put pins into the concrete of their garage so that they can maximize the stability of their carts . <p> For added safety , create a welding " shield " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets . This will protect the garage from sparks and also contain the mess . For welders who want to work with the garage door open but fear exposing passersby with UV rays , there are clear screens that can be put up across the garage opening that allow in light but block the rays . <h> Seasonal Considerations for Garage Welding Projects <p> Most building codes require a separate HVAC system for a garage , and therefore welders living in colder climates will want to explore safe and simple ways to ventilate their workspaces while generating heat for winter projects , as well as the possibility of insulating the garage . For welders in a hot climate , a window AC unit is most likely the best option . 48841 @qwx248841 <h> 4 thoughts on " How to Set Up a Garage for Welding Projects " <p> This is very helpful post . Anyone who plans to do some welding on their garage need to know the safety precautions before doing anything there . Accidents may happen due to our clumsiness and unawareness . <p> The first thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't use or need . If you have n't used a tool in a year , chances are you do n't need it , unless it is a specific or expensive tool that you really may use in the future . Useless tools take up precious space . When you 're finished taking out unwanted tools , think of a way to redesign your garage in such a way that you can move easily around in it . <p> You have heat sparks flying in all directions when you are welding as well as metal parts in many cases . Naturally , you are going to want to protect yourself as much as possible when you are welding by using proper equipment . 
@@25165818 @5165818/ <h> How to Weld Faster <p> Welding faster may sound appealing , but aside from practice , there are few shortcuts when creating a strong weld . In fact , unless a situation calls for a fast-moving weld , there 's a good chance that slow and steady is the way to go . <p> An online search for ways to weld faster , will yield either descriptions of the ways automated welding has increased welding speed or press releases from companies who claim their gas or electrode holds the key to improving welding speed . In other words , it can seem like spending a lot of money is the only way to weld faster . <p> However , for those looking for some ways to save time on their welding projects , there are some ways to weld faster for certain projects . While its not always a good idea to find a way to weld faster , there are situations when welding faster may produce a better product or a few simple changes can speed up the time on task . <h> Set Up Correctly in Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings , and electrode selection will impact how fast welders can work . Industrial welders invest time in planning the size and shape of their welding areas , how parts are laid out , and how they supply their shielding gas . Testing settings or an electrode on a piece of scrap metal , especially for a beginners , will save time in the long run . Learn more about setting up an efficient shop here . <h> Welding Downhill Increases Welding Speed <p> While welding downhill is a faster way to weld , its not as strong as welding uphill . On most projects its not worth sacrificing strength and durability for the sake of welding speed . However , if the metal is thin enough , then welding downhill wont make the weld weaker and may even be the correct technique for the job . Learn about uphill and downhill welding and see these diagrams of vertical and downhill welding . <h> Flat-Position Welding Increases Welding Speed <p> Its common knowledge that welding in a horizontal position will be the easiest and fastest way to weld . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welding puddle will stay in place . Take some time to evaluate each project before beginning in order to make sure the majority of welds can be completed in this position . If a job calls for vertical welding , see this article about vertical welding . <h> Core Wire Feeder Increases TIG Welding Speed <p> For professional welders hoping to speed up TIG welding , a core wire feeder will add filler metal through an automated process . Watch this video on how it works . This enables welders to work with both hands and to maintain a constant flow of wire into the welding puddle . <p> Ed Craig at the Frabricator writes about the wire feeder process first developed in Europe , saying it is " suitable for all-position welding on materials of any thickness , the process addresses traditional GTAW limitations and can enhance both manual and automated TIG weld quality and productivity .

One of the ways around the unstable arc caused by helium is using an argon-helium mixture , especially for GTAW welding when its important to control the heat input . <p> An argon-helium mixture will improve the quality and speed when AC welding aluminum . In addition , the mixture makes it easier to strike an arc . <h> Preheat Certain Projects for Increased Welding Speed <p> When TIG welding aluminum or magnesium , preheating the work area after it is cleaned will improve both welding speed and the penetration of the weld . <h> Pulsed-Current TIG Welding Increases Welding Speed <p> TIG welders can increase the speed and quality of their welds by working in pulsed-current mode . This method allows them to fuse the metals together using the higher pulse current and then cooling and solidifying the weld by switching to the lower level background current . <h> MIG Welding Increases Welding Speed <p> In addition to welding aluminum and other softer metals , MIG-welding works faster , provides cleaner welds , and handles many different types of metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct currents , a steady stream of inert gas , and precise control of their torches . <p> The amount of heat generated from MIG welding provides the deep penetration required for a strong weld , while also melting the feed wire rapidly enough to maintain a higher welding speed than other techniques .

While each electrode has its advantages , the fast-fill electrodes melt quickly and allow welders to work faster . <h> Welding at the Right Speed <p> Sometimes welding faster is the solution to problems caused by welding too slow .

In fact , many online welding forums are full of questions from new welders who do n't realize that most of their problems have relatively simple solutions . <p> We 've reviewed some of the most common mistakes and questions that we could find and created this roundup of MIG welding tips that should save new welders a ton of time when they strike their arcs for a new welding project . <h> Skipping the Cleaning and Grinding <p> Most new welders are n't aware of how clean they really need to make their metal work pieces before they get to work . While there 's going to be a little bit of impurity in most welds , you need to grind down the metal before you lay down a solid weld . <p> You can also angle your torch to keep the impurities from settling into your weld . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal wire . If you 're welding with flux core wire , you 'll just need to clean off the flux when you 're done . <h> MIG Welding without a Solid Ground Clamp <p> If your welder is sparking and sputtering and you ca n't lay down a good bead , the first thing every experienced welder suggests checking is your ground clamp . OK , may that 's not the first thing you should check every time , but using a small or poorly placed ground clamp while MIG welding will lead to a frustrating time , and it 's the easiest thing to fix . <h> MIG Welding the Right Materials <p> While a hobby welder can usually weld a variety of metals in small quantities without too much struggle , keep in mind that a MIG welder is best for steel .

I know you can find forum postings where welders claim their 115V MIG machines can handle more than they expected . However , do n't put yourself or anyone else in danger by trying to weld more than your machine can handle . If you do n't have enough amperage , your weld wo n't get enough penetration into the weld joint in order to make a solid weld . <h> Check Your Polarity Settings <p> If you 're welding with solid wire , set your machine to reverse polarity ( DCEP ) , but if you 're working with flux core MIG wires , you may need to use the DCEN setting . You should also experiment a little bit on some scrap metal .

Well , you wo n't find everything you may want to know here since every welder has a slightly different set up , but well give you some tips for getting started . <h> Defining Scratch Start TIG Welding <p> While you can start a TIG welder with a high frequency start or a lift TIG function , modifying a stick welder with a TIG torch is a different matter . Welders use the scratch start method for this type of TIG welding , which involves a very quick match strike motion to start the arc . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal , many- tend to grind the tungsten into a sharp point and then strike it . <p> The main challenge of course with scratch start TIG welding is keeping your electrode clean . While a quick strike on the metal is essential and not lifting it more than 1/8 once it starts will help , you also need to make sure your metal is completely clean . Grind and sand down any impurities before starting up your welder to ensure there are no contaminants . Keep your grinder handy as well if you get any contamination into your weld while you work . <h> When Do Welders Use Scratch Start TIG Welding <p> If you already have a DC stick welding machine or an AC/DC stick welding machine , you have the key component you need in order to scratch start TIG welding .

TIG welding is used to weld steel , stainless steel , chromalloy , aluminum , nickel alloys , magnesium , copper , brass , bronze , and even gold . View a diagram of the TIG welding process here . <h> Applications for TIG Welding <h> About This Article <p> This is not an exhaustive guide to every TIG welding scenario , procedure , and consideration . If you are new to welding and unsure about your material , equipment , or technique , please consult an expert . The following article is a series of guidelines that will provide basic welding information and links , but is not a substitute for an expert 's on-site advice .

There is no need to worry about splatter because it only uses the necessary amount of filler metal needed in the welding puddle . Because the Argon gas used during TIG welding ( most common gas used ) , there is no slag to block the view of the weld puddle . Argon gas can weld any metal at any thickness with TIG welding , and therefore there is no need to change the gas depending on the project . <h> Setting Up <p> As long as the metal you are welding is free of any oil , grease , paint , zinc , or lead , TIG welding does not create any harmful fumes or smoke . However , for a good weld the metals do need to be clean prior to welding . Like MIG welding , TIG welding can be done in a variety of positions , but it is often safer than MIG welding . <p> Invest in a helmet , gloves , jacket , boots , clamps , and any other safety gear your project may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIG produces far less than MIG welding ) , static electricity , and possibly toxic fumes . Consult a professional if unsure about the proper safety measures for your welding project . <p> Once all safety concerns have been addressed , select the appropriate electrode . There are a number of tungsten alloys ( use a respirator when using thoriated tungsten : it is radioactive ) which are suited to welding different alloys of metal . <p> Tungsten comes in 5 commonly used grades that are color coded : <p> The pure grade is color coded green and provides good arc stability for arc welding and is the least expensive . <p> Ceriated is color coded orange and also permits easy arc starting , good arc stability , and longevity . <p> Thoriated is color coded red and has a higher current capacity than Ceriated and has a high resistance to weld pool contamination , however it is more difficult to maintain a balled end on AC . <p> Lanthanated is color coded gold and works much like the thoriated . <p> Zirconiated is color coded brown and is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent for AC welding . The higher quality tungsten will always give the best results . <p> If there any questions during the set up process , see Miller 's thorough introduction to setting up a welder . Setting up the TIG welder includes : assembling the torch and then connecting the torch to the welder , the remote control , and the work clamp to the welder . Use this guide in order to select the correct polarity settings . This guide will also suggest the best gas . <p> Once the welder is set , grind the tungsten to either a ball or a point depending on the nature of the project . A balled tip typically works well for AC welding and a pointed tip for DC welding . A pointed tip results in a smaller , more directed arc . The arc will tend to dance around when the tip is rounded . <p> When the tungsten has been installed into the torch ( see this video on how to install the electrode ) , plug in the welder , making sure it 's plugged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn on the gas . Welding heats metals to particularly high temperatures where the metal can rust . Gas prevents rust while welding . One welder recommends using pure argon for aluminum and an argon/carbon/dioxide mixture for steel . <h> Basic Welding Tips <p> Those new to TIG welding should practice on scrap metal in order to learn both proper pedal movement , welding techniques , and how to feed the metal rod into the welding puddle . <p> While welding , hold the torch at a 70deg- 80deg angle . Keep the torch off the work surface so that the tungsten never makes contact with it - aim for a space of 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch . The tungsten is not consumed during the welding process , but rather produces heat . If the tungsten touches the work piece , it will contaminate the material and ruin the tungsten 's tip . If this happens , regrind the tungsten before proceeding . <p> The foot pedal regulates the heat . Therefore beginners should practice controlling the heat in order to learn how the weld puddle increases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1/4 inch wide . Learn to control the pedal so that the puddle size stays consistent while welding , rather than shrinking to an ineffective size or spreading too far . <p> Though small gaps can be filled without additional metal , larger gaps may require a filler metal that is typically a 3-foot-long rod . Holding the filler metal in the free hand , make sure it rests horizontally at a 15deg angle ( not pointed down ) from the material . After heating ; the base metal into a puddle , gently dab the filler into it . In order to avoid large deposits of filler , dab the filler quickly . <p> While welding it 's important to keep the TIG rod moving toward the pool of melted metal . Before beginning a welding project , practice holding the TIG rod in one hand and feeding it with a steady rhythm . Watch this tutorial video in order to learn how to hold a TIG rod and move it faster . <p> For tips on welding technique , see the Tips by Tom Davis . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of scenarios , especially welding aluminum . For illustrations of basic TIG welding techniques , see Miller 's TIG Guide . Consult Millers Hints and Tips in order to learn about the different joints and which angle to hold the torch for each one . <h> Correcting Common Mistakes <p> Some common problems that TIG welders come across are fairly simple to correct . <p> In order to prevent the metal from warping , avoid welding in one straight line . Rather , weld part of one side and then switch to the other so that each side has a chance to cool and hold the metal in place while welding . <p> If the tungsten is burning too quickly , it could be due to one of the following : inadequate gas flow , the electrode operating as a positive rather than a negative , using the wrong size tungsten for task , or using gas containing oxygen or CO2 instead of Argon gas . In order to correct the gas flow , check the hose , gas valve , and torch to make sure they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not out or close to running out of gas .

Stick welding provides plenty of power and sends imperfections in the weld to the top of the weld puddle so that they can be chipped off with brush , hammer , or sand paper after cooling . <p> Stick welding alone does n't guarantee a clean weld that is free from impurities . Your welding preparations and technique have just as much to do with your weld as your ability to use a chipping hammer , wire brush , or sand paper . Here are some key stick welding tips for getting the best finished weld when there 's slag in the mix . <h> Stick Weld with Plenty of Power <p> You need arc force to push the slag in your weld puddle back and out of the metal joint . The more power you have , the less slag there will be , provided you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stick welding at the upper end of your amperage settings ensures you can keep a tight arc and cerate a clean finished weld . <p> A stick welder working with lower amperage will not have enough power to push the slag , fuse the metal together , or keep the arc tight and focused . The arc may skip around and even cause spatter all over your metal " let alone all over yourself . <h> Stick Welding Technique <p> The angle of your stick welding arc plays a major role in keeping slag out of your weld puddle . A slight drag angle of about 15 degrees is a good place to start , but do n't be afraid to increase or decrease your angle if you 're working in vertical or horizontal welding positions that call for a slightly different angle . Your angle needs to be adapted to the position of your project . <p> However , if you do n't have an angle to your electrode , you 're just burning straight into the metal . Your slag wo n't be pushed out to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weld . <h> Avoid the 6013 Stick Welding Rods <p> Stick welding rods that are 6010 or 7018 are pretty typical for most welding jobs . While some welding schools use 6013 , many working welders blame the 6013 rods for many of their problems with welds . Even welding at the correct amperage is n't good enough to ensure that these electrodes will get the job done right in some cases . <h> Build Your Beads for Multiple Passes <p> One of the best ways to avoid problems with contaminated welds is to plan your welds for multiple passes . The wider the weld , the more you need to plan out multiple passes . If you do n't line up your beads correctly , the flux could be trapped inside the weld bead of your next pass . <h> File Your Welding Electrode <p> Slag will build up on the tip of your stick welding electrode , and while welders have come up with several creative ( and dangerous ) ways to remove these , the best plan is to keep a heavy duty metal file on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the time to file down your welding rod when the slag builds up . <h> Weld at a Steady Speed <p> You need power to push slag to the top of the weld puddle , but you also need the right amount of time for the slag to rise up .

Moving too fast will leave the slag right in your finished weld . <h> Clean Your Metal Before Welding <p> While stick welding can handle impurities in your metal work piece , it does n't hurt to take some preventative measures by cleaning , grinding , or sanding the weld joint in order to remove oil , grease , or any other imperfection that could ruin your weld . 48841 @qwx248841 <h> One thought on " How to Beat the Slag in Stick Welding " <p> Interesting article !

An auto-darkening welding helmet features a lens that instantly darkens to protect the welder 's eyes from the harmful UV light that is created during the welding process . Many auto-darkening welding helmets feature settings that can be used to compensate for the different types of welding and the different levels of light created by the welding arc .

Remember electricity is lazy . It wants to take the path of least resistance . If you get too far away from the work piece , resistance between the work piece and electrode ( cutting circuit ) is much higher than the resistance between the tip and electrode ( pilot circuit ) .

@@25165829 @5165829/ <h> How to Choose a Welder <p> A welder is a long term investment where many find that they get what they pay for . While it is sometimes advisable to test the waters with a used model , picking the right machine the first time around can save a lot of headaches and cash in the long term . No one wants a used welder to fail in the middle of a big job or to discover that a used welder 's price can help make ends meet but the welder itself ca n't make two pieces of metal meet . <p> The best welder will complete every project that comes down the pike and minimizes limitations . This means that the most expensive welder is not always the best for each situation .

Those interested in buying a welder need to ask if they see themselves using it more frequently in the future for many different kinds of projects . <p> They 'll want to ask themselves , " Am I the kind of person who learns how to use a tool for as many projects as possible or am I only interested in using tools for certain projects ? " In other words , using a welder for many other projects in the future will mean looking into purchasing a welder that operates with more power and has a longer duty cycleboth of which will be explained below . <p> In addition , each kind of welder has its limitations and benefits . For example , a MIG welder is extremely easy to use and quite versatile , but some welders find TIG welders even more versatile and useful for a broader range of applications , even if they are more difficult to learn . MIG , TIG , and Stick welders will be compared below , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional to ensure it meets your specific needs . Contact a professional at Baker 's Gas and Welding now . <h> Welder Choices <p> MIG Welders MIG Welders are extremely popular because they tend to cost less than TIG or Stick welders with comparable power and features , are extremely easy to learn , and can tackle a wide variety of projects . Since the filler metal is fed through the MIG welding torch , welders can use both hands to hold the torch steady rather than using one hand to add filler metal , as in TIG welding . The wire feeder also makes MIG welding up to four times faster . <p> The MIG welding process uses an inert gas to shield the weld and to keep it free from impurities . This makes MIG welding very neat and easy to clean up since there is n't anything to chip away , which is typical for Stick welding . <p> MIG welding can be used on a wide variety of materials such as aluminum and is also frequently used for automotive work . However , MIG also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cost more when compared to other methods . <p> TIG Welding When appearance counts , TIG welding creates a high quality , clean weld that is far less likely to distort the metal by using a nonconsumable tungsten electrode .

Instead of the point and shoot simplicity of MIG welding , TIG requires the use of a foot pedal to regulate the welding process . A filler rod that is separate from the torch that must be fed in gradually . <p> Many professional welders prefer TIG because it can weld a wide variety of metals and because of the versatility of argon gas used during TIG welding . There is no slag to block the view of the weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness with TIG welding , and therefore there is no need to change the gas depending on the project . <p> Stick Welding Stick welding is one of the most effective techniques for fusing alloys and joints , but it is also the least efficient . The process utilizes a consumable stick electrode that works anywhere , inside or outside , and the welding process is quite simple . However , the weld is not protected by a shielding gas . Rather , the electrode is coated with flux that covers the weld and protects it . This layer must be chipped away when the weld is completed . <p> Because it does n't require shielding gas , stick welding remains popular and cost-effective . It 's also the most convenient since a welder can easily switch from one metal work piece to another by changing the filler metal rod in order to match it to the metal work piece . <h> Power Options <p> Welders with a higher power output can work with thicker metals , but higher voltage welders will require special power supply set upseither generators or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 's will not be able to handle heavy duty jobs , but it can be plugged in and operated from any outlet . Any welder with power over 200 can not run off a typical power outlet and will naturally cost more to run . <p> In addition , welders will either run an alternating current ( AC ) that reverses itself at regular intervals or a direct current ( DC ) that flows in one direction and does not reverse itself . DC offers a steady rate of energy that leads to hotter temperatures and deeper weld penetration . <p> AC welders usually cost less than DC welders , but the available electrodes are far more limited for AC . In fact , DC welders are more costly but remain popular because their higher power offers a wider selection of electrodes and a number of working advantages such as : simple arc striking , better penetration , and improved control .

@@25165831 @5165831/ <h> How to Choose the Best Electrode <p> An electrode is one of the most important materials in welding , and the wide selection of electrodes can make a choice quite overwhelming . With some basic information about the factors to consider , choosing the right electrode does n't have to grind a welder 's productivity to a halt . <p> For starters , there are two basic kinds of electrodes . Consumable electrodes are used up during the stick and MIG welding processes , as they supply the filler metal used in the weld . Non-consumable electrodes are used during the TIG welding process and are typically made of tungsten , which is not burned up during the process . The tungsten electrode helps generate heat with the electrical current and is ground to form a point much like a pencil ( though it 's flat , not sharp at the end ) . The welding arc is conducted from the point of the electrode in TIG welding . <p> While a good deal of information about selecting the right electrode follows , there are many stick welders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ease of use . For stick welders looking to make a quick start , the 6010 , 6013 , and 7018 electrodes are routinely mentioned as excellent choices . However , choosing the best electrode involves an understanding of the kind of metal it will be used on , the welder 's settings , and the specifications for the job . <p> We 'll begin by looking at consumable electrodes for Stick and MIG welding , and then follow with non-consumable electrodes for TIG welding . <h> Consumable Electrodes <p> While stick and MIG welding both use a consumable electrode , each process is quite different . Stick welding uses a consumable electrode coated in flux to lay the weld , while MIG welding uses a continuous and consumable wire electrode and a shielding gas that are fed through a welding gun ( though MIG also offers flux cored wire ) . Stick offers versatility and portability , and MIG offers a clean , simple , and functional welding process . <h> Consumable Electrodes for Stick Welding <p> The speed , power supply , and position of the weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider when selecting an electrode for stick welding . Since stick welding is particularly portable and versatile , there is a wide variety of electrodes available for each situation . <p> The electrode in stick welding is coated in a metal flux that helps purify and protect the weld . The flux creates a protective layer of slag that must be chipped off . This is quite unlike the consumable electrode wire in MIG welding that is protected by shielding gas and does not require flux or create slag . <p> There are three primary categories of electrodes for stick welding . Stick electrodes such as E6010 are " fast-freeze " electrodes designed to solidify quickly , making them ideal for all welding positions since the melted electrode wo n't run . There are " fast-fill " electrodes that melt quickly and offer improved welding speed . There also are intermediate electrodes known as " fill-freeze " or " fast-follow . " <p> It 's also critical to remember that the electrode must match or at least be compatible with the base metal that is welded . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with E60 or E70 . In addition , the kind of joint and the amount of weld penetration required will be key factors to consider . While E6013 is an excellent overall choice for an electrode , it 's particularly useful for wider weld joints . <p> The Fabricator provides a helpful guide to the stick electrode classification system used by the AWS with an example of the code used for mild steel electrodes : <p> The letter E indicates an electrode . <p> The first two digits represent the resulting weld 's minimum tensile strength , measured in pounds per square inch ( PSI ) . For example , the number 70 in a E7018 electrode indicates that the electrode will produce a weld bead with a minimum tensile strength of 70,000 PSI . <p> The third digit represents the welding positions for which the electrode can be used . For example , 1 means the electrode can be used in all positions and 2 means it can be used on flat and horizontal . <p> The fourth digit represents the coating type and the type of welding current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used with the electrode . <h> Consumable Electrodes for MIG Welding <p> Unlike the electrode " sticks " used for stick welding , MIG welding uses a consumable wire that is fed through the welding torch . Much like stick welding , the proper MIG wire or electrode needs to be matched with the type of metal being welded . <p> Though most welder manuals will specify which wires to use in each situation , the most common MIG wires typically fall into the following range of thickness : .023 , .030 , .035 , and .045 . Larger projects , especially industrial ones , may require a thicker wire , but these are the first ones to consider for most projects . <p> MIG welding has its own classification system for wire electrodes that can be illustrated in the following example for ER 70S-6 : <p> ER : Electrode or filler rod for MIG or TIG welding . <p> 70 : 70,000 pounds minimum of tensile strength for each square inch of weld . <p> S : Solid wire . <p> 6 : Amount of deoxidizing and cleansing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider for MIG wire since wires must be chosen based on the metal being welded and the type of weld , but in addition , certain wires require different shielding gases . <h> Non-Consumable Electrodes <p> TIG welding uses a non-consumable electrode made primarily of tungsten ( sometimes only tungsten ) and conducts the heat and forms the arc . Since the electrode is not melting and forming the actual weld , it 's far more important to consider the power settings of the welder and the matching size of the electrode . For example , the higher power of AC welding requires a larger electrode than lower power DC welding . The nature of the weld and the type of material being worked on will determine the appropriate welding set up , which subsequently dictates the best electrode . <p> The wrong electrode may deteriorate , fall into the weld , and contaminate the weld if the power is too high , while the welding arc will be difficult to control and maintain if there is too little power . It 's tempting to use smaller diameter electrodes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , but the quality of the final weld is a higher priority . <p> Tungsten comes in 5 commonly used grades that are color coded : <p> The pure grade of tungsten is color coded green and provides good arc stability for arc welding and is the least expensive . <p> Ceriated is color coded orange and also permits easy arc starting , good arc stability , and longevity . <p> Thoriated is color coded red and has a higher current capacity than Ceriated and has a high resistance to weld pool contamination , however it is more difficult to maintain a balled end on AC . <p> Lanthanated is color coded gold and works much like the thoriated . <p> Zirconiated is color coded brown and is probably the most preferred over all of them . It is excellent for AC welding . The higher quality tungsten will always give the best results . <p> Unless you plan on welding with a respirator , avoid electrodes that produce radiation such as thoriated .

If the metal you will be welding is not prepared properly it can cause defects in your weld and it could be considerably weaker than a weld performed on metal that was properly prepared . Below we are going to offer you some helpful tips on how to ensure that the metal you are working with has been prepared correctly . <p> The first thing that every welder should do prior to welding is to check the metal that they will be using . If the metal being welded has a coating , it is important that it is thoroughly removed before welding starts . To remove any coating on the surface of the metal you can use a grinder ; this will ensure that all of the coating has been removed and your metal is ready to work with . When inspecting the metal , if you should happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welding . Rust can typically be found on pieces of metal that have been on a car . To remove rust you can either use the grinder or simply some steel wool . <p> If you are faced with using metal that is of an odd shape you may want to experiment with different cleaning techniques to find which one will work best . It is recommended that when you have to perform welds on metal featuring an odd shape that you use an angle grinder to ensure that all of the coatings and residue are properly removed . If the piece of metal that you will be using has been welded before , you will need to remove any bad welds using a grinder . Many welders feel that it is better to remove a bad weld and starting over than it is to leave the bad weld . By removing any bad welds you are now free to create a fresh , clean weld that you will know is strong . <p> Leaving any debris or contaminants on the metal prior to welding can pose many different problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also be prone to porosity which can create a weak weld . To avoid any of these problems it is important that all welders thoroughly inspect all of the metal they will be working with .

Beginner arc welders often have trouble learning the proper way to strike an arc weld . But with a little bit of patience and time the skill can be mastered . As with any skill , having the proper knowledge and skills will help make the process go much easier and result in high quality welds that are free of defects . To become skilled in the art of striking an arc , you should practice striking beads of weld on a spare piece of metal . As with any welding process , Arc welding requires welders to practice in order to achieve the desired results . To become proficient in the art of striking an arc while welding , you may burn up to 40 pounds of electrode . <p> To begin you should position the electrode about 1/2 inch away from the area you will be welding . Your next step should be to quickly jab the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this method is known as the jab technique . The strike method requires you to strike the electrode against the metal you are welding , which is also known as the striker , in order to create a weld .

If your rod happens to freeze to the metal you are welding , you should increase your amp level by ten until the rod becomes free . <p> Once you have successfully produced an arc , you should then pull the welding rod back approximately 1/4 inch in order to prevent it from going out . During this step in the arc striking process you should listen for a crackling noise which will help you know that your electrode is being held at the correct distance . If you experience a popping noise accompanied with sparks , that is an indication that you are too far away . If you begin to hear less noise during the welding process it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out .

@@25165835 @5165835/ <h> How to Prevent Metal from Bending ( ie : heat distortion ) When Welding <p> Heat distortion occurs when an uneven level of heat is applied to an area of metal during the course of welding . Some heat distortion can be so severe that it can cause the piece of metal being welded to be unusable . Controlling the level of heat distortion that the metal you are working on is not an exact science and can vary depending on the thickness and type of metal and the welding process being used to create the weld . To minimize the level of heat distortion that your work piece experiences , you may want to run a test on a piece of scrap metal similar to what you will be working on . Testing how much heat the metal can take will help the welds you create experience less distortion during the welding process . <p> To begin the testing process you will need to place the two pieces of scrap metal on top of your welding table . Next , you will need to power on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the type of metal you will be working with . If you are unsure of what settings to use there is typically a chart attached to MIG welders that will provide you with recommended settings for the gauge of metal you will be welding . Once you have determined the settings to use for the test pieces , you can now put your welding helmet and gloves on . <p> After you have put on all of your welding safety gear , you should set-up the scrap pieces of metal to resemble how the larger pieces will be welded . Once your scrap pieces of metal are in the proper position you should line up the welding wire coming out of the MIG gun with the area where the two pieces of metal intersect . When your MIG welding gun is in the proper location you should use the welding gun to perform a tack weld on the two pieces of metal , then move the MIG gun to the opposite end of the metal pieces and perform another tack weld . This step should be repeated until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the length of the two pieces of scrap metal . <p> Once you have placed tack welds along the piece of metal , you are now ready to run a weld bead along the tacked weld joint . After you have placed a weld bead along the length of the metal , you will need to allow it to cool before attempting to handle the metal . Once the metal has cooled you should inspect the test pieces , looking for any bended areas of metal . If you find any areas of heat distortion , pay attention to which direction the metal moved . Heat distortion can more easily be detected on stainless steel as opposed to carbon steel . Now that you have seen how and where the metal can be expected to distort , you can now begin welding your work piece . <p> To begin welding your work piece you should place it on your welding table and perform tack welds like you did on the test piece . You may also want to tack weld the work piece to your work table to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the test pieces distorted you can make any necessary adjustments at this time .

If you- have interest in plasma cutting , he s written a comprehensive guide and comparison chart which you can find here . <p> While plasma cutting might seem simple enough when you 're just getting started , experience shows us that there 's more to it than meets the eye . After you 're done reading the manual ( very important ! ) and learning the basics of plasma cutting , there 's still a lot left to learn especially if you 'd like to improve your cut , prolong your equipment , and increase efficiency . <p> Below we 've compiled a list of handy tips and tricks that will make plasma cutting work more enjoyable and , perhaps most importantly , more professional . <h> 1 ) Setting Up the Work Area : <p> If you plan on doing any amount of plasma cutting , its a good idea to set up a workstation that is dedicated to the task . Your workstation does not have to be elaborate or expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made of wood or metal . It should be high enough for you to use your torch comfortably , but not so high that you have to stretch forward too far while cutting . <p> Use wooden blocks under your work piece to help draw off fumes while maintaining a good electrical contract . If you cut a hole in the table top below where the work piece will sit , you can use a fan unit beneath to help draw off fumes and even contain sparks with the use of an arrestor. <h> 2 ) Securing the Ground Clamp : <p> Make it a habit to always secure the ground clamp to clean metal only . Avoid clamping to any metal that is painted or rusted as this can inhibit the flow of electricity . <p> Its also important to secure the ground clamp as close to the intended cut path as possible . If possible , secure the ground clamp to the work piece itself . Periodically inspect the cables for loose connections , worn spots , or anything that might impede the electrical flow <h> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting projects require the use of a template . When you create your template , make sure you take into account the radius of the cutting tip ( or drag shield ) . This means that your cut line will be larger than the actual cut . In woodworking , this is known as the kerf . <p> The thickness of your template should be enough that the drag shield can ride along it without jumping over it . <p> You can also use a roller guide to maintain a consistent standoff and these guides are very good for making straight line cuts . Simply clamp a straight edge , piece of straight metal , or other straight guide to the work piece and follow along the edge . <p> Circle guides can also be used as standoffs and they allow for perfect cutting of various sizes of circles . <h> 4 ) Correct Use of the Cutting Tip : <p> If you are working at less than 40 amps , you can place the cutting tip right on the material . However , if you are above 40 amps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand or use a suitable drag shield . <h> 5 ) Steady Work is Clean Work : <p> Before you do any cutting make sure that you have braced yourself . Experts often do this by using the non-cutting hand for support . This tip will also help you to maintain a constant 1/16th 1/8th inch standoff which is critical for professional level results . Also , many experienced cutters find it easier to pull the torch toward their body instead of pushing it away from their body . <h> 6 ) Clean Air is Crucial for Best Results : <p> Unless you have a special need to do so , there is no reason to use compressed nitrogen or argon . You can use ordinary compressed air with great results . One note to this , however , some experienced plasma cutters believe they can get cleaner results when cutting stainless steel if they use nitrogen ; however , the results are honestly not that different . <p> One thing to always remember is that oil and water will contaminate your compressed air supply . This will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When possible , use a good in-line air filter to remove these contaminants before they get to your torch . <h> 7 ) Make a Practice Cut First : <p> The best way to know that you are using the correct amperage settings and travel speed is to get a scrap piece of metal that is the same as the working metal and make a practice cut . <h> 8 ) Moving Too Fast : <p> If during your practice cut , or during the actual work , you see sparks shooting along the top of the metal , you are going too fast and need to slow down . When the travel speed is correct , you will see the arc coming out at about a 20-degree angle and this will be in the opposite direction of the torchs travel path . <h> 9 ) How To Start the First Cut : <p> Most experts agree that starting the first cut and making the very last cut are the two places most novices encounter problems . The way to start the first cut depends on the thickness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply place the cutting tip of the torch on the work piece and pull the trigger . This action will punch right through the material . However , for thicker metal , you want to start outside your cut line and angle the torch about 45 degrees away from your body ; pull the trigger and roll the torch into a perpendicular position ( straight up and down ) . Carefully move the torch to the cut line on the template and begin working along that line . <p> Keep in mind as your work that if the torch tilts , the cut will be beveled . Move your head if you can not see the cutting arc , not your torch . <p> A very good tip , and one that can save both time and money , is to make it a habit to practice the cut line before turning on the arc . This will allow you to see if you are in the right position and how far you have to stretch before you actually begin cutting . Your non-cutting hand can be used to steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Cuts : <p> Some areas may be too small to cut with the torch . Mark these before you begin cutting . Cut the larger cuts first and then turn off the unit and go back and cut the smaller areas by hand . <h> 11 ) Cutting Holes : <p> Your plasma cutter is a great tool for cutting bolt holes . This easy tip works every time : Simply pierce the metal , and then make the appropriate sized circle . Your cutter can pierce metal that is up to one-half of its cutting thickness . <h> 12 ) Beveled Edges : <p> Beveling edges takes a bit of practice but the results can be outstanding . Beveled edges can used to better fitting between pieces but can also be used to cut through thicker pieces of metal . <p> To bevel an edge , you simply tilt the torch head to a 30- to 40-degree angle and make your cut . With some practice , you can master this technique in no time . <h> 13 ) Troubleshooting Consumables : <p> If you find that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting up , check your consumables before anything else . When consumables become worn , they will cause cutting problems and/or arc starting problems . You should inspect your consumables regularly . Look at the tip hole and if it appears irregular in shape , or if it is covered with spatter , it is time to replace it . <p> Also , the electrode , which is just beneath the tip , contains a small amount of a called hafnium . Every time the arc starts it will consume a small amount of hafnium . If you see a pit in the electrode , discard it . <p> Lastly , you should be careful to not over-tighten the retaining cup . The parts that are inside the consumables retaining cup need to move in order to create an arc . The cup should only be hand-tight. <h> 14 ) Making the Last Cut : <p> The last cut is often a problem for novices . There are two tricks you can use to get a clean last cut . The first is to pause for a second as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for a cleaner cut . The second trick is to roll the tip of the torch towards the final cut edge . These tricks are especially helpful when cutting thicker materials , but will work on all thicknesses. <h> 15 ) Cleaning Up Your Work : <p> You can use a grinder or a piece of scrap metal to knock off any dross that you find after cutting . You might also want to invest in a chipping hammer as these are very affordable and can make the cleaning up process easier . <h> Conclusion : <p> By using these tips , your plasma cutting will be more enjoyable and less costly .

The problem is , you have n't been trained how to teach someone to weld . You may be on the verge of a really frustrating weekend if you ca n't help your friend figure out how to strike an arc or run a straight weld bead . In the hope of salvaging your weekend , here are a few tips on how to teach a new welder the basics . <h> Teach a New Welder Travel Speed <p> The most common challenge that welding instructors mention is teaching their students the proper travel speed . It 's hard to know how fast or slow to move in order to create the best possible weld . You may know how it feels to travel at the right speed , but it may be difficult to tell someone how to do it . <p> However , you can overcome this challenge by first letting your student watch you weld a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weld just to get the sense of how fast they need to move . When you turn your friend loose , you can help guide the torch on the first few passes just to make sure it 's moving at the right speed . <h> Teach a New Welder How to See the Puddle <p> Welding instructors often start their students with stick welding because it 's easier to see the puddle . However , if you do start out with MIG , you will need to spend some time helping your student find the right angle and positioning in order to see the puddle . When beginners move their heads to the side in order to see the puddle , they often move off the weld joint . <p> This also brings up the importance of making sure you both have safe helmets with large enough viewing areas . If your student is a child , it may be hard to find a helmet that fits well enough to provide excellent visibility . <h> Teach a New Welder How to Weld Straight <p> Beginners do n't need to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be best to just start with a flat piece of metal where you draw two lines on it and weld down the middle of it . Straight stringers are the best way to go with beginners who need to focus more on travel speed than whipping or weaving the torch as they work . <h> Keep It Fun <p> A first welding project is n't the time to build a trailer hitch or to work on an expensive part for your car . Besides practicing on scrap pieces , choose some simple projects that a beginner can enjoy welding for a brief period of time . By the time you 're done , you 'll have something small to show for your efforts , even if it 's as simple as tacking some pieces of metal together . If you keep it fun and provide some attainable goals , you can help even the greenest noob get started on welding . 48841 @qwx248841 <h> One thought on " Tips for Teaching a New Welder " <p> You said that beginners just need to learn how to weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know that I have the basics down .

@@25165850 @5165850/ <h> How to MIG Weld Aluminum <p> MIG welders are extremely versatile welders that can handle a wide variety of projects . However , before you buy a spool of aluminum wire and try MIG welding aluminum , you 'll want to learn about the particular challenges and adaptations you 'll need to make before attempting to MIG weld aluminum . <h> Use 14 Guage or Higher for MIG Welding Aluminum <p> The one challenge you 'll face when trying to weld aluminum is that a MIG welder may have too much power for thinner sheets of aluminum . A good rule of thumb is that you 'll weld aluminum that is 14 gauge and higher . Thinner aluminum will need a pulse setting for a MIG welder . Otherwise , use a TIG welder . <h> Torch Position for MIG Welding Aluminum <p> A 10-15 degree torch angle will be ideal for MIG welding aluminum . You 'll also want to push your torch while welding rather than pulling it . A straight , steady torch movement is ideal for MIG welding aluminum so that the impurities stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and then pausing before inching forward again so that your final weld has a neat , uniform appearance . <h> Use a Spool Gun to MIG Weld Aluminum <p> A spool gun will save you a ton of time and aggravation since aluminum wire is too soft to effectively feed through a MIG machine . It will keep getting jammed , and you 'll have a frustrating time at it . Spool guns attach to your MIG gun and then feed the wire right into the torch . <h> Use Spray Transfer for MIG Welding Aluminum <p> You 'll use a longer electrode stick out for MIG welding aluminum and the melted aluminum will be sprayed into the weld puddle . If you hear the crackle you usually hear when you 're welding steel , you 're doing something wrong . Your wire feed speed is most likely too fast . Though it 's usually ideal to start a little on the fast end and then adjust the speed as you go , having too fast a wire speed will add too much metal and possibly damage your metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Solvents such as acetone are usually ideal for cleaning metal , but if you have a lot of mill scale , you may want to grind down the metal first before prepping the weld . <h> Use Straight Argon for Aluminum MIG Welding <p> Though some gas mixtures can be used as a shielding gas for MIG welding aluminum , the majority of situations will call for a simple tank of argon . You 'll need to weld with argon using reverse polarity or DCEP . <h> Pick Up A Complete MIG Welding Set Up <p> MIG welding aluminum requires materials and parts beyond what comes with a typical MIG welder . The best way to ensure that you have everything you need for the lowest price is to pick up an aluminum MIG welding set up from Baker 's Gas and Welding . 48841 @qwx248841 <h> One thought on " How to MIG Weld Aluminum " <p> I have a miller 212 and spool gun.When I pull the trigger the wire feeds 1 inch the machine shuts off and over temp light comes on ..

The latest TIG inverters can create a significantly higher number of pulses per second , offering as many as 5,000 pulses per second--an increase from 20 per second on older TIG machines . TIG pulsing is used for difficult joints or thin metal where there is a chance of burning through or stainless steel where too much heat can cause rust . <p> The higher your pulsing rate , the stronger your weld will be because of the control you have over the weld puddle . A higher degree of pulsing focuses and constricts the arc , limiting the amount of heat applied to the weld .

Smaller TIG welders still offer a lot of versatility and enough power to complete smaller jobs that do n't require a longer duty cycle . Portability is often one of the biggest factors that welders have to think about after considering the duty cycle and power output . <h> Foot Pedal <p> A reliable foot pedal is critically important for TIG welding . TIG projects are sometimes performed in awkward positions and the TIG process itself requires two hands--one for the torch and the other for the filler rod . Pedals allow welders to manage the amount of heat used so that the weld puddle does n't become too large . <p> The best foot peddle does n't slope at too high an angle , which would cause foot fatigue .

However , the added complexity of TIG welding does n't make it impossible . There are a few things you can do right from the start that will help you create solid welds without needing too much time to practice . <h> Pay Attention to Your Filler Metal Size <p> If you use filler metal that is too large , you 'll add too much material to the weld puddle and possibly distort the metal . Even worse than that , too much filler metal will draw the shielding gas away and lead to distortion of your metal work piece . A small filler metal will melt before it even reaches where you 're trying to weld , piling up metal where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electrode Size <p> TIG welding produces the least amount of heat out of any welding process , but welding with too much heat can still cause a lot of damage to your TIG cup or your metal work piece .

While you 'll begin with that , you 'll then sand or grind down the metal , and then heat the metal with a torch in order to burn off the impurities . Keeping it at a low heat output , run the TIG torch along the place where you plan on welding in order to make sure you 've burned off all of the grease .

As the wire melts in the weld , the flux rises to the top and creates a protective coating on the weld . This layer of flux needs to be removed , and the weld itself will be scratched up . This makes flux cored welding inappropriate for welds where a neat appearance is important . In that case , gas-shielded MIG wire will be a better choice . <h> Do You Need a Spool Gun ? <p> If you 're welding aluminum , the wire often gets jammed in the MIG torch as it 's being fed from the wire feeder .

@@25165870 @5165870/ <h> 6 Flux Core MIG Welding Tips <p> MIG welding with fluxed core wire is significantly easier to set up than MIG welding with shielding gas . When you enter shielding gas into the mix , you have to make sure you have enough gas flowing into the weld joint in order to shield the metal from impurities . That 's an extra cost for the gas , and not to mention that you 'll have another setting to keep track of while you work . <p> Flux core MIG welding is also more versatile and portable . If you need to MIG weld outside or you ca n't control the environment where you 're working , you 'll do well to keep some flux core MIG wire around for the odd project . However , if you want to use flux core wire for your next MIG project , you need to keep a few things in mind : <h> Prepare to Clean Your Welds <p> Flux core MIG wires protect the weld while you burn the electrode down .

A flux core wire will give you more penetration into the weld joint if your metal is thick or your welder simply ca n't crank out enough amperage for a particular project . <p> The safety and longevity of your weld depends on getting solid penetration and fusion with the metal work piece , and a flux core wire can offer a slight edge sometimes . <h> Use DCEN , Electrode Negative with Flux Core Wire <p> Each package of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it best , but one common setting change is that flux core MIG welding must be done with DCEN , or electrode negative .

Running on a positive current could result in a lot of spatter that you 'll need to clean up .

Do n't overheat it , or you could burn through ! <h> When There 's Slag , Drag <p> Welders often recommend dragging or pulling when working with flux core MIG wire since it often creates more spatter .

Productivity savings will allow a company to keep saving even if the price of consumables , equipment , or welding accessories goes up . Outlined below are five ways companies can reduce their welding costs . <p> 1 . Enhance current welding processes <p> Be on the lookout for ways to create more efficiency in your welding processes and procedures . Examine such things as wire diameter , wire feed speed , travel speed , voltage , transfer mode , and gas type . If your shop is welding with a short arc process and a 75/25 blend of shielding gas , it may be more effective to switch to a different gas and spray mode of transfer . If there is oxide on the parts being used , perhaps it would be easier to use a process that overcomes contamination problems rather than try to clean each part before welding . Is your supplier up-to-date on the latest technology ? He should keep you advised on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 . Eliminate extra welds from design <p> One company that manufactured boxes originally had a design for welded lift handles on each side of the box . By changing the design of the box to cut out lifting slots , it eliminated the need for welding the handles " saving time and money . This example shows the importance of looking for ways to modify product designs to reduce the number of unnecessary welds . Closely examine your current designs and modify wherever appropriate . <p> 3 . Determine whether material handling is effective <p> Delivery of parts to the welding station is a logical way to reduce welding costs . For example , a company manufacturing concrete mixing drums was making the mistake of putting pieces on the shop floor . When it came time to weld , the operator had to hunt around for the parts he needed . An outside welding expert pointed out the amount of time being wasted , and suggested the company start batching pieces together on separate carts . This organized process allowed the welders to find the pieces they needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time wasted handling parts . Whatever makes your production line more efficient reduces overall costs . <p> 4 . Analyze delivery of consumables to welding points <p> In many shops , the operator has to go to a tool room for a new contact tip or other welding accessory , which takes time away from the welding cell and slows production . Companies should stock at least a limited supply of items near the welding station , including gas , flux and wire . This will minimize wasted time and improve operating efficiency . <p> 5 . Watch out for gas waste <p> Leaks in the gas delivery system can create a potential loss of money . By looking at the amount of consumables purchased each year and comparing it to the total gas purchased , your company will be able to determine if there is a significant loss . A simple gas device called a surge turbine placed at the end of the gun provides a digital readout of the gas surge and flow rate . If you notice a high surge rate , investing in a surge guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As more companies look for more efficient ways to do business , everyone involved will benefit .

It 's easy to blast through or melt thin metal if you are n't able to control your heat input , and therefore a TIG welder with pulsing and a foot pedal can make your life a whole lot easier . While a simple rule of thumb for working with thin steel is to practice TIG welding on scraps first , there are some simple tips you can keep in mind that will make life a whole lot easier . <h> Should You Use Filler Rod on Thin Steel ? <p> Sometimes metal is thin enough that you can weld it effectively without using a filler metal . A TIG welder can run at about 60 amps and get the job done on really thin steel or stainless . Keep in mind that this applies to steel and stainless steel . Aluminum is a whole other ball game . You always need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIG Welding with a Foot Pedal or Torch Control ? <p> When you 're welding thin metal , it 's going to be important to control the torch , keeping it pointed right at the weld joint without burning over to the sides .

You 'll want to keep your torch hand as steady as possible when you 're welding thin metal , and that 's where a pedal comes in really handy . <p> Jody at WeldingTipsandTricks.com also suggests reinforcing your welding glove by adding a piece of heat resistant cloth to one of your fingers on your hand that 's holding the torch . He typically puts the TIG finger on his pinky . This makes it easier to prop one finger on the metal while you work without burning it .

Jody has created his own product called a TIG Finger that you can pick up at his site . <h> Weld Downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIG weld thin metal in a variety of positions , it 's extremely easy to weld downhill quickly with a lot of control . If you 're welding thin metal , you 'll be able to move at a fairly constant travel speed without much effort . This tip may be best for TIG welders who have less experience . Keep a tight arc and keep the puddle moving nice and steady . Also , if you do end up welding uphill , you 'll want to weld with a slightly lower amperage . <h> How to Increase Your Travel Speed While TIG Welding <p> If you need to increase your travel speed while welding thin metal , you can increase the number of pulses per second ( say in the 100 pps range ) . Keep in mind that you 'll need to keep the torch moving in order to prevent distortion or discoloring of your metal . A faster pulsing rate is only useful when you need to keep travel faster , so make sure you pay attention to the way the puddle moves forward . A fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may take a little practice before you can get it right on thinner metal . <h> Learn How to Tack without Melting the Metal <p> Tacking with a TIG welder can be really quick and efficient , but if you have the settings or torch position wrong , you can also melt the edges of your metal work piece . While some of the newer TIG welders have a tack setting , either way , you 'll want to practice making quick , on target tack welds with your TIG machine . Get some scrap metal out and test it out . <p> When I say that this is a quick tack , we 're talking in the ballpark of a tenth of a second . You 'll need to be careful about the right amperage settings based on the metal thickness before you give this a go on a piece you hope to use . <h> Beware of TIG Welding with Too Much Heat <p> TIG welding with too much heat will cause problems down the line with rust .

Being able to weld stainless steel is a great skill for any welder to have because not only does it make a welder very valuable , but some jobs are designed just for welders capable of welding stainless steel . It is n't the easiest metal to weld . Stick and wire feed welders can both be used when you want to weld stainless steel , but if you use a MIG welder , or wire feed , you have to use gas . This is because you wo n't find stainless steel in a flux-cored form . <p> Picture Credit : **27;137;TOOLONG <p> There are some things that you can do to make it easier when you are welding stainless steel .

This will remove any chromium buildup , grease , oils , paint , and dirt . You have to make sure that stainless steel is completely free of any debris before you will be able to properly weld it . <h> Avoid Warping <p> You should always use low heat when you are welding stainless steel . Most of the time stainless steel is in very thin sheets , and if you do not use low heat to weld it , you can warp it . Start with cool settings and then add heat slowly if you need to for stronger welds and better penetration . Sheets of stainless steel need to tack welded like car body panels . Tack weld them in several places then fill in later . This will reduce the chance of warping and you can easily make sure that everything is properly aligned . Another way to avoid warping the steel is to weld in short bursts of three to four seconds . Then , stop and allow the steel to cool off , then weld again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel , use only stainless rods . If the rods suffix ends with " -16 " then use it with AC welders and if it ends with " -15 " then its for direct current reverse polarity use . Your strongest results will come from the " -15 " rod but both will work very well . If you are planning to use a regular MIG or flux cored rods or wire for stainless steel welding , you need to remember that any portions that are welded will rust .

While you 'll first need to choose between solid core wire that is protected with shielding gas or a flux core wire that shields itself , the width of your wire determines the appearance and strength of your weld . <p> You may think that a thick wire will give you more penetration , but that is n't always the case . A lot can hinge on the amperage , metal thickness , the width of the weld joint , and the material itself . here 's an overview of some factors to consider when choosing a wire for your next MIG welding project . <h> Referencing A Wire Thickness Chart <p> If you 're MIG welding with solid wire and use a shielding gas , then you can typically opt for a thinner wire compared to flux cored wire that tends to be thicker . For instance , 22 Gauge metal can be welded effectively with .024 thick solid wire , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flux core wire . This trend holds true throughout a typical wire thickness chart . <p> In addition , metal that is 3/16 inch thick or more may require several passes in order to completely fill the weld joint and to achieve sufficient penetration . <h> Welding with Smaller Wires <p> A wire with a small diameter will leave less filler in the weld joint , but that does n't  necessarily mean it wo n't give you good penetration . In fact , a narrow wire will concentrate current right into the joint . While the final weld will be rather narrow and wont fill a large joint with material , it will tend to provide a deeper weld than a wider wire under the right conditions . <p> The quality of your penetration and the strength of your weld will also change based on your technique , angle , and material . However , before picking a wire , consider the depth and the width of the weld joint together . <p> Smaller wires also require a faster wire speed in order to reach an optimal deposition rate while welding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you increase your amperage too much , then the arc will become erratic and leave spatter along the weld . When you need to increase your power , then your best bet is to use a thicker wire . <h> Welding with Thicker Wires <p> Welding with a thicker wire means you may not get the same amount of penetration compared to a thin wire . However , the advantage is that you can weld with a slower wire speed and fill a wide opening . <p> You 'll improve your penetration by paying attention to your technique and matching your amperage to the thickness of the metal and the depth of the weld joint . The wider your weld joint , the more likely you 'll still need to consider making multiple passes . <p> If you start to have problems with burn through , then consider switching to a thinner wire that wo n't deposit as much material into the weld joint . <h> Wire Options for Aluminum Vs .

You can usually complete most aluminum welding jobs with a wire that is 3/64- or 1/16- inch diameter . <p> Steel tends to be thicker and does not heat up as fast , so your wire options tend to be on the thicker side .

Spatter is what is left of the wire electrode that did not fuse with the weld puddle . If you have too much spatter on your work piece it can ruin the finish of the metal . To help avoid spatter from occurring when you MIG weld , you should properly set your MIG welder . This will only reduce the amount of spatter . Whenever MIG welding is performed there is always spatter , but the important thing to do is to keep the spatter from sticking to the surface of the work metal . <p> To help keep the amount of spatter to a minimum you will need to adjust the settings on your MIG welder . When you feel that you have the appropriate settings you should perform a test weld in a short stitch welding pattern . Once you have performed the test weld you will want to examine the area around the weld joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is still an excessive amount of spatter you should turn down the wire speed slightly and perform another test weld .

If you are satisfied with the reduced amount of spatter and you can still produce a solid weld , you should be ready to proceed . <p> You may also want to use a can of anti-spatter when you are MIG welding . This will help reduce the amount of spatter . To use anti-spatter spray you should shake the can for 30 seconds and then spray the area where you will be welding .

@@25165894 @5165894/ <h> Guide to Welding Cast Iron <p> Cast iron is very versatile and is used in hundreds , if not thousands , of industrial products . The reason is that cast iron is fairly inexpensive , is hard , and is resistant to wear and tear . Cast iron is available in many compositions and grades , just like steel is . It is a common belief that cast iron is brittle but that is not true of all kinds of cast iron . <p> Cast iron is an iron-carbon alloy ( again like steel ) but in some properties , composition , and structure it is nothing like steel . Not all grades of cast iron are weldable , and with those grades that are , there are challenges that welders face that they would not encounter if they were welding steel . <p> Cast iron is not pure iron and there is actually less iron in any form of cast iron than there is in steel that is low-carbon ( that could be 98% iron ) . Nearly every form of cast iron has over 2% carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has small amounts of phosphorous and sulphur , .5 to .8% manganese and 1.2 to 2.5% silicon . <p> So what makes the challenge for welders ? It is the high percentage of carbon . That high percentage makes cast iron different than steel in many properties . In steel that is finished , the carbon joins with iron to make iron carbides . These might be in grains of pearlite , cementite , or scattered around the steel as carbide . ( This may seem useless , but it really is quite important to understanding how cast iron welding works ) . Most of the carbon in cast iron is not in a combined form . It might be graphite for example . The main difference in the different kinds of cast iron is what form the graphite will turn into when the iron is finished . <p> Gray iron is a more general type of cast iron and is the one that is used the most widely . Its called gray iron because the fractured metal is gray , and that helps to distinguish it from white iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined . Gray irons have graphite that takes the shape of flakes and are machinable . They can be hard , and the strongest grades have double the strength of the weakest ones . Gray iron is often cast in sand molds where it is allowed to cool . Hardness can be increased or decreased with heat treatments . One place you 'll see gray iron is in diesel and gasoline engine blocks . <p> White iron is like gray in composition but allowed to cool fast , and this makes a malleable iron . White iron is often used in some kinds of dies , plowshares , and railroad car wheels . <p> Gray cast iron can be welded using fusion welding . The iron has to be preheated and the temperature varies depending on whether you use arc welding or oxy-acetylene welding . Repair jobs often use oxy-acetylene braze welding while arc welding is used where fusion is needed . White iron is not normally welded because the heat can change the properties of it . Normally welding is only done on white iron if it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strength is needed . <p> Cast iron is hard to weld and some say it is like playing golf +G there will be times it will go great and times it will not . The actual environment that the cast iron that you are going to be welding was made in has a lot to do with whether or not it will be easy to work with . For example , exhaust manifolds are full of carbon where they have been heated , cooled , and exposed to fuel exhaust , making them very difficult to weld whereas fixing something like a cast iron stove is simple because it has n't  been exposed to such things . It can also crack , hence the need for preheating. 
@@25165895 @5165895/ <h> Beginning a Welding Business <p> Have you ever considered starting your own welding business ? Like any business it is not an easy thing to do . In fact , it is a very risky proposition . New businesses are prone to failure but if you are careful , plan your business well , and work hard then you will be able to beat the odds and have a very successful business . There is always a need for welders in many fields , so it is very possible for you to build a successful business , perhaps one that you can even pass on to your own children . <p> When you are trying to start a business , try to find 5-10 machine shops that only have 2 or 3 workers . Leave a business card and a small welding sample . Try to be creative but do n't go too over the top . You want to be remembered , not classified as " the weirdo who came in the other day . " <p> Many of these small shops have people able to weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have larger orders come in that require welding , it could easily be above their skill level . In those cases , they will call you to come in and do the work . Why ? Because it is much more profitable for them to buy the materials , call you to do the work and pay you than it is for them to buy the materials then have the project messed up because they do not have a welder who has the needed skills . They will only need to buy the materials once instead of two or three times . <p> This is a good way to get a leg up in welding , learn about negotiating , sharpen your skills , and maybe even pick a thing or two up about running your own shop . One of the biggest things for you to learn is how to price the jobs you do . Always set a minimum price . If you feel that the lowest you want to be paid for any project is $25 , then that is your minimum price . Make a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign if you have a place you work out of ( like a garage ) that states your minimum price . A simple statement of " Minimum fee for a job is $25. " can go a long way towards helping you avoid jobs that are simply not worth your time . <p> There will come a time when you will want to branch out and be able to have enough work that you do n't have to work anywhere else . A minimum price will help with that but you have to be able to price other jobs as well . You will learn with experience what prices will work well for what jobs , and what your time is worth . Never underestimate yourself and work for less than your skills and your time is worth . <p> Labor only jobs are usually easier to price and that is where working as needed for machine shops comes in handy . You do not have to buy materials and in some cases you do not have to buy the machines either . All you have to do is figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . This saves you the risk of buying materials and then never being paid for the job . <p> For an example , a good rule of thumb if you are doing tig welding is to charge a dollar for an inch of welding and an additional dollar for every tack weld . This is a fair price for you and for the machine shop you are helping out . For something like pipe welding or anything else that requires multiple passes , you should remember to charge for all the passes . If the item you 're welding is 8 inches per pass , needs three passes , and has three tack welds , then you would charge $27 . Not bad for you if it 's an easy job , nor for the shop that does n't have to worry about ruined materials . Price mig welding or stick welding in a similar way based on what you feel your time and skills are worth , but be careful not to price your services so high you price yourself out of the market . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find used machines that are in good condition . This can save you a good deal of money . Many welders find that Miller equipment is the best way to go because of the customer support . Others find they can get great deals on bidding sites for their equipment . Make sure you are able to find all the tools you need such as rods , a welding table , and consumables . 
@@25165896 @5165896/ <h> Why You Should Use a Welding Screen <p> Welding screens are typically used by welders who must perform welding tasks in the vicinity of other workers . Using a welding screen will reduce the amount of dangerous UV light that other workers are exposed to when welding is being performed . Welding screens ( or welding curtains ) can be found wherever you purchase your welding supplies and can be found in a variety of sizes and colors . Installing a welding screen in the area you are working in will be greatly appreciated by those working close by . They will no longer be temporarily blinded by the flashes of light coming from your welding torch . <p> Installing a welding screen in your work area will not only provide you with privacy , it will also keep others from developing dangerous flash burns . Even if a person is not directly looking at the UV light produced by a welding torch , even catching glimpses from the corner of your eye may be enough to cause harmful flash burns . If you do n't have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , you can create one using a tarp . This will provide sufficient protection for those around you until you have the chance to purchase a welding curtain . Using a see through welding screen is suggested if you are working in an area where large pieces of machinery are constantly moving . Being able to see what may be coming will help keep you from walking in front of a fork lift or other piece of heavy machinery . <p> Many welders who work in a shop or machine shop have recognized the importance of using a welding screen . They commonly build their own frames that can hold the welding screen and order a screen that will fit in the frame . Doing this allows welders to customize the size and design of the welding screen they use in their work area . Welding screens that are available include grommets that allow the screen to be attached and stretched within the frame . Using a welding screen is the safe thing to do , and it will not only offer you an extra level of protection but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harmful UV light that is created when welding is being performed . <p> Welding screens are an excellent form of protection and are even required by OSHA to protect passersby from being exposed to UV light . Having the ability to customize and build your own frame will allow you to design a welding screen that will cover your work area completely . A welding screen is a relatively inexpensive way to protect those who are working in the same area as you are . It is not only up to the welder to protect themselves while welding but they should also do whatever they can to reduce the amount of exposure others experience .

The next thing you should look for at the end of the reference line is the arrow . Once you have located the arrow you should look for symbols on the arrow . If there are any symbols on the arrow in the same side of the reference line this is an indication that an arrow side weld must be performed .

@@25165906 @5165906/ <h> How to Select The Right Welding Helmet For You <p> While welding helmets are designed to protect you from the visible and invisible ( ultraviolet and infrared ) rays a welding arc emits , not all helmets are created equal . There are numerous factors to consider when selecting a welding helmet : passive or auto-darkening lens , fixed or variable shade , two , three or four sensors and viewing area are just a few . Taking the time to find the right helmet for your needs can increase your productivity and weld quality , as well as your fit and comfort . <p> First of all , you should definitely choose a helmet that meets ANSI Z87.1 " 2003 standards , which ensures that the helmet and lens have passed independent testing to show they can survive high velocity impact from flying objects , provide 100% ultraviolet and infrared filtering regardless of shade setting . and meet advertised switching speeds and darkness shades in temperatures as low as 23GF and as high as 131G F. <h> Passive vs . Auto-Darkening Lens <p> Welding lens shade numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may range from a #8 shade for low-amp applications up to a #13 shade for high-amp applications . Top-line helmets may include additional ranges #3-#8 for grinding and cutting . <p> A passive lens helmet uses UV- and IR-coated dark-tinted glass with a fixed shade value , usually #10 . The passive welding helmet is worn in the up position while the electrode , gun or torch is positioned . Then with a quick nod or snap of the neck , the operator flips the helmet into position immediately before striking an arc . <p> While passive lens helmets have passed the test of time and provide an economical choice , they have a few shortcomings : <p> For the novice welder , or someone who does n't weld often , it can be difficult to position the electrode while the helmet is snapped into place . This can lead to poor weld starts , which may lead to weld defects or the need for excessive grinding . <p> Tack welding , or numerous short welds , can be difficult and inefficient since the welder has to repeatedly lift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helmet up and down can cause neck fatigue , and in some cases may lead to repetitive stress injuries . <p> An auto-darkening lens directly addresses these issues . In its inactive state , an auto-darkening lens usually has a #3 or #4 shade ( light state ) . When sensors on the helmet sense an arc start , the lens darkens in a fraction of a second ( typically 1/12,000 to 1/20,000 of a second ) to shade #8 to #13 . <p> Because the helmet stays in position before , during , and after the weld , an auto-darkening welding helmet enables you to set up your welding joint with the hood down . No more head snaps , no more sloppy starts , and no more raising and lowering the helmet for tack welds . It not only has the potential for improving weld quality , it can ease neck strain associated with snapping the helmet into place . <p> Auto-darkening welding helmets are available for every welding level , from the hobbyist to the professional .

If you are an experienced welder , removing and replacing rusty panels from your car is something that you can accomplish with the proper tips . <p> First you will want to gather all of your MIG welding equipment . A MIG welder provides the necessary amount of power for welding through the heavy steel that many cars are made of . Before starting work , always make sure that you have plenty of welding wire as well as gas . Running out of either material while you 're working will force you to stop in the middle of your work and run to the nearest welding supply store . Save yourself some time and make sure that you have enough of everything before you start . You should also make sure that you have clamps and a hand grinder within reach . You will need both of these items as the job progresses . <p> The next step will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new panel to the existing frame to ensure that it is the correct size and that there will be no overlapping . If your new panel is too large , you will need to cut the excess using the hand grinder . You will also need to use the clamps to hold the new panel in place so that you can mark the area that needs to be removed . You will need to draw a line ( with a welding marker or welding soapstone ) on the new panel to show where you will need to make the cut . Once you have trimmed the new panel to the correct size you are ready to begin welding . <p> At this point you will want to remove the old panel from the car . It is important that you take the time to properly remove the rusted area from the car and not try to weld the new panel directly onto the rusted area . If you weld the new panel onto the rusted area , over time the rust will just spread to the new panel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the old panel you will need to draw a line approximately 1/2 inch below the line you drew earlier . This will allow you to have some metal to weld the new panel to . Using your hand grinder you will cut along the new line until the panel is free . <p> Now , you are going to want to check your welding current . The recommended current for this type of body work is between 40 and 60 amps . If your welding current is set at too high a speed , the chance of creating holes in the panel increases . An inappropriately set welding current will also decrease the depth of the weld you are creating . To avoid any of these from occurring , you should always check the level of your welding current . <p> Once you have removed the rusted panel and have double checked your welding current , you are ready to attach the replacement panel . Using clamps to hold the new panel in place you are ready to start attaching it to the remaining panel . If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement panel in place by using tack welds .

The recommended welding technique when working with body panels is the stitch welding method . This is a series of welds that create a continuous line of weld to attach the panel . When you 've finished welding the replacement panel onto the vehicle , check it for any gaps and fill them by plug welding . <p> After you have attached the new panel to the vehicle you can now grind it down so that it is flush with the rest of the area .

@@25165923 @5165923/ <h> Proper Use of Auto-Darkening Helmet Controls Settings <p> The auto darkening welding helmet is one of the more functional technological advancements in the welding safety equipment arena . <p> The eye shield on old school welding helmets have one setting : dark . Obviously this is intended to protect your eyes from the damaging and painful effects of exposure to the bright flare of a welding arc . When you 're welding , however , you often pause to grind or make cuts to the metal you 're working with , or interact with others in the welding shop or on the jobsite . And with an old school welding helmet , you have to lift up the visor , or totally remove the helmet to actually see . <h> The Auto-Darkening Welding Helmet Advantage <p> With an Auto-Darkening Helmet , the old school method of flipping the visor down or lifting it up is not necessary because the built-in eye shield sensor automatically recognizes variations between light and dark , relative to where the eye shield is focused . The auto-darkening control settings , however , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few basic control settings tips will help you to make much better use of your auto-darkening welding helmet . <h> Basic Darkening Controls <p> Typically , auto-darkening helmets include three basic settings : shade , sensitivity and delay , and all settings range for 1 " 10 . <p> Shade refers to the density of the darkening shield ; 1 being almost clear glass , and 10 the completely dark , unless focused on the light of an active arc . <p> Sensitivity refers to the degree of light required to engage the shade : the brighter the light , the darker the shade . <p> Delay refers to the speed at which the shade engages once light is detected . <h> Control Setting Based on Location <p> In your average welding or fabrication shop setting , you would probably want to keep all settings closer to ten , as most dramatic shifts in light are usually created by the arc welding machine you 're working with . <p> But what if you 're working in a fabrication shop , manufacturing facility or industrial plant with a loading dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps you 're working in the field on a construction project or jobsite ? The sun is actually immeasurably darker than any arc light , and will affect an auto-darkening shield the same as an arc light . <p> So if you 're working in an environment with tons of natural light ( sunlight ) , you probably want to reduce the sensitivity and delay settings , to avoid the shade engaging every time your eye shield happens to catch a ray of sunlight . <p> Another import factor to keep in mind is the degree of light intensity variation between different welding processes . Cutting torches , oxyacetylene welding equipment and lower voltage arc welders create much less intense light than higher voltage arc welding machines . Therefore , you will need to adjust the shading settings according to the intensity of the arc created by the welding machine you 're working with . <h> About the authorbakersgas <h> One thought on " Proper Use of Auto-Darkening Helmet Controls Settings " <p> This is awesome , kind of reminds me of my grandpas old motorcycle hood .

Whether welding with AC or DC welding , welding uncommon metals , or working with particular shielding gases , you 'll have your work cut out for you when it comes to choosing the best tungsten electrode for your TIG welding machine . Today we 're going to run through each of the tungsten options . Well- break down the different situations that call for each one . Well also go over the advantages and disadvantages each brings to the welding table . - <h> TIG Welding with a Pure Tungsten Electrode <p> If you 're welding on an AC machine , a pure tungsten electrode ( with a green label ) is a great- option .

If you 're welding aluminum , keep in mind that you 'll need a slightly larger electrode than you may expect . <h> TIG Welding with a Thoriated Electrode <p> These durable electrodes with a red label are the most popular electrodes for DC TIG welding applications . Also use thoriated electrodes- for- some limited AC welding projects . Welders frequently use these electrodes to work on copper alloys , nickel alloys , titanium alloys , and non-corroding steels . <p> While welders should take the manufacturer 's recommended safety steps to protect themselves from the radioactive elements in the thoriated electrode , thoriated electrodes are recognized for their value and durability since they weld at temperatures that are below the electrode 's melting point . Welders who sharpen these electrodes will be able to effectively weld thin steel or in narrow gaps and will deposit significantly less tungsten in the weld puddle . <h> Ceriated Electrodes for TIG Welding <p> If you need an electrode that can weld with a lot of heat without the risk of radiation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( grey or orange labels ) electrodes are a popular choice for welders .

In fact , you may even have some scrap metal laying around that you can use for this project . <p> While purchasing all of the materials new may be a little costly , you ca n't place a cash value on being able to custom design shelves that meet your specific needs and space constraints . In addition , you 'll feel better about having designed and built the shelves in your own work area when you enter your garage or work shop ready to get down to business . <h> Materials for Welding Shelves <p> It can be overwhelming to plan your own shelves. - The plans and materials you use depend on where you hope to use your shelves .

For most purposes , angle iron gets the job done , though square tubing works perfectly for the shelf fixture frame that each shelf rests on . <p> The shelves can be made from plywood or pieces of sheet steel or expanded metal . In making these plans , you 'll need to decide what factors matter the most in order to select the materials you use : design , cost , or function . <p> You 'll need plenty of clamps to hold the joints together while working on them . <p> Before starting to weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Baker 's Welding Center . In addition , Baker 's has a wide variety of welding tools , welders , and practical safety gear . <h> Steps for Welding Shelves- <p> You can- begin by first sketching a diagram with- measurements- for your shelves and looking up the plans of other welders . Keep in mind that any shelves taller than three feet should have extra bracing or , ideally , be attached to a wall . In addition , DIY experts recommend leaving more room on the bottom shelves for larger objects , and spacing the top shelves closer together in order to minimize the weight they carry . <p> Every shelving system has three basic parts : horizontal shelf trays , - vertical legs , and the shelves .

You can either fasten or weld your shelves into place if desired . <p> For greater stability , you can weld adjustable legs or a nut and bolt combination to the base of the shelves in addition to anchoring the shelves to the wall. - A bit of paint will add a finished look to the final product , but then again , building shelves may be quite enough work for one day . <p> And besides , if you 're just going to fill them up with your tools , it may be wiser to save the money you could spend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Welding .

Depending on the gas or gases generated and the concentration depends on the welding process you are using . Whether the gases are used to provide a shield or as a consumable these different types of gases may be hazardous . Many of these gases are well below the workplace exposure limits , but in some cases where the proper safety procedures have not been followed , they may exceed those limits . <p> When welding using the TIG , MIG/MAG processes the formation of a shielding gas is a natural and relevant result of these types of welding . The main danger of welders working with this type of welding process is asphyxiation . This may occur if the accumulation of these gases is greater than the amount of oxygen in the work area . Without the proper ventilation and inspection of all connections and hoses being used the danger for asphyxiation is extremely high . <p> Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can be created when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more hazardous of the two gases ; it can cause a reduction in oxygen , headaches , dizziness , nausea and weakness . The production of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide during regular types of flux welding is generally not a hazardous situation . In some cases when high velocity oxy-fuel gas cutting is taking place , the potential for large quantities of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide being created is much greater . This process of welding involves large amounts of gas to be consumed in a short period of time ; this may expose the welder to high levels of carbon monoxide which can cause health problems . <p> Nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide are typically generated by oxidation of nitrogen in the air and by heat caused from an arc or flame . The acceptable limits of exposure limits to these gases are 1ppm per 8 hours is recommended for each gas . Being overexposed to nitric acid can cause severe eye , skin and nose irritation . Nitrogen dioxide is the more hazardous of the two gases , it is highly toxic . The symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may take several hours for any of the symptoms to appear . Sever overexposure to these two gases may result in the accumulation of water in the lungs which may restrict the supply of oxygen in the blood and in the most severe cases of overexposure death may occur . <p> The most common methods of welding typically produce small amount of nitrous gases so the risks of becoming overexposed are relatively small . Exposure problems may occur when you are using a cutting method especially if the cutting is being done in a hand held manner . This process places the worker closer to the gases . The hotter the flame the higher the concentration of nitrous gas being produced is . <p> Over exposure to ozone while welding typically occurs when there is a reaction between the UV light produced by the arc and oxygen in the air . Ozone is only produced during arcing and disappears rather quickly after the arc is extinguished . Therefore , ozone exposure is not one of the more dangerous gases to be exposed to while working . <p> While any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is important to take note of any recommendations pertaining to exposure limits before you begin work . Insuring that you have proper ventilation equipment and have taken all necessary precautions is imperative to maintaining your safety and the safety of those around your work area .

While MIG welding is one of the easiest welding techniques in use , it requires a specific skill set that welders will need to learn to produce high quality MIG welds . One of these specific welding techniques is welding vertical up , which is one of the most difficult types of MIG welds . <p> To perform vertical up welds you will first need to open the front or side lid , depending on the model of MIG welder you are using , and locate the weld-guide-chart which lists the recommended voltage and wire speed setting for different types of metals .

Once you have finished welding the pieces together , check your weld bead to see if you have a good pattern and overlap , and that you achieved proper penetration . With practice , you 'll be able to add the vertical up welding technique to your set of welding skills .

A chamber is used because while welding titanium , heat will naturally spread throughout the material , which is also known as a heat affected zone of HAZ for short . Oxygen will react to titanium at a temperature just below its melting point , and therefore should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain temperature . The entire area of the heat affected zone must constantly be purged with argon until the surface temperature of the titanium will no longer react to the oxygen . <p> The ability to control these factors may be the difference between successfully welding titanium and creating a piece that is not welded properly and will have a weak weld . Welding titanium is a very expensive process and is usually only performed by welders who have years of experience and have a specialty in the field of titanium welding . Due to the amount of skill and knowledge required to properly weld titanium , it is an aspect of the welding field that is not suited for beginners . <p> Many welders have practiced and worked in the field for many years before they feel that they are skilled enough to attempt the titanium welding process .

@@25165946 @5165946/ <h> Tips for Practicing TIG Welding <p> If you 're getting started with TIG welding as a hobby or as a potential new welding career that could pay off in the long run , its good to develop a clear plan for practicing your welding technique . TIG welding is specialized and has a narrow margin of error , so you ca n't practice enough ! <p> You could blow through a bunch of metal or leave a pile of cracked welds in your wake if you have tons of cash on hand . However , there are some simple and effective ways you can practice TIG welding effectively without spending your life savings on aluminum and steel practice pieces . <h> Practice Feeding the TIG Wire <p> Before you even start welding , learn how to feed the filler wire through your fingers with a TIG glove on . Get the feel of the glove and a clear idea of how fast or slow you can move the wire into the weld puddle before working on a metal piece . <p> You can also practice moving your foot on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your welder while feeding wire . Getting a good feel for the wire will help you keep a good steady rate of filler metal into your weld and let 's you focus on your technique . <h> Common TIG Welding Settings <p> When you begin practicing with your TIG welder , try lengthening and shortening the arc and shaping the electrode so that its either tapered or rounded so that you can see how your machine performs under a variety of conditions and positions . Review the best practices for the type of electrode you 're using , your power settings ( AC or DC , etc. ) , and metal you 're working on . As you switch out metal with varying degrees of thickness , take note of particular settings that prove most useful . <h> Practicing TIG Welding Techniques <p> Besides modifying the materials used , the rate of your filler wire , and the amperage settings on your machine , you should also get a feel for the angle of your TIG torch and the impact that pulsing with a foot peddle can have on your weld puddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions and angles so that you get a sense of welding uphill , or horizontal . Weld lap joints and t-joints , and any other joint you can put together . Its especially helpful to try out different rod sizes in each position so that you can easily select that best combination for your next project . <h> Just Keep Welding Beads <p> Of course all of this TIG welding practice can use up a lot of metal . Some experienced welders suggest that new TIG welders should just begin by making a series of beads , staking them up one after the other . That allows you to push , weave , and try out any other technique you 've learned about . <p> Keep in mind that stacking beads like this can make the metal hot , so while its great to get a sense of what metal looks like when it gets too hot , you should also remember that the weld bead will react differently when the metal is already hot . Also some materials you can not tell if they are hot , for example aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a break every now and then just to give the work piece a chance to cool off . <h> Play with Your Shielding Gas Settings <p> Shielding gas is essential for a clean weld , but too much shielding gas will lead to a long , frustrating day . Learn to recognize when you have too much or too little shielding gas for your TIG welds . <p> Turbulation is caused by too much gas flow . Turbulation causes air to be pulled into the shielding gas cloud and contaminates the weld pool . The more important part is selecting a gas cup sized right for the job . The larger the gas cup the more flow required . Lastly if you are using a gas lens or diffuser will change the shape and density of the shielding gas cloud . A gas lens filters the gas so it is distributed more evenly over the weld pool . The traditional diffusers do not provide an even distribution and are more susceptible to turbulation . <p> Too little shielding gas is also obvious , generally leaving porosity or a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by solely increasing the flow rate . Tungsten extension is a vital source of proper shielding . You will need enough tungsten extension to see the weld and access the pieces being joined , but if the extension is too far it will have the same effect as setting the flow rate too low . <h> Prepare Your Electrode for the Job <p> Contrary to popular belief you can not use a pointed electrode , it will erode the tip and cause your arc to wonder . A flat must be put on the tip , the diameter of the flat depends on the amperage being used . The higher the amperage the larger the flat needs to be . Also the grind lines must be parallel to the length of the tungsten . If it is ground radially it will cause the arc to wander as well . <p> Never round the tip of the tungsten , grind lines attribute to a lot of arc wonder . Therefore if you use a rounded tip your arc will be erratic . Balling of the tungsten is also a thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrodes . If you are using an inverter for aluminum on AC try a ceriated tungsten at a balance around 65% . This balance takes some heat away from the tungsten and allows it to keep a more direct arc . You will notice a decrease in time to start the pool , this is due to he energy density increased by having a more directed arc . You can use that same ceriated tungsten on mild steel , stainless steel , titanium and other alloys using DC straight polarity . <h> Get Deals on TIG Welders and Welding Supplies <p> Visit Bakers Gas and Welding for discounts on name-brand TIG welders , including Lincoln , Miller , and ESAB , as well as TIG welding supplies like bestselling goatskin gloves and auto-darkening helmets. 48841 @qwx248841 <h> 2 thoughts on " Tips for Practicing TIG Welding " <p> Thanks for the tips !

@@25165947 @5165947/ <h> Tips for Welding Fuel Tanks <p> The process of welding gas or diesel tanks can be extremely dangerous . There is the possibility of igniting fuel vapors , and if the welder is using the welding process of MIG or TIG inside a fuel storage tank , they are in danger of suffocating from fumes if argon gas is used . This not only poses a threat to the welder but to anyone who tries to rescue the welder from the interior of the fuel tank . We hope that the tips we 've listed below will help keep you safe if you are required to perform any welds in a fuel tank . <p> Before beginning to work on the fuel tank you should first insure that the battery has been disconnected and that the ignition is in the off position . By making sure that all of the power sources are off , you are reducing the chance that a spark might set off any fuel in the tank . Once you have done this you can then proceed to drain the fuel tank of fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to completely drain the fuel tank in an approved gas container designed for use with flammable liquids . It is highly recommended that the draining of gasoline tanks not be performed over or near inspection pits . <p> Once you have completely removed all of the gas from the tank you can now remove it from the vehicle . It is important that you use the proper ventilation equipment when working with gas tanks due to the high amount of fumes that may be present . <p> After you have safely removed the gas tank from the vehicle you should thoroughly rinse the tank several times with warm , soapy water . The water should be placed in an approved flammable container . Do not dispose of the water in the street or in drains it can cause a very dangerous situation . <p> Your next step will be to evacuate the fuel fumes from the tank using an air hose for a minimum of one hour or until you can no longer detect any fuel fumes . You can conduct chemical tests to determine whether all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank is safe to weld . <p> Any welds performed on the tank should be done according to contract specifications and follow all safety standards . When you are finished with the welding , the tank should be allowed to cool to within five or ten degrees of 70 degrees Fahrenheit . <p> Once the tank has reached the desired temperature and you feel it is cool enough you can now test the integrity of the weld and look for any leaks by placing a small amount of fuel in the tank . If the tank is leak free , you can now reattach the tank following the manufacturer 's specifications .

@@25165950 @5165950/ <h> What You Need for a MIG Spool Gun to Weld Aluminum <p> MIG welders are great for welding a wide variety of metals , but one of the best uses for a MIG welder is welding aluminum . Aluminum is a thin metal where you need to control the amount of power you use while welding . MIG welders have specially adapted spool guns for MIG welding that feed the filler wire electrode directly into the torch . However , before you start buying a MIG welder and a matching spool gun , there are some things you need to know first . <h> Use Enough Power to Weld Aluminum <p> A solid weld penetrates deep into the metal and fuses the joint together , and therefore you need enough power to make sure you achieve proper penetration . A 230V MIG welder will give you enough power to penetrate the metal . Generally speaking , a 115V welder does not have enough power to melt through the aluminum and provide the proper fusion needed . <h> Use the Right Spool Gun to Weld Aluminum <p> Once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next step is to match up your machine with the right sized spool gun . There are different torches and hook ups that you 'll need to consider based on your welding machine . The most important factor will be matching up your spool gun with the duty cycle of your MIG welder so that you do n't get stuck while working on an aluminum project . <p> Though 4043 is the most common wire alloy for aluminum MIG welding wires , you can choose between 4043 or 5356 wires . These types of wires can be used to weld the following types of aluminum : 3000 , 4000 , 5000 and 6000 . <p> 5356 tends to melt faster , requiring a faster wire speed and more skill to keep up with the rate at which the wire melts into the weld joint . 4043 is the best choice for DIY welders at home . <h> Store Your Wire Before Welding Aluminum <p> When exposed to the elements , aluminum MIG wire will oxidize . Do n't open up your MIG wire until you 're ready to load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause an erratic arc , resistance , soot , and affect the feeding speed of the MIG wire while welding . <p> MIG welding with aluminum can be a breeze with the right spool gun and feeder wire , making clean , smooth welds for automotive , farm , and other welding applications . <p> I have a spool gun that was wired to attach to my predator -pro .

@@25165951 @5165951/ <h> How to Successfully Weld Steel Pipe to Stainless Steel Pipe <p> Joining two pieces of dissimilar metals can be somewhat tricky ; however , TIG , MIG and stick welding are all capable of successfully welding steel pipe to stainless steel pipe . The important thing is to know which types of electrodes will produce the desired weld ; for MIG welding using an E70 electrode will hold the pieces of pipe together and a 7018 electrode for stick welding will do the same . But in order for the weld to seal properly , a high-carbon stainless steel electrode must be used . The preferred electrode to use when the joint needs to be sealed is a 309 electrode . This electrode will ensure that the weld has good penetration and seals properly . <p> To begin welding steel pipe to stainless steel pipe you should start by cutting the end off of the welding wire that may be sticking out of the welding tip of the MIG welder . This can easily be trimmed using wire cutters . Next you will need to back spool the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MIG gun and lead . Once you have back spooled the welding wire and removed it from the gun you will now need to load the welding gun with the 309 welding wire . Now that your welding gun is loaded with the proper wire , your next step is to exchange the gas with the three part shielding gas mixture needed for this type of welding . To ensure that the gases have been properly mixed , you should lay the tank on its side and gently roll it back and forth . Once you are satisfied and feel that the gas has been thoroughly combined you can then attach the gas gauges to the gas cylinder . <p> Now that your shielding gases have been properly attached , you can now power on the MIG welder and set the heat and wire speed to the proper setting . Because welding stainless steel requires a higher level of heat than carbon steel , you will need to look at your welding guide to determine the proper heat level for stainless steel . Once your machine is set for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of metal to make sure that everything is working properly . When you feel that your machine is properly set you can now begin to weld the two pieces of pipe together . <p> You should begin your weld on the stainless steel pipe and pull the weld puddle onto the carbon steel pipe . Roll your MIG gun in a circle pattern to flow the puddle while dropping 1/8th of an inch at each down stroke to create a roll of dimes weld . While welding you should watch the bottom of the weld to ensure that proper penetration is being achieved . If you notice that the carbon steel pipe is under-cutting , you need to reduce the heat setting on your MIG welder and repeat the process . If reducing the heat setting fails to improve the level of under-cutting taking place , you should speed up the stroke of your circle so that you can pull the heat away from the steel pipe . Doing this should help rectify the under-cutting and leave you with a strong sturdy weld . <p> Once the weld is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that there are n't any defects or weak areas .

This melted electrode mixes with the melting metals in the work piece in order to form a weld . <p> The electrodes core provides the filling material for the weld , while the outer layer of the electrode , the flux , helps create an arc and provides a shielding gas and protective layer of slagwhich keeps contaminants out of the weld and will later be chipped away . <p> If performed correctly , this kind of weld will be extremely strong . Stick welding is one of the most popular kinds of arc welding . <h> Applications for Stick Welding <p> Repairs to farm equipment ( see Welding on the Farm ) , hobbies , repairs at home , and industrial projects . <h> About This Article <p> This is not an exhaustive guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are new to welding and unsure about your material , equipment , or technique , please consult an expert . The following article is a series of guidelines that will provide basic welding information and links , but is not a substitute for an expert 's on-site advice . Additional resources are included at the end of this article for those ready to take the next step . <h> Why Use Stick Welding ? <p> Stick welding is one of the most effective techniques for fusing alloys and joints . While there are other techniques , stick welding is the most economical and effective because different metals can be welded by changing the rod . Stick welding can be done both inside and outside . Wind or a strong draft will not affect the welding process since there 's no shielding gas . Stick welding still works even if the welding surface is less than perfect . <h> What You Need <h> Welding Safety <p> Make sure the metal is free of any oil , grease , paint , zinc , or lead . Welding contaminated metals may create harmful fumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stronger weld . <p> Invest in a helmet , gloves , jacket , boots , clamps , and any other safety gear a project may require . Welding produces sparks , static electricity , and possibly toxic fumes . Consult a professional if unsure about the proper safety measures before starting a welding project . <p> Keep in mind that stick welding with DC power is easier to start , splatters less , has fewer arc outages and sticking , makes better looking welds , makes it easier to weld in different positions , gives 10% more penetration ( in a DC reverse polarity over any amp in AC ) , and allows a smoother arc . However , AC makes it possible to stick weld magnetized parts . <h> Setting Up <p> When setting up a welding machine , begin by choosing an electrode rod ( see this guide on selecting a rod ) and inserting it into the electrode holder . Set the polarity and the amperage of the welding machine according to the manufacturers recommendations for the type of metal and electrode ( see Miller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welding position and penetration will work the best . Thick metals need more current than thin metals , and a large electrode requires more amperage than a large electrode . <p> A weld is created when an electric current in the electrode holder heats the electrode . An arc in between the electrode and work piece will melt the metal work piece and the electrode in order to form the weld . In order to begin welding , the arc must be struck . <p> In order to strike an arc , lightly slide the electrode across the metal as if lighting a match and immediately lift it after making brief contact with the metal . Do n't move it too far from the metal or the arc may go out . If electrode sticks to the metal , twist it free . Learn how to strike an arc by watching this video . <p> When striking the arc , there 's a chance the flux on the outside of the electrode will be damaged . There are two ways to proceed . One involves striking an arc on a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by holding the electrode rod a quarter inch from the metal . The other requires removing the electrode rod from the holder and scraping away the damaged flux . <p> During the stick welding process , the electrode rod is typically dragged ahead of the puddle that is formed in between the two metals that are being joined together . This prevents slag from contaminating the weld . Depending on the nature of the project , the rod will either be moved in a back and forth whipping motion , in circles that will help join the metals together , or in a wide side to side weaving motion . <p> While welding , listen for the crackle of the burning electrode in order to determine if the amperage is set correctly . The ideal sound is comparable to the sizzle of eggs in a frying pan . If the electrode rod sticks , the amperage is too low . If the electrode turns red , the amperage is too high . <p> When stick welding , the electrode should be almost perpendicular to the work , though a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , move at a constant speed , and feed the electrode at a steady rate as it melts . For welding diagrams and tips , see the Miller Stick Welding Guide . <p> After welding is completed , remove the slag with a welding hammer and wire brush .

@@25165961 @5165961/ <h> Tips for Measuring a Fillet Weld <p> A fillet weld typically can be found between two perpendicular pieces of metal . In order for your fillet weld to fit properly it should be the same size as that of the thinnest piece of metal in the weld joint . To correctly measure your fillet weld you should first determine if the fillet weld is convex or concave . It is easy to spot the difference between the two because a concave weld is lower in the middle and higher on the sides while a convex weld is the opposite with the center of the fillet weld being the highest point of the weld . It is recommended that you use a fillet weld gauge to measure the thickness of the fillet weld . <p> The first step in measuring a fillet weld is to determine the thickness of the pieces of metal being joined by the fillet weld . To do this you will place the metal gauge onto each piece of metal to determine thickness . You should then use the thickness size of the thinnest piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of this process would be if one of the pieces of metal you 'll be welding is 10 gauge and the other piece is a 1/4 inch plate then the fillet weld you use should be no smaller than 1/8 inch in thickness . <p> Next you will want to examine the weld to see if the throat of the fillet weld is convex or concave in nature . The throat of the fillet weld refers to the face of the weld which faces out from the weld joint . Using the notched end of the fillet weld gauge you will determine the correct throat width of the fillet weld . It is important that the throat of the fillet touch the entire area in the fillet weld gauge to determine the correct size needed . <p> Now your next step will be to slide the fillet weld gauge along one side of the metal entering the weld . In order for the fillet weld gauge to pass , the side of the fillet weld must touch the height notch . To insure that your fillet weld is correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite side of the fillet weld as well . <p> If the weld is larger than the smallest fillet weld size you should use a larger fillet weld gauge to find the correct size . You should increase the size of the gauge until the fillet weld fills the notch in the fillet weld gauge completely . This is the correct size of weld fillet that you will need to complete the weld . <p> Finally , after determining the size of the weld fillet you will want to mark the correct size onto one of the pieces of metal that are coming into the weld joint with a permanent marker . Once you have completed these steps you are ready to weld . 48841 @qwx248841 <h> One thought on " Tips for Measuring a Fillet Weld " <p> in this article author told find thinnest piece of metal in which he take one is 10GAuge and other is 14 ? . and then consider the fillet weld you use should be no smaller than 1/8 inch in thickness . but in this two metal 10 Gauge thickness metal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . pls explain .

For experienced welders , there is always another tool to buy for each new project that comes along . The selection can be staggering with so many choices out there . Baker 's Gas and Welding offers top of the line products from leading companies so that welders do n't have to wonder about the quality of their purchases . <p> For welders who are either just starting out or looking to add a new tool to their shops , here is a guide about some basic welding equipment and protective gear . <h> A Guide to Selecting Welding Equipment <h> Welders <p> The voltage power , AC/DC settings , and duty cycle are some of the most important factors to consider when choosing a welder . The welder will need both the power and a sufficient operating time ( the duty cycle ) in order to complete every project . Choosing between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of balancing cost , skill , portability , convenience , and the nature of the project . MIG welding is simple to use , but it is costly and not as portable as the simple stick welding process . TIG welding creates high quality , clean welds , but it is much more difficult to learn . Read Baker 's Guide to Choosing a Welder <h> Electrodes <p> There are specific electrodes that match each of the three main welding processes . Stick welding uses a consumable electrode that is melted in order to create the weld joint . The E6010 electrode is one of the most popular electrodes , though the E6011 , E6013 , and E7018 are frequently listed by welders as excellent choices . <p> MIG welding uses a consumable electrode wire that is fed through the welding torch . Most projects use wire in the following range of thickness : .023 , .030 , .035 , and .045 , though a thicker wire may be needed for larger projects . <p> TIG welders use non-consumable electrodes that come in five main varieties .

If a workpiece shifts , the weld could be crooked and result in the loss of significant time if it has to be ground down and welded again . <p> The more clamps , the better . Some welders have stopped in the middle of their projects in order to buy more clamps , which shows just how important clamps are for welding . Find Clamps for Your Project <h> Angle Grinders <p> Angle grinders are critical for preparing metal prior to welding , especially for MIG and TIG welding . An angle grinder is a portable tool that has the arbor at 90 degrees in relation to the tool . Depending on their size , grinders vary from 500 to 2500 watts .

Dark face plates are good for preventing exposure to the ultraviolet rays . <p> Welding helmets are a critical piece of equipment because they protect your face from sparks and your eyes from harmful rays . The best choice for a welding helmet is an auto-darkening helmet that allows welders to keep both hands on task without having to reach up to put on the darkening visor . <p> A good weld can go bad if a torch shifts even an inch .

The right shielding gas can make all the difference in the shape , transfer of heat , alloy content , fume generation , and a host of other details that will impact your finished weld . <p> As a fabricator , you will do well to have a basic understanding of the chemistry involved in shielding gases . So today , we want to remove some of that confusion for you by giving you a very brief , yet informative look at shielding gases 101 . After beefing up your knowledge in this area , you will produce stronger , smoother welds in no time . <h> Basics of Shielding Gases <p> Before we get started you will want to keep these three things in mind about the way that shielding gases work . The simple properties of these gasses that will influence your weld are as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The chemical reaction each gas will have with the materials in your welding plate and wire . <p> How each gas will affect the method of transfer between metals . <p> Now that we have these three basics in mind , let 's take a look at the most commonly used shielding gases and their applications . <h> Argon <p> Argon is one of the pure gases used for welding , and is the most popular , the others include helium and carbon dioxide and we will get to those later . Argon is a noble , single atom gas that is used in welding because it is affordable , available and has minimal to no chemical reactions , leaving you with a strong weld and no fumes . <p> Argon gas is often mixed with a bit of oxygen and is ideal when welders want deeper penetration and a more concentrated arc . You will want to use it in MIG welding and TIG welding when working with non-ferrous materials such as aluminum , copper and zinc . <h> Here are a few helpful , binary shielding gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spray transfer on stainless steels , 1% oxygen is sufficient not only to stabilize the arc but to improve appearance and droplet rate . <p> Argon-2%O2-Useful for spray arc welding on carbon steels , low alloy steels and stainless steels , this mixture will give you increased wetting over the 1% mixture while still providing the same quality weld . <p> Argon-5%O2-Providing a weld pool that is more fluid , yet easier to control , this mixture is general carbon steel welding as the extra oxygen provides higher transfer speeds . <h> Helium <p> Let 's talk about Helium , another monoatomic noble gas that is commonly used in TIG welding on non ferrous materials . Unlike argon , helium has a high ionization potential and a greater conductivity , offering the opposite effects of welding with argon . This can give you a bit of trouble when striking an arc if you are not using high frequency arc starting . This gas is rarely used for TIG welds , unless working with copper . <h> Carbon Dioxide <p> Carbon Dioxide is a fairly complex , compound molecule that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When working with CO2 keep in mind the way it will react in your arc , the carbon and oxygen will separate and if you are not careful they could oxidize your base metals and cause dealloying of your weld bead or puddle . <p> Working with CO2 can produce a nicely balanced width to depth penetration profile but in MIG welding it is unable to give you a spray transfer and it can give you a globular transfer with a fair amount of spatter . <h> Other Gases Used In Mixtures ( The Basics ) <p> Oxygen A polyatomic molecule , generally used at mixtures of less than 10% in MIG applications . <p> Hydrogen Generally used with austenitic stainless steels at a mixture of less than 10% <p> So , after your whirlwind education in shielding gases you can feel a bit more confident when deciding which to use in your next welding project .

@@25165965 @5165965/ <h> How to Choose a Plasma Cutter <p> A plasma cutter cuts metal by sending air or an inert gas through a plasma torch , sparking an electrical arc , and then forcing plasma through the torch tip to cut metal . The arc of a plasma cutter can reach temperatures of 45,000 degrees F and provide one of the fastest ways to cut metal . <p> Plasma cutters have an on/off switch and an amperage setting that determines how much power to use for cutting . Provided the plasma cutter has enough power to cut through the metal workpiece , plasma is often a very safe , efficient , and clean way to cut metal . <p> While many mention the advantages of plasma over oxy-fuel cutting , a plasma cutter requires a significant up front investment . Though a plasma cutter will certainly pay off in the long run with its speed and low operating costs if you need to cut a lot of metal , it can be daunting to select the right plasma cutter for your business or home workshop needs . <p> The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plasma cutter as well as some helpful links to the Baker 's website where you can learn more about plasma cutters and related products . <h> Match Your Plasma Cutter to Your Work <p> As with purchasing a welder , the kind of plasma cutter you select will be determined by the kind of work you do . Unlike oxy-fuel cutting , a plasma cutter is capable of cutting just about every kind of metal . Therefore , the main consideration when choosing a plasma cutter is the thickness and amount of metal you plan on cutting . Below are some key questions to ask when trying to match a plasma cutter to your work : <p> Are you cutting thick metal ? <p> How often will you use your plasma cutter ? <p> Do you need a portable unit ? <p> Are you willing to adapt your power outlets for your cutter ? <p> Do you have a generator you plan to use with your plasma cutter ? <p> Will your electrical current fluctuate ? <p> As you review your plasma cutter options , these questions will narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your particular needs , it 's likely that choosing between brands will come down to what you 're used to or what 's recommended to you . The main difference between brands is that one manufacturer 's standard feature may be an extra on another brand 's machine . <p> There also are combination units that include a plasma cutter with a stick and TIG welder . If you just want a plasma cutter for the occasional job , this may be a great option provided you can find a unit that meets your TIG or stick welding needs . <p> If you do decide to look into a portable unit that is light and runs off a generator , look for a unit that can handle the fluctuating power of a generator . <h> Choosing a Plasma Cutter 's Output Power <p> The output power of a plasma cutter will determine what it can cut . For example , 12 amps of output power from a 120V machine will be able to cut most 1/8 inch metal , while 60 amps of output power from a 230V machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inch thick . <p> There also are inverter-based plasma cutters available that provide high cutting output power , yet weigh much less than regular cutting machines that offer the same cutting capacity . <h> Choosing a Plasma Cutter 's Cutting Speed <p> The cutting speed for plasma cutters is typically noted as Inches Per Minute ( IPM ) . Your work flow and priorities will determine what you need , but keep in mind that while two plasma cutters may be able to cut through a 1/2 inch of metal , one may cut through the metal in a minute , while the other could take as long as four or five if it has a slow cutting speed . Choosing a machine with the right cutting speed can make the difference between a sound investment and a dip in your productivity . <h> Choosing a Plasma Cutter 's Duty Cycle <p> The duty cycle of a plasma cutter is the amount of time it can operate continuously within a ten minute span before needing to cool off . A five minute duty cycle means a plasma cutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five minutes . If a machine is run at a lower power , the duty cycle may be extended , though excessively hot operating conditions may shorten it . Using a machine beyond its duty cycle will cause it to overheat . <p> A longer duty cycle will be ideal for making long cuts or deep cuts on large pieces of metal , while a shorter duty cycle is ideal for a home shop where a series of small cuts are made regularly . <h> Choosing the Right Torch for a Plasma Cutter <p> There are two common types of plasma cutting torches . The most common torches are the high-frequency starting systems that create a spark with a high-voltage transformer , capacitors , and spark-gap assembly . High frequency torches have the advantage of not using any moving parts and therefore remain fairly dependable . However , they do require occasional maintenance and may create electric noise that can interfere with computers and other nearby electrical equipment in your office , shop , or home . <p> Another option is the contact start torch that uses a moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights the pilot arc . This kind of torch does not create inference with other electrical items and turns on instantly without a pre-flow cycle . <p> An excellent feature to explore in a torch is a drag shield that attaches to the cup of the torch and holds the tip at the ideal 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch from the metal being cut--this distance is known as the " stand off . " The torch can be operated at full capacity with a constant standoff . The standoff distance is based on the thickness of the metal and the amount of amperage used to cut it , with low amperage cutting requiring little to no standoff distance . <p> If you plan on working on thin metal , you will most likely only need a single flow torch that works with limited amperage and does not require an extra flow of shielding gas in order to cool the torch . For larger cutting operations or users who plan on cutting thick metal , a dual flow torch with a shielding gas will make it possible to cut thicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way a torch ignites the plasma arc or utilizes a drag shield , choose a torch design that fits your hand well , especially if you plan on using it for extended periods of time . <h> Choosing Your Consumables for a Plasma Cutter <p> After making the initial purchase of a plasma cutter , the most important ongoing cost will be the cutting tips and electrodes . Therefore , before you pick up a plasma cutter , learn as much as you can about how fast your machine will use these items . A damaged tip from poor technique or a worn out electrode will either slow your cutting speed or reduce the quality of your cuts , and it 's often recommended to change the tip and electrode together in order to achieve best cutting performance . <p> " Consumable cost , or the total consumable cost divided by the consumable life in hours of arc-on time per hour , is the most useful measurement . For example , if the cost of a nozzle is $4 , the cost of the electrode is $6 , and together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per hour , or CPH , is ( $4 + $6 ) /2.5 = $4 . " <h> What Else to Consider for a Plasma Cutter <p> As with any large piece of machinery , it 's important to test out a plasma cutter or to at least make sure the retailer offers a good return policy if the cutter does not live up to its promises . In addition , a reliable warranty will ensure your investment in a new cutting system will be a sound one for the long term .

Best yet , it can be used for a variety of materials in various positions . Stick welders come in a variety of sizes with all kinds of options . Some are a simple AC stick welder , while others offer the option to switch between AC and DC settings . <p> Whether you 're welding a pipeline on your hands and knees for a new welding job , standing all day to weld large structures , or doing a little of everything in a welding shop , here are some stick welding tips to help you get the most out of your stick welder . <h> What Kind of Rod Are You Using ? <p> Its not enough to know which number rod ( electrode ) you 're using . While the thickness of a 6010 or 7018 will naturally make a huge difference in your settings , positions , and technique , the brand name of your rod could make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , running a 7018 rod typically requires a DC setting , but if you only have an AC buzz box , ask around for brands that may run smoother with your machine . It may help to start with the rods made by the manufacturer of the machine you 're using . <p> In addition , the smaller your electrode , say 6010 , the more control you 'll have over the weld , as you can move slower , and get a smoother weld . However , the 7018 will work better for larger joints and will require fewer tie-ins , giving you a smoother , cleaner weld . Welding with a 7018 will often call for less movement , moving your rod far less than a 6010 , which may need to trace the edge of the puddle as you weave your weld . With the 7018 you may only need a steady hand so that the rod is pointed straight into the weld joint . <h> Dealing with Stick Welding Slag <p> Its true that stick welding makes it significantly easier to burn through impurities , rust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prep work with a stick welder . However , you 'll still have to deal with a layer of slag once you 're done welding . <p> The good news is that you can get better at your settings and technique to the point that may be able to simply chip the slag off using a chipping hammer or sand paper . <h> Tacking a Stick Welding Project <p> A tack requires a sudden blast of power to a weld joint in order to hold pieces of metal together . You can really wreck a weld if you do n't  get the tacks strong enough so that they hold together while welding , so take the time to make sure you 've got enough power . <h> Stick Welding Pipes <p> Stick welding on a pipe is a whole other matter from uphill or horizontal welding projects .

If you have been welding for three or more years , chances are you do n't need a welding certification . For most people a welding certification is a crutch to get your foot in the door . This applies to experienced welders and the less experienced .

Or let 's say you are a student who is about to graduate . In this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting hired . <p> The funny thing about employers is that the human resource department does not look at anything but experience .

Without entering into a debate about the best cutting fuel , the current shortage means that welders will need to explore alternative fuels and the appropriate equipment modifications in order to keep working . <h> Propane as an Acetylene Alternative <p> Propane and other propane-based fuels are frequently used as substitutes for acetylene . In fact , many cutting operations are saving on fuel costs after switching over to propane . While propane does n't burn hot enough for welding , its outer cone offers a high number of BTUs . The flame for acetylene concentrates the heat inside the cone , which means that welders used to acetylene will need to adapt their techniques . Cutting with the inner cone of propane will only result in frustration . <p> When preheating metal for cutting , propane sometimes takes a little longer . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone , preheating wo n't take much longer than acetylene . Besides technique changes , there are some important changes welders need to make in order to switch over to propane and cut effectively with it . <p> While many welders correctly note that it 's possible to switch over to propane by only changing a torch tip , this limited modification will make propane far less effective for cutting . Propane requires a different torch ( injector style ) because propane is much heavier than other fuels . <p> Switching to the correct torch and torch tip enables propane to reach a higher temperature . In addition , an injector torch makes cuts that some claim to be cleaner and faster than acetylene . <h> Propylene as an Acetylene Alternative <p> Much like propane , propylene is often misunderstood as ineffective as a fuel for cutting since it requires an injector torch in order to achieve optimal heat flow .

The mixture of propane and HGX-3 is referred to commonly as HGX propane . This mixture cuts metal at temperatures comparable to acetylene , and offers great value since one gallon of HGX-3 can be added to 1,000 gallons of propane . <p> HGX-3 increases the flame temperature of propane gas by 15% , reaching flame temperatures of 5400-F , and uses less oxygen than acetylene . This makes HGX propane a viable alternative for welders used to the heat output and speed achieved with acetylene for flame cutting , brazing , and even some welding procedures such as aluminum welding and cast iron welding . <p> Much like other alternative fuels , HGX propane reduces slag and makes for a smoother , cleaner cut , but it also requires specific components such as compatible tips and hoses .

At-will employees can be let go for any reason at anytime ( or even without reason ) . Unions usually require proof from the employer of wrongdoing , policy violations , or incompetence before disciplinary actions are taken . <p> Union members may receive many of the following benefits : protection against double jeopardy , representation in instance of employer investigation and employee appeal , due process through discipline and firing , protection against self-incrimination , and a third-party objective viewpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firing decisions . Unions may help to set a company 's standards for expertise , merit , and productivity .

@@25165994 @5165994/ <h> Introduction to Brazing <p> Brazing is a welding process that is used to join two pieces of base metal using melted filler which flows across the joint . When the filler metal cools , it creates a solid weld between the two pieces of metal . The process of brazing is similar in nature to that of soldering , and brazing forms a very strong welded joint which tends to be stronger than either of the base metals on their own . Brazing allows welders to create a strong weld and does not cause the base metals to melt or lose their shape while the process is being completed . The process of brazing is commonly used when the welder needs to create a joint that is invisible to the naked eye , yet strong enough to hold up in a variety of temperatures . Joints that are created using the brazing technique are often pliable and can withstand jolts and twisting . <p> The technique of brazing is somewhat similar to that used in soldering except that the temperatures that can be used with either method differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , metals of a flat nature or any other shape of metal as long as the two pieces being joined fit snugly against each other without any large gaps . Brazing can also be used to join unusual combinations that feature linear joints . <p> Before beginning to braze a welder must clean the entire area of the metals that are going to be joined , otherwise the melted brazing mixture will become lumpy and not flow as it should which will result in the formation of an inconsistent joint . To avoid the formation of inconsistent joints , you should clean the surfaces of the metals and then apply melted flux . Flux is used to remove oxides and prevent further oxidation while the brazing is being performed . Flux also smoothes the surface to allow the braze to easily flow over the joint . <p> Once you have thoroughly cleansed the metal pieces you will be working with , you will need to gather the tools you will be working with . This includes preparing your work area and preparing your torch and the braze alloy you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use gases like acetylene and hydrogen to produce an extremely high level of heat typically between 800 and 2000 degrees Fahrenheit . It is important that the temperature be low enough not to melt the base metal but hot enough to melt the filler metal being used to create the joint . The temperature of your torch can be adjusted using the controls to reach the correct temperature . <p> After you have cleaned the base metals and set your torch at the appropriate temperature , you are now ready to begin brazing . Braze can be purchased in either a stick , disc or wire form . Depending on which type you prefer to work with or the shape of the joint you will be creating , there is a form of braze that will work . Once you have heated the base metals near the location of the joint you will be forming you will want to bring the wire to the hot pieces and allow the braze to melt and flow around the joint . The term flow refers to the braze penetrating the joint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braze is done in the correct way , the result will be a bond that is virtually indestructible . <p> There are many advantages to using brazing over spot welding or soldering . A brazed joint tends to be smooth and complete and creates an airtight and watertight bond . Brazed joints can also conduct electricity in the same manner that the base metals were able to . Brazing can also be used to join metals that are dissimilar in nature .

While there are plenty of places you can go to learn how to weld there are some basic elements that you will want to consider before lighting that first torch . If you are going to be setting up your own welding workspace near your home there are some important aspects that you need to be aware of . <p> Firstly , no matter where you plan to be doing your welding you want to ensure that it is someplace that will obviously tolerate high heat levels and an abundance of smoke . So setting up shop near your propane tank is not advisable nor is doing so in a tightly sealed area . If you are going to be welding in say your garage you want to position your bench near the front of it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can also add a fan or two . And if you are near your home or another residence make sure those doorways and windows are shut tight so you are n't blowing your smoke into that enclosed area . Secondly you will need to make sure that where you are welding there is an adequate power supply , preferably one that is close enough that you wo n't need to use an extension cord . Your welder will be able to maximize its full amperage potential if it is plugged directly into the power supply , but if you have no other option but to plug it into an extension cord check that it is one that allows your welder to run at its highest level . <p> In terms of just how much electric power you will be needing for your welding projects you can expect your arc welders to use anywhere between 110 and 220 volts . If you are just beginning and planning on your welding being more of a hobby you can get by with a welder that is 110 volt and will be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a branch circuit with a total capability of 20 amps between the wiring , receptacle , and circuit breaker . Alright , so just what kind of welder should you be looking into ? The most used types of welders for a work area at home are : wire-feed , stick , and oxy-acetylene . In fact it is common to actually have two of these with either one wire-feed or stick welder and then also an oxy-acetylene one that is then used in cutting and brazing . <p> Stick welders are significantly less expensive than wire-feeders , anywhere between four and five times cheaper , but they are more difficult to begin learning how to weld with . Stick welders , or rod welders , may be more simplistic in design but they do have a wider array of electrodes that enable them to weld with more varying materials and conditions such as dirty and rusted metals , overhead welding , and vertical welding . Wire-feed welders then are best for beginners because they can work with shielding gasses , ones that are noncombustible and inert , meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly ready to paint when the weld has been given time to cool . They work more compatibly with this thin sheet metal as well as other metals because you can switch the wires that you are using , making your welding tasks easier . Wire-feeders also produce significantly less smoky fumes than stick welders . Finally , the oxy-acetylene welders are actually able to be used for not only welding but cutting too as you are able to change tips , fluxes , and rods . These then are great to have in addition to one of the other two aforementioned welding tools . <p> Lastly , outside of the actual welders you will need a few other pieces of welding equipment . These include a chipping hammer/wire brush , drill bits , punches , ball-peen hammer , tap-and-die set , cold chisels , hacksaw frame and blades , marking tools , and metal-scribing . Many of these are things you would need for other metal related hobbies and may already have in your workshop .

Welding for a hobby or career can bring you infinite pleasure ( and even a nice paycheck to boot ) but when you are just beginning it can be a bit daunting at first . This does n't need to be the case and if you know the basics before getting started the journey will be all the easier !

This minimizes the number of items on the maintenance checklist . <p> However , since the oil in an air-cooled engine acts not only as a lubricant , but also a coolant , the importance of maintaining oil level and changing the oil and filter at regular intervals is critical . Checking the oil level before starting the engine is good practice . <p> Today 's industrial air-cooled gasoline engines are a far cry from the simple lawn mower engines of the past . With full pressure lubrication , automotive style valve trains and spin on oil filters , the oil systems are designed not only for durability , but it is also fairly easy to change the oil and filter . <h> Coolant Levels for Welder-Generators <p> Welder generators with the Kubota diesel engine have the most durable engine components but the liquid cooling system does occasionally need attention .

Filter clogging is a function of fuel cleanliness and so many users that fill from above ground storage tanks or from small carry cans may see excessive dirt in their fuel tank . This leads to clogged fuel filters that will reduce fuel flow and cause engine performance issues . <p> Regular fuel filter changes will go a long way in preventing unwanted engine performance issues down the road . The fuel injectors on the Kohler EFI engine require cleaner fuel and thus a fine filter is present on EFI products .

While solid MIG wire requires a shielding gas to protect the weld , typically a mix of Argon and CO2 , there 's also flux cored MIG wire that shields the weld on its own without the help of gas . The flux in the MIG wire melts in the weld puddle and provides all of the shielding your weld requires , and you can chip the flux away after it hardens . <p> Both types of MIG welding wires offer advantages and disadvantages , and well take a look at which will work the best for your welding project . Here are several scenarios to consider when choosing your MIG welding process . <h> One Twist with MIG Welding Wires <p> Before we get started with flux cored MIG wire vs. shielded solid MIG wire , you also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire that is typically use for vertical and uphill MIG welds .

At the very least a flux cored wire removes the need to worry about shielding gas , which adds an element that needs your attention and adds an additional cost . <h> Material Thickness Concerns with MIG Welders <p> When you 're MIG welding on thin material , the flux cored option is not ideal . Youll be better off using solid cored MIG wire with shielding gas that provides a cleaner , more precise weld . <p> When you work with a flux cored MIG wire you 're going to have a lot of spatter on the weld that will need to be cleaned up at the end , which usually is n't recommended for thinner metals . In addition , some welders recommend only working with metal that is 20 gauge or more when welding with flux cored MIG wire . <h> Weld Quality with MIG Welders <p> Many welders opt for a MIG welder because of its convenience and accuracy when creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean welds that will be neat and visually appealing that is , if you use a solid wire with shielding gas .

At this point you will need to adjust the electrode angle so that it is 12 to 20 degrees from the vertical position and allow the cellulosic electrode to form a molten pool on the metal . It is important when using cellulosic electrodes that you keep the electrode angle and height constant as you weld . <p> To move your electrode once you have begun welding you should move your entire body not just your wrist .

Switching from acetylene to propane or any other alternative fuel will require equipment changes for the torch tip , torch itself , and hose depending on the fuel . <p> HGX Propane : HGX-3 is a new product on the market that can be added to propane in order to increase its performance . This mixture , referred to commonly as HGX propane , cuts metal at temperatures comparable to acetylene . One gallon of HGX-3 can be added to 1,000 gallons of propane . <p> HGX-3 increases the flame temperature of propane gas by 15% , reaching flame temperatures of 5400F and uses less oxygen than acetylene . This makes HGX propane a viable alternative for welders used to the heat output and speed achieved with acetylene for flame cutting . Much like other alternative fuels , HGX propane reduces slag and makes for a smoother , cleaner cut . <p> One of the biggest advantages alternative fuel gases such as HGX propane have over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied in individual cylinders with a maximum capacity of approximately 400 cubic feet per cylinder , while the alternative fuel gases can be supplied in either cylinders , bulk stations , and even from a pipeline . <p> Propylene : Much like propane , propylene is often misunderstood as ineffective as a fuel for cutting since it requires an injector torch in order to achieve optimal heat flow and cuts and concentrates the heat on the outer edges of the heat cone . The tips for propylene rarely need cleaning and provide eight holes for effective pre-heating . In other words , effectively using propylene rests entirely on having the correct torch and tip setup . <p> Welding Tips and Tricks recommends propylene as a great alternative since it offers no 15 psi limit on working pressures , no soot , more BTU 's of heat for heating thick metal , and quick cuts on metal . <p> MAPP : MAPP gas is commonly used instead of acetylene because it can be used above 15 psi and is therefore far less dangerous while cutting steel up to 12 inches thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a liquefied petroleum gas that can be stored more easily since it compresses easily . <p> MAPP gas is more commonly used as a substitute for acetylene in Oxy-welding . While other gases such as propane , propylene , and HGX Propane are more widely used for cutting and brazing , MAPP can be used in place of acetylene , even though MAPP does n't  burn quite as hot and can be expensive for large-scale operations . <h> Tips on Cutting Torches <p> The tips on torches are designed for each specific kind of fuel and will determine how effectively you can cut . Using the wrong tip for a particular kind of fuel will prevent you from reaching the optimal temperature and will limit the torch 's effectiveness for cutting . For example , an acetylene torch tip does not have the correct number of holes for cutting with propane , and therefore propane with an acetylene tip wo n't reach optimal heat and will be extremely ineffective for cutting . <p> Torch cutting tips come in two styles : one piece and two-piece . <p> One-piece tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are machined with either 4 or 6 preheated holes and can handle light , medium , and heavy preheats . There are different 1-piece torch cutting tips that perform different functions from gouging out metal to cutting sheet metal and other specialty functions . One-piece tips use methyl acetylene propadiene ( MAPP ) , acetylene , and propylene , though each fuel has a different number of holes that match a particular kind of fuel , so be sure to take note of the number of holes in each torch tip . <p> Two-piece tips require cooler and slower burning fuel gases such as propane . In the case of propane , it 's also critical to use the right kind of torch . An injector torch allows welders to make cuts that some claim to be cleaner and faster than acetylene . Propane also offers more versatility for bending and heating . <p> Finding the right tip for a job can be confusing . The American Welding Society ( AWS ) issued a Uniform Designation System for Oxy-Fuel Nozzles back in 2000 . In it they asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them as well as the identifying fuel symbol , maximum material thickness , and part number for data and reference ; however many manufacturers still do not follow these designations due to the extra manufacturing costs entailed . When shopping for tips , check the oxygen bore size , orifice size , and fuel gas required . <h> Torch Cutting Basics <p> When oxy-cutting , managing the oxygen flow rate will determine what kind of cut is made . Torch cutting with too much oxygen both adds to the overall cost and results in a wide cut with curved edges , rather than the sharp , clean edges that are desired when cutting with a torch . Too little oxygen produces a slow , uneven cut that will be frustrating . The flow rate of the oxygen should match the manufacturer 's specifications for the torch tip used for cutting . <p> Cutting with a torch is performed by preheating the metal and then cutting at a high temperature . This process will melt the metal being cut . Therefore set up a grate or other object that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cutting steel . It is almost always twice as fast as a grinder and can cut large sections with very little effort or noise . Ferrous metals up to two inches thick can be effectively cut with oxy-cutting fuels such as acetylene . <h> Torch Cutting Safety <p> Oxy-cutting fuels are among the most flammable and require proper safety precautions for storage and usage . Acetylene is hazardous above 15 psi pressure , as it becomes unstable and explosively decomposes . <p> One should never use concrete as base for cutting since concrete holds water . When the cutting torches heat makes contact with the concrete , the heat will cause the water in the concrete to expand and the concrete to explode . <p> Take extra caution and time when cleaning the tips of cutting torches . Make sure the orifice is always free of any debris and smooth . Use protective welding gear at all times and welding screens . Make sure you are using the right size tip for the job and that the tip matches the fuel use . <p> Hoses should regularly be checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of hose for a particular fuel will deteriorate your hose over time . While some welders have found they can occasionally use a fuel such as propane with an acetylene hose , the best long term solution is to use the proper hose with each type of fuel . <p> If your hose leaks , fuel gases that are denser than air ( Propane , Propylene , MAPP , Butane , etc ... ) will most likely collect in lower areas and present a flame hazard , especially in basements , sinks , storm drains , and other enclosed areas . Cutting fuels are made to burn , so take proper precautions with your work clothing , location of fire extinguishers , ventilation , and equipment maintenance .

@@25166027 @5166027/ <h> Air Cooled vs . Water Cooled TIG Welding Torches : How to Choose <p> When you 're TIG welding there 's only so much that a top brand welding glove can do for you if your torch heats up and you cant cool it down fast enough . The longer you weld , the hotter your torch will get , and youll need to cool it off with either an air cooling or water cooling system . Which is better ? <p> While welders who work on TIG machines all day will tell you there 's no competition between the two cooling options ( theyll pick water cooled every time ) , here 's a look at the options you can consider , including circumstances when air-cooled may be ideal : <h> Torch Size for TIG Welders <p> There are small and large torch sizes to consider first . A larger torch with a lot of power will need to be water cooled if you want to weld for any length of time , while a smaller torch can be air or water cooled . <p> Large torches are typical for operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical for welders , especially hobby/home welders to opt for the precision of a small torch . The rest of this post will assume that you 're considering a small torch . <h> Welding Outside with an Air-Cooled TIG Torch <p> If you 're welding in a remote location , outside , or in a place where you wont have access to water , its ideal to use an air-cooled torch . Besides saving you a good bit of money on the cooling set up , air-cooled torches provide the flexibility you need to work in multiple locations and enable welders to travel light from one job location to another . <h> Welding Short Beads with an Air-Cooled TIG Torch <p> The main limitation with an air-cooled torch comes when you 're working on a large project and your torch becomes too hot to hold .

This can prove especially important when you 're working on a small , precise weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heats up , you 'll either have a hard time keeping your hand steady or you may need to stop too soon . <h> Long Beads at High Amperages with a Water-Cooled TIG Torch <p> Water-cooled torches really shine when you 're working for long stretches of time , running beads continuously . Professional welders note that they can work at higher temperatures , faster paces , and for longer stretches of time with a water-cooled torch . <p> If your goal is to weld professionally in a shop using a TIG welder , then you 'll definitely want to invest in a water-cooled torch set up . Your welds will be steady and comfortable no matter how long your welding bead needs to be . <h> One Last Point on TIG Welding Torches <p> If you choose to go with an air-cooled torch , you may notice that some torches have a letter listed in the product description .

However , whenever you read a discussion on a welding forum about which one is better , it 's hard to find everything you need to know about both helmets in one place . There 's usually someone who shares about his experience with one helmet , but it 's rare to find someone who has owned both helmets and can offer a simple side by side comparison . The post that follows will dig into what both helmets share in common and what makes them different so you can compare them both in one place . <p> - - - <p> While a welding helmet comparison requires digging into the fine details of each helmet , it 's important to remember that both helmets are top of the line products . There is no shortage of stories about welders who have bought one of these helmets who will never buy a different helmet again . So while we can pick apart some flaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that both helmets offer many of the same features . <p> The real differences come down to user preferences , comfort , and a few other factors . We 'll begin by looking at what both helmets share . <h> What Lincoln and Miller 's Welding Helmets Share <p> Both helmets offer four sensors and a wide selection of lens shades that will protect your eyes while still providing excellent visibility . You 'll be able to easily TIG weld , MIG weld , or stick weld with either helmet . <p> Both helmets also have a grinding mode that makes it possible to use your helmet in a variety of metal prepping applications . Without grinding mode , your auto-darkening helmet wo n't work for a grinding project . <p> The combination of batteries and solar power on both helmets is another plus for users who need the reliability of a battery and the economy offered by solar power . <p> Generally speaking , users of both helmets say they are comfortable and can be adapted to hard hats . Reviewers of the Digital Elite have especially praised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up without it sliding down . <p> If you need to use a magnifying lens , both helmets offer that feature . <h> Advantage Lincoln <p> One of the most common reasons welders choose the Viking helmet over the Digital Elite is the price . Depending on the deals you find , the Viking could cost anywhere from $50 to $100 less . However , prices and promotions fluctuate online so regularly that the price difference one day may be negligible ( as of this writing , the price difference between the two helmets at Baker 's Gas and Welding is within $40 ) . Nevertheless , the Viking helmet tends to cost less on a regular basis . <p> Lincoln 's 3350 Viking helmet also enjoys a few edges on Miller . For example , the Viking viewing area is slightly wider , - 3.74 in x 3.34 in- to Miller 's 3.85 in x 2.38 in . In addition , the replacement lens for the Viking helmet is a standard size on the Viking helmet .

That may be a significant draw back for the hobby welder who needs to replace a lens while working on a Sunday afternoon welding project . Lincoln 's lens versatility may not matter quite as much to welders who work during the week at a shop . <p> Though the lens speeds are nearly identical for both helmets , the Viking helmet 's lens speed is 1/25,000 compared to Miller 's 1/20,000 . <p> While some welders will certainly use the Digital Elite for overhead welding projects , it 's not technically rated for overhead welding in the specs . If you plan on doing a lot of overhead welding , consider the Viking helmet . <h> Advantage Miller <p> The most talked about feature in the Digital Elite is X Mode , a setting that you can turn on in order to reduce the possibility of being flashed in tight spaces or while working on pipe lines . This feature may be the single greatest deciding factor for some welders who work out of position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X Mode detects the electromagnetic field from the welding arc and provides continual eye protection even if the sensors ca n't pick up any flash from the welder . Most welders leave this setting on all of the time , since it removes any possibility of ever being flashed . <h> Which Auto-Darkening Welding Helmet Is For You ? <p> For starters , you ca n't go wrong with either auto-darkening welding helmet . Both helmets will protect your eyes and offer all of the best features you can ask for in a welding helmet . For some users the price and lens versatility of the Lincoln helmet will put it on top . For others the X Mode of the Digital Elite make it the perfect helmet . As with any other welding product , you 'll need to figure out which features work best for your welding needs . <p> I would pick a Lincoln Viking than a Millers since they are rather same same but Lincoln Viking has a better price and the X mode from Miller can be replaced by adjusting the sensitivity and shade on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmets and prefer the Miller because I do low-level welding ( &lt;20 amps ) and sometimes the clamps I use block the sensors on the Lincoln ; the Miller , with XMode , never flashes . <p> I have both the Lincoln and Miller . I like them both , but when I 'm working in the field I prefer the Miller because of the X-mode and durability . The lincoln has a great lens with a lot of clarity but the shell feels a bit flimsy . I use my Lincoln only in the shop .

A flash can essentially cause a sun burn on your eye , leading to a great deal of discomfort--a sensation that has been compared to having sand thrown in your eyes . By wearing an auto-darkening helmet , you 'll protect your eyes while you work and especially whenever a flash flares up . <p> Auto-darkening helmets also make it very easy to start working without flipping your helmet down .

The distraction of flipping down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Auto-darkening removes this potential problem . <p> The one thing to keep in mind about an auto-darkening helmet is that learning how to weld with an auto-darkening helmet will make it nearly impossible to successfully weld with a helmet that does n't offer this feature . Though auto-darkening is common , you are locking yourself into this kind of helmet for the foreseeable future . Most welders do n't have a problem with that , but it 's one factor to keep in mind . <h> Sensors for a Welding Helmet <p> The best welding helmets have four sensors that will catch any flashes while you work in a variety of angles . Some less expensive helmets have two sensors that work fine for regular position welds but may not catch every flash while you weld out of position . Four sensors are excellent for out of position welding where a pipe or other obstruction may block your sensors from picking up a flash . Four sensors ensures you 're always protected . <h> Lens Shade Options <p> The more lens shape options you have in your welding helmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to start by grinding or cutting metal , <p> A 9-13 shade is standard , but some helmets come with a 6-13 shade that provides grinding modes so that you do n't have to switch off your helmet while on the job .

Since you ca n't predict flashes , auto-darkening helmets with a wide range of shades are extremely handy . The itself on the helmet will protect you from the UV rays while welding , but the shades handle the flashes . <p> Some helmets also provide a slot or a clip for a magnifying or " cheater " lens that helps you see smaller weld joints . <h> Helmet Power Source <p> The power source for a welding helmet can be tricky , as some helmets come with a power supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet or picking up a helmet on the cheap , make sure it offers a replaceable power source . <p> Welding helmets are either powered by batteries , solar panels , or a combination of the two . Solar power is a great way to extend the life of your batters if you use them together . Solar by itself usually ca n't be replaced , and therefore a lot of welders prefer a combination power source or batteries alone . The disadvantage of batteries alone is that you need to replace them frequently . <p> Another helpful feature on a welding helmet is the auto-off setting . This will save your power source and ensure that you never drain your helmet of power , only to find that you ca n't use it when you need it . whether you 're a weekend welder or a full time welder , auto-off is one of the best features you can have for a welding helmet . <h> Viewing Area Size <p> One of the most common improvements made on welding helmets is a larger viewing area .

The fourth number on the electrode is used to show the properties of the flux that is used on the electrode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stored in a dry location and in their original box . If welding electrodes are not properly stored they can absorb moisture on the flux which can cause bubbles to develop in the weld . These small bubbles that may develop can cause the weld to become porous and weak which can then lead to cracks and an overall defective weld . To avoid welding defects from occurring it is highly recommended that all welding electrodes be stored in a dry place . Welding experts also suggest that welding electrodes be used before they become too old . An old electrode can become coated with efflorescence which let 's you know that it is time to use that particular electrode . <p> If you keep a lot of electrodes in your work shop you may want to consider purchasing an electrode oven .

Welders can use a variety of methods to cut metal , including a saw , grinder , torch , or plasma cutter , but a plasma cutter provides an efficient way to make clean cuts , especially for thick metals . <p> However , using a plasma cutter effectively and safely requires a little bit of learning and practice . While its ideal to read the instructions for a plasma cutter before you begin using it , here are six tips to keep in mind in order to make the best cuts possible . <h> Take Precautions with a Plasma Cutter <p> While a plasma cutter offers the advantage of never using unstable cutting fuels such as acetylene , its not an entirely risk-free cutting process . Plasma cutters operate at a very high voltage and should never be handled without work gloves on . Beware touching your metal work piece without gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of electricity , watch out for water or flammable materials in nearby drums or containers . Be fully aware of the hazards present in your workplace . Also be aware that the dross from your cutting will fall to the floor and could catch fire if there 's a lot of sawdust below your cutting set up . <h> Cut with the Tip Near the Metal <p> While a thin metal can sometimes be cut at a low amperage with the plasma torch right on the metal , be sure that 's a safe and viable option for your cutting project . One welder compared these cuts on thin metal to dragging a pencil along a piece of paper . <p> Typically , plasma cutters work best with a 1/8 inch distance from the metal you plan to cut . Take some time to practice some dry runs with your torch to get a feel for maintaining that distance for a sustained period of time . The arc for the plasma cutter should be directed straight down before you begin cutting . <h> Adjust Your Cutting Speed <p> A plasma cutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot starts . Once the pilot engages , start moving your torch across the metal so that dross falls below , meaning that you 're cutting right through the metal cleanly without having to hold the torch in place for an extended period of time . You should be able to keep the torch moving slowly across the metal . <p> Too much amperage will distort the metal and leave a sloppy cut , but too little means you wont be able to maintain a steady travel speed either . <h> Piercing with a Plasma Cutter <p> Move the plasma cutter toward the metal at a slight angle when piercing roughly 60 degrees should work . As you move the torch down , rotate it to a 90 degree angle . This keeps the metal moving away from the torch . Moving straight down on the metal at a 90 degree angle from the start runs the risk of blowing melted metal right up into the torch . <p> You can often pierce metal that is up to one half of your machines cutting capacity . <h> Gouging with a Plasma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the torch straight down at a 90 degree angle . Rather , you should begin at a 40-45 degree angle over the metal and keep the arc length at 1-1 -+ inches as you move it across the metal . Gouging is a far more gradual process compared to piercing , so adjust your torch and arc length as you go , but do n't  be afraid of making multiple passes as you work . Gouging too deeply on your first pass could wreck your work piece . <h> Finishing Your Cut with a Plasma Cutter <p> By the time you reach the end of your cut , angle your torch slightly toward the final edge , taking care that you do n't  burn yourself . Or pause briefly at the end so that it severs the metal without distorting it . <p> The metal and the torch will be hot when you 're done working , so be careful that you do n't  touch the metal by the cut right away and that your torch has time to cool off .

Sometimes you 're rushing on a project during the weekend or a busy day in the shop can result in making a mistake that could damage the metal , ruin your weld , or lose a lot of time in having to clean up the finished weld . If you run your own welding business , you especially want to get the weld right the first time since the last thing you want to do is spend time regrinding a piece of metal or cleaning up a sloppy weld . <h> Take a Dry Run Along Your Weld <p> Many welders say that it helps them to take a dry run along the weld joint where they imagine their travel speed and technique . They often move the torch with the same exact motions , whether that 's cursive e 's , cursive u 's , or a forward and back movement . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to make sure you know exactly what to do , and a dry run is the best way to prepare . <h> Work on Your Hand and Body Positions <p> As you prepare with your dry run , also look at the torch angle and how you can position your hands and move your body as you work along the weld joint . This will be especially important if you 're working on an out of position weld joint . A good hand prop will give you the stability you need to make a clean , straight weld . <h> Ground Your Metal Properly <p> One of the easiest things a welder can overlook is proper grounding while working . You need a good bit of copper exposed to the metal you 're working on in order to get the highest quality ground . Without a sufficient ground , your welder may make a loud backfire sound and your weld quality will suffer . <h> Practice Your Technique for Better Weld Quality <p> While it 's important to get your metal nice and hot while welding , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you end up with a sloppy weld . However , you also do n't want to end up with a weak weld that does n't penetrate deep enough into the metal . This is where your technique is so important .

That 's especially the case when a spool of flux core MIG wire runs close to the same price as solid wire and does n't  require shielding gas . If you do n't  have to worry about the extra expense of gas , let alone transporting it , storing it , and setting it up with your MIG welder , why even bother with anything other than flux core MIG wire ? <h> Budget Time for Cleaning Up Flux Core Wire <p> The first reason why you may prefer gas-shielded solid core wire for MIG welding is the most obvious : You do n't  have to clean up the flux when you 're done welding .

However , welders with a bit of experience and a material chart can certainly adapt and figure out their own settings . <h> Flux Core Works Great on Rusted Metal <p> If cleaning up the welding work piece is a big concern , then flux core is a great option . Just as in stick welding , flux core MIG welding can handle some rust and impurities in the weld joint , as you can just scrape them away when you 're done welding . In addition , while solid wire MIG produces a clean weld , you may not be quite so worried about getting the perfect weld if you 're dealing with a rusted work piece . Functionality may mean more than appearance ! <h> Flux Core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repairmen , and welders without a dedicated welding shop will also benefit from flux core welding since it does n't  require shielding gas that can get blown about by the breeze . This versatility and portability is a great reason to at least pick up a few spools of flux core MIG wire to keep around just in case a project calls for a little outdoor welding . <h> Change the Polarity for Your Wire <p> When you 're MIG welding with a flux core MIG wire , you need to change your machines polarity settings to electrode negative in order to get a smooth , stable arc . Solid MIG wire calls for electrode positive polarity . <h> The Metal Type Determines What You Use <p> For a thin sheet metal project , flux core MIG wire is going to give you a lot of trouble and may create a messy weld that burns through the metal . You may do better with a solid core wire and shielding gas or just tacking the metal if the metal is thin . However , thicker metal could work great if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shielding Gas Is an Extra Expense <p> Depending on costs , you can expect to pay around $200 for a canister of shielding gas .

However , if you dial in too much power , you 'll distort the metal and waste materials . Saving yourself from redoing a weld is the most efficient way to save money in a welding shop , though even a weekend welder wo n't want to burn through a piece of metal that has to be replaced . <h> Inspect Your Hoses and Cables <p> While checking a power cable for cuts or tears is a commonsense way to prevent yourself from an electrical shock , you should also check your gas lines for leaks on a regular basis . A leaky gas line is not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shielding gas will lead to weld defects . <h> Maintain Your Equipment <p> Simple inspections of your equipment along with minor changes and adjustments can save you a lot of time . For example , MIG welders will want to check their wire feeders and the O-rings on their gas lines in order to make sure everything is tight , clean , and secure . Faulty connections or dirty lines could cause arc instability or increased spatter on your weld . <p> Frequently inspect your MIG gun nozzle and contact tip for signs of spatter build-up , which can obstruct shielding gas flow and cause weld defects that will need to be reworked . Spatter build-up can also cause your consumables to fail prematurely . Replace both consumables if spatter build-up appears or clean according to the manufacturers recommendation .

If the metal you are welding is not properly cleaned you can compromise the integrity of the welds . Properly cleaning the metal takes time but it is worth the effort to insure that your welds are of the best quality and integrity . Below are some steps to follow in order to properly clean the metal you will be welding . <p> The first thing you should do is to check the metal before you weld it . If there is any type of coating on the metal , which may be a thin layer of metal , you should remove it . To remove any coatings or metal that is on the surface you can either use a grinder or chemicals to thoroughly remove the coatings . <p> When preparing metal for welding it is also important that you remove any rust that may be on the surface . It is common to find rusty spots when dealing with car metal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can use a grinder or steel wool . <p> As you are preparing metal for welding you can try different techniques to find the one that works best for you . You can take this time to try straight or flat grinders to see how they work in removing coatings from the surface . If the metal you are preparing consists of different shapes or angles you should use an angled grinder . <p> If there are any bad welds on the metal you are preparing now is the time to remove them using a grinder . Removing a bad weld and creating a new one is often better than trying to repair a bad weld . Starting with a clean slate means that you can create a weld that will be strong . <p> You should use a grinder to clean the edges of the metal you will be joining . Having clean edges insures that the weld you create will be solid and strong . <p> Whenever you are preparing metal for welding you should always wear a pair of safety glasses to protect your eyes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye can be very dangerous and even cause permanent damage to your eye . <p> Once you have properly cleaned your welding material you are now ready to begin .

A simple torch , gas tank , regulator , and hose are all that you 'll need by way of equipment--not to mention a few smaller pieces such as a torch tip and flashback arrestor . In addition , fuels such as acetylene that burn quite hot can also be used for welding . <p> If you 're used to cutting with acetylene but you want to cut with an alternative fuel , you 'll need to invest in an alternative fuel cutting kit with new tips , torches , and hoses . At the very least you 'll need a replacement torch since the alternative fuels to acetylene form their heat cones differently and require specialized equipment in order to cut effectively . Here are some items you 'll need in order to cut with oxy-fuel . <h> Torch Cutting Supplies &amp; Accessories <p> An oxy-fuel setup requires a number of small accessories such as a torch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to strike a flame and to keep your torch tips clean for optimal cutting . <h> Cutting Torches <p> The cutting torch itself can make a tremendous difference in the effectiveness of your cutting . Acetylene torches differ from propane/propylene torches since they both require different fuel flows and concentrate their heat at different parts of the flame . If you 've ever heard a veteran acetylene user complain about ineffective alternative fuels , there 's a good chance he did n't change his torch or modify his style in order to cut more effectively . <p> Invest in the torch that best fits your cutting needs , but remember that alternative fuels are just as effective at cutting as acetylene . The main differences come with preheating times since acetylene burns hotter . The key advantages of alternative fuels include cheaper fuel supply costs and greater fuel stability . <h> Gas Regulators <p> Gas regulators are a critically important component of your cutting set up . Make sure you pick up a regulator that keeps your fuel lines clean with a filter , resists corrosion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas regulators will tell you how much fuel you 're using , and therefore , you 'll need a regulator that provides the most accuracy for your readings . It 's especially important to open your regulator valve very slowly before you begin cutting . If there is any pressure in the line along with a bit of dirt , the dirt could ignite and cause a dangerous burn out . <h> Torch Hoses &amp; Accessories <p> Taking care of your hoses will significantly contirbute to the safety of your cutting set up . An old hose with cracks in it can present significant safety hazards in your shop . In addition , an uncoiled hose can also become a tripping hazard . Make sure your hoses are in good repair and always stowed away in a safe location . <p> If you plan on working with alternative fuels , you 'll also want to invest in hoses that are specifically made for each fuel type .

You can save yourself a lot of time by investing in a torch cutting outfit that provides all of the equipment for your cutting set up . Instead of buying your equipment piecemeal , you can safely store it all in a specially designed carrying case . <h> Torch Safety Accessories <p> You ca n't be too careful when you 're using a cutting torch , as gases such as acetylene or propane can explode quite easily . The last thing you want to happen is for the flame on the tip of your torch to begin working its way up your torch , into your hose , or into your tanks with cutting fuels . In order to prevent a fatal flashback , you 'll need torch safety supplies such as flash back arrestors . <p> " With a flashback , the flame recesses into the back of the torch 's mixing chamber .

@@25166101 @5166101/ <h> Overview of Torch Cutting <p> The tip of your cutting torch is based on the flame characteristics of the fuel gas used , material cutting , and is where all the action takes place . Your intended use will determine the type of gas you will need as well as the tip used for torch cutting . Torch cutting tips come in two styles , one piece , and two-piece . <p> One-piece tips are made from copper alloy and are used with acetylene . They are machined with either 4 or 6 preheated holes and can handle light , medium , and heavy preheats . There are different 1-piece torch cutting tips that perform different functions from gouging out metal to cutting sheet metal and other specialty functions . One-piece tips use methyl acetylene propadiene ( MAPP ) , acetylene , and propylene . Two-piece tips require cooler and slower burning fuel gases such as natural gas , methane , and propane . <p> When shopping for tips , finding the right tip for a job can cause major confusion . The American Welding Society ( AWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2000 . In it they asked that all standard tips have the manufactures name stamped on them as well as the identifying fuel symbol , maximum material thickness , and part number for data and reference , however many manufactures still do not follow it due to the extra cost it would entail in the making of the tips . Make sure , when shopping for tips , you check the oxygen bore size , orifice size , and fuel gas required to run the tip . <p> There are three forms of gas used in torch cutting , methyl acetylene propadiene ( MAPP ) , liquid hydrocarbon ( propane ) , and acetylene . When these gases are mixed with oxygen the dangers and risks increase over that torches that use plain air and fuel .

Oxygen/fuel mixed gases burn much hotter then air/fuel mixes . One should never use concrete as there base to cut on . Concrete holds water . When the cutting torches heat makes contact , the heat will cause the water to expand and the concrete to explode . Take extra caution and time when cleaning the tips of cutting torches . Make sure the orifice is always free of any debris and smooth . Use protective welding gear at all times and welding screens . Make sure you are using the right size tip for the job and that the tip matches the fuel use . Always make sure your work area is free of any hazards , things you can trip on , etc and that your hoses are in a position that sparks do not land on them while working .

@@25166114 @5166114/ <h> Overview of Plasma Welding <p> Since its creation in 1957 , plasma arc welding has become one of the most reliable forms of welding in todays world . Plasma welding is a process where the electrode is inserted into a small nozzle which allows the gases being used to be separated . <p> Plasma welding is similar to gas tungsten arc welding , where the electric arc is made using an electrode and the piece you are welding . In plasma welding the plasma is forced through a fine-bore copper nozzle that makes the plasma come out at a far greater velocity and a much higher temperature than when you use gas tungsten arc welding . <p> Some of the main benefits of using the plasma arc welding method are the ability to make precision welds on thinner types of material with more accurate precision , thereby allowing welders the ability to make better use of their skills . <p> With the ability to stream their arc into harder to weld areas , this type of welding offers many new opportunities for welders . With the availability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manually , which allows the welder more room to observe and control the weld , or automatically , the production of very straight and thin welds is now possible . <p> Plasma arc welding can be used on all metals that are weldable with the gas tungsten method .

@@25166126 @5166126/ <h> Welding Supplies Checklist <p> We 've all had that experience at the hardware store where you walk in with a list for two things and you leave with ten . In a field like welding , there are lots of fantastic supplies and tools you can pick up to improve your welding shop and to help you accomplish a wide variety of projects . However , most of us have limited bank accounts , and we ca n't afford to buy one of everything . If you visit an online welding store for welding supplies , you may get overwhelmed by all of the products available . <p> This checklist for welding supplies will provide a simple reference guide as you pick up supplies for your welding shop : <h> General Welding Supplies <p> Angle Grinder : An essential tool for cleaning , cutting , and prepping metal , an angle grinder will save you a ton of time and make it possible to create cleaner , stronger welds in less time . If you 're learning how to weld , an angle grinder will be essential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every welder uses different tools for cutting metal , and a chop saw is just one tool among many to consider for your shop . A chop saw may save you a lot of time when you 're cutting thicker metals that an angle grinder ca n't handle , but if you have a plasma cutter or oxy-acetylene set up , you may not need one . <p> Chipping Hammer : Chipping hammers are especially important for stick welders who need to remove slag from their welds , but these hammers can also come in handy if you 're MIG welding with flux core wire . <p> Knot Brush : A knot brush is an effective way to do heavy duty cleaning on a large surface . If you have a lot of mill scale to remove from metal , you may want to consider using a knot brush . <p> Ground Clamps : A good grounding clamp will help you weld with a smoother arc and , most importantly , keep you safe from electric shock . <p> Sand Paper : Sometimes a fine sandpaper is ideal for cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having to get an angle grinder going . <p> Wire Brush : A wire brush is great for both prepping metal and for removing slag when you 're done welding . <p> Ventilation System : Depending on where you work and what you 're working with , you will generally need some kind of ventilation system . A lot of home welders work with the garage door open and a fan blowing . If you 're working in an indoor shop , you may need a ventilation system that will suck out any toxic fumes from the melting metal or from your cutting products . For example , a plasma cutter will create fumes that you do n't want to inhale . Some welders use respirators , but however you do it , just make sure you are n't breathing in harmful toxins that may be emitted while welding . <h> Stick Welding Supplies <p> Electrode Holder : Most stick welders come with an electrode holder , but if your welder does n't seem to be running smoothly , an electrode holder is one part of your set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oven : You mainly need an oven for the larger electrodes used on structural welds or welds that will absorb a lot of impact and pressure . Most hobby welders wo n't need one of these . <p> Stick Electrodes : Stick electrodes are extremely convenient because you only need to change your electrode in order to work on a wide variety of metals and weld joints . <h> MIG Welding Supplies <p> Solid MIG Wire : Solid MIG wire comes in a variety of thicknesses . The solid wire must be shielded with gas in order to prevent impurities . <p> Flux Core MIG Wire : There are two kinds of flux core MIG wire . One can be used without shielding gas , as the flux in the wire melts into the weld and rises to the top in order to shield it . The other flux core wire is sued with shielding gas and provides an extra layer of protection . When used with shielding gas , flux core MIG wire chips off very easily and should generally create a relatively clean weld because of the shielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're welding , shielding gas can be a mixture of CO2 and Argon or straight Argon . You 'll need to purchase cannisters of gas and a cart or rack that will safely store them . <p> Spool Gun : A spook gun is generally only used for feeding the lighter , thinner wire used for MIG welding aluminum , since the wire can easily jam in the gun without the spool gun attachment that feeds the wire right into the torch as you weld . <p> Torch : Also called a " MIG gun , " a torch generally comes with a welder , but you can upgrade and purchase a different torch if your current one starts to wear out or fails to feed wire smoothly . <p> MIG Gun Liner : This liner inside of a MIG gun is what the wire in runs through , and it will need to be replaced periodically . <p> Tips and Consumables : The tips of your MIG gun will wear out , so plan on having a few around so that you 're never stuck while working on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't an all-in-one unit , you 'll need a wire feeder in order to create a smooth and steady flow of wire into the weld puddle . <h> TIG Welding Supplies <p> Acetone : You 'll hear about welders using all kinds of cleaners in order to prep their metal for TIG welding , but acetone is consistently mentioned as the most effective way to clean metal after sanding or grinding it . <p> Filler Metal : In TIG welding you 'll need to pick up filler metal that is separate from your tungsten electrode that provides the arc . <p> Foot Pedal : Most TIG welders , like the one we link to here , come with a foot pedal that allows you to control the amount of heat you add to your TIG weld . However , there are many specialized pedals available if you 'd like to take your TIG welding set up to the next level . <p> Grinding Wheel : You 'll use a grinding wheel in order to sharpen your electrode for TIG welding . This is both the fastest and most effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Respirator : If you 're grinding down a thoriated electrode that has some radioactive elements in it , make sure you wear a respirator in order to protect yourself from the radioactive dust .. <p> Thin TIG Gloves : Usually goat skin gloves are the best option for protecting your hands during TIG welding while also providing the flexibility you need to effectively feed your metal into the weld puddle . <p> TIG Accessories : If you have a water cooled TIG torch or need a kit with a TIG cup and other torch parts , you may want to pick up a TIG accessory kit . <p> TIG Gas Line Covers : Gas line covers are an important safety and money-saving measure that will guard your lines from anything that could puncture them and cause a safety hazard or at least drain the gas in your tanks . <p> TIG Finger : If you need an extra heat shield on your fingers while welding , you can add a TIG finger , which is a piece of heat resistant fabric you can slide on whichever finger is closest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger along the workpiece while you 're welding . <p> TIG Cup : A TIG cup is a ceramic piece added to the end of the torch that is often used to provide stability for out of position welds . <p> TIG Torches : If you want to upgrade your torch , you have plenty of options . <p> Tungsten Electrode : There are five different kinds of electrodes used for TIG welding that provide different capabilities for welding projects . Most welders use ceriated and lanthanated electrodes , but pure tungsten and thoriated ( note : thoriated has some radioactive elements in it ) are also popular . <p> Water Cooler for TIG : This system is n't something you take with you on a picnic . This is a unit that you add to your TIG welding set up and use with a water-cooled torch in order to keep your torch cool . This is especially important if you want to TIG weld for any significant amount of time or if you 're on the higher end of amperage. 
@@25166127 @5166127/ <h> Different Types of Welding Rods <p> Welding rods are necessary in the welding process to add filler metal to the area being welding . In some arc welding methods the welding rod is also used as the electrode . The welding rod is typically made of the same material that the base metals are made of and a flux is often used to help with the welding process being used . Welding rods are typically held by an electrode holder that is used to insulate the welder from the electric current created from the welding process . In the area of automated welding , a thin continuous wire is used as a welding rod . <p> In many arc welding processes the welding rod used also acts as the electrode used to guide the arc to the weld area . The American Welding Society uses an E prefix to label welding rods that can also be used as an electrode in arc welding . If you are using an arc welding technique that does not require the use of a shielding gas , it is suggested that welding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coating will vaporize when exposed to high heat and create a gas that acts as a shield and keeps the air and other contaminants away from the weld area which helps the welder create a clean weld . <p> Steel welding rods are the most common welding rod used by welders today due to the fact that most material that is welded is steel . Because of this welding rods come in a variety of different steel alloys to meet the needs of any welding process being performed . The most common types of steel welding rods are mild steel , low alloy steel and stainless steel . Depending on the type of work being performed steel welding rods are available with or without a flux coating . <p> Aluminum welding rods are used for welds that are performed to join pieces of aluminum and can also be used to join aluminum alloys that are dissimilar in nature . Aluminum welding rods can be used with standard arc welding equipment , MIG welding equipment and also in TIG welding techniques . <p> Bronze welding rods are most commonly used when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copper to other metals and in the repair of bronze pieces that may have been damaged . The technique of brazing uses bronze welding rods because of their high resistance to salt water corrosion . <p> Composite welding rods have become more popular due to the advances in welding technology . Composite welding rods consist of two or more layers of material that when combined results in a stronger and higher quality weld . Flux core welding rods have the flux placed in the center of the welding rod which allows the flux material to be used in a manner that was n't possible when the flux was on the outer layer of the welding rod . This process also prevents the flux from wearing off by handling or storage as is common in welding rods where the flux is located on the outside . Metal cored welding rods have a mild steel outer layer and are filled with a customized mix of metal powders that can exactly match the alloy needed to perform a high quality weld . <p> When welding it is important to properly match your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will help ensure that your welds are strong and clean . If at any time you are not sure which type of rod to use in a certain technique , you should consult a colleague or read your manual which usually contains a list of acceptable welding rods that should be used and with which type of metal they are most compatible with .

@@25166131 @5166131/ <h> Brazing Techniques <p> Brazing is a popular form of welding . It is an excellent way to join two metals . Fillers are brought to high temperatures +G usually above 800 degrees Fahrenheit +G and join workpieces together by flowing into the spaces between them and cooling . A flux is often used to protect atmosphere around the work area . There are many techniques for brazing that a welder can choose from . <p> Torch Brazing <p> Torch brazing is the most common form of mechanized brazing . In some countries it is the method used for the majority of the brazing that is done . Specialized operations or small production volumes are often where this method is used . The three categories of torch brazing are machine , manual , and automatic . <p> Manual torch brazing has heat applied with a gas flame near or on the joint . It can be a hand held torch or held in a fixed position , depending on the method . Usually it is used where other methods are impossible or for small production volumes . Flux is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is repetitive . It is a mix of manual and automated methods and uses flux , reduces the cost and works for small to medium production projects . Automatic torch brazing has a high production rate , reduced costs , and a uniform braze quality . A worker is needed just for unloading and loading the machine . <p> Furnace Brazing <p> This method is semi-automatic and is used in industrial operations . It can produce large numbers of small parts , has a controlled heat cycle , and post braze cleaning is not needed . To prevent oxidation , inert , vacuum , or reducing atmospheres are used . It is cost efficient to run but uses a lot of power compared to other methods , is more difficult to design , and the equipment is expensive . The kinds of furnaces used are batch type , vacuum , retort with controlled atmosphere , and continuous . <p> Batch type furnaces have relatively low costs and heat each load separately . It can be turned on and off easily , has a large degree of flexibility , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled atmosphere can be used . Vacuum furnaces are fairly economical , work well with such oxides as aluminum or titanium , and is often used with refractory materials or alloys that ca n't be brazed in atmosphere furnaces . It is vital to clean because there is no protective atmosphere . Continuous type furnaces work by making a steady flow of parts go through the furnace on a conveyor . These are good for large productions . Retort-type furnaces have a sealed lining where the atmosphere can be completely changed inside and is best for semi-continuous or batch productions and alloys that resist oxidation . <p> Silver Brazing <p> This method uses silver alloy based filler for brazing . It is also known as hard soldering or silver soldering . The silver alloys have a lot of variety and different percentages of silver and other metals in them , such as cadmium , zinc , and copper . A special method of silver brazing is pin brazing ( pinbrazing ) . It is used especially for cathodic protection installations or for connecting cables to railway track . It can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fasten hardmetal ( like carbide ) to such tools as saw blades . <p> Braze Welding <p> This method uses a brass or bronze filler rod that is coated with flux in order to join steel workpieces . It requires more heat than basic brazing and acetylene or **26;262;TOOLONG ( MPS ) gas fuel is often used . The name comes from the fact that this method does not have capillary action . Dissimilar metals are able to be joined with this method , there is a reduced need for pre-heating , and minimal heat distortion . However , there is a loss of strength when the work is under high temperatures and it can not withstand high stress . <p> Cast Iron " Welding " <p> Welding cast iron is actually a type of brazing . Filler rods that are mainly nickel are used but there are cast iron rods available . Cast iron is a difficult metal to work with and many find the skill extremely difficult to learn . It is used often in repairs . <p> Vacuum Brazing <p> In this technique the brazing process is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as flux-free joints that are very strong and have high integrity , are superior to other joins and are extremely clean . It can be an expensive process . Residual stresses are greatly reduced because of the slow heating and cooling cycles in this process . The materials thermal and mechanical properties are improved and things such as heat treating or age hardening can be done during the metal joining process . The process is done in a furnace and heat is transferred with radiation . <p> Dip Brazing <p> This particular technique is very suited for brazing aluminum because there is no air and therefore no oxidation . The brazing compound is usually applied in slurry form and the assembly dropped into a molten salt bath that will work as both a flux and heat transfer .

Though accidents can happen with a plasma cutter , it 's generally accepted that plasma cutters are safer to use than an oxy-fuel cutting system , especially set-ups that use acetylene . The main drawback of a plasma cutter is its high price tag when compared to a simple oxy-fuel torch . <p> Plasma cutters are significant investments for home metal workers and welding businesses , and therefore a simple guide to purchasing a plasma cutter will help demystify the process and ensure that you invest in the best unit for the money and for your projects . <h> What Kind of Metal Are You Cutting ? <p> Plasma cutters are popular because of their versatility . A plasma cutter is capable of cutting steel , aluminum , copper , and stainless steel , but you 'll need to make sure you purchase a unit that is powerful enough to handle your project if the metal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will enable you to cut thicker and longer pieces of metal . <h> Cut Rating for a Plasma Cutter <p> The cut rate will tell you how fast a plasma cutter can cut metals of varying thickness . There are three classifications used in the industry according to Miller Electric : <p> Rated Cut : The thickness of mild metal that an operator can manually cut at a rate of 10 inches per minute ( IPM ) . <p> Quality Cut : Rated at a slower speed but on thicker metal . <p> Sever Cut : the maximum thickness a plasma cutter can handle . The travel speed is slower and the cut may require clean up . <h> Voltage for a Plasma Cutter <p> Plasma cutters operate at three different voltages , with some operating at the lower power of 115V , others offering the higher power of 230V , and many others providing the option to switch between 115V and 230V depending on which plug you use . <p> One critically important feature that you 'll want to consider is Line Voltage Compensation . This is how your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature can adapt to changes in the power supply , maintaining a steady arc and travel speed . If you plan on working overseas or with an engine drive 's auxiliary power , this feature will prevent blown circuit boards . <h> Cutting Speed for Plasma Cutters <p> Larger plasma cutting units will be able to crank up more power and cut faster , while smaller units will have a much slower cutting speed . The frequency of your cutting will determine whether you purchase a larger and faster unit or a smaller unit with less power and speed . <h> Pilot Arc vs . High Frequency Plasma Cutters <p> Both pilot arc and high frequency plasma cutters are reliable options , but pilot arc makes it easier to strike an arc and can extend the life of consumables . High frequency cutters will be cheaper and produce a more stable arc , but they need to start close to the metal with a scratch start . This will reduce the life of the consumable . Another difference is that high frequency cutters may interfere with computers and appliances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shielded from interferences from high frequency machines , and therefore this may not prove to be a factor in some cases . <h> Air for a Plasma Cutter <p> In order to run a plasma cutter you 'll need to supply an inert gas . The most common gas used is typically compressed air , though some operators add dry air to the mix in order remove moisture from the lines so that the plasma cutter operates better . <p> The compressed air may be supplied from a compressor or bottle . In order to choose the right air supply , you 'll need to know the CFM of the compressor or bottle so that you can match it up with the air levels and PSI your plasma cutter requires . <h> Portability of a Plasma Cutter <p> A typical plasma cutter can weigh anywhere from 60 to 100 lbs .

Broken welds need to be reground and they use up resources such as filler metal and shielding gas . In addition , every time you need to grind and re-weld a broken weld , you lose valuable time . Diagnosing a broken weld is an important part of running an effective welding business and ensuring you can effectively complete safe welding projects at home . <h> The Wrong Filler Metal Will Break a Weld <p> Before you begin welding , make sure you know what kind of metal you 're welding . If you 're not sure , consider having a few different kinds of filler metal on hand just in case . Sometimes it may help to run your work piece to the local metal shop or someone with more experience to find out if you 're matching up your filler metal correctly . <h> Too Much Grinding Will Break a Weld <p> Depending on the application for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grind your weld joint in order to smooth off the weld . This will prevent you from accidentally grinding away too much of the weld in the process . However , if you need to grind your weld down , you 'll need to make sure you achieve proper penetration for the weld joint . <h> Break a Weld Without Proper Penetration <p> One of the ways you can ensure that you create a deep and strong weld is to bevel the weld joint so that you can easily lay a stringer right into the weld joint .

Blacksmithing creates little waste . Other than when trimming , even punching and cutting processes rearrange material , rather than remove it entirely . To accommodate odd-sizes , shapes , or make repetitive work repeatable and consistent , blacksmiths will employ additional tools . <p> The forging or sculpting process can be broken down into five techniques : <p> Drawing lengthens the metal . When the depth is reduced and the width narrowed the piece grows in length . A smith can draw a taper to make a wedge or chisel shape . Tapering can be done to achieve a point . Drawing is commonly done by hammering on the anvil horn and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer .

In resistance welding , however , the current is delivered through contacts to the work piece , instead of induction . The welding form that uses an induction coil energized with a radio-frequency electric current and electromagnetic induction to heat the work piece is what is referred to as induction welding . In most instances both an electrically conductive and ferromagnetic work piece will be acted upon by an electromagnetic field ( EMF ) . Eddy currents are used and resistive heating takes place . In ferromagnetic induction welding hysteresis heating occurs . The EMF distorts the magnetic domains of the ferromagnetic material . Susceptors , metallic or ferromagnetic compounds , can be introduced to nonmagnetic materials and electrical insulators so that plastic can be induction welded . Suscpetors absorb electromagnetic energy from the induction coil , heat up , and thermal conduction disperses heat to the surrounding material . <p> Induction welding is usually carried out in highly automated long production runs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be welded by inducing a current in a tube along the open seam . The edges are heated to a temp high enough for welding . Then the seam edges are forced together . The induction welding process can be done quickly ; a lot of power can be localized so the faying surfaces melt quickly and can form a continuous rolling weld when pressed together . Temperature and metal composition will affect penetration depth . The depth the heating penetrates the surface is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency . <h> Induction Heating <p> Electromagnetic induction heats an electrically conductive object ( metal ) . Eddy currents are generated within the metal . Resistance leads to Joule heating ( resistive heating ) . An induction heater consists of an electromagnet . A high frequency alternating current ( AC ) is passed through the magnet . Heat may also be a result of a magnetic hysteresis . AC frequency is dependent on object size , material type , penetration depth , and coupling between work coil and work piece . <p> Induction heating may be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Induction heating has been used to heat molten metals and gaseous conductors .

Magnetic hysteresis can occur in any magnetic material . <p> How does induction heating work ? A furnace heats metal such as iron , steel , copper , aluminum , or precious metals to the melting point . Most furnaces consist of water-cooled copper rings .

It does n't matter if it 's a gas engine driven one or a electric arc machine . For most Stick applications , you will want to use DC welding because it has many advantages over AC . Some of the advantages are fewer arc outages or sticking , easier starts , less spatter , easier overhead and vertical welding , welds that look better , easier learning , and smoother arcs . If you choose DC straight polarity thinner metals can be welded better while the DC reverse polarity will give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its advantages . For example , you may need to weld material that has become magnetized from friction . This can happen when hay , water , or feed rubs against a steel part continuously . If you use DC output , it wo n't work . The magnetic field causes " arc blow " which is where the molten filler metal is blown out of the weld puddle . AC output will allow you to weld things that have become magnetized because it alternates polarities . <p> You might be surprised at the size of machine that you actually need . The average person will never encounter Stick welding jobs that need a lot of amperage , as most jobs need 200 amps or less . This means that a machine that is 225 to 300 amps will be more than adequate for the average welder .

@@25166190 @5166190/ <h> Guide to Orbital Welding <p> Orbital welding is a very specialized area of welding . It is a type of arc welding where the arc is rotated by machine around a static workpiece " such as a pipe " a full 360 degrees . It is an automated process and can be very useful . Pipes that are as large as several centimeters around or even as small as just a few millimeters can all be welded this way . It is a process that was developed over fifty years ago . <p> There are several main components that make up an orbital welding system . These components are the controller and power source , welding head , and in some cases a wire feed mechanism . There are many factors that have an influence on the results of the welding . Some of the most significant parameters are the magnitude , arc length , and the welding current 's pulse frequency , the parent material and filler material , welding speed , weld preparation , inert shielding gas , thermal conductivity , and weld preparation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed knowledge about how to adjust all of these individual parameters precisely enough for every welding task . <p> Manual welding is very tricky because in order to meet the highest standards of safety and quality a perfect balance has to be found between surface tension and gravitational force in each position that the torch is in . But when the system has mechanized components , certain parts of the process are handled by components that are mechanical while a welder controls and monitors the entire process . While it would be perfect for all the welding parameters to already be programmed in before welding ever begins , the reality is that a welder has to often make corrections throughout the process . If the entire process is automated , a computer controls the welding process and there is no need for the operator to intervene at all . <p> Orbital welding is carried out using Tungsten Inert Gas ( TIG ) techniques . It uses non-consumable electrodes and when necessary , a cold-wire feed . There are many kinds of metal that can be welded : copper , titanium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , corrosion resistant and high temperature steels , low alloyed and unalloyed carbon steels , and nickel alloys . Because the process is carried out in an atmosphere that is inert , results that are produced are extremely clean , with no unwanted spatter and having low particle counts . <p> The tiniest diameters of just 1.6 millimeters can be welded using orbital welding . Pipes that are up to 170 millimeters with 3.5 millimeter thick walls can also be welded using weld heads that are closed chamber . Closed chamber weld heads let the pipe be held securely and the torch positioned precisely . Even the most sensitive materials will not have tinting from heat thanks to the inert atmosphere . If tubes are in diameters that are between 8 and 275 millimeters , open welding heads that are more easily manageable can be used . Flexible hoses supply power , cooling water , inert gas , and filler wire to the welding head when it is required . Whether or not filler wire is needed depends entirely on the task . For example , thin-walled tubes need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be carefully prepared and the work pieces must have no scale or impurities . <p> Orbital welding is used in the semiconductor industry in the clean rooms . It 's use has also expanded to the building of equipment and pipework for industries such as pharmaceuticals , food processing , chemical engineering , automotive engineering , shipbuilding , biotech , and aerospace . It 's even used in thermal power plants . There are many openings for this type of welding to be used and there is a need for welders who can program the systems .

@@25166193 @5166193/ <h> MIG Welding Applications <p> As a replacement for the archaic stick welding method , MIG welding is without a doubt one of the most efficient welding forms in the industry , and it happens to be an acronym for Metal Inert Gas . The arc is struck between the tip of the wire as it emerges from the torch , and during this process a shielding gas will be emitted in the interest of preventing oxidation . Most MIG welding sets provide a setting that permits the wire speed to match the voltage , and one of the biggest benefits is the ease of use . <p> The most common application of MIG welding is automotive repair , and such repairs can be carried out on a number of different vehicles whether they be large , small , light , or heavy . One clear and widely noted benefit is the fact that the MIG welding process is more than capable of proving a strong weld even down to 0.5mm . This provides a level of strength and versatility previously unseen and unheard of in the automotive industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities . <p> In addition to providing a superior welding experience it has been noted that the most expensive of the MIG welding components is actually the welding unit itself , which opens up an entirely new possibility . On assembly lines MIG welding can be easily incorporated into robotics , which certainly speeds up the process . <p> In the event you need to weld pipe joints , there are companies that create MIG welding apparatuses particularly the creation of pipe welds . You will certainly want to look into this with the understanding that it is more economical to use a track based robotic welding system than it is to actually man the assembly line . <p> MIG welding can be used to institute hard facing , or it can even be used to reinforce the surface of a worn out railroad track .
