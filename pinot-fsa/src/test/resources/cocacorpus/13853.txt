In an interview with Collider Fassbender hinted that he would be quite different saying , " Walter is very much a synthetic minus any of the human traits " .

@@95850538 @50538/ <p> Amidst the onslaught of superhero epics and roaring monster movies arriving this year , Christopher Nolan 's Dunkirkis poised to be very different . <p> With its feet firmly planted on the ground and in fact , the Inception and Interstellardirector carves out exciting new territory in this sure-to-be-gripping dramatisation of the World War II Dunkirk evacuation known as Operation Dynamo . <p> However if you were expecting a conventional war movie then think again after all , this is Nolan we 're talking about , a director famous for putting his narratives through the blender . Let 's find out what he 's been saying about the movie and why , narratively , it 's of a piece with his earlier , time-twisting masterpieces . <h> What 's the movie about ? <p> The movie takes as its basis the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the eponymous French town in May and June 1940 , a pivotal moment in World War II history and one that ultimately helped to determine the Allied victory . <p> Shot using a combination of 65mm film stock and IMAX 65mm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the darkest hours in the conflict , a powerful statement about the nobility and endurance of the human spirit . Featuring an all-star cast of British thesps including Tom Hardy , Cillian Murphy , Kenneth Branagh , Mark Rylance and , erm , Harry Styles , it 's set to be unmissable cinema in the director 's usual style . <p> The director has confirmed that the story will play out from three different perspectives , playing around with both our sympathies and perceptions of time as the fraught and harrowing evacuation unfolds . On land , characters played by the aforementioned Styles and Fionn Whitehead will act as our guide . In the air , Hardy 's pilot carries us through . And on the sea , Murphy is the main focus . <p> " For the soldiers embarked in the conflict , the events took place on different temporalities , " Nolan explains to French magazine Premiere . " On land , some stayed one week stuck on the beach . On the water , the events lasted a maximum day ; and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour of fuel . To mingle these different versions of history , one had to mix the temporal strata . Hence the complicated structure ; Even if the story , once again , is very simple . " <h> So why should we be excited ? <p> As Nolan 's words make clear this is n't just a sweeping presentation of a wider conflict but rather a nuanced portrayal that presents us with three different interpretations , all of which take us up close and personal to those involved . <p> The time-shifting structure also ensures there is continuity with the majority of Nolan 's back catalogue , all of which have gripped and surprised audiences by playing around with the fabric of cinema . <p> His breakout Memento simultaneously played events in a complex backwards/forwards structure , tieing us into central character Guy Pearce 's struggle with short term memory loss . The Prestige was a glorious puzzle box movie , a story-within-story thriller about warring magicians that brilliantly used unreliable perspectives to wrong-foot us . <p> And his grandiose epics Inception and Interstellar acted as visually extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it 's the former 's eventual slide into limbo or the latter 's revelation about how the past , present and future can all co-exist at once . Even his blockbusting Dark Knight trilogy hinged on the potent use of flashbacks to fill us in on the tortured anguish of Bruce Wayne and other key characters . <p> In short , Nolan 's unconventional presentation of relatively straightforward narratives has earmarked him as one of the most singular directors of the last twenty years . Given Dunkirk is his first excursion into the realm of the fact-based war movie , indications are he 'll shake up that genre in similar style need we say more about why we 're anticipating this one ? <h> When 's it out ? <p> Dunkirkis released on 21st July in both 2D and IMAX .

No wonder the character has suffered so much abuse and mockery .

Theres Superman , Hulk , Thing and Thor just to name a few . Sure , its great seeing them lift trucks and uproot trees at first , but it gets old quickly . <p> While Aquaman clearly possesses superhuman strength too , as seen in the trailer when he lifts the not-too-shabby Bruce Wayne ( Ben Affleck ) , he has many more unique powers in his arsenal .

Of course not , its his legendary hammer , Mjolnir . There 's something about a magic weapon that makes combat instantly more satisfying , and it looks like Aquamans trident will be no different . <p> The trident has already been pictured with the aquatic superhero ( see the Momoa behind the scenes pic below ) , so we know for sure it will be present in Justice League .

The changing fate of Vin Diesel 's #Furious hero <p> We have now reached the eighth instalment in the blockbustingly insane Fast &amp; Furious franchise , not bad for one that started off as a relatively humble street-racing series . <p> Since being reinvigorated with the addition of Dwayne Johnson in Fast 5 , each new film has been bigger and better .

Dom has always been a man who will do anything and everything for the one he loves , but what exactly does Cipher have that would make him betray his beloved family ? Apart from looking like Charlize Theron , of course . <p> Perhaps hard-nut Dom has simply fallen in love with her . If Dom is now in love with a cyber-terrorist , then this could be the end of the character we thought we knew , with Dom and Cipher becoming the ultimate criminal couple . Or maybe there 's more to this ' romance ' than meets the eye ... <h> 4 . Dom has been brainwashed <p> Cipher is described as a being the very definition of ' high-tech terrorism ' .

A quick brain implant here , a touch of hypnotic suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up cars and family members in the name of your terrorist agenda . <p> Advanced brainwashing technology seems a little far-fetched , but crazier things have happened in this world of skyscraper-leaping cars . If this is the case , watching the gang race against time to save Dom before he unwillingly hurts himself could make Fate of the Furious the best in the series . <h> 3 . Dom has been threatened <p> At this point , Dom and the gang are neck deep in shady activity far beyond the street racing that began the Fast &amp; Furious saga . Living such a life inevitably brings with it powerful enemies . Enemies able to threaten everything you hold dear including your family . <p> Its entirely possible that Cipher is holding something over Doms shiny head , whether it be a threat to his loved ones or perhaps a blackmailing scheme , forcing him to do her bidding .

Dom misses Brian <p> The tragic death of Paul Walker meant that the franchise had to send Brian OConnor touchingly off into the sunset . Now taking care of his wife and child away from all the explosive antics , perhaps Brian was the anchor keeping Dom on the semi-straight and narrow all along ? <p> The trailer gives us a glimpse of someone , potentially Dom , looking at a picture of his family with Brian taking centre stage . The ex-cop 's innate sense of right and wrong could well have rubbed off on Dom over the years , and now that he s left the gang perhaps this sense of morality has left with him . There was bound to be an after-effect with Brian leaving , and an evil Toretto could be it . <h> 1 . Dom is pretending <p> The most likely outcome is that crafty ol Dom is faking it .

The Mechanic <p> Often in action cinema , its all about the superstar pairing .

Indie Jake <p> Jake Gyllenhaal is an A-list actor who can command millions per movie , but he s still someone who is very much in touch with his independent roots , lending some powerful star wattage to films that might have otherwise struggled to find an audience . From the haunting and nocturnal Nightcrawler to the strange , elliptical Enemy to the Jack Kerouac-inspired road trip drama Highway , it appears that keeping one foot in the indie world is still important to Jake . <h> 4 . The courageous A-lister <p> Not many A-listers of Jakes standing would have had the courage to sign up for a movie about a homosexual love affair . Ang Lees groundbreaking drama Brokeback Mountain ended up winning three Academy Awards , with Jake and co-star Heath Ledger scooping a Best Kiss gong at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards . <h> 5 .

Sci-fi Jake <p> Jakes certainly enjoyed his share of science fiction classics . Our favourite has to be the brilliant Source Code , Duncan Jones complex thriller which has Jake as a U.S. Army captain who is sent into a computed reality to find a terrorist bomber . <p> We also love Enemy , Denis ( Arrival ) Villeneuves haunting sci-fi drama that stars Jake in TWO roles ! And now he s returned to the genre with Life , where he plays a scientist onboard the International Space Station who discovers a rapidly evolving life form that threatens the crew and all life on Earth . <h> 7 . The Method Man <p> You ca n't doubt Jake Gyllenhaals commitment to his craft . Just look at the transformations he made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing 30lb for his role as the sleep-deprived crime journalist in Nightcrawler , and then , immediately afterwards , had six months to gain 30lb of muscle for boxing movie Southpaw .

Grant ) . Having absorbed multiple fatal wounds , Logan is slowly dying as his healing serum begins to wear off . <p> Rice is also behind the tests carried out on young Wolverine clone Laura/X-23 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of whom have been discovered by Logan at the mythical ' Eden ' , a place our hero previously dismissed as fiction lurking within Laura 's favourite X-Men comics . <p> Having spent the majority of the movie attempting to hunt Laura and her fellow child mutants down , Rice is ultimately shot dead by Logan and X-24 is himself killed by an adamantium bullet fired by Laura . It then culminates in Logan 's tender , poignant farewell to his daughter , after which he dies having been impaled on a tree stump . Laura and her fellow mutants then trek off towards the Canadian border and an unknown future . We 're not crying honest ... <h> Rice 's connection to Logan <p> One of the most intriguing dialogue exchanges comes when the sneering geneticist reveals to Logan that the latter killed his father when escaping from Alkali lake following the fateful adamantium skeleton graft . <p> The birth of Wolverine himself is one that has echoed throughout both the X-Men and solo Wolverine movies , but this adds an unexpectedly personal dimension to the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial moment from Rice 's tragic perspective , allowing us to perceive the danger posed by Wolverine in fresh and exciting new ways , and to better understand Rice 's rise into an all-powerful , vengeful bad guy . <h> The destruction of all mutants <p> Even more shockingly , Rice explains that he is the one behind the mutant obliteration , having developed a Transigen virus that was designed to wipe out the majority whilst their scientists developed weaponised test subjects of their own ( of which X-24 is one ) . <p> The exact setting of Logan as a movie is uncertain , the events that occurred between this movie and the earlier X-Men films alluded to but never explicitly spelled out . Perhaps in future we 'll get another movie filling in the gaps , one that dramatises the terrible collapse of mutant-kind and which further contextualises the bleak sense of despair felt by the characters in Logan . <h> A new beginning ? <p> Tragic as it is to say goodbye to Jackman 's signature character ( has it really been 17 years ? ) there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to hopefully begin a new life . <p> We 've already become well acquainted with Laura , courtesy of Keen 's terrific and charismatic performance , and she is surely due for her own spin-off movie .

We get a little sampling of their awesome powers when they band together to take down Rice 's drawling cyborg lackey Donald Pierce ( Boyd Holbrook ) , so there is surely potential to take the X-Men franchise in a bold new direction with a fresh cast of young faces . <p> After all , we could then be faced with the intriguing prospect of a group of new X-Men growing up on-screen , and this would also tie in with the ongoing strategy to introduce young blood into the series .

Let 's find out . <h> He 's simply an awesome actor <p> Having won an Emmy award for his supporting role in the television show Cheers , and been nominated for a Golden Globe Award on four separate occasions there 's no doubting Harrelsons talent . His role as Martin Hart in True Detective alongside Matthew McConaughey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed many disgraceful acts , yet was still able to get the audience to sympathise with him . <p> While Harrelson is usually a supporting actor , its great to see him cast as the main antagonist for War for the Planet of the Apes .

Take the likes of Bruce Willis and Vin Diesel for example , or when Bryan Cranston shaved it all off to become Heisenberg in Breaking Bad . Woody Harrelson is another actor that fits the bald tough guy stereotype .

Saying that , we wonder what Cera would look like if he were bald <h> He 's human <p> This one might sound pretty obvious at first , but hear us out . What we mean to say is that Woody wont be hiding behind CGI as another hairy ape . That 's no disrespect to the likes of Andy Serkis ( Caesar ) and Toby Kebbell ( Koba ) , who do fantastic work with motion capture technology , but for War for the Planet of the Apes we want a human antagonist as the war between ape and mankind reaches its climax . <p> Harrelson knows how to dominate the screen , even without speaking .

Its not as if we ever saw Darth Vader or Voldemort sobbing their eyes out . However , a villain that can show a range of emotions instantly becomes a more rounded and interesting character . And Woody has demonstrated his emotional side before , even to comic extremes in the likes of the brilliant Zombieland . <p> Harrelson 's character is fighting to save humanity , so he is n't necessarily evil per se . A small part of us will be wanting him to succeed , as we 're human , after all .

Which is to say that the upcoming epic War for the Planet of the Apes , the conclusion to the highly-praised Planet of the Apes trilogy , will be coming to Cineworld on 14th July 2017 . <p> We know that 's still a long wait before we get to see a planet of apes on the big-screen but watching apes in the cinema is n't the only place you can see apes . With the jaw-dropping Planet Earth II having just come to an end , we at Cineworld got inspired to find out more about the various species of apes that appear in the Apes trilogy . Here , we will be showing you the real-life Planet of the Apes ... <h> Bonobo ( Pan Paniscus ) <p> In the movies : Koba <p> In reality : Also known as pygmy chimpanzees , you might recognise this species better as Koba , the human-hating ape who is the main reason why apes and humans are going to war in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees at the heart of the Democratic Republic of Congos rainforests in central Africa . They live together in hierarchal groups with an alpha male in charge of the females and the females are the ones left to raise the children . Bonobos are highly intelligent and able to use tools but unfortunately these amazing apes are endangered as of 2008 . <h> Orangutans ( Pongo ) <p> In the movies : Maurice <p> In reality : Orangutans which literally translates as " people of the forest " are the largest tree-dwelling apes on the planet . There are two species of Orangutans : the Bornean who live on the island of Borneo and Sumatran who can be found on the Indonesian island of Samatra . <p> Both species nest high in the canopies of the tropical rainforests and live off a large diet of fruit . The might look fat but its only the males that have the baggy pouches on their chins and cheeks . <p> You might have guessed by their appearance that their small legs are relatively weak compared to their huge arms which can span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arms for brute strength alone . <p> Orangutans are highly intelligent and teach their young how to use sticks as tools to fish for insects no surprise that in the Apes franchise Maurice is seen as the teacher within the ape community . Like bonobos , Orangutans are also now endangered in the wild the Sumatran species is the worst affected . <h> Gorilla <p> In the movies : Buck ( Caesar 's bodyguard ) <p> In reality : They might look fearsome with their immense size but gorillas are genuinely passive creatures they 're certainly less aggressive than chimps . There are two main species of Gorilla in the world : the eastern , and western gorilla , each with their own subspecies . <p> Gorillas live in the rainforests of central Africa . And you 've probably already deduced by now that the eastern gorillas live in eastern central Africa and the western gorillas live in western central Africa .

Adult gorillas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadly , due to disease afflicting the gorilla population , almost a third of gorillas were wiped out between 1992-2007 .

They share a staggering 98% of our genes so they inevitably look like us ( or do we look like them ? ) and share our complex social behaviours . They are also the only other known species that wage war amongst their own kind . <p> Chimpanzees can be found across central Africa living in groups within dense rainforests and tropical grasslands living on diets of mostly plants and insects . Chimps are also known to hunt in packs for larger animals such as colobus monkeys and you probably thought the hunting scene at the beginning of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was completely fictional ! <p> Chimps are extremely intelligent creatures . Not only are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been observed to use plants and minerals in the wild as medicine to cure illnesses and treat wounds ! <h> Planet Ape <p> There you have it : we live in a real-life Planet of Apes full of many diverse , brilliantly intelligent , and very sociable creatures . Imagine if somehow these apes became super-intelligent enough to form their own society and set-off a war against humanity ? We probably would n't stand a chance ! <p> If you 're unable to travel across central Africa to see these apes , you will probably need to wait until July to see them in War for the Planet of the Apes . War is coming , but thankfully its a war that we wont have to fight well , at least not any time soon . <p> Andy Murray is a writer who blogs for Cineworld as part of our news team .

@@95850697 @50697/ <h> Apes ! Together ! Strong ! Why War for the Planet of the Apes could be Oscar-worthy ! <p> It all started when Charlton Heston uttered the words " You maniacs ! You blew it up ! " as his character realises that it is Earth , after all , that has met its ruin . <p> This dramatic finale is where 1968 's Planet of the Apes became an instant classic . Now it is regarded as one of the best and most well-known film franchises in movie history . After Tim Burtons unsuccessful remake in 2001 , Fox decided to reboot the franchise with visionary , motion-capture mastermind , Andy Serkis in the leading role as Caesar , and special effects provided by Peter Jacksons visual effect company , WETA . <p> The first instalment , Rise of the Planet of the Apes , surprised many when it was released in 2011 , a thought-provoking film in which lab-born monkey Caesar , having been brought up around humans , is suddenly thrown into an all ape environment that ultimately leads to a devastating ape uprising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Planet of the Apes , the second instalment released in 2014 , was the Empire Strikes Back of ape movies . A gritty portrayal of the aftermath of the ape-rising , it showed downtrodden humans fighting for their lives . <p> Now , as we anticipate the third instalment , titled War for the Planet of the Apes , released in July 2017 , we explore the reasons why the third in the Andy Serkis reboot series has the potential to be Oscar-worthy. <h> 1 . It 's a series that 's got better and better <p> The first film became a huge sleeper hit back in summer 2011 . It established its characters beautifully and set up a world that we were excited to explore . The second film amazingly managed to improve on the first , with brand new human characters , a ruthless and villainous ape named Koba , and captivating CGI . <p> Now , with a new cast including Woody Harrelson , Judy Greer and Steve Zahn , and returning director Matt Reeves , were sure that War for the Planet of the Apes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this much potential has a big chance to get nominated for Best Picture , something that a sci-fi flick rarely achieves . <h> 2 . Andy Serkis <p> Andy Serkis may not necessarily be a household name but if you look back at his filmography , you 'll wonder why . He made his breakthrough by portraying one of the most iconic characters ever in a fantasy series , Gollum in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy , with his voice for the character becoming instantly recognisable . In doing so , he was largely responsible for bringing motion capture performance ( more on which in a moment ) into the mainstream . <p> He has then gone on to star in films like Christopher Nolans The Prestige , Peter Jacksons King Kong ( again donning the motion capture suit to play the great ape ) and Steven Spielbergs Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn ( another , more comic , mo-cap role as the drunken Captain Haddock ) . <p> He s also working on his directorial debut , a Jungle Book reboot due for release in 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character Caesar with life and soul , its a wonder how he has not been nominated for an Oscar already . Seriously , they need to create a motion capture category . Should it happen , let 's hope next year that he not only gets nominated , but he also wins . <h> 3 . The incredible visual effects <p> One of the big things that sets this Planet of the Apes series apart is the striking special effects . They 're done by WETA Digital , founded by none other than the legendary director Peter Jackson . <p> To help fully capture the movement of the apes , WETA have used motion capture to help create the CGI apes ; this is where an actor acts like the inhuman character ( in this case , a primate ) by wearing a dotted suit , and the CGI is then created around the actors . This results in the apes looking incredibly realistic , so with that in mind its a wonder why the series has n't  won the Best Visual Effects award at the Oscars . <p> Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but have lost out to other films ( Hugo and Interstellar , respectively ) . Could this be a ' third time lucky ' situation for the team at WETA Digital ? One can only hope . <h> 4 . There 's storytelling skill behind the effects <p> Unlike a lot of sci-fi films , the Planet of the Apes reboot saga has already shown that whilst action , special effects and a solid cast go a long way towards making a good movie , it takes a story with heart to lift a movie to the realms of truly great cinema . <p> Part one of the series allowed us to connect with the ape at the centre of the story and provided several heart-wrenching moments as Caesar was separated from his human family . In the second instalment we were treated to an exciting and gritty drama as humans and apes tried in-vain to live side by side before descending to violence . <p> In War for the Planet of the Apes we expect astounding visual effects and heart-stopping action , but we also hope that the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorable sci-fi film .

At the age of 14 , she stuns in Robert Redford 's moving drama , playing a young girl traumatised in a riding accident who must travel with her mother ( Kristin Scott Thomas ) to seek help from the whisperer of the title ( played by Redford ) . Never striking a false note , Scarlett is utterly convincing as a teenager on course for redemption . <h> Ghost World ( 2001 ) <p> Scarlett 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool graphic novel adaptation , held up as one of the greatest ever . She plays Rebecca , who along with her friend Enid ( Thora Birch ) finds her life unravelling when she meets loner Seymour ( Steve Buscemi ) . The star 's familiar husky voice and air of charismatic detachment is well-suited for a movie that glides along to a hipster soundtrack before uncovering darker truths . <h> Girl with a Pearl Earring ( 2003 ) <p> A great actor will always be able to adapt to different genres and time periods . In this ravishingly designed historical drama set in 17th century Holland , Scarlett plays Griet , the real-life muse of famed painter Johannes Vermeer ( Colin Firth ) who provides inspiration for the celebrated painting of the title . The actress 's beauty is put to thoughtful and captivating use yet beneath the surface she also convinces on a dramatic level . <h> Lost in Translation ( 2003 ) <p> Scarlett 's signature role ? It 's got to be this . If not quite her best performance it 's almost certainly the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charismatic A-listers of the modern age , drawing on her penchant for compelling understatement in its tale of Tokyo loneliness and melancholy . Sofia Coppola 's acclaimed indie draws more attention for bringing Bill Murray back into the limelight but Scarlett 's valuable contribution should n't be forgotten . <h> Vicky Cristina Barcelona ( 2008 ) <p> For a short time in the mid-to-late 2000 's , Scarlett appeared to become the legendary Woody Allen 's latest muse , further cementing her reputation as one of the brightest and most eye-catching stars around . There 's no denying she rolls off his famously acerbic dialogue like a pro , as seen in this excellent late-period charmer about two women seduced by a charismatic Spanish painter . Her character ( the Cristina of the title ) is n't always sympathetic , but that only makes the character more enjoyable to watch . <h> The Avengers ( 2012 ) <p> It takes a special kind of actor who can flip-flop between stylish indie drama and rollicking popcorn thrills . But Scarlett is that person . She first appeared as badass Natasha Romanoff/Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't until Joss Whedon 's triumphant Marvel ensemble adventure that she really began to stand out , mixing action chops with sincere humanity in a manner that rivalled and often excelled her beefier co-stars like Chris Hemsworth . Seriously , where is our Black Widow movie ? <h> Under the Skin ( 2014 ) <p> If we 're thinking of Scarlett 's best acting performance , it has to be this : the hypnotic , disturbing and eerily detached centrepiece of Jonathan Glazer 's confounding sci-fi mood poem . Mixing candid camera footage with breathtakingly surreal vistas , this captivating and enigmatic critical favourite is brilliantly held together by Scarlett 's performance as an unnamed alien in human form , one going clandestine on the streets of Glasgow . Conveying the essence of an otherworldly being slowly awakening to a sense of humanity , she is superb . <h> Her ( 2014 ) <p> Who says Scarlett needs to appear on screen in order to impress us ? Spike Jonze 's dreamy and moving romantic drama centres on a man ( Joaquin Phoenix ) who falls in love with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has one of the most distinctive vocal ranges in the business Scarlett 's casting is nothing short of a masterstroke , conveying all manner of emotion love , pain , betrayal and all without ever showing her face . <h> Lucy ( 2014 ) <p> She has n't just blown away the bad guys in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Scarlett also made another bid for iconic action movie status in this nutso revenge thriller from The Fifth Element Luc Besson , playing a woman used as a drug mule who essentially turns into a superhero when the drugs she 's carrying leak into her bloodstream . If you ever wanted to see the brilliant Scarlett essentially move onto a higher plane of existence and transform into God ( after loads of physics-defying special effects action ) , you 've got it here . <p> Where do you think Ghost in the Shell will rank among Scarlett Johansson 's best roles ? Tweet us @Cineworld with your thoughts . The movie is released on 31st March 2017.

But it does n't  officially come out in UK cinemas until 12th January 2017 . So I 'm cheating and sticking it on the list because its a truly special film . I want everyone to see this movie . I 'm really routing for it to do well . Its unashamed in being old fashioned but it manages to thrust a classic story into the 21st century . The songs , music , characters and style already feels iconic and its not even been released everywhere yet . Look forward to this one . <h> 2 . Kingsman : The Golden Circle <p> Matthew Vaughn is my favourite director . There 's something about the way he makes films , I can really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 , he made Kick-Ass , which is one of my favourite films . If you have n't seen it , rectify that immediately . Stop reading this and go watch Kick-Ass . Seriously . <p> But do n't  watch the sequel . Pretend that does n't  exist . But the first movie was ahead of its time . And while Deadpool hit the sweet spot this year by parodying superhero movies whilst being a superhero movie itself , Kick-Ass did it first and , in my opinion , did it better . <p> In 2015 , Vaughn and his screenwriting partner Jane Goldman brought us Kingsman : The Secret Service . They basically gave the spy genre the Kick-Ass treatment . Parodying some tropes and embracing others . It was funny , smart , with some of the most jaw-dropping action sequence Ive ever seen . For those who have seen it that church fight , right ? I am totally on board for more of all that next year . <h> 3 . Spider-Man : Homecoming <p> This is the third time Hollywood has tried their hand at Spidey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me is jumping for joy . I 've talked about my giddiness for this in an earlier blog . But since then , we 've had a trailer and I 've watched it more times than I 'd care to admit . So far , it looks like everything we 've been promised . A proper high school film with a John Hughes inspired tone . I also love that we live in a time where Spider-Man can swing past us with Iron Man flying beside him . But you wo n't fool me with all your cool visuals get the characters right and well talk . <h> 4 . Star Wars : Episode 8 <p> I did n't  ' get ' Star Wars until The Force Awakens . When I was a kid , the originals never grabbed me and the prequels certainly did n't  do any better . Its no secret that Episode VII was a soft reboot of the franchise , in fact some people have complained that its basically a remake of A New Hope . <p> I 'm not denying that , but by doing so , Disney have converted people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise to a whole new generation . Smart move . Now every year , until we all die , we can expect a new Star Wars film . Its probably not going to be exciting forever , but it is for now . <h> 5 . Baby Driver <p> After his departure from Marvel 's Ant-Man , it feels like Edgar Wright burrowed himself away for a couple of years . But next year , he s reemerging with a new film which is apparently based on a music video he directed in 2003 for Mint Royale . <p> I know next to nothing about it apart from that . But a crime-thriller written and directed by Edgar Wright , starring Ansel Elgort , Lily James , Jamie Foxx , Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey sounds like a good time to me . <p> Jack Howard is a writer , director and actor .

This is a stark contrast to what we saw in the original sixties film , in which the human race was reduced to nothing more than a few primitive beings . <p> So while we know the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the title War is a huge clue , as conflict is brewing between the humans and the apes . Could it be the apes that force the humans to the brink of extinction ? Or could the new antagonist , the Colonel ( played by Woody Harrelson ) , be to blame ? <p> The original Planet of the Apes did suggest that nuclear warfare was responsible for humanitys downfall , but were still unsure how faithful the prequels are to the original . All we know is that the humans are going to lose . Its about time someone else won . <h> Which of Caesar 's apes will die ? <p> We currently have very little information about the upcoming film , but we do have a short film synopsis ( courtesy of Slash Film ) . of the planet . <p> " After the apes suffer unimaginable losses . " This could be the emotional catalyst for Caesar , and so we should expect at least one major ape to be killed in the battle . Could it be Caesars wife , Cornelia , or maybe even one of his sons ? Such a death is certain to give Caesar a lot of emotional turmoil . <p> We just hope that the lovable orangutan Maurice is n't one of the early casualties . After all , his species has been through enough already . This could be the most upsetting animal death since Marley and Bambis mother , so do n't  say we did n't  warn you . <h> Will Caesar delve into his dark side ? <p> As mentioned before , Caesar is expected to go through emotional trauma during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that he will " wrestle with his darker instincts as he resolves to avenge his kind " .

What he will do remains a mystery , but were excited to see what unfolds . <h> Did Koba perish ? <p> We did just say that Caesar let Koba fall to his death . But did the villainous ape truly die ? At the end of the credits , there was a strange audio clip of heavy breathing .

If so , his body would have surely been crippled , but that does n't  mean he could n't still be a major character in the upcoming film . <p> We already know that the military are on their way to his location , so perhaps they will find Koba . As if Koba had n't  already suffered enormously , this would probably mean that the ape will be interrogated . We almost feel sorry for him .

It was assumed that there would only three prequels , but a couple of years back Andy Serkis suggested that it could be boosted to four or five films . <p> That 's great news for us , as we get to see more of the Planet of the Apes series , but is it good news for Caesar ? So far , he s been the main protagonist of the series , but does that guarantee he 'll survive the duration ?

@@95850745 @50745/ <h> Apes , together , strong ! What we 've learned from the War for the Planet of the Apes trailer <p> The world is changing in the darkly dramatic new trailer for War for the Planet of the Apes , as super-intelligent Caesar ( Andy Serkis ) confronts his greatest enemy in the form of The Colonel ( Woody Harrelson ) . <p> Here 's what we 've learned about the movie that could be poised to go down as one of 2017 's greatest blockbusters . <h> Ape legacy <p> Fragments of voiceover from Rise and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes signal the dark cloud hanging over Caesar in the new movie , reinforcing how we 've arrived at this stage and what 's at stake for his band of genetically enhanced simians . <p> With the arrival of a group of humans , one of whom bears a helmet emblazoned with ' monkey killer ' , we can assume that following the explosive climax of Dawn , tensions are still high between the two species . <p> As new character Bad Ape ( Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Human get sick ...

" But it looks like he 'll soon be pulled into a new battle that 's not of his choosing ... <h> Meet the Colonel <p> Always great at playing scene-chewing baddies , Harrelson looks poised to deliver another malevolent performance as the warring Colonel , one who seeks nothing less than the destruction of all apes . " In order to retain our humanity , sometimes we have to lose our humanity , " he addresses his troops . <p> And he lives up to his threat in what 's sure to be a devastating sequence as Caesar 's ape colony is destroyed by an onslaught of rocket-firing helicopters . This inaugurates the next stage in the ape 's life , transforming him from reluctant warrior into vengeful animal . <h> Fight for survival <p> As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed in the original 1968 Planet of the Apesmovie , in which humans were displaced on the food-chain by their superior ape counterparts . <p> We get a spine-tingling foreshadowing in the confrontation between the Colonel and Caesar as he attempts to justify his barbarous actions , claiming , " You talk about mercy ... but no matter what you say eventually you 'll replace us . " <p> This also ties directly into the events of the preceding two movies . Let 's not forget that we got to this stage as a result of the devastating simian flu being unleashed at the end of Rise of Planet of the Apes , one that wiped out much of humanity and which resulted in the post-apocalyptic world seen in Dawn . <h> Ape or human ? <p> One of the most intriguing twists throughout this series has been the inner-species tension .

What 's your favourite film of all time ? <p> Tough question . I like a wide variety of films from a number of different genres and my answer would probably change either on a day to day basis , or by how I 'm feeling at any given moment . <p> The film that has always stuck with me though is The Matrix , the imagination in that movie just blew my mind back when it came out and I thought the action sequences and the special effects were absolutely spectacular and still think they hold up well to this day .

Also there are some pretty neat local deals too which I 've found out about recently .

I tend to finish eating before the film starts as I have to have full concentration on the film . <h> 8 . What do you love most about being an Unlimited member ? <p> What I love most about being an Unlimited member is that it has given me the opportunity to go and watch movies that I normally would never have thought to have gone to see . It 's also led me to some surprising favourites .

@@95850752 @50752/ <h> Why the Guardians of the Galaxy are a bigger marvel than the Avengers <p> The Avengers may be the standout team of the Marvel Cinematic Universe , but there 's another group of heroes that are significantly more entertaining . The Guardians of the Galaxy are out of this world , and while they stole our hearts and tickled our funny bone in the first film , we believe theyll be bigger and better in the sequel . But are the likes of Star-Lord and Drax really better than Iron Man and Thor ? Yes , and here 's why ... <h> Their chemistry <p> The Guardians ' greatest strength is their chemistry . The " I have a plan " scene is the best example of this , as they provide both laughs and teary eyes by arguing about their current predicament . All of the characters show their strengths , from Rockets sarcastic comments to Groots perfectly timed one-liners . <p> No character has an ego large enough to dominate the screen , unlike a certain genius billionaire playboy philanthropist . They 're a team of equals rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the Avengers have had their moments , particularly the exchanges between Captain America and Iron Man , but the Guardians can make any conversation hysterical , whether they 're hatching a plan to escape from prison or discussing the art of dancing . <h> They do n't need superpowers ! <p> As much as we like super strength and robot suits , it can get a bit tedious when their solution to everything is repeatedly punching something or firing a few homing missiles . Aside from Groot , the Guardians do n't  really have any superpowers . Rockets handy with a gun and Gamoras dexterity puts Black Widows to shame , but despite being a raccoon and a green alien , respectively , they still manage to feel very human . <p> Plus , everyone likes an underdog , and the Guardians are always risking their lives when heading into a fight . For this reason , you could say that they 're even more courageous than Captain America . <h> They 're a bunch of loveable losers <p> The Guardians are losers . Not our words , but Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the team have lost something . Draxs family were murdered and Quill was abducted from aliens when his mother passed away . Their tragic backstories make them relatable , which makes them all-the-more likeable . <p> The Avengers initiative on the on the other hand is made up of Gods , super soldiers and billionaires . So unless you are ridiculously rich or a character from Norse mythology , we understand what it means to be a loser . <h> They 're hilarious <p> The key ingredients for a Marvel film are comedy and action . Every film within this superhero universe will make you chuckle at least once , even the ( relatively ) more serious Captain America films . However , no other Marvel film masters the art of comedy better than Guardians of the Galaxy . <p> Each of the characters have their own quirks that will have you rolling on the floor with laughter . Draxs inability to understand metaphors and Star-Lords charisma were frequent sources of entertainment , as long with many other catchphrases and one-liners . With this year 's Civil War having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker , its refreshing to have a lighter tone . After all , we all love a good laugh . <h> They exist outside the law <p> The Guardians of the Galaxy do n't  exactly have clean records . Rocket and Groot are bounty hunters , Quill is smuggler and Gamora in the first movie was working for the super villain Thanos . Plus , they all ended up in prison during the film . <p> In comparison its hard to think of any Avenger that has served time in jail ( aside from Ant-Man ) . But is n't being a law abiding citizen a good thing ? Yes , of course . We do n't  want axe wielding maniacs and burglars roaming the streets , but at the same time , its a bit of a drag listening to Captain Americas ramblings about morality and justice . <p> Peter Quills approach is a more entertaining watch , from literally giving the authorities the middle finger to sending the galactic police a message about his genitals . And when you consider that many of the authorities back on Earth have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put faith in our outer-space anti-heroes . <h> They are Groot ! <p> Yes , the Guardians are funny , courageous and relatable , but that would mean nothing if they werent so good together on screen . While the Avengers have great chemistry , you would n't exactly call them the best of friends after the events of Civil War . The Avengers are united by justice and duty , while there 's nothing holding the Guardians together aside from friendship . <p> This is shown clearly on screen . Even when they 're arguing , you can tell that they care a great deal for each other . Quill risked his life to save Gamora , while Rocket shed a tear or two when he thought his best buddy Groot had died . Could you say the same about Iron Man and Cap 's relationship ? <h> Baby Groot <p> The biggest thing that sets the Guardians apart from the Avengers is a certain member of the team : Groot . In the first film , despite only being able to say " I am Groot " , and exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be made out of wood , but he still managed to show heart . <p> But for the sequel , in his smaller form , Baby Groot looks to be even better . He s small and adorable , yet he s still a formidable opponent , being the only Guardian with superpowers . Baby Groot is already getting a lot of attention , which is no surprise considering he was the main focus of the recent trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 . <p> Check out the latest Guardians Vol. 2 trailer below . The movie is released on 28th April 2017 . <p> Ryan Jones is a writer who blogs for Cineworld as part of our news team .

Which Cineworld do you visit the most ? <p> I watch most of my unlimited films at Gloucester Quays Cineworld , which opened in 2013 . The cinema is in a perfect setting within the Gloucester Docklands with many restaurants to choose from to eat before or after seeing the film which I now get various amounts of discount at with my unlimited card . I will also take an adventure to Cheltenham Cineworld to watch the big blockbuster movies in IMAX. <h> 2 . What 's your favourite film of all time ? <p> There are so many good movies out there , which makes it really hard to choose a favourite .

Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery . And I promise you , something great will come of it . " The other of my favourite films is a ' festive ' film , and that is ' The Grinch ' with Jim Carey . The comedy and adult humour set within a scenic and magical Christmas scene is brilliant . <p> My final favourite film , which now that I think about it , would actually be my favourite film of all time has to be Gravity with Sandra Bullock . There is something about the film that captivates me . I have watched this film twice at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3D effects were exceptional . You would never think that watching one or two people alone in space would be so great . Along with the visual effects , great storyline and brilliant acting , the soundtrack by Steven Price , nominated for fifteen awards with seven wins , including a BAFTA absolutely makes and completes the film . <h> 3 . Why did you decide to join Cineworld Unlimited ? <p> In 2014 , my friend Matt and I went to see Interstellar in the newly added IMAX screen in Cheltenham Cineworld . I remember sitting in the extremely comfortable seating with my coke and bag of cinema sweet popcorn , high above the screen , looking around the room and realising that there was a lot of speakers on the walls . We talked about how we read an article on the Cineworld blog , and I quote , " The IMAX cinema at Cineworld Cheltenham will offer visitors a uniquely immersive cinematic experience , allowing them to enjoy the biggest blockbusters including Interstellar like never before .

The IMAX experience was most defiantly felt at this stage as the whole room came alive , the music was intense and our seats were on extreme vibrating mode . To say the IMAX Experience offers a uniquely immersive cinematic experience is an understatement . Matt and I just looked at each other and just smiled and said " Woah ! ! " . <p> At the end of the film , I most defiantly had the film bug . It was n't until May 2015 that I finally decided to join as unlimited member . I felt it would be so much better to see as many films as possible with one set monthly price , along with enjoying all the key benefits such as special unlimited screenings and 10% off food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobby , a hobby that I could enjoy with my friends and family at a really great price . <h> 4 .

My friends Matt , Rosie and John attend all the great movies . We are all big kids at heart , so were all into the cartoon films as well as all the other films . My friend Jenna is my Unlimited buddy for the Psychological Thriller movies such as Split with James McAvoy . I have a cinema buddy that is only 3 years old , that I have recently been to the Movies for Juniors screening of Moana .

What 's your favourite must-have cinema snack ? <p> If I am watching a movie I have to have your traditional cinema sweet popcorn and some refreshing coke , and I can never resist going for the large size .

@@95850815 @50815/ <h> The music of #RogueOne : can Michael Giacchino replace John Williams ? <p> With booking now open for Rogue One ( seriously , get your tickets now ! ) , we 've got Star Wars on the brain . <p> The main theme from the series is perhaps one of the most iconic and recognisable pieces of film music of all time . It 's composed by the legendary John Williams , the man who has given us other hit film scores such as Indiana Jones , Home Alone , Jurassic Park , Harry Potter , and so much more . Williams has become an integral and much-loved part of the Star Wars franchise but he will not , however , be proving the music for Rogue One . <p> Do n't  panic though because we will be treated to the music of Michael Giacchino ( pictured below ) when we sit down in cinemas on December 15th instead . Who is Giacchino ? Well , you might not recognise the name but we can guarantee that you 've heard his music . So , trust us when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here are some classic scores that prove why . <h> The Incredibles <p> Giacchino has worked on several Pixar films over the years , his first being The Incredibles . The music is jazzy , up-beat , and intense , combining screeching and muted brass with growling tenor sax and frantic percussion . Giacchino creates an incredible score which is part old-school superspy and part superhero flick , but all-round fun ! Will he be providing some cantina-style music for Rogue One ? He 's certainly got the capabilities . <h> Ratatouille <p> John Williams ' Star Wars scores are as famous for their romantic tenderness as their thunderous action ( think the theme for Han Solo and Princess Leia ) . <p> Fortunately , Giacchino excels in this area too . From fast-paced superhero thrills to the streets of Paris : Giacchino 's next Pixar project was Ratatouille where he swaps the in-your-face brass and percussion for a more haunting sound of soft piano and swelling strings to envision the beauty and grandness of Paris . Do n't  forget a pinch of accordion mixed in there too for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right , Giacchino was the person responsible for making you weep inconsolably every time you watched Pixars UP . <p> This score is more playful than the previous two animated scores we 've listed , passing the main theme ( Ellies Theme ) amongst a variety of instruments including muted trumpet , clarinet , and piano . In the process Giacchino is effectively able to tell the story of the relationship between Carl and Ellie through its charming beginning to heart-wrenching end as the musical theme grows with the characters . A truly great film composer is one who can make us cry with joy , and Giacchino can surely do that , which bodes well for Rogue One . <h> Super 8 <p> When he s not working with Pixar , Giacchino can usually be found working alongside J.J. Abrams in such sci-fi blasts like Super 8 . The lyrical string section here work to illustrate the child-like wonderment of the group of heroes who discover something out of this world . Layer this melody over a majestic fanfare which adds depth and excitement and you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stunning as this in his Star Wars score , we 'll be delighted . <h> Star Trek <p> Rogue One is n't the first time that this terrific composer has jetted off into space . He s also the musical genius who wrote the music for the new Star Trek trilogy . <p> To do justice to the sheer scale of the Star Trek universe Giacchino had to write something just as huge , and he did not disappoint . The main theme is as big as orchestral music gets . It starts off small with a few simple ideas but after the pounding of drums it erupts into a powerful action-packed piece that is lives up to the Star Trek name . <p> When you listen to it , imagine you are launching into outer space for the first time . Without knowing what to expect , you are thrown into a vast universe rife with infinite possibility . <h> Dawn of the Planet of the Apes <p> If you ever need proof of how versatile Giacchino is , just take a listen to what he wrote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't  write the music for its predecessor Rise ( that was Patrick Doyle ) , his work is a more than welcome addition to the franchise and we cant wait to see what he has in store for War for the Planet of the Apes next year . The music here is extremely atmospheric , the composer using some unsettling sounds to make his point , and we 're hoping this same creativity will feed into Rogue One . <p> There are a lot of gorgeous melodies on top of some not-so-nice accompaniments which creates a large amount of musical tension to foreshadow the impending war between the feuding humans and apes see how clever and subtle film music can be ? <h> Jupiter Ascending <p> When you 're tasked to write music for a film as strange and stunning as Jupiter Ascending , why not compose a mini symphony ? That 's exactly what Giacchino did , conjuring a full-scale 80 minute powerhouse for directors the Wachowskis without seeing a single image from the film . Instead he composed using only cards with descriptions of characters and places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an already edited film , which goes to show how talented Giacchino is . Each movement is completely different from the last but each one fits in perfectly with the films world despite not seeing the film until after the music was written . Creative and intuitive : need we say more about why he 's perfect to score a galaxy far , far away ? <h> Inside Out <p> Giacchinos Pixar magic is n't over yet ! His most recent collaboration with the team was the immensely emotional Inside Out , which features some of our favourite Pixar music in recent years . <p> The main theme , ' Bundle of Joy ' , is a music box style piano melody over a simple ostinato ( a fancy music word for repeated rhythmic phrase ) with a hint of stunning electronic sounds that let 's you know you are in for an emotional experience from the very start . Just try listening to this without smiling ; it 's impossible , and bodes well for the epic space saga coming our way . <h> Jurassic World <p> Working on Rogue One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' musical ideas . In the theme for Jurassic World , Williams ' original theme is still easily recognisable from the sombre French horn call at the start into the build-up towards the iconic melody . <p> Giacchino then adds in a bit of his own flair by introducing some vocals into the mix to make the music that little bit more grandiose . The composer does n't  add much to this theme but , to be fair , he does n't  need to : Williams score was already perfect , and Giacchino simply brings it into a new generation . Fingers crossed he 'll pull of the same extraordinary feat with Star Wars . <h> Doctor Strange <p> There seems to be no stopping Giacchinos talent . He has now even contributed to the music of the Marvel-verse with his work on Doctor Strange . He certainly knows how to match Marvels madness : the piece is a funky fusion of orchestra , keyboards , traditional eastern instrumentation , and modern rock music . If you 're going to write for a film as visually outrageous as Doctor Strange you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to match , right ? <h> So can Michael Giacchino replace John Williams ? <p> John Williams is a musical icon who is truly unique and irreplaceable so , in that sense , no one will ever be able to replace him . But if there is a modern composer worthy enough to carry his legacy , it 's Michael Giacchino . <p> Giacchino is one of the best composers writing film music today and we have every confidence that whatever he has written for Rogue One will not only be an homage to Williamss original Star Wars score , it will also reimagine the soundscape for a whole new adventure . <p> So , when you sit down to watch the movie in Cineworld , remember to keep an ear open for the music and have a listen for yourself !

Supporting Adams is Avengers star Jeremy Renner as scientist Ian , another actor who resists the temptation to play things over-the-top but who injects some much-needed humour , particularly his first deadpan reaction to venturing inside the alien ship . Ian 's relationship with Louise becomes vital to the storyline but we could n't possibly reveal why . <p> Also on hand is Last King of Scotland Oscar-winner Forrest Whitaker as no-nonsense Army Colonel Weber , a man who has to put his own sense of wonder aside to prioritise his sense of duty : do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

@@95850841 @50841/ <h> Why Rogue One is going to be the Platoon of Star Wars movies <p> Rogue One will mark a new direction for the Star Wars franchise . This is not just because its the first stand-alone Star Wars anthology film . It will also adopt a completely new tone to what weve previously seen in the popular universe . You could even say it will be the Platoon of Star Wars movies given it focuses on war . Why do we think this film will be so unique compared to its predecessors ? here 's our reasons ... <h> Its told through the soldiers ' perspective <p> In the majority of previous Star Wars films , particularly the prequels , we follow characters higher up the rankings . The Jedi were some of the most influential people in the galaxy and Princess Leia was well a princess . <p> Of course the likes of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker werent high ranking generals , but they werent exactly on the front line either . They were always protected by their armoured ship , or surrounded by powerful allies such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy ride , but they werent knee deep in the trenches either . <p> Jyn Erso ( Felicity Jones ) and company will have a completely different experience of the war . There 's little to protect them the enemys fire . They are not the chosen ones . They are simply soldiers that have been sent on a mission . They will show a darker perspective on the war and how significant victory will be on their lives . <h> No Jedi mind tricks <p> As mentioned before , unless Yoda or Obi Wan make an ( unlikely ) appearance , there will be no Jedi in this particular Star Wars film . This means that there will be no lightsaber duels or mind tricks . The weapons they use will be a lot closer to what soldiers use in reality . Well OK , we have n't invented a blaster just yet , but they 're basically a gun with futuristic ammunition . ( Sorry to ruin the illusion . ) <p> Do not doubt that this will have a major impact on the tone of the film . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defy the odds . They 're going to have to win it the old fashioned way and that surely means casualties . This is especially interesting with the appearance of Darth Vader . Every time Vader has entered the fray there 's been a Jedi to counter-act him . This time it could be a massacre . <h> A darker universe <p> Star Wars has , and will always be , a family friendly franchise . To make it exclusive to a mature audience would steal away the magic of the series . Both children and adults will be in attendance at the very first Rogue One showings , but that does n't  necessarily stop the film from becoming slightly darker . <p> The Force Awakens flirted with the idea in its opening scene , as a fallen comrade smeared blood across Finns helmet . This was initially shocking for a Star Wars film , but The Force Awakens soon returned to the typical upbeat charm . <p> While Rogue One is unlikely to show the full extent of the horrors of war in the manner of Saving Private Ryan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cracking joke after joke when the stakes are this high . War and grief go hand in hand and it will be interesting to see how Rogue One handles this . <h> Every hero has a dark side <p> One of the most interesting elements of Rogue One is that the group of heroes are n't  volunteering to take this mission out of the goodness of their hearts . They all have their own motives . <p> " They destroyed our home , " Baze Malbus , the hardened warrior cries in the first trailer . Jyn Erso on the other hand looks determined to find out more about her father . With her dad working for the Empire on the Death Star , her loyalty to the Rebellion is n't as clear cut as originally thought .

The Vietnam War was a major factor in the development of war cinema , and we cant help but think this was a consideration when it came to the setting of Rogue One . <p> Why would they do this ? We would guess that it would ground the fantastical Star Wars universe in locations that are somewhat recognisable . Previous Star Wars films had no interest in portraying a realistic representation of war . Its a fantasy series after all .

Everyone 's favourite pirate Cap'n Jack Sparrow ( Johnny Depp ) takes to the high seas again next year in the swashbuckling fifth instalment of the blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean franchise , Dead Men Tell No Tales . <p> Having claimed an ocean-load of booty already , expectations are high for the next adventure to top what 's gone before . One of the ways it 's set to do that is the casting of villainous actor extraordinaire Javier Bardem in the role of Jack 's latest nemesis , Captain Salazar . <p> So how will he compare to the other swashbuckling brigands in the series ? He will for sure have some big , buckled , buccaneer boots to fill , and that 's no easy thing to do ... <h> Captain Barbossa 's the name , and mutiny 's the game ! <p> Played by : Geoffrey Rush <p> The lowdown : Our first baddy , Captain of the Black Pearl , was cursed for stealing treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew , into skeletons at night , making for quite the deadly villain . <p> The Curse of the Black Pearl 's baddie was our first brush with brigand battlers but certainly not the last .

With his customary stylistic precision and his regular rep of actors , including Jason Schwartzman , Bill Murray , Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson , alongside George Clooney as Mr " Foxy " Fox , it feels more like a companion piece to The Royal Tenenbaums and The Grand Budapest Hotel than to James and the Giant Peach . <h> Esio Trot ( 2015 ) <p> The title is ' tortoise ' spelled backwards and the end result is one of Dahl 's most sweetly down-to-Earth stories , a romance between an elderly widower and his neighbour with more than a few reptiles thrown in .

Quite apart from the physical ravages he puts himself through , it 's the actor 's ability to convey Sands ' fiercely committed beliefs that really lingers in the mind . <h> Fish Tank ( 2009 ) <p> One of Fassbender 's great skills is to take unsavoury characters and make them utterly compelling .

Director Quentin Tarantino 's WWII/Spaghetti Western mash-up casts Fassbender as the superbly suave Lt. Archie Hicox , and the moment where the gallant Brit meets his end is one of the actor 's finest moments . <h> X-Men : First Class ( 2011 ) <p> Matthew Vaughn 's mutant epic took the X-Men back to their origins , and it 's a comic book adventure stuffed with great performances . All the more credit to Fassbender then that his seething , anguished take on Magneto is far and away the best thing in the movie , resonating far more than the glitzy special effects . <h> Jane Eyre ( 2011 ) <p> Charlotte Bronte 's brooding , broiling literary creation Mr. Rochester has been treated to a host of different iterations from the likes of Orson Welles and George C.

However Fassbender 's understated , intensely emotional performance opposite Mia Wasikowska as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <h> Shame ( 2012 ) <p> In his second collaboration with Steve McQueen , Fassbender plunged to even more forbidding depths of character as sex addict Brandon . The star 's raw , unforgiving performance as a man consumed by his own inner demons is so convincing it 's hard to watch , further proof that the Fassbender/McQueen partnership is film dynamite . <h> A Dangerous Method ( 2012 ) <p> Fassbender 's a dab hand at playing real-life figures too . He puts a debonair spin on legendary psychologist Carl Jung in David Cronenberg 's playful look at the former 's relationship with Sigmund Freud ( Viggo Mortensen ) in fact , during filming , Fassbender was so delighted with how his career was going that Cronenberg expressed irritation with how happy he looked between scenes . <h> Haywire ( 2012 ) <p> Very often in movie fight scenes , it 's easy to tell ourselves that the actors are n't getting hurt . Trust Fassbender to blow that theory out of the water .

But Fassbender 's consummately believable performance as eerie android David is easily the most captivating and intriguing thing about it , his blonde locks modelled on Lawrence of Arabia . David will be back next year in Alien : Covenant . <h> 12 Years a Slave ( 2013 ) <p> It takes a very special kind of actor to take an utterly despicable , loathsome real-life figure and find the humanity in them . That 's exactly what Fassbender did with his incendiary , Oscar-nominated performance as brutal slave owner Edwin Epps in Steve McQueen 's extraordinary drama : never lapsing into caricature , it 's a towering portrayal of a man whose soul has been corrupted by the very institution to which he belongs . <h> Frank ( 2014 ) <p> Back on lighter territory after 12 Years a Slave , Fassbender demonstrated we did n't even need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .

Constantly toying with our sympathies , the actor demonstrates few can make unpredictability as interesting as he can . <h> Macbeth ( 2015 ) <p> We 're running out of superlatives here but needless to say we 're reserving some for Fassbender 's moody and brilliant take on the Bard .

It seemed in 1989 that there was only one real choice for the role of the Joker when director Tim Burton reinvented the big screen Batman off the back of the success of graphic novels The Killing Joke and Year One . Truth is though , Nicholson was past his physical prime by 1989 and while the leaner Jack of Chinatown or The Shining would have made a knockout Joker , he was too damn pudgy by the time of Burton 's goth epic . <h> Heath Ledger , The Dark Knight ( 2008 ) <p> Its easy to forget now how unpopular the choice of the handsome Heath Ledger was when he was named by director Christopher Nolan as the Joker for the Batman Begins follow-up , The Dark Knight .

Emblazoned with tattoos , Letos Joker looks like the most frightening yet . The actor has described the Joker as a " beautiful disaster of a character " and in preparation for the role , Leto spent his time alone , listened to 1920s gospel music , commenting that he senses " the Joker may be much older than people think " . <h> Honorable mention : Mark Hamill <p> Mark Hamill , AKA Luke Skywalker , first voiced the Joker in Batman : The Animated Series in 1992 .

He was originally created for his youth appeal <p> For the second series of the original Star Trek in 1967 , creator Gene Roddenberry was concerned that Kirk and Spock might seem rather middle-aged to youthful swinging sixties audiences . So Chekov was cast to lure in teenagers with his groovy Beatles/Monkees moptop . In fact , Walter Koenig , who played Chekov in the original series , was just a few years younger than William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy .

Walter Koenig was criticised for his ' inauthentic ' accent , but he 'd been instructed to ham it up for comic effect . Both Koenig and Anton Yelchin were born to Russian Jewish parents . Yelchin 's family relocated to the USA when he was six months old . Koenig was born in Chicago . <h> 3 . He has some brilliant boasts <p> The hot-headed , proudly patriotic youth has variously claimed that Cinderella is a Russian story , the Garden of Eden is located just outside Moscow , and Scotch whisky was invented by a little old lady from Leningrad . <h> 4 .

The movie explores the unwitting adoption of the Antichrist by the American ambassador Robert Thorn ( Gregory Peck ) and his wife Kathy ( Lee Remick ) but Superman director Richard Donner requested that David Seltzer 's script be devoid of any overtly devilish imagery like cloven hoofs . <p> 2 . Indeed , Donner 's approach to the movie was to treat it like a psychological thriller in which the Satanic undercurrent is ambiguous , and the steady emotional breakdown of Peck 's character felt believable . <p> 3 . Screenwriter Seltzer also wrote a novelisation of the movie that was released two weeks before the film was . <p> 4 . The original idea for The Omen came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munger . The former immediately hired Seltzer who took a year to complete the script . <p> 5 . Veteran To Kill a Mockingbird actor Gregory Peck was drawn to the script because of its aforementioned psychological aspects . The role in fact rejuvenated his career , which he had considered to be in decline . <p> 6 . Harvey Stephens , who plays infamous devil child Damien , was hired on the basis of how aggressively he could attack director Donner during his audition . After a round of screaming and hitting the filmmaker , Donner immediately declared him cast in the movie . <p> 7 . However , Donner did request that Stephens ' blonde hair be dyed black to give him more of an evil look . <p> 8 . Billie Whitelaw chills the blood as nanny/Satanic guardian Mrs. Baylock but the character was originally written as effusive and Irish . Whitelaw changed the dialogue in her audition to something far creepier and subsequently got the part . <p> 9 . Whitelaw 's terrifying performance received a BAFTA nomination . <p> 10 . The nanny who hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking sequences is Holly Palance , daughter of Shane and City Slickers actor Jack . <p> 11 . The movie forever cemented the image of Rottweiler dogs as the devil 's disciples but the lead dog in the movie was in fact very affectionate , choosing to lick and play with the actors rather than feign attacking them . <p> 12 . In order to provoke Stephens ' rage-fuelled outburst as the Thorns approach the church , Donner yelled at the boy off-camera in order to instigate a genuine response . <p> 13 . The savage baboon attack at the zoo was generated by tranquillising the lead male and stashing him in the back of the car . The ferocious response from the animals was genuine , as was Lee Remick 's terrified reaction . <p> 14 . The infamous decapitation scene in which David Warner 's photographer Jennings is killed by a pane of glass was shot using five cameras . The desired effect was to extend the sequence long enough so that viewers were fooled in lowering their fingers from their eyes . <p> 15 . The production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse that claimed the lives of several crew members and caused several strange accidents . Perhaps the eeriest of all came in 1977 when special effects supervisor John Richardson was involved in a horrific car crash that claimed the life of his assistant . Upon coming to , Richardson looked out of the window to see a sign pointing to the Dutch town of Ommen . <p> 16 . After shooting on location in Israel , a private plane was hired to fly Gregory Peck back to America but he cancelled at the last minute . The same plane crashed and claimed the lives of 5 Japanese businessmen . <p> 17 . During filming , Richard Donner 's hotel was bombed by the IRA . <p> 18 . Whilst scouting locations in Rome , a violent storm swept across the city and hit Hadrian 's Gate near where the crew were staying . <p> 19 . Richard Donner and Harvey Bernhard were adamant in getting esteemed Planet of the Apes and Chinatown composer Jerry Goldsmith to score the movie , off the basis of a Hollywood bowl concert they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however was initially too expensive , and Fox studio head Alan Ladd Jr . was persuaded to grant an extra $250,000 to the production so that Donner could hire him . <p> 21 . The composer 's pioneering , bone-chilling use of Satanic , Gregorian chants was to change the course of horror movie soundtracks forever and won him his only Oscar . ( The movie 's primary theme , ' Ave Satani ' , was nominated . ) <p> 22 . The Omen was a massive box office success , grossing $60m at the box office and spawning two sequels in 1978 and 1981 . <p> 23 . The movie 's box office success meant a boatload of greenbacks for Gregory Peck , who took a cut in his salary in exchange for 10% of the profits . It turned out to be the most financially successful role of the legendary actor 's career . <p> 24 . As part of its pre-release publicity campaign , and to point out the significance of " the three sixes " as The Sign of Satan , the movie was sneak-previewed nationwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the theatres were being scared witless by the film , theatre employees were out front , busily putting up specially made posters declaring : " Today is the SIXTH day of the SIXTH month of Nineteen-Seventy-SIX ! " <p> 25 . More than twice the film 's original $2.8 million budget was spent on the film 's advertising and promotion . <p> 26 . David Warner kept his severed head for years until his ex-wife rather oddly claimed custody of it . <p> 27 . Remember that final , chilling shot of Damien smiling directly into camera ? That was achieved by Richard Donner using reverse psychology on young Harvey Stephens , saying off-camera , " Do n't you dare smile , Harvey . " The end result was , of course , one of the scariest grins in movie history . <p> 28 . Entertainment Weekly ranked The Omen as the 14th scariest movie of all time . <p> 29. 1978 sequel Damien : Omen II picks up with the title character as he enters adolescence .

A fourth and fifth movie , both made for television , were received poorly and the franchise went into slumber . <p> 32 . That is until A Good Day to Die Hard director John Moore revived the series with his remake , released on 6th June 2006 . <p> 33 . Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick became the Damien for a new generation and the film 's teaser trailer was actually his sinister audition video ( see below ) . <p> 34 . However , original Damien actor Harvey Stephens appears in this remake as the tabloid reporter who asks Robert Thorn if the deceased nanny " was on drugs " . <p> 35 . Pierce Brosnan was considered for the Robert Thorn role that ultimately went to Liev Schreiber . <p> 36 . In order to honour Jerry Goldsmith 's formidable musical legacy , composer Marco Beltrami incorporated traits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 37 . In-keeping with his predecessor 's penchant for creativity , one track on Beltrami 's score entitled ' More Tantrums ! ' even features the orchestra playing backwards . <p> 38 .

In fact , the film recorded the highest opening Tuesday box office gross in domestic box office history in the United States , by earning more than $12 million . <p> 40 .

Scroll down to find out ... <h> Cyclops <p> Currently played by : Tye Sheridan <p> Previously played by : James Marsden <p> The lowdown : The rising star who has made a name for himself in acclaimed movies The Tree of Life and Mud , Sheridan nowtakes on the role of younger Scott Summers aka Cyclops , who fires deadly lasers from his eyes . <p> In the first three X-Men movies , the character was played by Tangled actor James Marsden , who clashed with Wolverine ( Hugh Jackman ) over his relationship with Jean Grey ( Fame Janssen ) , although frankly he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed off near the start of 2006 's The Last Stand . <p> Given Apocalypse is set in the 1980s , we now get to see the foundations of Summer 's relationship with the younger Jean ( Sophie Turner ) . Sheridan has been singled out for praise in many early reviews of Apocalypse , critics loving his tortured and angsty take on a character who struggles with his powers . <p> " Sheridan exudes some of the same square-jawed heroism that James Marsden brought to Scott Summers in the original trilogy , " writes Tim Grierson in Screen Daily . <p> Who wins ? Sorry James , but we have to give this one to Tye on the basis of the reviews he 's been getting and the way the movie intriguingly re-invents the character . Plus , the kick-ass footage of Cyclops in battle looks way more awesome than his underserved role in the original X-Men trilogy . <h> Jean Grey <p> Currently played by : Sophie Turner <p> Previously played by : Famke Janssen <p> The lowdown : One of the most important characters in X-Men comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good guys who in The Last Stand struggled with her burgeoning powers and transformed into the awesomely destructive Dark Phoenix ( although most agree the movie botched that famous storyline ) . <p> Established by Goldeneye sensation Famke Janssen in the first three X-Men movies , Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner now takes us back to Jean 's tempestuous origins , exploring her initial struggles with her mutant powers . Given this latest incarnation of Jean is a troubled 1980s teenager , it 's no surprise to learn that hormones and mood swings play a bigger factor than before . <p> Who wins ? We 're giving this one to Famke for the way she subtly yet brilliantly indicated Jean 's escalating abilities across three blockbusters , fully investing us in her inner struggle . <h> Storm <p> Currently played by : Alexandra Shipp <p> Previously played by : Halle Berry <p> The lowdown : Weather-controlling Storm may have some of the most impressive powers of all the X-Men but as played by Halle Berry , she was a little bit ... boring ? And anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of bad weather suddenly become scary ? <p> Although Storm was very much a force for good in the earlier films , Apocalypse does a switcheroo and sees her become one of central villain Apocalypse 's Four Horsemen : slaves commanded to do his world-destroying bidding . Early reviews have praised Storm 's new origin story , in which she 's discovered in Cairo by Apocalypse , plus relative newcomer Alexandra rocks that mohawk . <p> Who wins ? The newcomer beats the Oscar winner this time round as we give the nomination to Alexandra over Halle . Let 's face it , the hair 's better , the character looks to have been made more interesting by turning her bad and she gets properly stuck in during the battle scenes . <h> Nightcrawler <p> Currently played by : Kodi Smit-McPhee <p> Previously played by : Alan Cumming <p> The lowdown : This blue-skinned teleporter stole the show in 2003 's X2 with his striking blue body , intriguing Catholic origins and , of course , mind-blowing teleportation abilities . Seriously , who can forget that opening sequence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks the President ? <p> In the hands of British stage and screen actor Alan Cumming , Nightcrawler was a terrific character : quirky , intriguing and full of pathos . He 's now embodied , at a younger age , by Slow West 's Kodi Smit-McPhee , and the movie sees Nightcrawler rescued from a cage fight with fellow X-Men Angel ( Ben Hardy ) by Raven ( Jennifer Lawrence ) . It 's another interesting story twist but is it enough ? <p> Who wins : We 're giving this to Alan . Seriously , he defined this character to such an amazing extent ( and in only one movie , no less ) that Kodi 's interpretation , impressive though it may be , ca n't possibly hope to live up to it . <h> Magneto <p> Currently played by : Michael Fassbender <p> Previously played by : Ian McKellen <p> The lowdown : We 're cheating a bit here as the other actors on our list are series newcomers , not to mention they never appeared in the same movie as their older counterparts ( Fassbender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although never sharing the screen ) . Nevertheless with Magneto such a pivotal part of the X-Men universe , we had to weigh up the two different interpretations of his character . <p> The telekinetic villain is possibly the most intriguing character in the series , a human-hating mutant who nevertheless evokes sympathy with his tragic Auschwitz backstory . Legendary thesp Ian McKellen lent stately gravitas to Magneto in the original X-Men trilogy and the aforementioned Days of Future Pastwhilst versatile Shame star Fassbender took us back to his roots , unleashing the character 's explosive , youthful anger in the latter movie and its predecessor , First Class . <p> In Apocalypse , Magneto is incognito living with a wife and child in Poland following the events of Days of Future Past but a tragic series of circumstances soon lead him to becoming one of Apocalypse 's Horsemen ... <p> Who wins ? This is a very tough one but we 're going to give it to Fassbender by a nose . Yes , we know McKellen is one of the greatest actors in the world but for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting and thought-provoking , endlessly toying with our sympathies . <h> Xavier <p> Currently played by : James McAvoy <p> Previously played by : Patrick Stewart <p> The lowdown : Again , this is breaking the rules somewhat , all the more so given that McAvoy and Stewart did in fact share the standout scene in Days of Future Past ( ah , the wonders of time travel ) . But as with Magneto , this is an X-Men figurehead and he simply can not be left out . <p> Star of stage and screen Stewart initially gave us the sage and profound , wheelchair-bound Charles Xavier whereas McAvoy showed us ( and continues to show us ) the wise X-Men leader 's boyish origins , beginning with his boozy days as an Oxford Uni student in First Class . That movie also revealed how Xavier tragically ended up in a wheelchair in the first place . <p> From there , we 've glimpsed his continuing struggles to maintain his X-Men leadership in Days of Future Past and , in Apocalypse , how that leadership faces its deadliest threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also finally get to discover how Xavier lost all his hair ( we 're assuming it 's not stress-related ) . <p> Who wins ? Again , it 's a close call but this time we 're going with Sir Patrick himself . Much as we love McAvoy 's portrayal , Stewart so effortlessly embodies the warmth , wisdom and compassion of this towering comic book figure that we ca n't not give it to him . <h> Raven <p> Currently played by : Jennifer Lawrence <p> Previously played by : Rebecca Romijn <p> The lowdown : The shape-shifting mutant who would make a great addition to the Blue Man Group ( or maybe not ) , Raven/Mystique has had some of the most complex ups and downs of the entire X-Men series . Originally played by Rebecca Romijn as a sidekick of the villainous Magneto ( her first appearance in 2000 's X-Men in the helicopter is still unforgettable ) , we could n't help but feel she was a bit shortchanged . <p> Then , prior to her Hunger Games fame , along came the sensational Jennifer Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raw energy and conviction to the younger Raven and subsequently making the character much more compelling . Established as a childhood friend of Charles Xavier 's in First Class , she was very much operating on her own terms in Days of Future Past , her actions threatening to wipe out the future of mutant-kind and necessitating a time-travel intervention by Wolverine . Thankfully , she 's firmly back with the good guys again in Apocalypse , looked up to by the younger members of the X-Men team . <p> Who wins ? Well , it 's got to be Jen . After all , this was one of the roles that made us aware of her incredible abilities as an actress , and she was able to transform what was previously quite a bland character ( at least in the movies ) into something much more exciting . <p> The end result : Well , look at that , by a whisker the young ' uns have just about won out over the old guard , 4 to 3 .
