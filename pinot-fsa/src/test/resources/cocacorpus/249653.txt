@@43718377 @3718377/ <h> How to Extend the Life of Your Appliances <p> I went to use my iron a few months ago and realized it was n't working anymore . It had to have been at least fifteen years old . It got me wondering : How long are irons supposed to last ? Is there anything I could have done to extend its life ? This iron was probably a lower-end model . Would a higher-priced iron have lasted longer ? What could I expect the lifespan to be for my other small appliances , and is fixing a broken one always better than buying new ? <p> After conducting extensive research , this is what I found : <p> Irons <p> Average lifespan : 7 years* <p> Irons run the gamut in pricing from as low as $20 up to about $180 . Generally , the higher the wattage , the more expensive the iron is . The amount of wattage the iron uses determines how hot the iron can get . The hotter it gets , the less time you 'll spend ironing each item . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut-off feature in the event you forget to turn it off , that will also have an effect on the price . When shopping for an iron , consider the features you really want . In this case , more expensive does n't necessarily mean higher quality . <p> Tips for getting the most out of your iron : <p> If you notice your iron not heating up as well as it used to , you will want to check the soleplate " the flat , metal surface , for limescale deposits . If you see crusty deposits , take a dry cloth and dip it in white vinegar then baking soda . In small circles , scrub the soleplate until it 's clean . <p> If your iron has a steam function , but it 's not steaming well , the holes may be clogged . Using a pipe cleaner or cotton swab , poke the holes in the soleplate to displace any blockage . When you 're finished , take a cloth dipped in vinegar and clean the soleplate . <p> If the iron stops working because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective to just buy a new iron . <p> Coffeemakers <p> Average lifespan : 6 years* <p> When it comes to coffee makers , usually the less moving parts , the higher the likelihood it will last . The new coffee makers with the digital readouts and programmable brewing times are great , but do n't expect them to last as long as your basic coffee maker . Simply put , if the bells and whistles do n't matter to you , the basic coffee makers will be just as good if not better . <p> Tips for getting the most out of your coffee maker : <p> The newer models may turn off automatically if not used for an hour or so , but the older models may require you to manually turn it off or unplug it . Allowing it to sit on all day may decrease its shelf life . <p> Filling the water reservoir beyond the fill line will create a minor annoyance when it overflows .

Run a solution of equal parts vinegar and water through the coffee maker . After that , run water through it to ensure the vinegar solution is gone . It 's also recommended that you should clean the coffee pot after every use with dishwashing liquid . <p> Blenders <p> Average lifespan : 7 years* <p> Have you been blender shopping recently ? If not , be prepared for sticker shock . Countertop blenders start at about $15 and go up to $500 or more for the ones you see being hawked at Costco and Williams-Sonoma . It all comes down to what you 're putting in the blender . If you intend on using the blender twice a year to make margaritas for your friends , go the less expensive route . On the other hand , if you intend on using the blender to mince whole pineapples , whip up peanut butter or puree meals every week , viewing the blender as an investment and thus spending more money might be worth it to you in the long run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blender of any price . Can you stash it in a cupboard when you 're not using it or is it so large that it will have to sit on your counter all the time ? How noisy will it be ? Do you have to hand-wash it , or is it dishwasher-safe ? Is the container glass , stainless steel or plastic ? There are pros and cons to each material . What is the warranty ? A one-year warranty is the absolute minimum . The more expensive or commercial-grade blenders should include a longer warranty . <p> Tips for getting the most out of your blender : <p> Clean the container and base after every use , but do n't immerse the base in water . Using anything more than a damp washcloth with soap may damage the electrical components in the base . Use a toothbrush to clean the buttons if you suspect food particles got in . <p> When washing the container , take it apart , and wash the individual pieces . If they are plastic or rubber , it 's better to hand-wash them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the rubber gasket that acts as a seal : After washing it , rub it with vegetable oil . This will help prevent cracking and ensure it keeps its texture . <p> Do n't fill the blender beyond what 's called the fill line . If you do , the engine is working harder than it is designed to and may burn out prematurely . <p> Not all blenders are designed to crush ice . If it does n't have a crush ice ' function , then do n't put ice in it . Just because a blender can handle a whole pineapple does n't mean it should all the time . Occasionally cutting food into manageable pieces before you put it in the blender will help it last longer . <p> Microwaves <p> Average lifespan : 8 years* <p> For the amount of technology that is found in microwaves , they are surprisingly affordable . Ranging from $40 to $260 , you can probably find one with the features you want at a price you can afford . <p> When looking at microwaves , they should all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . Anything under that and your food may not cook evenly and will take longer to heat . Consider the interior capacity of the microwave . Bring your largest microwave-safe dish to the store to see if the microwave will accommodate it . If not , you might want to consider a larger model . Note : Just because a microwave is larger on the outside does n't mean it offers more capacity . Lastly , where are you going to put it ? Countertop models are the least expensive followed by over-the-range and built-in microwaves . <p> If you have young children , consider buying a model with child-proof measures , e.g. , a 4-digit code has to be entered correctly to use it . Do you want the microwave to automatically adjust the temperature or time so it does n't overcook the food ? That 's an extra cost . Do you want pre-programmed buttons for popcorn , soup and baked potatoes ? That 'll be extra , too . <p> Tips for getting the most out of your microwave : <p> To clean your microwave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wait 5-10 minutes for it to cool down , remove the bowl and the interior can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth . <p> Do n't use abrasive scrubbers or powders to clean the microwave . A soft cloth or paper towel will do the trick . <p> Using the timer function on your microwave is fine , but do n't run the microwave without food in it . This can cause damage resulting in a costly repair . <p> If your microwave has a filter , consult the owner 's manual to determine if and when it should be replaced . <p> Vacuums <p> Average lifespan : 7 years* <p> Vacuums can range from very affordable to taking out a second mortgage-expensive . Why the chasm in price ? Features , quality of construction and efficiency can have a tremendous effect on the dollar amount . When purchasing a vacuum , consider the following questions : Are the floors bare , carpet or a combination ? Are there pet allergens ? Do you need a HEPA filter ? Are there stairs in your home , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do you want a vacuum with bags or do you prefer the bagless variety ? <p> Vacuums are absolutely one of those items you want to test-drive in the store . Throw some paper or dirt on the floor and see how it handles it . Take note of the type of flooring the vacuum does best on . Some are better on carpet , others on hardwood . Consider that generally , the less expensive the vacuum , the more plastic is used in construction and plastic tends to break easier . Good for your dorm room when you 're on a budget , maybe not for your new house when you 're thinking long term . Some people prefer vacuums with disposable bags because throwing away the bag is easy . Bagless vacuums are great because you do n't need to buy additional bags , but emptying them can create a mess if you are n't careful . <p> Tips for getting the most out of your vacuum : <p> Clean the air filter according to the owner 's manual .

If you do wait , the vacuum is working harder than if it was n't full and could overheat . <p> A few more tips <p> If an appliance does stop working , check to see what the warranty covers and for how long . Next , crunch your numbers to see if it makes sense to fix it or buy a new one . A general rule of thumb is not to spend more than 50% of the cost of a new appliance to repair an old one .

Although it 's tough to separate the myth from the reality of where 4:20 ( and 4/20 ) became synonymous with the drug , it turns out it started " extremely unsurprisingly " with some teenagers in the 1970s , and became widespread with a little help from the Grateful Dead . <p> Of course , marijuana remained solidly within the counter-culture from the 60s all the way to the 90s , when California became the first state to legalize its recreational use in 1996 .

If that fact is getting you down , it might be time to start looking into buying a home . There is a myth , especially with the millennial generation , that they ca n't afford to buy a home due to their bad credit , large student loan debt or simple lack of savings . Although there might be some work and time that needs to be put in beforehand , most people can usually buy with the help and guidance of a good real estate agent and informed lender . <p> Buying a home stabilizes your rent . When you lock in on a 30-year-mortgage on a single family home the only increase over time can be in the taxes . Not only is your payment set , but in the end you actually own your investment .

You will spend a lot of time with them and you should enjoy the time spent . You should also find them trustworthy and honest .

A great lender should be able to speak to you in terms you understand . <p> Currently buyers can purchase a home with as low as 3% down conventional using Fannie Mae if they are a first time buyer . In this case , first time buyer is defined as someone who has n't owned a primary residence in the prior 3 years . If you are part of a couple only one person has to qualify . Freddie Mac offers a similar program called Home Possible Advantage where buyers can do 3% down even if they are n't first time buyers . <p> The goal of both Freddie and Fannie is to make home ownership available to those who have strong credit and jobs , but have n't been able to save enough money for a down payment yet . FHA loans have lower credit limits and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only require $1,000 down . <p> CHFA is a great down payment assistance program that effectively grants people money . You do n't have to have perfect credit or even great credit . Not all lenders are approved to offer the CHFA program so if you think that might be the program for you , ask your real estate agent if they know a CHFA approved lender . Keep in mind that you have to take a one day class to qualify for the CHFA loan . I have found this class really is helpful to understand the home buying process . <p> In addition if you are military , VA loans are a great benefit offering people a chance to buy homes with no money down . <p> Finding and securing the right home <p> Once you have your financing in place , you and your Realtor can start searching for homes .

Doing a home inspection can save you thousands of dollars in the long run . If you are buying a single family home , you might want a general inspection , sewer scope , and radon test to name the most common . These can range in total from $400-$600 dollars . Often your agent can negotiate repairs based on these inspections .

@@43718451 @3718451/ <h> Paying For College Out of Pocket ? Read This . <p> The following is not advice . It is information about an option you have as a Colorado resident who is considering or attending post-secondary school and looking to save money . <p> Last year I opened 529 plans for my two nieces and nephew in lieu of birthday and Christmas presents . Over the course of the year I have been contributing to their plans , and recently thought about opening one for myself . If I were to pursue a graduate degree or take classes at the local community college , it would be nice to have money earmarked for education . <p> Not everyone had family members with the foresight and/or means to open a 529 when they were children . Fortunately , 529 plans have no age restrictions and you can open one for yourself . Nothing is preventing you from opening one now and taking advantage of at least one of its benefits " tax benefits , to be specific . <p> If I lost you , allow me to elaborate . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " usually for a child . Similar to a 401(k) , regular contributions are invested in hopes the account will grow and compound . When a beneficiary is ready for college , ideally the account will be worth more than the amount contributed . With a well-funded 529 , a student would be able to leave college with no or minimal student loans . <p> There are 48 states and the District of Columbia that sponsor 529 plans . Many can appear to be shades of the same color , however , they can be very different . Past performance , fees and investment options help the purchaser sift out the best contenders from the middle-of-the-road plans and the ones to be avoided . Most states allow non-residents to enroll in their plan(s) , but there may be perks to using your state 's 529 . In Colorado , you have three state-sponsored 529 plans to choose from , which are offered by CollegeInvest . <p> Historically , states like when its residents spend their hard-earned money in-state . To encourage this behavior , many states offer residents a tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 529 plan(s) . The tax break is usually not on the entire contribution though . The majority of states have a cap on how much of an annual contribution is tax deductible . For example , contributions to an Alabama 529 plan of up to $5,000 per year by an individual , and up to $10,000 per year by married taxpayers filing jointly who each make their own contributions , are deductible . Anything above their cap would not be tax-deductible . Not so in Colorado . <p> As a Colorado resident , you are allowed to deduct all of your contributions up to your taxable income . In other words , if your taxable income is $40,000 , you could theoretically contribute $40,000 to the 529 and receive a tax break on the entire amount . Only three other states offer anything similar : New Mexico , West Virginia , and South Carolina . <p> Another component of many 529 plans is a holding period ' . This mandatory waiting period is the amount of time the contribution has to sit in the 529 before it is withdrawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example . It is likely that there are several reasons for 529 plans to implement holding periods , one of which is to encourage parents to begin contributing early on in their child 's life . <p> What 's Colorado 's holding period ? Seven days . <p> What do these two features allow Coloradoans to do ? Make a contribution to the state-sponsored 529 and a week later pay their tuition bill with tax-free money . <p> Imagine this : It 's December and you have registered for classes that start in January . You open a 529 plan and contribute the tuition for the two classes you will be taking , plus money for materials , before the end of the year . <p> The second week of January you transfer the money you need from the 529 to your checking account to pay your tuition bill and purchase your materials . The distribution will be tax-free because it is being used for educational purposes . <p> When you file your state tax return in the spring , you will notice that the contribution you made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would save you 4.63 percent ( the Colorado state income tax rate ) . <p> It is the same percentage everyone pays regardless of income . You would save that percent of every dollar you put into the Colorado 529 plan and then used for college . <p> This opportunity is not limited to the month of December . You can do this anytime of the year . The drawback is that you will have to wait longer to use the tax deduction . I like the December/January arrangement because I can use the tax deduction sooner . <p> Let 's look at an example : <p> Michael is taking two classes and purchasing textbooks for his occupational therapy program . <p> By funneling the money through his 529 plan first , Michael will save himself $116.30 in Colorado income tax . <p> That could buy a dinner for two at a high-end restaurant .

It sounds unromantic , but a civil union gives us the peace of mind in knowing that Colorado now recognizes how much each of us has at stake . <p> There 's a financial aspect to having multiple ceremonies too . Weddings , no matter how simple you try to make it , can still cost an arm and a leg . Food , event location , flower , invitations , photographers all add up quickly .

If you 'd like to submit a guest post , email us at dimecontact@copera.org . <p> I have a confession to make . My first personal investment was ten shares of stock in Enron in late 2000 . In less than one year my ten shares ( also my life savings to that point ) were worth nothing . This is how I learned to love mutual funds . The following are four characteristics of mutual funds that can transform poor investors like me into good ones . I wish I had known about mutual funds before I had sent my life savings off to die . <p> According to a 2013 study by Fidelity Investments the average annual contribution into a 401(k) during 2012 was $2,733 or , $227.75 each month . When an investor goes shopping with that money , they are severely limited by both what is available for the money and the transaction costs associated with buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one half of a share of APPL . <p> In a mutual fund , the investor buys shares in the fund and not the underlying investments . New contributions are then pooled with the new contributions of thousands of other investors . This allows an investor access to a broad range of choices and reduces transaction costs based on the volume created by the pooled money . <p> Pooled resources allow for greater diversification . <p> Diversification is one of the pillars of a successful investment strategy . All investments have some type of risk attached to them and may react differently to the same market conditions . This includes investments that appear extremely similar . Outside of having a crystal ball , a broad diversification is the best defense against these risks , even when the two investments may appear identical . <p> Think of it this way : In the 1980s there were three companies that were defining the personal computer market . Tandy , Commodore International , and Apple Computers . As of today Tandy is barely in business and no longer makes computers , Commodore International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the most valuable companies in the world . Yet in 1980 it would have been difficult to know which was which . With the powerful diversification found in a mutual fund an individual investor would have had access to all three companies and spread the risk , realize the gains of the successful and minimizing the losses of the failures . <p> The investment strategy , research , and execution are handled by professionals . <p> Chances are that you are trained , paid and experienced in just about anything but investing . Active investing is difficult to say the least . Imagine sifting through the 2,800 companies that reside on the New York Stock Exchange alone . Finding the winning stock in that pile and at the right time takes serious time and energy . Mutual funds have a team of professionals whose sole job and training is to select investments that meet a previously agreed upon strategy . Is there still work to be done by the investor ? Of course there is . It is still up to the investor to make decisions in choosing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just does n't have to do the tough work of choosing the actual investments . <p> The fund management team can potentially make judgment calls about the underlying investments in a mutual fund . If the team noticed that Commodore Computers was no longer a good investment they can mitigate losses . If the team 's research indicates that Apple Computers is the next big thing , they can increase exposure to the future gains of the company . This all requires a specialized set of skills and access to a constant stream of information . <p> Mutual funds give the individual investor access to a broader spectrum of the investment world than they would have on their own . <p> The U.S. stock market only makes up about 33% of the world 's total stock market capitalization . There is a fair amount of growth to be had in the rest of the world these days . Yet , as an individual investor it is highly unlikely that one could affordably access these investments or even find them . Mutual funds may allow for investment in commodities like corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation to own and trade directly . A mutual fund can give an individual investor access to real estate portfolios that would require millions of dollars in capital on the open market . <p> The point here is that mutual funds allow an individual investor to further expand diversification principals while gaining access to areas of potential growth that they never would have had before , whether it is international , commodities , or real estate . <p> So what 's the lesson here ? <p> Through the use of mutual funds even the most amateur investor can remove some of the biggest mistakes a person can make when investing money . Mutual funds diversify by nature , they make sure the investor is getting the most bang for their buck , investments are picked by those who know what they are doing , and they offer access to previously inaccessible asset classes . Do mutual funds remove all of these risks ? Certainly not , but they give us amateurs a good start . 34982 @qwx444982 34983 @qwx444983

@@43718533 @3718533/ <h> A Savings Experience : 50 Years of Practice <p> A recent chat with my 20-something co-workers about the difficulties of saving forced me to reflect on my own 50 year experience . Once my shock dissipated ( I 'm over 50 ? ! ) , I wondered what I could pass along that would be helpful for them . <p> For me , saving started in 1964 when I was 5 years old with a hoard of quarters in a pink plastic piggy bank . My Depression Era parents took my sister and me downtown to open passbook savings accounts . Kindergarten me was not enamored with the notion of compound interest , but I was obsessed with doing everything my older sister did . <p> The account took on significance when I got an after-school job and started the ubiquitous " Saving Up for College " fund . Things went swimmingly for the next few years . <p> All ended when I felt the real cost of living during my freshman year of college . The account was gone , spent the first year on tuition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suede boots . A worthwhile investment overall ( boots not withstanding ) , but the rapid rate my money was depleted impressed hard on me the importance of saving . <p> After graduation , I got a full time ( albeit low paying ) job and opted to save into a new-fangled IRA account . I had no retirement target date expectations , but I did want to get back into a saving 's habit and the tax break attached to the IRA was very attractive . <p> In my thirties , I moved many times , had many different jobs , assorted roommates , and traveled . Saving any amount of money became harder and even though I continued to put funds away periodically , my overall savings dwindled . I 'll admit it , at one point all the IRA 's were cashed out .

@@43718540 @3718540/ <h> The True Cost of Being a Football Fan <p> Football season is well underway and I ca n't find a better way to spend a Sunday afternoon than sitting on the couch glued to my TV . I 've been a huge Denver Broncos fan for as long as I can remember and I never miss a game . <p> One afternoon during a particularly pathetic second quarter , I decided to try to multitask by updating my budget . This got me thinking -- how much money does it really cost to be a dedicated football fan ? <p> Here is my breakdown : <p> Football Team Apparel and Other Items <p> You are n't a true fan if you do n't have a vast collection of t-shirts , sweatshirts , hats , gloves , socks , coats , pajamas , and underwear covered in your team 's insignia . Officially licensed apparel is n't cheap , but because you love your team , you are willingly to spend $45 on a pair of socks or $300 on a jersey with your favorite player 's number ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next season ) . <p> Clothes are n't the only thing a football fan needs . They need logoed beer cozies , flags/signs , serving ware , and other miscellaneous decor . If you are n't surrounded by and dressed in your team 's logo , then you are , without a doubt , jinxing your team . Any football fan knows this fact , so spending tons of money on apparel and other items is an absolute necessity . <p> Snacks <p> You can not watch football , either on TV or in the stadium , without chowing down on a variety of snacks and guzzling your favorite beverage . It 's just another rule of football . Sometimes it 's as simple as a bag of chips and a can of soda . Other times , nothing will suffice except for a platter of hot wings , hot dogs , an extra-large pizza , and three pitchers of beer . Oh , and if your team is playing in the frozen tundra of Green Bay or Buffalo , then a bowl of chili is another must-have . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to be prepared for multiple refills and trips to the kitchen or concession stand . Also , if you are entertaining other crazed football fans at your home , be ready to feed an army . <p> Keep in mind that this is a weekly expense for 16 weeks ( not including pre-season or the bye week ) and if your team goes to the playoffs , then the expense continues and the quality of food should increase as your team advances . <p> Tickets <p> Single and season tickets are probably the most costly expense in a football lover 's budget . Single tickets to a Denver Broncos game start at about $55 per ticket in the nosebleed section and go all the way up to $360 per ticket for club level seats . <p> If you 're lucky enough to be able to purchase season tickets ( there is currently a waiting list ) , you 're spending anywhere from $450 to $3,500 for 10 home games . If you add in the cost of parking or bus fare , the cost is even higher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 70,000 other raucous fans after an amazing tailgate party ? Nothing really compares so , again , this cost is most definitely worth it . <p> Cable Subscription <p> If you happen to live in a different town or state than where your favorite team is , then you know how hard it is to catch every game on TV . <p> Without a premium sports package , you will most likely miss most of the games unless they are nationally televised . If you happen to like multiple teams or simply enjoy watching nothing but football for hours on end , then an upgraded cable subscription is a must . These premium packages come at , well , a premium , but if it 's the only way to catch every game , then sign up today ! <p> Heartache and Stress <p> There is nothing worse than watching your team take a beating . It causes serious pain when your team begins to crumble with numerous turnovers or struggles to even complete a pass . Then there is the stress of being down two points with three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attempt a 55-yard field goalin the snow . <p> All this heartache and stress certainly takes a physical toll and could perhaps translate into paying for anger management classes and depression therapy . <p> Fantasy Football <p> If simply watching football is n't enough for you , you may choose to participate in a fantasy football league . There are a lot of free fantasy football options , but if you want to monetize your favorite pastime , then signing up for a fee-based league with a cash prize at the end may be for you . <p> These fees can range anywhere from $1 to over $100 and some people choose to participate in varying types of leagues . Couple this with the amount of time spent researching players and building a roster , and fantasy football can get quite costly . <p> Getting Nothing Done for the Three Hours the Game is On <p> Unless your team is losing abysmally , there is simply no way to do anything else while you are watching the game . During this time , your family and friends should understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level other than gluing your eyes to the TV screen . <p> Being a super fan takes more than time -- it can also put a serious dent in your wallet . When you add up all that you 've spent on enjoying football over the course of a season , the cost may surprise you . <p> Yet , when your team is taking a victory lap around the stadium hoisting the Lombardi Trophy over their heads , you can be proud that your dedication and hard-earned cash helped them get there . <p> How much do you think you spend on being a football fan ?

@@43718541 @3718541/ <h> Save Time , Money , and Angst Through End-of-Life Planning <p> Death and taxes are famously touted as life 's only two certainties . But while most people spend considerable time and effort documenting and juggling tax matters , few focus on the end-of-life planning that could give them and their survivors peace of mind and help save time and money . <p> Here are some simple steps to consider in securing end-of-life plans , along with some ways to research them further -- all free of charge . <p> 1 . Plan for Possible Disability A common , often unspoken , fear for many is that their money will be frittered away by those around them if they become unable to handle their finances due to an illness or mental disability . A power of attorney for finances allows you to name a trusted person , called an agent or attorney in fact , to handle your financial matters if you become unable to do so on your own . See some typical wording for such documents by going directly to the source : your state 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your state , " probate code , " and " power of attorney for finances . " <p> A related fear is that in the case of incapacity , you might be denied or subjected to medical care you would find unsuitable . Advance care directives allow you to instruct health care providers about what life-prolonging treatments you want and do n't want if you become unable to express those wishes yourself -- and to name an individual to be sure those wishes are enforced . Ask your doctor or the patient representative at a nearby hospital or clinic to see the form used in your locale . <p> 2 . Consider an Estate Plan for Your Property The term " estate planning " sounds a bit intimidating -- or like a concern for only the richest of the rich . In reality , it involves the commonsense matter of finalizing one or more documents giving legal force to your wishes about where you want your money and property to go after you die . <p> A will is still the most common way to accomplish this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people die without one . In a will , you can specify : <p> Property you wish to leave to family , friends , and organizations . <p> A person to act as guardian and manage property for dependent children . <p> A personal representative or executor to manage your property at death , pay debts and taxes , and distribute what remains as you specify . <p> Whether you want to cancel any debts owed to you at death . <p> How outstanding debts and taxes should be paid . <p> Most wills must be filed with a local court , where their contents are available to the public . And many people hire lawyers or financial experts to help them through the probate procedure , which can amount to hefty fees . <p> But a will is not the only way . Other legal arrangements can pass ownership of property to others at death , avoiding probate . They commonly include : <p> A living trust , which operates much the same as a will but requires a bit more paperwork and management . <p> Joint ownership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means it will pass automatically to the named survivor when the owner dies . <p> Transfer or pay-on-death designations , in which bank , savings and loan , brokerage arrangement , or credit union accounts automatically pass to a named beneficiary at death . <p> Plenty of good , free information is available on these options at seminars , often offered through senior centers , chambers of commerce , and other local consumer groups . Beware , though , of presenters who seem to be using such seminars merely as " feeders " for their own businesses . <p> 3 . Record Your Wishes for Final Arrangements Final arrangements commonly associated with death -- including funeral or memorial services , burial or interment , and more -- are , ironically , among life 's most expensive purchases . <p> For this reason , many people join funeral or memorial societies , nonprofit consumer groups that help them find local mortuaries committed to dealing honestly and charging reasonable prices .

@@43718668 @3718668/ <h> Behind the Scenes : My Experience on a Home Improvement TV Show <p> I 've always enjoyed watching DIY home improvement shows for all the ideas they offer . Of course , I always thought the chances were extremely slim that I would have the opportunity to take part in one -- until , miraculously , it happened . <p> Ever wonder what it 's REALLY like to be on one of those shows ? How much is staged for the camera and how much is real ? Are the homeowners REALLY doing the work or is it all done for them ? Is the work and the materials of quality or is it cheaply done ? <p> Here is a peek into my experience . <p> A Basement in Need of Some TLC <p> We lived in our house for a couple years ; we had three small children and a basement that went unused . It was a dark and dingy place where the kids would n't go to play . We knew it could be a functional living space , but did n't have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids ' toys were scattered throughout the house -- the living room , the dining room , the kitchen . It was unsustainable . <p> We saw an ad on the news that an HGTV show was looking for homes to remodel in the area , so we applied to get our basement remodeled . We completed an application and included pictures . We were lucky to get past the first cut and had an interview . During the interview , we were filmed and the story was ideal for what they were seeking . We got it ! <p> Logistics , Prep Work , and Adjusting to the Cameras <p> Then came the legal speak . We had to be totally available for 5 days , and we had to completely open our house to upwards of 20 people -- all coming and going . We were told that our budget was $3,000 and we would have to cover any expenses over and above that . We talked about improvements that were possible and ones that were n't . When all of the particulars and the date were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we in for ? <p> The first day , a skeleton crew showed up with Carter , the show host to get the opening story filmed and staged . After introductions , they filmed the basement mess , the carpet stains , the toys around the house , and we were interviewed on camera . Then we were given instructions . Overnight we had to completely clear out the basement -- including the carpet . The painting crew came in the next day and laid down the base paint . <p> The work was doable , but the cameras were a bit more of a challenge . The first time that light comes on , is pretty intimidating to say the least . It takes a couple takes to relax and get it right . Luckily the director and film crew were very patient and understand that its nerve-racking with that big light in your face . <p> On the other hand , the host and his crew talked and behaved natural and spontaneous on camera . It was truly an art form . After the first day , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging that it 's all very natural . For the most part , scenes are filmed in one take . It helps that it 's a reality show , so mistakes are acceptable , but everything is pretty controlled and materials are set prior to a rolling camera . However , I can attest to the fact that the reactions during our reveal scene were NOT staged . It was the first time we saw the final product and our reactions were genuine . <p> The Ins and Outs of the Remodel and the Final Product <p> The bulk of the remodel took place over the next couple days and the crew that showed up this time was much larger -- carpenters , film crew make up , director 's assistants . While there was plenty of help , we actually worked the whole day . We made a table , drilled things , cut things , and filmed a lot . When evening came around , there was a whole list of projects that we had to finish on our own . With three small children to tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning hours . <p> On the final day , there was tension in the air . The director said we were WAY behind schedule and we could n't have cost overruns . We were sent away for a couple hours and told to return at 5:00 , so they could hopefully get all the extra work done . ( And throw in a few surprises . ) To be honest , we were nervous . The basement still had a lot to be done and the deadline was approaching fast . <p> We returned with huge anticipation . When we saw the final remodel , our expectations were more than met . It looked amazing . They turned this creepy basement into a playroom that was warm and fun . They created a desk cubby hole under the stairs for homework and to store art supplies , an amazing coffee table where board games can be kept , and they built a bed into the wall for the kids to relax and use for sleepovers . <p> A Look Behind the Scenes <p> Did we really do the work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cubby hole for the kids ' homework and art supplies . Yes , we really built a bed into the wall for the kid 's sleepovers . The trick is , a carpenter is standing over your shoulder , watching and helping , the screw holes are pre-drilled and everything is perfectly measured and cut to specifications . But there were a lot of cosmetic things , like painting , that we did on our own . <p> Was the quality up to par ? Yes . Ours was a small job and largely cosmetic . The coffee table is gorgeous , the lighting was fun and fit the mood of the room perfectly , the decorations were colorful , the wood that was used was of good quality and you can tell that time and care went into the process . <p> How much did we spend ? Every show is different . Some work on your budget alone , some give you the money and some have a little of both . Some like to surprise ' the home owners with cost overruns . We were given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget by about $1,000 . The crew communicated costs and opportunities well and there were no surprises . <p> In the end , we had a great experience and I could n't thank the crew enough for all they did . We still use the basement quite extensively today . The crew was very pleasant and the experience was a family treasure that we 'll hold for the rest of our lives . <p> Here are a few tips we took away from the show : <p> Go for Used Items There were a couple items that we were able to utilize that were used like a small cabinet purchased at a garage sale . <p> Utilize Bight Color Bright colors add life to a room . Our basement completely changed when we added yellow paint and some colorful stickers . <p> Try Inexpensive Lighting You do n't have to spend a lot on lighting .

@@43718689 @3718689/ <h> The Numbers That Say a College Degree Still Makes Financial Sense <p> The value of a college degree is a hotly debated topic in many families . It costs a lot and takes a huge financial and personal commitment to pursue either a two year diploma or four year degree . Just like evaluating any big purchase , we often wonder if it is worth it . <p> The CollegeBoard reported that in-state public school tuition for four year college increased 2.9% in 2013-14 . That was the smallest increase in 30 years . Two year colleges increased tuition by 3.5% last year . College cost skyrocketed over the past decade averaging 4.2% with the annual increases peaking at 8.5% in 2011 . <p> But this is only half of the question . The cost may be accelerating , but what about the benefits ? While it is impossible to place a value on education , there is a financial reward in terms of higher earning power for college graduates . <p> The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently released a study of the financial value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obtaining a four year degree in terms of tuition and fees paid as well as the opportunity costs of lost wages . These costs would be offset by expected higher wages over a forty year working life . To get a present value of these wages the flow of higher annual earnings was discounted to the present . <p> The value of a high education declined through the seventies and did not show any appreciation until the mid-eighties . For two decades a college degree paid big dividends in terms of higher expected wages . This trend reverses slightly after the recession in 2000 , maintained a level benefit through the following decade , and has recently slipped a bit . Over the thirty year time period the value of a college degree has risen from $100,000 to over $300,000 in present value dollars . <p> Looking at the value of the college degree in another way , the Fed examined how long the college graduate would have to work in order to recoup the costs of tuition , fees and lost wages . <p> Here the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . It takes about ten years to recoup the costs of a four year degree . Even though the cost of a college degree have skyrocketed , the time to recoup the costs has remained the same . The researchers attribute this to the increasing gap between wages of college educated workers and those with only high school diplomas . The college students incur costs to attend college in terms of tuition , fees , and forgone wages but once they graduate , the higher wage levels rapidly reimburse the graduates . <p> So that family argument over the cost and value of a college degree might focus on some helpful facts . While college costs have exploded over the past decade , the rapid acceleration has moderated and is showing signs of leveling off . In terms of value , two points emerge . First the value of the college degree has remained constant at about $300,000 over the working life of a graduate . Second , with higher expected wages , the payback period has remained constant at about ten years from graduation. 34982 @qwx444982 34983 @qwx444983

@@43718729 @3718729/ <p> This guest post was written by Stephanie Breedlove from Care.com . If you 'd like to submit a guest post , send us an email at dimecontact@copera.org . <p> When you hire someone to work in or around your home ( like a babysitter or nanny ) , you 're considered a " household employer . " In the eyes of the IRS , you 're now a business with an employee -- just without an accounting or HR department . <p> This can be overwhelming for some families , but actually , the tax rules in Colorado are very typical of most other states in the country . And the good news is that if the payroll and taxes are handled correctly , the federal government has ways for you to save money on your employer costs . <p> So take a look below for a " Tax Law 101 " overview for household employers in Colorado . <p> What Are My Tax and Legal Responsibilities ? <p> 1 . Treat your nanny , babysitter , etc. as an employee . There 's a common misconception on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can be given a Form 1099 during tax season to file their own taxes . Not true ! Not only has the IRS definitively ruled that this is incorrect , but they also consider the practice to be worker misclassification -- a form of tax evasion . And you do n't want to deal with a headache like that . Instead , prepare a Form W-2 and give it to your employee at year-end so they can use it to file their federal income tax return . <p> 2 . If you pay your employee $1,800 or more during the calendar year , you have tax responsibilities . This threshold is in place to not burden families who only have an occasional babysitter watch their kids -- and it will increase to $1,900 in 2014 . But if you need regular child care , you should withhold payroll taxes from your employee , including : <p> Social Security and Medicare ( FICA ) <p> Federal and state income taxes , based on how your employee fills out the federal Form W-4 . ( The same information will be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own W-4 . ) <p> Additionally , you have to pay employer taxes based on a percentage of the wages you pay your employee . <p> Social Security and Medicare taxes and federal unemployment insurance taxes ( four times per year to the IRS , along with the FICA taxes withheld from the employee ) <p> 3 . Prepare and file year-end paperwork . Along with giving a W-2 to your caregiver , you have to file Form W-2 Copy A and Form W-3 with the Social Security Administration and file a Schedule H with your federal income tax return . <p> 4 . Follow federal and state labor laws . Household employees are protected under the Fair Labor Standards Act , which means they must be paid at least the Colorado state minimum wage of $7.78 per hour ( higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 ) for the first 40 hours they work in a 7-day workweek and overtime ( time-and-a-half ) for any additional hours . The only exception to this rule is if you have a live-in employee --then you just pay your employee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Doing All This Work ? <p> Why do you have to go through all this extra paperwork and hassle ? First of all , it 's the right thing to do , from a legal standpoint . There 's never a worry about a legal dispute from a disgruntled former employee or an audit from the state or IRS when everything is handled correctly . But here are a couple of other benefits you get when you pay " on the books . " <p> 1 . Tax breaks offset the employer taxes . Most families qualify for tax breaks -- regardless of their income level -- when they pay on the books . There are two tax breaks available that can significantly decrease your tax costs . <p> Flexible Spending Account ( FSA ) : Also known as a Dependent Care Account , an FSA allows you to pay for up to $5,000 of child care expenses ( a caregiver 's wages qualify ) using pre-tax dollars . Because no Social Security , Medicare or income taxes are applied to this amount , most families save around $2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tax Credit ( IRS Form 2441 ) : You can save as much as 20 percent on up to $3,000 of child care expenses per child per year ( maximum of $6,000 ) . For most families , this tax break will save up to $600 for one child and $1,200 for two or more children . <p> 2 . Your employee is treated like a professional . When you pay on the books , your caregiver receives important short-term and long-term benefits , such as Social Security , Medicare , unemployment and an ability to obtain loans and credit . These benefits and protections have a dramatic impact on the perception of the position . When caregivers feel like they 're treated like professional workers , they tend to provide high-quality work and are more likely to stay with families for a long time . <p> So whether you hire a full-time nanny to care for your kids while you 're at work , or ask a babysitter to watch your kids during your regular Friday date night , make sure you 're crossing your t 's and dotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Stephanie Breedlove is the VP of Care.com Homepay , where she helps families to simplify and understand their responsibilities as employers of caregivers or household workers .

To me , this is equivalent to a year membership . It may be a bit more costly than a zoo , but the money goes to an amazing facility that does a lot of thankless work .

It 's less than $5 and is absolutely the best for adhering prosthetics , in my opinion . I use Ben Nye Spirit Gum , which is sold at pretty much every costume and Halloween shop ever . <p> INSIDER TIP : Use your index finger , and press/lift your skin and the prosthetic to make it tacky . The skin you 're applying the prosthetic to should actually stick to your finger . The prosthetic will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add another bit of Spirit Gum then apply the prosthetic . <p> STEP 3 : At this point you should have a sweet prosthetic with nasty or obvious edged .

We used a higher quality this time around ( guess I 'm a girl with high standards ) and I noticed the quilting showed through more than when I used the dollar store version last year . <p> STEP 4 : Glue the toilet paper to the edges of the prosthetic and to the skin . It 's okay ( or even better ) if it folds and crinkles . Let it dry completely . <p> STEP 1 : To make skin look like it 's puckered ( this is also great for a bite mark ) take one square of toilet paper , tear in in half ( diagonally is my preference ) , and roll both pieces with glue like worms . <p> STEP 2 : Apply glue to the area and glue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make this as narrow or wide as you 'd like . <p> INSIDER TIP : Use more glue than the picture below shows . <p> STEP 3 : Just like with the prosthetic , separate the ply and glue one piece over the whole shebang .

Place a layer of glue over everything ( otherwise the toilet paper will absorb most of your blood ) , let it dry , and apply the makeup . <p> INSIDER TIP : This is the base of any bruising , so remember to apply purple in places off of the wound too ( like I did onto the temples ) . <p> STEP 3 : Apply Green <p> CARRYOVER INSIDER TIP : If using a prosthetic , paint over it too !

As a student teacher I learned some of what student teachers need from their teaching mentors . <p> 1 . The ability to allow change into the classroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may work perfectly well for them , but a student teacher wants to try all the new tactics he or she has learned in their training . This may be a different style altogether from the mentor teacher . <p> In order to learn , the student teacher must be allowed to bring changes to the classroom and be allowed to fail . A good mentor teacher will allow the student teacher to take reigns of the classroom and allow them to learn from their mistakes . The mentorship comes in at the end of the day when the mentor/mentee relationship can flourish by discussing what went wrong , what went right , and how to handle certain situations . <p> 2 . The ability to allow the student teacher to develop relationships with the students . <p> When a teacher can develop relationships with a student and understand what makes that student tick , the process of learning begins . These relationships are vital for the experience of what it is like to be a true teacher . Do n't get in the way of these relationships . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and student . <p> 3 . The knowledge that their mentoring teacher is there for whatever they may need . <p> Few things are more challenging than your first teaching experience . There are so many emotions you go through during these three months , which is why student teachers need support in every way from their mentor teacher . This should come in the form of constructive criticism , advice on how the student teacher can be more effective , room for trial and error , and lots of listening . <p> We all want our kids to be taught by the best teachers and develop the kind of relationships I , and so many other people , have had with their teachers and coaches . The development of a good teacher starts with that first real student teaching experience . A bad or mediocre student teaching experience can be disastrous for all parties involved . The mentor teacher can either drive a person to take a different path other than teaching or be the driving force behind why that person becomes a great teacher and positively impacts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veteran teacher or brand new one , remember your experience as a student teacher and remind yourself of how important that first experience is for an up and coming educator. 34982 @qwx444982 34983 @qwx444983 
@@43718772 @3718772/ <h> Why You Should n't Save For Retirement <p> National Save for Retirement Week is a time to raise awareness about the importance for saving for retirement and a chance to reflect on where we are in the process . Employers who sponsor retirement plans will often use the week to begin a conversation about the process for starting a retirement account , adjusting outlooks , or increasing funding to a retirement account . <p> For me , this week is a time to consider what retirement means to me and how I 'm going to fund that vision . While things seem to be on track for my retirement , I still had concerns . I came to the realization that anyone who simply saves for retirement is n't going to make it . <p> While savings are an important component of a solid personal financial plan , savings , by their very nature , ca n't get the job done when it comes to reaching the long term goal of one day permanently leaving our jobs . So what do we do ? The key is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the world of personal finance the basic concepts of saving do not match-up with the requirements for retirement planning the way that investing does . See below : <p> To be fair , most Americans use the words save and invest interchangeably when it comes to retirement . So it would seem I 'm quibbling over words . Here 's the thing though , the reality is that investing serves a very different purpose in our personal finance plans , as you can see in the chart above . <p> Essentially , investing is the use of time ( long term goal setting ) in tandem with a higher risk/reward profile to outpace inflation and retain ( or even increase ) our standard of living decades in advance . By adopting an investment mindset , funding retirement can cost us less up front because of the growth while increasing our chances of hitting our goals than those who are simply saving . <p> An investment mindset has already applied to many of us throughout our lives .

It might have been to increase your education , obtain a certification , purchase equipment , take a relationship class , or have children . If you 're having trouble getting up the nerve , remember those times when you took an uncomfortable step and put in the work . <p> Life is full of investment opportunities . Retirement planning is no different . We have to understand the basics , use tools , and remain diligent in working toward our goals . This week , instead of simply saving for retirement , invest in it . Invest in the life of your future self and the life you imagine . When you did take those uncomfortable steps in the past , how did it turn out ? Was it worth it ? I bet it was and this will be too . <p> Check out these other posts on investing to help you invest in your future : 34982 @qwx444982 34983 @qwx444983
