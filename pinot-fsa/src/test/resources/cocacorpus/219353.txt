" Those are the first words of out Sam Anderson and David Matsler 's mouths on ' El Astronauta , ' The Quaker City Night Hawks ' electrifying debut album for Lightning Rod Records , and it 's the only introduction you 'll need . Over a viscid , bluesy slide-guitar , the band transports you to the sweltering Texas heat , a " land of oilfields , iron nightmares , and fevered dreams . " That song , " Good Evening , " plants the band 's flag firmly in the sand , simultaneously celebrating the pride of home and acknowledging the ominous clouds that hang over it , all while perfectly setting the stage for the raucous journey through time and space that follows . <p> The Night Hawks - Anderson and Matsler on vocals and guitars , Pat Adams on bass , and Aaron Haynes on drums - are a Southern band , to be sure , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our rock and roll . Equally influenced by ZZ Top and science fiction , they write of landscape both familiar and foreign , of a people working to she 'd their past but still burdened with its repercussions even in the distant future . <p> " Dave and I both pull from older artists when we write , " says Anderson , " but we 're trying to put a new spin on it . We 're harkening back to old Texas , but we 're writing about a new southern culture , maintaining the past and moving it on into the future . " <p> Eras collide in every aspect of the record , from the title - which merges Texas ' Spanish and Mexican roots with its role at the center of the modern space race - to its pop art cover , depicting a classic hot rod from the 70 's that 's been modified into a spacecraft hovering over an exotic desert landscape . Songs like " Mockingbird " play out as a classic-rock road warrior 's tale souped-up for the 22nd century , while " Liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a " space coyote " smuggling illegal immigrants on and off the planet . The track , which was engineered by Centromatic 's Matt Pence , is actually named for a real NASA mission from 1961 . <p> " At the time , it was the furthest into space that anything had gone , " says Anderson , a huge space travel junkie . " Upon reentry , it crashed into the ocean and filled with water and sunk down to the bottom . This thing had been as far out into space as you could go and as deep down into the ocean you could go , and that 's how the narrator of the song feels , he 's been as far out and as low down as you can get . " <p> The Quaker City Night Hawks have been far out there , but they 're anything but low down at the moment as they prepare for their first major foray into the national spotlight . Paste hailed the band 's " blues-infused southern " sound , while the Dallas Observer dubbed the " relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several of their songs were featured in the hit FX series Sons of Anarchy . Anderson was one of the first to invite fellow Ft . Worth-native Leon Bridges to perform during set breaks at his shows , and the two recently reunited to perform for an upcoming Danny Clinch documentary which was teased during the GRAMMY Awards , and dates with Chris Stapleton , Lucero , J Roddy Walston , and Whiskey Myers have solidified the Night Hawks ' status as one of the Lone Star State 's most exciting new acts . <p> " Our name is pulled from a Mark Twain book called ' The Innocents Abroad or , The New Pilgrim 's Progress , ' " explains Anderson , " where Twain , along with many other Americans , set out in 1867 aboard the chartered vessel Quaker City to see sites in Europe and the Holy Land . En route , he found that the only time his fellow passengers of varying religious backgrounds refrained from petty bickering and squabbles was when they met together at night to play cards , smoke , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawks . " <p> It 's a fitting moniker for a band that seeks to bring their audiences together every night onstage , but despite the group 's clear sense of identity , ' El Astronauta ' was almost a very different record , as they aborted an early recording session only to revisit the songs later with a new perspective . <p> " Usually Dave and I write the songs and then we record them a few weeks later , " explains Anderson , " but on this one , because we decided to re-record , we had the opportunity to incorporate them into our live sets for a while , and songs can change so much when you play them 100 times in different cities . " <p> " Our old studio habit was to get there and knock out as many drum and bass tracks in a day as possible , " adds Adams , " but this time around , we took the approach of trying to fully complete each song before moving on to the next , and that was a really good spark for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio . " <p> " There was definitely a gestation period , " reflects Matsler , " where we gave the songs time to develop on their own , and sometimes they changed pretty drastically . " <p> Change , and the need for it , is a central theme on the record , and one that weighs heavily on the bandmembers ' minds as they enter a new phase of adulthood . " Beat The Machine " is a protest song of sorts according to Matsler , not against any one particular war but against the military and prison industrial complex that seems to hold a vice grip over modern American politics , while the JFK-inspired " The Last Great Audit " grimly assures that we 'll " never walk through the gates of His promised land ' til we shake off our bloody ancestors ' blues , " and album-closer " Sons and Daughters " is a rollicking dose of secular gospel . <p> " That song caps the album because it 's about the realization that things are n't exactly right and they have to change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to be sad or morose . It 's a call-to-action to head out the door and change the world . " <p> " This whole record sums up that feeling when you finally start to realize that you 've been surrounded by bullshit , " adds Anderson with a laugh . " It 's immense and depressing at first to understand that things are n't the way people told you they would be growing up , but coming out the other side , you see everybody else is in the same boat . We 've been lied to for a long time , but now it 's time to figure it out and move on and do something about it . " <p> For the Quaker City Night Hawks , that means getting onstage and singing their hearts out every night . This is n't the South of their fathers , nor is it the America they 'd been promised growing up , but we 're all in it together , and maybe , by the time souped-up hot rod spaceships are cruising between planets , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Quaker City and put aside our differences long enough to make life just a little better for everybody .

That expression drills right to the heart of the New York singer-songwriter 's proper introduction , a mission statement both artistic and personal . <p> On its surface , the title track talks about being a touring musician and figuring out how to see your partner , looking at the calendar and calculating how you 're going to spend time together . But " Emotions and Math , " which ATO Records will release on June 17 , also sums up an epiphany she had while making the record . <p> " In a lot of ways , it 's kind of how I operate , " says Glaspy .

She had plenty of practice ; having recorded demos of the album twice at home before eventually ironing out the wrinkles at Sear Sound studios in New York . Glaspy auditioned her players and kept the sessions brisk and loose , running through songs a few times with musicians still reading the charts she had written out .

" I think a lot of times kids are pigeonholed as being kids , but at the same time it 's the most important years of their lives , " Glaspy says . " Our view of ourselves is so paramount , and when it gets messed with at a young age , it 's lethal . " <p> The closing " Black Is Blue " is a poetic ode to accepting a reality you never knew .

" As a fan of Hamilton 's voice in the Walkmen , I 'd been wanting to capture it in ways it had n't been captured before -- to make songs with him that placed the crooner right beside the howler , the screamer beside the whisperer -- to try to leave no stone unturned in terms of how we should approach the delivery of a song .

@@23588434 @3588434/ <h> Saint Motel <h> Details <h> Added By <h> 180 Fans <h> Link <h> Bio <p> The year before making their breakthrough with a mainstage performance at Coachella and the chart topping single " My Type , " Saint Motel had planned to host an event of their own called " saintmotelevision " -- a multimedia spectacular of music , dance , comedy , art , and more that was shut down by authorities before it even took place . " That crazy mixture of worlds and ideas is something we 've always gravitated toward , " says front man A/J Jackson in reflecting on the original saintmotelevision . " We 've always been fans of strange combinations , and that glorious yet doomed event became a symbol of all that . " So when it came time to create their forthcoming full-length debut for Elektra , the band reclaimed the name saintmotelevision and , in the end , dreamed up an album as magnificently kaleidoscopic as that mythic party itself . <p> Featuring production from the likes of Lars Stalfors ( Cold War Kids ) and Tim Pagnotta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson , in and around the band 's own studio in downtown L.A. -- ' saintmotelevision ' builds off 2014 's ' My Type ' EP with a sound even more expansive and artfully genre-blurring . And with its effervescent melodies and shapeshifting grooves , the album emerges as a beautifully alchemized piece of alt-pop , every bit the " channel-surfing odyssey " its namesake was meant to be . <p> Lead single " Move " serves as ' saintmotelevision ' ' s opening track , a psych-rock-tinged dancefloor anthem with a chorus so catchy that -- during Saint Motel 's raucous sets at summer festivals like Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo -- audience members instantly shouted along despite never having heard the song before . In the lyric video for " Move , " Saint Motel have also unveiled their latest undertaking as a decidedly visually-oriented group : the so-called " virtualizer , " which combines 360- animation and virtual reality technology that allows each viewer a chance to experience the music in a fully immersive manner . <p> Throughout ' saintmotelevision , ' the band transforms their infinite inspirations into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Getaway , " for instance , Saint Motel shape their fascination with Donna Summers ' " I Feel Love " into a shimmering , intensely charged pop number powered by massive piano riffs . With " Destroyer " ( as in " I do n't break hearts , I destroy them " ) , the band echoes the seductive danger in the song 's lyrics by bringing in some fantastically trashed-up horns a la ' Exile on Main St. ' -era Rolling Stones . Meanwhile , on " Sweet Talk , " Saint Motel channel Iggy Pop-inspired swagger into a stomp-and-clap-driven heavy-hitter destined for sing-along status . <p> Just as inventive in its lyrical element , ' saintmotelevision ' brilliantly twists together melancholy and levity in songs like " Local Long Distance Relationship ( LA2NY ) " ( a brightly wistful meditation on love in a social-media-crazed era and on being with " someone who 's physically there with you but mentally far away , " according to Jackson ) . One of ' saintmotelevision ' ' s starkest moments , " Born Again " calls on an L.A.-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Born Again ' rides the line between two worlds , so you ca n't really tell which way to take it . " And on " For Elise , " Saint Motel play on the mystery of Beethoven 's immortal beloved by paying rhapsodic tribute to the legendary muses behind songs like the Kinks ' " Lola " and Lou Reed 's " Walk on the Wild Side . " <p> Passion for eclecticism has always been at the heart of Saint Motel , a band founded by Jackson and guitarist Aaron Sharp : film-school classmates whose longtime friendship had its roots in a shared appreciation of obscurist cinema and mutually adventurous musical tastes that include everything from Imperial Teen to Beethoven 's 7th Symphony , 2nd Movement . After bringing bass player Dak Lerdamornpong and drummer Greg Erwin into the fold , the band released their debut EP ' ForPlay ' in 2009 and began hosting a series of " experiential concerts " with such themes as Zombie Prom and Judgment Day . " We played in half-pipes , semi-trucks , circuses -- pretty much anywhere we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what we could to push ourselves beyond our comfort zone , and give people some kind of big , crazy experience whenever they came to see us . " <p> Thanks in part to those one-of-a-kind live shows -- and to their critically acclaimed , independently released 2012 full-length debut ' Voyeur ' -- Saint Motel steadily built up a devoted underground following throughout their early years . Releasing the ' My Type ' EP in summer 2014 , the band saw their fan base grow exponentially as the title track became a top 10 alternative radio smash , with both the song and its companion video ( directed by Jackson himself ) each collecting streaming figures in the tens of millions , and counting . <p> Now set for a fall headlining tour -- with their past tours including support slots for Arctic Monkeys , Imagine Dragons , Band of Skulls , and Weezer -- Saint Motel have discovered a new outlet for their boundary-breaking brand of artistry .

This is a whole new way to do that , where we 're letting people walk into the album and then just live inside it for a while . " 
@@23588437 @3588437/ <h> Sylvan Esso <h> Details <h> Added By <h> 204 Fans <h> Link <h> Bio <p> Sylvan Esso - A biography <p> Sylvan Esso was not meant to be a band . Rather , Amelia Meath had written a song called " Play It Right " and sung it with her trio Mountain Man . She 'd met Nick Sanborn , an electronic producer working under the name Made of Oak , in passing on a shared bill in a small club somewhere . She asked him to scramble it , to render her work his way . He did the obligatory remix , but he sensed that there was something more important here than a one-time handoff : Of all the songs Sanborn had ever recast , this was the first time he felt he 'd added to the raw material without subtracting from it , as though , across the unseen wires of online file exchange , he 'd found his new collaborator without even looking . <p> Meath felt it , too . Schedules aligned . Moves were made . And as 2012 slipped into 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Durham , N.C. , a former manufacturing town with cheap rent and good food . Sylvan Esso became a band . A year later , their self-titled debut -- a collection of vivid addictions concerning suffering and love , darkness and deliverance -- arrives as a necessary pop balm , an album stuffed with songs that do n't suffer the longstanding complications of that term . <p> These 10 tunes were realized and recorded in Sanborn 's Durham bedroom during the last year , an impressive feat considering the layers of activity and effects that populate them -- the dizzyingly crisscrossed harmonies of " Play it Right , " the gorgeously incongruous elements of " Wolf , " the surreptitiously minimalist momentum of " HSKT . " Sanborn 's production is fully modern and wonderfully active . He enlists obliterating dubstep stutters and crisp electropop pulses , hazy electrostatic breezes and epinephrine dancefloor turnarounds . <p> But this is n't a workout in production skills or a demonstration of electronic erudition . Instead , his music syncs seamlessly with Meath 's melodies , so that the respective words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey Mami " webs handclaps and harmonies around a flood of bass , a strangely perfect canvas for a tale of dudes hollering at neighborhood tail ( and , finally , finding the chivalry not to do so ) . " Coffee " sparkles and quakes , patiently rising from a muted spell of seasonal affective disorder to a sweet rupture of schoolyard glee . These pop cuts condescend neither to their audience nor their makers . They are sophisticated , but with none of the arrogance that can imply ; they are addictive , but with none of the banality that can entail . There is sensuality and sexual depravity , homesickness and wanderlust , nostalgia and immediacy . Sylvan Esso acknowledges that the world is a tumult of complications by giving you a way to sing and dance with those troubles , if not to will them away altogether . <p> When Meath and Sanborn talk about Sylvan Esso , they come back to context -- to how , before this project , they felt that their solo endeavors often felt short of it , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a concern . When Meath sings to Sanborn a melody that she 's conjured and captured , he almost instinctively knows how to respond . And when he delivers to her the backbone of a wordless beat , she adds lyrical bait where he 'd only seen white space . Sylvan Esso represents the fulfillment of their fortuitous encounter by , once again , linking parts that too often come stripped of their counterparts . Here , motion comes with melody . Words come with ideas . And above all , pop comes back with candor.

As she sang her first song in public , Bishop fell instantly in love with performing , and her auspicious debut served not only as an indelible touchpoint , but also the initial indicator of an unmistakable identity . <p> Born to Scottish parents , raised in Japan and Hong Kong , immersed in American pop-culture , and having attended college in Hollywood , Bishop is a true world citizen .

Composed in bedrooms , and destined for festival tents and arenas , Bishop claims her music comes from a place of sadness , though it might be more accurate to say it comes from a place of substance . While the words themselves are direct and precise , they encompass grand emotions which are deeply personal yet rendered in a way that invites listeners to project and examine their own experiences ; is n't that what music is supposed to do ? <p> What unequivocally distinguishes Bishop is there is no duality -- no difference between Bishop the person and Bishop the artist -- they are one in the same . There is no construct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the defiance of " Wild Horses " or the rapture of " River , " they are all inspired by what she calls " the biggest , most toxic and tragic love affair I 've ever had " : her lifelong commitment to music . <p> Bishop is not offering merely a piece of her heart -- she 's giving you the whole thing .
