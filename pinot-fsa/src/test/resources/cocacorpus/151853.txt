@@98346552 @2546552/ <p> The idea of creating and using buyer personas is not new " it 's become part of B2B marketing 101 . Developing them is a natural step in creating a marketing strategy . <p> Afterall , you ca n't really effectively market to your audience if you 're not sure what drives them , what they 're interested in , and what makes them tick . Without personas , you 're really just guessing at what your audience cares about , and end up in situations where you 're an example of a bad #marketingfail . <h> Seeing Beyond the Persona <p> The problem is that personas as they exist today are static . They are profiles that we create , albeit with significant research and justification , but they are n't dynamic . Sure , best practice is to update personas on a regular basis , but even in ideal world , we 're missing a big piece of the puzzle . <p> Personas are not actual buyers . B2B buyers are real people , whose needs and interests may be aligned with a specific persona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running to meetings , checking items off their to-do lists , dealing with whatever the day 's fire drill is , etc . <p> The benefit of personas " having a go-to profile of your buyer you can reference " has a built in flaw . They are static , living on paper and not in the real world . <p> To effectively market to personas , you need to consider another element : time . It 's not just about providing the right message to the right person , but also providing that message to them at the right time . You need to provide content to your audience not only based on their specific persona , but also based on funnel stage . <p> Without personas , you 're really just guessing at what your audience cares about <h> Considering Funnel Stages <p> Most marketers are good at thinking about content by persona , or at connecting content against a specific funnel stage . However , we are not so great at looking at both of those together . <p> Why is this important ? Because a buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on where they are in the funnel . And if you 're not considering this , you may end up giving your audience something irrelevant . <p> For example , just because your IT stakeholder persona typically likes content that 's heavy on tech specs , they may only care about that information at a later funnel stage , vs. early on in the process . <p> We should be combining both dimensions together to consider both persona , and that persona 's role in the funnel stage and then develop content to address what they need to hear from us , at that stage in the buying cycle , based on their involvement in the stage . <p> - <h> Multi-dimensional Persona Maps : An Example <p> So how does it actually work ? What does this multidimensional approach look like ? <p> - <p> - <p> This is an example of a persona map , layered across different funnel stages .

It 's easy to fall into the trap of requiring content for each persona at every stage . <p> For example , in this map , Phil Finance is actually not really part of the buying process until Stage 2 , so there 's no need to create content to engage him there . <p> Instead , this team should focus on developing content for him where it matters , later in the process at Stages 3 &amp; 4 . <h> Trying It Out Yourself <p> Want to try your hand at creating your own multidimensional persona map ?

Prioritizing text over content <p> Interactive ebooks offer so many more ways to engage ( and convert ) readers- than traditional PDFs . Think of text as a supplement to the interactive content . Your words should be kept to a minimum while letting visual and auditory- content do most of the talking . <p> Some experts suggest keeping the ebook copy shorter than a typical blog post - around 800 words or less . <h> Use rich images and audio to condense complex concepts. - <h> #2 . Forgeting the call-to-action <p> Like any piece of content , your interactive ebook should provide a clear next step to help guide readers further into the funnel. - The type of CTA you use- will depend on which stage in the funnel your content targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog post that explores the topic from a different angle. - <p> Middle funnel : Invite readers to explore and interact with your product to better evaluate it as a solution to their problem. - <p> You may want to consider placing a variety of CTAs throughout the ebook and A/B test- them to see which ones convert better . Experiment with positioning , triggers , messaging and design elements to find a winning combination. - <h> #3 . Stop thinking in PDF-mode <p> Ebooks , whitepapers , checklists and other PDF documents have been a cornerstone of the marketing mix since the 1990s . For most of us , they are familiar and relatively simple to create . A comfort zone that comes major limitations. - <p> While PDFs have been used to bring books , magazines and other ofline assets into the digital world , - they provide a very linear reading exprience . It looks and feel like a textbook - intro , table of contents , some pretty images and links out to external content on third party platforms. - <p> While this structure works ok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So : <p> Do n't make the mistake of thinking about your interactive ebook in the context of a traditional PDF . You 'll end up with a " me-too " one-way reading experience . <p> Instead , think of it as a blank canvas . Your imagination is the limit. - Utilize images , videos , audio , interactive data and animations to tell an engaging story . Traditional plain text should only be used to support the visual elements . If readers want to drill deeper into specific topics , enable it through interaction , not walls of static content. - <p> Which brings me to the next point ... <h> #4 . Visuals are NOT an afterthought <p> Creating a traditional static PDF is a pretty straight-forward process : <p> 1 . Brainstorm some topics 2 . Research the subject 3 . Put together a draft4 . Add image to support the text 5 . Proof and publish - <p> I bolded point #4 for a reason . <p> See : <p> When creating interactive ebooks , a lot of marketers make the mistake of thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creating interactive content does not work this way . Instead of thinking of visuals as a contextual add-on , you need to make them a centerpiece. - <p> Start with a visual concept for your topic , and add text to support. - The key here is to ensure visuals are not an afterthought . <p> - <h> Ready to Create Your First Interactive Ebook ? <p> While ebooks are still a critical component of the B2B marketing mix , they have become saturated . In a world where readers are drowning in content , and our attention spans are getting - shorter , marketers are looking for new channels and content types to cut through the noise . Therefore , it 's not surprising- more than- 75% of marketers are investing more in interactive content . And , ebooks are a big part of that mix. - <p> While interactive ebooks follow similar overarching principles to the traditional PDF , there are differences . But , do n't let those deter you from making the leap into the visual world of interactive content .

@@98346580 @2546580/ <p> The thinking goes that if traditional , static content is a monologue , delivering information to an audience without needing or even asking for their input , then interactive content is instead a dialogue since it requires the users to actively participate . <p> That 's certainly true , and it speaks to the key value of interactive content , but simply stating that interactive content is a dialogue only scratches the surface of what it can do . After all , there are many types of dialogues , from friendly conversations to professional interviews to outright interrogations . <p> Not all of these are equally appealing , so it 's important when creating interactive content to think about what kind of dialogue you 're inviting your audience into . <p> This is where personalization can add a tremendous amount of value . <p> The word personalization ( like the word dialogue ) can mean many things .

For example , you could put a lead form at the beginning of the content that includes a field for the user 's name . Once they 've filled that form out , you can refer to the user by name in any text that appears along the way , creating a more personalized user experience . <p> A user 's name is one of numerous possible pieces of information that can be pulled into the rest of the experience , including any other lead data or answers to individual questions . <p> No matter what text you use and how you use it , the value for the user is that they feel listened to and more directly engaged with .

Let 's say , for instance , you have two different verticals to which you market your products or services , and you want to provide each with its own unique messaging and CTAs within a particular piece of interactive content . You could begin by asking each user to choose which vertical they fall under , and then use their answer to send them down a different path with its own follow-up questions , results , and so on . <p> Or maybe you have a particular whitepaper that you only want to offer as a download for users who have a specific need , because otherwise the content of the whitepaper wo n't apply to them . Again , you can ask them whether or not they have that need . If they do , you can immediately offer them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can move them through to the next step of the experience and give them access to different assets later on . <p> Where conditional text repeats back to a user info they 've already given , conditional content can actually individualize how your interactive content responds to the audience members , giving them only the questions and assets that apply to them and leaving out less relevant pieces . It makes the content more targeted and resonant , and allows you to reuse the same interactive piece for multiple audiences or segments . <h> Custom Download <p> At the end of an experience , the user gets their result , be it a maturity score or an ROI calculation or whatever the key value prop of your interactive content might be . But what comes next ? How do you expand on that result or talk about potential actions they can take in the future ? And how will the user remember the result they got , or how they got it , or what recommendations or CTAs you offered them as part of it ? <p> All of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download ( usually a type of - document ) , providing them with a tangible takeaway from the experience . This could simply be a review of the questions they answered and the result they received , or it could be something more in-depth , actually offering feedback , advice , and suggested next steps based on those answers or results . <p> Before we wrap this up , how about a chance to see personalization in action ? Take a minute to click through the experience below and notice the ways in which its messaging and content change based on how you respond to each question along the way : <p> Pretty cool , right ? By having the content react to your behavior , it feels much more like you 're actively participating in a conversation with it , rather than simply sending information about yourself into a vacuum . <p> Obviously , that experience above was just fluffy and fun , but the same ideas can be applied to any content to make it resonate more powerfully with the target audience(s) .

No matter how small or large your team is , optimizing content can generate the same or even more leads than brand new content . <p> In a study from HubSpot , one marketer managed to double the amount of monthly leads from the blog by optimizing old posts . Double . That 's a lot of new leads . They also increased organic search volume by 106% . Conversion Rate Optimization or CRO is the future of marketing and can be implemented across all channels . <p> We are going to walk through the steps required to run experiments , get results , then implement them to improve CRO for landing pages , email , social , or any medium that allows for experimentation . <p> Step 1 : Identify Your Objective <p> What are you hoping to learn from this experiment ? Take a moment to thoughtfully come up with the objective for your experiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you will determine if the experiment was successful . <p> Not all experiments need to be quantitative ( numbers-based . ) You can use experiments to map your buyer personas or find your brand 's voice .

Typically , you will keep one control , meaning the element that remains the same throughout the experiment . This is how you will prove the test 's effectiveness . Then , you can create a variation ( or multiple variations ) to test against the control . Do n't forget to track everything . <p> Fail means that your hypothesis was incorrect , inconclusive means that you did n't have enough data to draw a conclusion , and success means that your hypothesis was correct .

If a tweet is posted and nobody clicks , replies , or retweets it , does it even matter ? <p> Instead of simply following vague advice like ' Curate content ' and ' Listen and participate in the conversation ' ( true as they may be ) , you can be more strategic about the timing and overall effectiveness of the content that you put out . <p> Here are some top analytic findings from around the web that can help you hit your Twitter conversion goals . <h> 1 . Tweet links slower . <p> Ever see a series of headlines and links coming out of the same Twitter user all at once ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slow down , personalize headlines so that they 're easily distinguished , and do not link your RSS feed to auto-populate your account . Try to space your tweet types out " a few links , a few retweets , and a few original thoughts all in a mix that feels natural . <p> The faster the speed links are posted , the lower the clickthrough rate , according to Zarrella 's research . <h> 2 . Be clear . <p> No one likes the guy who unnecessarily beats around the bush and uses jargon that means nothing to you . Tweets that have clear , concise language with an identifiable offer receive 18% more clicks and nearly 30% more retweets than tweets without a clear message , according to Patel 's research . - - - <p> When you tweet , make it perfectly clear exactly what you 're saying and exactly what a user might find if he or she clicks on the link . You 'll get a more focused group of people to your content " no surprises , no gimmicks . <p> - <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that use familiar Twitter lingo tend to have higher click rates . Using ' via ' , @ , and RT can lead to higher clickthrough rates than tweets without those common phrases . Hashtags do n't tend to make a difference on whether a tweet lands , according to Zarrella 's research . Another important word to use ? ' Please , ' which also has a marked impact on clickthrough rate . Marketers and advocates make hundreds of requests to an individual each day ; being polite can make a difference ! <h> 4 . Use the paper.li system . <p> If you 're tweeting about a specific niche category , you might consider using paper.li , a tool which can help you curate the day 's topic-relevant social conversations into a daily ' newspaper . ' <p> Some of the most commonly shared tweets were of paper.li content . Those tweets all take on a familiar structure : " The Subject Daily is out today ! URL " It can be hard to personalize and take ownership of the dissemination of the paper but there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> - <h> 5 . Use action words . <p> Just like in all good web and copy writing , leading users to actions with verbs is more effective than overwhelming them with nouns . You ca n't avoid nouns but try to talk about things in a way that inspires movement and interaction . <h> 6 . Tweet on the weekends and later in the day . <p> It 's common sense : most businesses execute their social media strategy during the American workday . The problem ? Practically no one limits their use of the Internet , social media , or Twitter to weekdays . <p> Weekends and evenings are often ripe for brands and businesses to get their message across with a little less density in the way . That being said , make sure you know when your specific audience is online . Tweeting at 3 a.m. may give you a large playground to work in , but it 's a waste of time ( and sleep ) if no one 's actually there . <p> Do your research before you send off those late-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics . <p> Trending topics are great venues into the conversation on Twitter " you 're discussing something that has already been vetted as popular and worth discussing ! For businesses , it depends what the topics are and how they fit your brand 's image . <p> If you 're a quirky , modern company , it might be appropriate to be witty and enter into a pop culture trend . In almost all circumstances , avoid disasters and controversial topics in the news , though . Social media backlashes often occur when businesses jump in on the wrong trending conversations . <p> Always think before you tweet . <h> Convert Confidently <p> Though it can be helpful to follow a somewhat formulaic routine when executing your social media strategy , it 's not always best to follow this recipe each and every time . One of the best parts about social media is its spontaneity " anyone can say anything at any time .

@@98346674 @2546674/ <h> Instagram for Brands <h> Instagram for Brands <p> Major brands are beginning to use Instagram , the mobile photo-sharing app that has gone well beyond stylized photos of brunch to become a bona fide social media hit . Since its launch in October 2010 , the Apple-only service is home to 15 million users and more than 400 million uploaded photos . The company recently announced its plans for an Android release , which means growth will only continue . Just as Twitter serves as an instant customer service tool , brands are using the unique features of Instagram for a multitude of reasons : to forge a more personal bond with their audience , to run contests and campaigns , and to collect crowd-sourced photo content . There are about 200 brands currently using the service , according to the company . Here 's a sampling of how they 're using Instagram to connect with customers : -General Electric , which has about 34,000 followers on Instagram , uses the platform to highlight the company 's work behind the scenes . The company is one of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Photos of engines , research labs , solar panels , and technicians show the scale and impact of the company 's work in fields like energy and transportation . It 's also interacting with more of its audience , sending an Instagram contest winner to Wales to photograph an aviation facility . Close to 4,000 photos tagged #GEInspiredMe were submitted for the campaign . -The biggest brand on Instagram , Starbucks , has more than 200,000 followers . Tens of thousands of photos have been tagged #starbucks , and the beverage brand has tried to branch out by sending out photo requests so users take their photos beyond the coffee cup . -NBC News shares great off-the-air shots from interviews , news rooms , and offsite shoots . -Levi 's is currently asking would-be models to submit their photos on Instagram with the tag #IAmLevis for consideration . -Puma : The sportswear brand sent 10 bloggers to Abu Dhabi a few weeks ago to cover the Volvo Ocean Race and the Mar Mostro racing yacht the company is sponsoring . -Instagram is n't just for major brands , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has cultivated a niche , loyal audience with the help of the platform . Along with posting photos of its clothing , it also post inspirational vintage swag and aggregate photos from the community of similar items . Now that you have a few ideas on how brands are using Instagram , here are a few tips for how you can make it work for yours : 1 . Capture images that go beyond the brand label . It may sound obvious , but posting photos of Starbucks coffee cups wo n't be enough to engage with your audience . To move past that , Starbucks started asking users to take photos inspired by different prompts and tags , like what they would do with five minutes of free time . Visually appealing lifestyle photos are what work best on the platform . 2 . Post consistently and deliberately . Do n't ever flood your stream with posts . Even if you 're taking a lot of quality shots from one place , pace posts out throughout the day so as not to overwhelm. 3 . Get the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-way conversation started . Encourage user-generated photo competitions and allow the community to judge the best ones for itself . With Instagram 's tagging , you can track a campaign 's success easily . 4 . Develop a few regular tags or themes . To encourage your users to think of tagging you without you having to ask , come up with a few branded or themed hashtags they can attach . NH Hotels consistently posts morning shots as #wakeuppics . A few regular ' feature ' tags can help you plan your photos as well as get similar audience involvement back to you . -

This allows you to take the device variable out of the equation and ensure your SnapApp is captivating no matter how it is viewed . <h> How it Works <p> With SnapApp , responsive design is handled by setting up different Displays within the Builder . A Display is a unique rendering of your SnapApp with a different Canvas size . The Canvas size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devices you are looking to target . The content can then be adjusted and styled for an optimal experience at each size . <p> For instance , this Display is set up for a widget size of 520px x 520px , which looks great on desktops : <p> On a mobile device , viewing a SnapApp with these dimensions would require scrolling and zooming " not an optimal user experience . <p> To fix that , we can adjust this SnapApp by creating a new Display for it in the Builder with a more mobile-friendly Canvas size , 320px by 520px : <p> Once you have these displays set up , your SnapApp will automatically resize to fit the device your visitor is using . <h> How to Set Up Your Displays <p> Your SnapApp can have as many displays as you need to meet your users ' device preferences . All of your Displays can be- added and configured within the SnapApp Builder on the Global Display menu in the Page Manager , accessed via the gear icon next to the Display name dropdown menu . <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width , - rename the Displays for easy navigation when building , and change the styling per Display , such as a unique background and border . <p> Adjusting the content is done on the Canvas itself . Once you 've focused on each Display , changes you make to the content and styling will only affect that Display . <p> To quickly switch which Display the Builder is focused on , a drop-down menu is available next to the gear to open the Global Display menu . In this screenshot , the Builder is focused on Display 3 . This drop-down is also available when previewing a SnapApp so you can quickly see how the live version will look across all Displays : <h> Adjusting Viewport Width <p> Once you 've configured your Displays and adjusted your content to fit each size , you 'll need to set the viewport width for the additional displays . This is located at the top of each Display 's section in the Global Display menu . <p> The viewport width determines which version of the SnapApp the user is seeing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has to know when to do this . Switching from one size to another is based on the viewport width you 've entered for each display . <p> When setting your viewport width , you 'll want to make it equal to or slightly greater than the width of the SnapApp for that Display . In the above example , the mobile Display has a widget size of 320x520 and a viewport width of 350px . That means that if a user is on a page width of 350 pixels or smaller , they will see the mobile Display ( 320x520 ) . If they are on a page with a width 351 pixels or greater , they will see the default Display of 520px x 520px . <p> You can easily see how this all functions by viewing your SnapApp on a desktop and dragging your browser 's width smaller and smaller , which will show the SnapApp switching between displays . <p> There you have it !

As a result , rather than sticking to static text , as a whole , marketers are realizing that visuals are a way to quickly and easily share ideas and concepts ( as images are interpreted 60,000 times faster than text . ) <p> But interactive content goes a step beyond mere visuals . It makes those images interactive and engaging so that the user has an influence on how content displays , reacts , and appears on their screens and devices . <p> It Leverages Storytelling <p> Interactive content also engages through the power of storytelling . By placing the user within the story via his or her own unique inputs , each individual gets to create their own narratives .

Here are all the columns you can choose from : Interface - Visualize Your Apps Performance We 've improved the design of the interface , to make it easier to visualize your apps performance . This includes a new look and feel , and a new chart option called " Viral Lift " . This chart shows how much of the traffic to your app is generated through viral sharing versus through direct channels . The " lift " is the additive effect of the SnapApp social features , over-and-above your existing traffic stream . <p> Screenshot of new Analytics Intefrace <p> Drill Down &amp; Segmentation Previously , the options for rows in your report were that you could view activity stats by Date , by App Type , or by App Title .

With almost 100% participation in this marketing activity , here are some key takeaways you need to know : <p> Effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead scoring programs have room for improvement : Only two in 10 rated lead scoring activities as highly effective " and that only 15% said it produced highly qualified leads . However , it appears that those with more experience using lead scoring tools had significantly higher levels of success . <p> - <p> - <p> Companies who had been using lead scoring for more than two years saw better results than those who were only one year in , which indicates that it does take some time to make lead scoring an effective demand generation tool . <p> Lead Scoring is an Essential Function in Demand Generation <p> Overall , lead scoring does appear to have some serious benefits for marketing and sales teams . 74% reported better prioritized leads , more than half of survey participants reported seeing improved marketing and sales alignment , and 40% saw improved conversion rates from leads . <p> - <p> - <p> So what does that tell us ? <p> There 's clearly a connection between lead scoring and better prioritized leads " but that 's only the first step .

While sales teams may be impatient for success , it 's important to take the time to ensure both marketing and sales departments are properly trained with lead scoring resources , and that complementary objectives are aligned for both teams . <h> Implications for Content Marketing <p> After reading through these takeaways , maybe you 're wondering , " How does this impact my content campaign ? " <p> We 're glad you asked . <p> What we can glean from the data in this report is this : Your content marketing efforts ( like blog posts , landing pages , and interactive quizzes ) need to collect some important pieces of customer information . <p> In order to effectively leverage your lead scoring system , you need to know not only who your audience is , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their concerns are , and what they 're looking for in a solution to their problem . This way , you can present more personalized , relevant follow-up materials that help nudge them closer and closer to conversion . <p> The next question , then , is : How can you craft content that does that ? <h> Tips for Improving Your Lead Scoring Efforts <p> Your content needs to complement your lead scoring efforts by gathering essential data from leads as they move down the sales funnel . Here are a few ways to do that . <p> 1 . Create content for different sections of funnel <p> Creating content for users at different parts of the sales funnel means that you 're constantly sharing new , increasingly relevant information to the lead . For example , sharing case studies with bottom of the funnel leads allows them to study how other similar companies have achieved success with a specific product or service offering . <p> 2 . Use multiple content formats <p> Content does n't only have to come in the form of blog posts . Leveraging email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tandem with your blog content gives your leads more opportunities to interact , a way to share content , and more formats to choose from . <p> 3 . Leverage interactive content to better qualify and enable sales <p> Interactive content allows you to collect important data about where the lead is at in the sales funnel . For example , if you used an interactive quiz ( like this example from HotSchedules ) to assess the major obstacles your lead is facing , you can more effectively address those hurdles keeping them from conversion ( while educating them at the same time . ) <h> Lead Scoring : A Powerful Tool for Demand Generation <p> With the data from this report and the tips we 've outlined for more effective lead scoring , you can improve your sales funnel and the hand off between your marketing and sales teams . <p> The bottom line : If you continually score your leads and provide relevant , personalized follow-up materials ( with the help of interactive content that collects user data ) , the impact on conversions has proven to be worth its weight in gold .

@@98346784 @2546784/ <h> What Twitter ? s New Header Display Really Means <h> What Twitter ? s New Header Display Really Means <p> There 's a lot of buzz about Twitter ? s new header display , but what 's the big deal ? Sure , Twitter profiles may get prettier but looks are only skin deep , right ? Plus , most social media die-hards do n't even use Twitter.com to manage Twitter - what good is a prettier profile when it does n't even appear in platforms like Tweet Deck or Hootsuite ? At least , that 's how it seems on the surface , but when you dig a little deeper and consider some of the other moves Twitter has been making , the new headers have a lot more implications than what meets the eye ? Increased Functionality to Come : Just over a year ago , Twitter acquired TweetDeck to expand its offerings to professional and power-users alike . More recently , Twitter trimmed down API access for third-party applications - a move that was met with mixed reviews . Now , add the new header @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics to derive what Twitter is trying to do . Basically , Twitter wants to make Twitter.com the best place to manage and experience everything that 's going on in the Twitterverse - as opposed to third-party platforms or applications . This means the new header image may only be the tip of the iceberg as other enhanced features are likely to follow . Enhanced Advertising on Twitter : So what does Twitter get from focusing user interactions so they primarily occur on Twitter.com ? The answer is easy - more appealing ad space . Already , Twitter has hit its stride in mobile ad revenue , generating approximately $129.7 million this year , and overall revenue is looking to be around $283.3 million . Although , still significantly behind Google and Facebook , Twitter ? s current moves may make advertising in 140 characters or less that much more appealing for brands . What 's more , the header images themselves make for compelling branded profiles with a static message , while promoted tweets continue to help brands be an active part of conversations . <p> More Human Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuisance , and at worst , a major threat to the credibility of Twitter metrics . In fact , because of purchased followers , and other metric manipulation , Twitter ? s co-founder , Ev Williams has even gone so far to suggest that follower count is inadequate . ? With the new headers , however , it becomes that much easier to spot a fake , or not-all-there Twitter profile . Along with other Twitter red flags like egg avatars and absent or hashtag-heavy bios , the presence of a header image clearly shows that time and thought have been invested in a profile . The header image alone is n't a silver bullet to put fake followers to rest , but as Twitter continues to make similarly noticeable changes , the inactive or illegitimate accounts may become so painfully apparent that the practice may eventually die out altogether . Fun with Profiles : Given that so many creative and visual people are active on Twitter , it hasn ? t taken long for users to have fun with their header images . Not only is it another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes Twitter that much richer of an online environment . For all the business applications of the microblogging network , having more fun and playful elements can make Twitter that much more viable as a social channel . How do you feel about the new Twitter header images ? Weigh in in our SnapApp poll below or share your thoughts with us on Facebook or Twitter ! -

Other alternatives with similar preview options include FontFont , H&amp;CO , and Fontspring . <p> At the end of the day there are a lot more options available for fonts than our computers lead us to believe . <p> Choosing the right font <p> Choosing fonts to use all comes down to the elements on your page . Bolder fonts are best for calling out important text that should be read first by users . Lighter fonts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the font gets thicker for various elements , those fonts are also usually larger in overall size . <p> A basic set of fonts that you would see in a design includes a title , sub-title , sub-sub-title , paragraph , and text for things like navigation items or buttons . The first four font groupings descend in sizing in order to show the informational hierarchy on the page ( see Fig. 1 ) <p> - <p> - <p> Once the fonts that are applied to titles and paragraphs are figured out , it 's best to decide on a font for other elements on the page that are used with interactions . Buttons , for example , should have a distinct font style that is easy to read when people interact with it . If the button has a bright or dark color , it 's good to invert the text color to a more lighter color or white . ( see Fig. 2 ) <p> - <p> - <p> As more elements are added to the page , it will be easier to decide which font @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not you need to add another font style category . <h> Picking Colors <p> Unlike choosing fonts , luckily , you do n't have to scour the internet for free colors or to find tools that help you discover great combinations . However , colors are daunting for a whole different reason " There are literally 10 million colors visible to the human eye from which you can choose . <p> The problem with colors does not lie in being locked behind a paywall or needing to seek out colors themselves " The problem is sorting through those millions of colors to find the right pairing . <p> Technically , a matching of two colors has a little less than 50 billion possible combinations , which could take a century or more to asses all combinations . Thankfully there are tools out there that pair color combinations in a way that it is easy to get a sense for how well they complement or contrast each other . <p> Coolors is a website that allows you to quickly peruse through various color combinations by generating combinations that work well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors that you like , you can generate the optimal palette in no time . <p> - <p> - <p> What if you find colors you like in another image or website and you want to duplicate it into your design ? <p> Check out these color picker apps that allow you to save that color 's hex code or RGB value . For Mac use Couleurs , which allows you to choose from anything on the screen ; for PC use Chrome 's Eye Dropper extension , which allows you to choose anything from a browser . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Choosing the right color <p> When thinking about which colors to use , web designers usually start with picking one or two base colors . These base colors are typically used for elements on a page that should be called out to the user on a regular basis for interaction and viewing ( Fig. 1 ) . <p> The base colors also provide inspiration for the rest of the color palette by allowing for more shades of those base colors . A green , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complement it . The same can be applied to a second blue base color . These shades are then applied to elements in a design that are not as important for the audience to interact with or look at ( Fig. 2 ) . <p> After adding base colors and complementing shades , it 's best to add more neutral colors for elements of a design that do n't need to be called out as much . Typically a dark grey , light grey , or a grey with a slight tint from your base color works best ( Fig. 3 ) . Neutral colors are then applied to things like the page background , dividers for content , lengthy text , and other elements that indicate the structure of a design . <p> The last color that most designers add to a color palette is a brighter color that could act as a way of calling out elements on a page or adding a slight decorative detail ( Fig. 3 ) . This color is not used as much as the primary , secondary , and neutral colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get your audience 's attention and they will lose track of what 's important on the page . <p> This method of building a color palette can serve as a great start to a new design , however , a palette can always be essentially anything the designer wants . Color palettes could have no dark colors , no light colors , or only neutral pastel colors . In the end , it 's best to make sure the colors work for the elements you have designed for . As time goes on you will notice sometimes a color palette will also change or expand . ( Fig. 4 ) <p> - <p> Do n't forget , color blindness is common ! <p> Color is one of those things that a lot of us take for granted , especially considering that 1 of 200 women and 1 of 12 men have color blindness . When someone is color blind , it is possible for that individual to see red and green as the same color ( or blue-yellow color blindness as another popular color ambiguity ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a muddy brownish color for both colors . Luckily , there is a way to help account for this 8% of men and .5% of women , with a few color adjustments .

There 's unparalleled potential for huge returns at little cost , but only if you use Facebook right . Too many social media marketers see lackluster results from their Facebook presence by making one ( or all ) of these fatal Facebook fumbles. 1 . No Contact Information A compelling , exciting Facebook page that makes people want to interact with your brand is nearly useless if they ca n't contact you . Customize your profile with as much contact info as possible - have it include your business address , phone number , email , website and all other relevant contact info . 2 . Not Thinking About Graphics It 's easy to post a bunch of low-quality pictures to your Facebook page -- after all , casual observation might lead you to conclude it 's what the site is all about . In fact , bad pictures on your business page are worse than no pictures at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-quality shots to go along with your logo ; you 'll be surprised at how influential these pictures can be in fostering engagement and interaction on your Page . 3 . Firing and Forgetting The success of your Facebook page will depend in large part on how often people comment and share on the content you provide . Once you post something , come back to it a few minutes later , then a few hours later . Add a comment or two to keep the conversation rolling . 4 . Ignoring the CompetitionKnow what 's going on with your competition 's page , even to the point of becoming a fan . This means that you are aware of any events , promotions or sales that they may be having -- giving you a chance to respond in real time . 5 . Broadcast-Only Posting If every single post you drop is about your product or service , people wo n't follow you on Facebook . Educate , entertain and inform your customers by sharing inside information , humorous insights and relevant news . Some experts recommend a ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 6 . Conduct Unbecoming Personal pages on Facebook are often a hive of petty arguments , foul language and not-so-modest pictures . Although you might be tempted to involve your business page in one or all of the above , resist that temptation . Keep your page professional , clean and on-point. 7 . Going AWOL Facebook relies on dynamic content -- meaning you ca n't just build your company 's page and walk away . Build a Facebook content calendar to keep you -- or your marketing staff -- on track for both content creation and content delivery . Only this kind of upkeep gives potential fans and followers value for their time and mental real estate . - We want to hear from you - have you experienced any of these issues on your own page ?

So we can learn to pick ourselves back up . Yes , even superheroes fall and fail every now and again - which is why this quote from The Dark Knight Rises is so fitting . In the world of fiction , we 're perfectly ok with heroes making mistakes or becoming outcasts , and in fact , sometimes it makes us connect with those heroes all the more ! Yet in the real world , we 're often more afraid of our own errors than we are of the most terrifying fictional villains . Why ? Covering up mistakes , pretending they never happened , or doing nothing about them in hopes no one will notice can be far more damaging than taking responsibility and learning from the experience .

Not only did Kerpen publicly take responsibility for the mistake , he went the extra mile to dedicate extra Likeable resources to support non-profit organizations in need . In the end , Kerpen helped to save the reputation of the client , and set a high and very likeable standard for dealing with social media mistakes . - Beware of the Dark Side : Social channels often give people the perception of power and invulnerability , and the allure of speaking one ? s mind with impunity may become overwhelming .

The problem - the no name upstart was Travis Wright , a very well connected social media professional . What could ? ve been just another typical angry tweet from a sports fan blew up to become a much bigger problem . Instead of rationally addressing Travis ? s tweet , or even just accepting that people do n't always have nice things to say , the Chiefs ? representative started an unnecessary fight on the assumption that he or she would win . What 's worse , the representative then blocked Travis as if that would end the dispute and hide the conflict from the world . Unfortunately , by striking him down , though , the Chiefs ? manager only made Travis ? s message more powerful ? Be a Man or Woman of Steel : When ? Mr. Worldwide , ? aka Pitbull , teamed up with Walmart for a social media campaign intended to send him to the Walmart location with the most Facebook likes , he probably never expected to end up in Kodak , Alaska .

Yes , one of the world 's biggest companies and one of the world 's most popular artists were out done by a Boston-based writer , but by staying true to the terms of their contest , Walmart and Pitbull essentially made themselves bulletproof . What 's more , Pitbull even embraced Thorpe 's exile initiative by inviting David out to the event and covering his expenses - true class all around !

In the marketing round , however , there 's no room for tunnel vision tactics . What happens in one channel can and should be used to support efforts in other channels . Silos as Spokes : Silos happen because specific groups of people have specific skills to drive specific results , but the specificity itself naturally causes divisions . Through the marketing round model , Dietrich and Livingston emphasize tearing down such silos by channeling departmental specialties into an overarching vision . PR , communications , IT , advertising , business development , the executive suite - any department that can support marketing must be considered and connected as a part of the marketing round . Measurable Objectives as Spokes : Just as silos and channels have specialized applications , specific objectives are spokes as well .

Whether it 's using social media to drive search rankings , or PR connections to promote content , marketing in the round means a completely holistic approach . Granted , marketing in the round is n't easy . It takes some substantial change management , dedication , and serious buy-in across an organization to work , but as Dietrich and Livingston say in closing ? keep your eyes forward and never stop driving . In the end , the true benefit of a round approach to marketing is that there is no real end to what you can do .

With the original layout of Facebook , SnapApps could easily be like-gated and could appear as either a tab or a landing page . Although things are a bit different than they were then , Facebook Timeline still allows this feature . Want to know more about the differences between now and then ? Keep reading to find out !

That 's where the " Introduction to Facebook Marketing " series can help ! This series of posts should put you well on your way to understanding how to expand your marketing efforts to Facebook . We 're going to start with an anatomy lesson , but you wo n't have to get your hands dirty ! How is a Fan Page different from a Personal account ? A Fan Page is for company and professional use , while a Personal account is for individual use . Companies should create a Fan Page to have a presence on Facebook , not a personal account . One ? notable and important ? difference are the apps featured on the tab section of your Fan page . These function differently than Apps you may have installed on your Personal Profile page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features . You can even build your own Apps and feature them in that space . In future " Introduction to Marketing " blog posts , we will delve into this , and other topics further . First , let 's examine the components of a Facebook page . I 've highlighted areas in the screenshot , below , that are particularly relevant to Facebook marketing so you can become more familiar with elements you may not have used or noticed before . <p> Profile image : For a product page , like this one , you can use your company logo . Make sure it 's an image that you want representing your brand alongside every status update and post . This will literally be the " face " of your company ! Maximum dimensions are 180(w)x 540(h) pixels . <p> Other Photos : These photos get pulled from the photo album and wall posts on your page . Many new pages do n't have ANY pictures in these spots , which is a shame . Try and think of any imagery that you think best represents your brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top . You can hide or delete any images you do n't want displayed later . <p> Post : This is where you share interesting and relevant information with your fans on Facebook . Anyone who " likes " your page will see your posts in their personal newsfeed . <p> Wall/Feed : Your Wall is the primary place users can engage and conversate with your brand . Users can comment , like and " share " your messages , links and video . Below each of your posts you can view quick analysis of the post 's popularity , including impressions and feedback rate . <p> Tabs : To the left of the Wall , are your tabs .

@@98346918 @2546918/ <p> Because of this , it 's important to plan out a strategy for addressing those needs at the bottom of the funnel . You 'll want a plan of action that helps you move those low funnel leads right on through to the customer side . <p> So what are customers looking for at the bottom of the funnel , you might be wondering ? In this post , we 'll cover five key areas that address their common questions and concerns . <h> 1 . Social Proof That Addresses Their Concerns <p> Low in the funnel , your leads want clear evidence that proves you can deliver on the things you promise . And they want to hear that from someone other than you . Enter social proof . <p> Increasingly , review sites like G2 Crowd are becoming more and more browsed and relied upon for low-funnel leads . This gives them the general experience of current or past customers . Make sure you encourage great customer successes to leave their reviews on these sites . <p> Other social proof comes in the form of testimonials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They not only provide concrete evidence that you can provide real , tangible value for clients , but it also allows them to see for themselves what past customers have to say about working with you . <p> Take this example from Super Spicy Media , a social media management company . They leverage social proof in the form of testimonials to show how they addressed customer concerns and produced positive results . Promoting these assets to leads in the bottom of the funnel gives them one more reason to stop worrying and to take action . <h> 2 . A Discount or Deal to Overcome Price Objections <p> For other bottom-of-the-funnel leads , it 's a pricing issue that 's keeping them from converting into a customer . They see the value of what you can provide , but they 're not convinced it 's worth paying the full price tag . <p> For these customers , a discounted period or free trial can allow them to get hands-on experimentation with your product or service ( and to see for themselves the many benefits of your offering . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the investment in a more long-term relationship with your product . <p> Unitrends offers cloud-based backup services to enterprise clients , and they use a 30-day free trial to get bottom-of-the-funnel leads interested in using their service for the long-term . Bonus : In collecting form field information up front from mid to low-funnel leads , they ensure they can follow up with them when the time comes and help them convert . <h> 3 . Content That Proves Value Within Their Niche <p> Potential customers also want to know that you can help them address concerns that are unique to their individual niches . For example , a hair salon owner exploring appointment software wants to see some content that indicates other hair salons are successfully using this particular product . <p> Highly relevant content ( again , like a case study or testimonial ) that shows similar businesses ' - positive experiences are powerful because they are more tailored to the lead 's individual concerns . It 's not a catch-all " it speaks to more specialized needs . <p> Kissmetrics does a nice job of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eCommerce world , Ecwid . They show how their services helped a company working with this highly specialized subject matter used their tools to produce amazing results . <h> 4 . A Demonstration of Authority &amp; Expertise <p> It 's always a good idea to remind your bottom-of-the-funnel leads of your authority and expertise , as this drives up your ethos with your audience . It 's a basic principle of Rhetoric : Remind your audience that you 're an expert they can trust with proof they can evaluate for themselves . <p> So how do you do that ? Showcase your awards , achievements , press , and praise in a way that convinces leads to follow through and convert . <p> Mentalist Vinny DePonto has an entire page on his website that indicates his expertise as a performer , and it includes reviews from respected theater publications , praise from past clients , and more . <h> 5 . Quick Follow-Up <p> Bottom-of-the-funnel leads do n't want to wait around for answers " they need fast responses that address their questions . In fact , data from InfusionSoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then your lead is 21x less likely to turn into a sale . <p> Because of this , it 's important to have options like live chat and email support that can help resolve issues for these leads efficiently . Automated emails can also help ensure your potential customers know help is on the way . If someone is having an issue with checkout , your website navigation , etc. , these features keep you from losing those leads who are ready to buy . <p> Nordstrom uses live chat for this very reason . Right from the checkout screen , customers can resolve issues in real time thanks to handy live chat features .

Facebook 's recent update to Pages for businesses and organizations made it possible to install third-party apps with rich styling and functionality , like SnapApp , directly onto a tab of your Facebook page . Starting today , any quiz , poll , or survey you create using SnapApp can now be placed on a tab of your Facebook Page . ( See an example app on our Facebook page . ) <h> Features <p> Here 's what you 'll now get when you put SnapApp on your Facebook page : <p> Trivia quizzes , personality tests , surveys and polls . All four content types currently supported in Facebook . Any app you create in SnapApp is Facebook-compatible <p> Full Customization . All of the same design , styling and customization options that SnapApp offers for widget and microsite deployment are available on Facebok apps . <p> Single-source creation and editing . If you have an app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website and a Facebook page tab , you can edit your app all in one place , and any updates will propagate to all instances of your app , wherever it is deployed . You do not need to re-deploy or re-add the Facebook application to put changes live . <p> One-click sharing into your fans ' newsfeeds . When your fans reach the results page of a quiz , poll , or survey , they can publish a status update from your app into their newsfeed with a single click . <p> Connection to the outside . If you have third-party social connection buttons , download links , or lead generation forms within your widget , those will all function the same in the Facebook environment , which means you can use SnapApp as a tool to funnel your Facebook fans into customer acquisitions channels outside of Facebook . <h> Deploy Your App to Facebook in Two Easy Steps <p> Deploying your app to Facebook takes two simple authorization steps , one on the SnapApp.com side , and one on the Facebook.com side . <p> On the Publish tab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to publish the app to , and click " Deploy to Facebook " . <p> Follow the link to Facebook.com , where you must confirm that you want to add the app to that page . When you do so , the app will be live instantly on a tab of your page . <h> Technical Details <p> Prior to the February 10th update to Pages , Facebook only supported FBML , Facebook 's proprietary version of HTML . This made it impossible to offer all of the design options that are built into SnapApp . Now Facebook supports Page tab apps using iframes , which means we can serve your fully-customized app on Facebook in the exact same format in which it appears outside of Facebook . The one exception is that , since the app must appear within the Page tab canvas , apps deployed to Facebook can be a maximum of 500 pixels wide , or Facebook will be unable to display the entire app . The height is unlimited , and no other Facebook-specific design constraints apply . We technically have three different Facebook applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " SnapApp Poll " , depending on which type of content you 're deploying . The tab that appears on your Facebook page will read " Quiz " , " Survey " , or " Poll " , respectively . Facebook also allows page administrators to customize the labels on tab apps , so once you 've added the app , you can go into your Facebook Page admin on facebook.com and change the tab label to whatever you like . SnapApp is only available for Pages , not personal user profiles.

In early February we added a new member to our leadership team , Senior Vice President of Marketing , Aaron Dun . So that Aaron can be formally introduced to our readers , we sat down for a quick Q&amp;A to gain some insight into his thoughts on SnapApp and modern marketing. - <h> Q. What does your marketing road to this point look like ? <p> I have a pretty diverse background in both startup and larger global tech companies in various roles . Before joining SnapApp , I was the CMO for- Intronis- through its acquisition by- Barracuda Networks . While there I worked closely with the sales and product teams to reposition the product , restructure the go-to-market strategy , and rebrand the company . Most recently , I was leading the setup of Intronis ' global operations after the Barracuda acquisition. - <p> One of the interesting components I 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge and mission are generally similar : - find the unique story for your product or service and align a go-to-market strategy- to scale demand gen , drive marketing. - <p> With the marketing tech community , there are a few additional elements in the playing field . Marketing to yourself ( as in , other modern marketers ) is always a fun and challenging experience . The bar is sufficiently raised " how to create a dialogue for someone who understands marketing as well , if not better , than you do . <p> I 've been in and out of the marketing tech community a few different times . Each time , I 've always enjoyed engaging and- talking with the marketing community as a marketer- " exploring newly developed tools and ever evolving best practices . It 's a thrilling time in the marketing technology field . I 'm excited to join SnapApp and establish ourselves as a leader in this emerging content interactivity segment. - <h> Q. What 's the most exciting thing about marketing ? - <p> I 'm definitely most fascinated by the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a dialogue with your customers and prospects . The options continually seem to be endless , and the exciting part is how we think about harnessing and deploying certain channels in a way that is- actually going to drive results . Though there are thousands of things to do , the question is how do we figure out which will work for us today and which will work for us tomorrow ? <p> These days , incremental growth really is n't enough . You have to continually be looking for what I call a 10X change . If you want to grow from 1000 blog subscribers to 100k , just growing by 25% is n't going to get it done . You need to change the scale of the opportunity , THEN you will push yourself to find things that will create that big change . - <p> I 'm big into testing . Test to fail , test to iterate testing , test to grow " that 's the way I think about finding solutions . Because there 's a constant and dynamic growth happening in tech communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually . If you 're not pushing the envelope and pushing the result , then you 're not doing much of anything interesting . - <h> Q. What aspects of SnapApp most appealed to you ? <p> With SnapApp , what really excites me is the mission of creating a whole new industry category centered on content interactivity . I know that my teams have continually pushed to- find better ways to create engaging experienceswith our customers and prospects . Having a platform that marketers can use to create compelling content that pulls more people into and through the funnel , and connect that content to revenue , addresses several marketing leadership mandates . I 'm really excited to be in an active conversation with the tech community and other marketers to create engaging new ways to communicate with our customers . <p> Plus , joining at this specific stage of a- rapidly expanding company , one that already has a strong customer base and a committed team which we are continuing to grow is very energizing and inspiring .

In just a sentence or two , how would you describe SnapApp 's company culture ? - <p> There 's a dynamism here with very smart people- coming together- to build something amazing . Everyone is very driven with their eye on two main objectives . One , creating the best outcome possible for our customers , and two , have some fun doing it . <h> Q. What do you see as the future for marketers ? <p> I think there are essentially- three key trends- that marketers need to consider . All three are connected by the idea that you must create content that truly resonates across increasingly segmented audiences in order to scale the business and ultimately create raving customer fans. - <p> To get there , we need to be constantly thinking of how to create raving fans out of our customers and unleash them to be our best advocates . I 'm really interested in the advocate marketing work- Influitive- is doing in this area. - <p> The next area of focus would be- account based marketing . Marketers need to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating different and modified strategies for each account or audience segment in the B2C world . It 's something that has been in the works , but in a narrow way . It should and will be much more of a key strategy focus . <p> And the third is the- importance of- resonance . It 's no longer enough to just publish more content . I think about it this way : If- content 1.0- was about deploying a content strategy and producing content , then- content 2.0- is about publishing at scale , and using different tools to accelerate delivery . That 's pretty much where many of us find ourselves today . <p> Content 3.0 , however , is about creating content that- engages and truly resonates with your audience- to create a differentiated experience for your customers . When you create an emotional or intellectual response in your reader , the connection sticks around and continues to ring well after they 've finished engaging with your content . That is what gets them coming back , sharing , participating . Marketers using resonant content well are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to optimize their strategies . For the first time we can measure the impact of each piece or area of content in the different stages of the funnel . I know that has been a struggle for me in the past . Having those metrics driving your content strategy will have a massive impact . <h> Quick Fire Round <h> Q. Favorite travel destination ? <p> Key West is always a lot of fun , sometimes a much needed winter escape. - <p> Q. Last movie you really liked ? <p> I just saw- Spotlight- and it was amazing .

The first 100 boots ever made by Leon Leonwood Bean actually fell apart at the seams - literally . Instead of just spouting " caveat emptor " and fleeing into the proverbial Maine woods with the money , however ( as even some modern businesses might do ) , Bean refunded all ninety customers who returned their boots at full price and started over . Perhaps it was the quality of the next batch of boots that caused L.L.

Bottom line - engagements built around satisfied customers are just plain good business . <h> Socrates ( via Plato ) <p> The Socratic method of asking questions in order to arrive at a greater understanding has an interesting effect when encountered in the works of Plato - it gets people thinking . As a writer , Plato preferred to put his teachings into dialogues between his character of Socrates and other figures . This format still expressed Plato ? s ideas , but it also served as an example for people to have meaningful discussions of their own . Today , marketers need to get their audience thinking as much as they need to facilitate meaningful discussions through calls to action , attentive listening , and savvy content strategies- --- otherwise , brands will be easily overlooked . <h> John Deere <p> In 1895 , John Deere released its own magazine targeted to farmers called the Furrow .

Keep upcoming events and holidays in mind as you refresh your brainstorming area . These make great inspiration for marketing . Seeding and Planting After you 've removed ideas that wo n't work , choose one concept from your brainstorm area . Write it in the center of a blank part of your content board . Using that idea as a seed , come up with 10 actionable concepts for turning that core idea into a working message .

Basically , it 's a sophisticated solution for generating leads , creating long-term relationships and driving measurable , repeatable marketing results all from one platform . In other words , it 's a necessity of modern business . If your company has n't already invested in marketing automation , it 's probably on the horizon , so knowing how to get the most out of the marketing automation solution you have or the one you will have down the road is crucial . <p> Although marketing automation sounds complicated , as a former engineering student I can tell you , it 's not all that bad . For example , I remember sitting in an advanced laser and fiber optics class being confounded by the idea that light degrades - even in a perfect system - and yet , at the same time it also has the potential to be amplified ; all it takes is a simple device to add a little extra light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just looking back makes me relieved to be in marketing , but much like simple things - light in this case - can have varying degrees of complexity in engineering , similarly in marketing , things as simple as interest can take on unexpectedly deep levels . <p> Think of marketing automation like it 's the simple lighting device . A prospect in your marketing program may have had a strong interest or purchase intensity which needs to be amplified , or a degraded intensity that needs to be restored . Marketing automation allows you to adjust and enhance these purchase intensity signals and respond accordingly to the brightest opportunities . Not so complicated , right ? But what if you could even amplify the amplifier ? What if you could even make your marketing automation system more perfect ? To keep it simple -- you can , and here 's how : <p> Asking questions , capturing leads for valued content in and at the moment of engagement increases the interest or purchase intensity of prospects dramatically . From our own data , we 've found that interactive content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89% click through rate . That means through interactions alone , people are much more apt to consume your marketing content and consent to sharing their own information . <p> 3 ) - Improved Data Fidelity <p> Marketing automation helps you capture leads and specific information on those leads . But by capturing additional data in the interaction you not only gain stronger lead scoring or a way to grade purchase intensity , you also get more subtle buying behaviors that boost the signals of interest in an interaction . Like the more pixels in an image , the more data points on a lead , the clearer the pattern becomes . <p> 4 ) - New Methods of Nurturing <p> During any sales process the nature of how you interact with customers changes along with the types of questions and interactions . Interactive content can be leveraged during the nurturing stage to increase the purchase intensity .

So how do you get your content in the News Feeds of the highest possible number of fans ? It all comes down to understanding the EdgeRank Algorithm ... and you thought marketing was n't going to require math ! <p> A recording of our webinar on this topic , as well as the slides , are available at the end of this post . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Affinity , Weight &amp; Time . Every piece of content shared on Facebook ( status update , a Like , a Share , a picture , an app , etc ) is an Edge and each Edge has a rank or score based on the additive values of these 3 elements : <p> Affinity = How Popular you ( the person or the brand ) are with a user . <p> Weight = A score based on how likely the content being shared is to drive action/engagement . Much like Google 's Search Engine rewards relevant content with a higher rank , so does Facebook . Photos , Apps , Videos , etc are among the highest weights . <p> TimeDecay = The simplest of the 3 , time decay is simple a degradation based on how old the edge is . Hint , your edge does not age like a fine wine ... <p> So what does this have to do with the News Feed ? Simple . The higher your EdgeRank , the higher your post goes on the list of News Feed items . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , and it wo n't show up . This is why it 's crucial to make sure your edges are heavy , relevant and timely . Here are 5 things you can do NOW to boost your EdgeRank Scores : 1 ) Post Daily ( at a minimum ) there are lots of studies and opinions on the frequency of posting to Facebook but the majority lean towards a minimum of a daily interaction . Even with all this good advice , a Sysmos study posted on TechCrunch found that on average , Facebook Fan pages were updated only once every 16 days ! With time decay weighing against you , you 're essentially counting yourself out of the game if you are n't posting at least once a day . Some brands with highly engaged fans and great content will post from 3-5 times per day . You 'll need to test what frequency is acceptable for your audience . For more advanced page managers , consider this post from @danzarrella on the KissMetrics site which shows that Saturday 's at Noon may be the best time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insights &amp; EdgeRankChecker.com to deduce what frequency and content is best for your fans . 2 ) Gain Some Weight - I know the summer is just around the corner , but trust me , you want to get hefty here . Although there is no pre-set hierarchy of weight value , the edges which tend to get high weight scores are posts w/links , videos , pictures and apps. ? The reason behind their weight is simple . More people will want to click them &amp; Facebook wants users to click . So , make sure your status updates include media whenever possible and ALWAYS include an explanation with your post . A study done by EdgeRankChecker.com found that - completely contrary to Twitter - Facebook users actually prefer status updates LONGER than 140 characters . DO N'T use shortened links in your posts . This advice given by Socially Engaged Marketing , says that shortened URLs decrease trust and are less likely to be clicked . They also take away a chance to drive brand recognition - think www.snapapp.com VS. http : //bit.ly/eo66BO 3 ) Expose Yourself &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About This " Rating last September as an on-page measure of fan engagement . A good goal is to aim for 10% of your fans to be talking about you on any given day/week/month . ( So , if you have 2,000 fans you would want to see 200 People Talking About This ) . A great way to encourage response to posts are to ask questions . Figment , a community for teen writers , does a great job of incorporating Apps &amp; Questions into their Facebook posting mix using SnapApp 's In News Feed Question and Answer Feature - a double win for weight factor ( app ) and engagement ( responses ) . When a fan engages with a fun interactive personality quiz ( for example ) and then shares their results with friends , their post includes a question from the Facebook quiz ? which their friends will then be enticed to click &amp; respond to . This method will help increase their on-page People Talking About This Rating as well as increase the weight of their edges , expand their reach with sharing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality quiz app lives . - - - - - - - - - - 4 ) " Ad " Repeat Page Viewings - Facebook ads , like any marketing channel , have some pros &amp; cons . On the down-side , they 're not particularly effective at customer acquisition with 70% of marketers saying they failed to convert new customers . This may be in part due to Facebook members apparent disdain with traveling off of the Facebook site for info . A test done by SEOmoz found that when they referred traffic from Facebook to their main site , bounce rates increased by 41% and average time on site decreased by 56% . Enough of the bad news . The good news with Facebook ads is that , compared to other cost-per-click ad options , they 're relatively low cost . And , the flexibility with targeting on the platform makes it easy to hit precise audiences . Since you pay only for the click , you can also count the other impressions as inexpensive branding . Another option to consider is getting creative about driving conversion ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Facebook sweepstakes ? or content download back to a SnapApp living on your Facebook page . Including a lead gen form and email opt-in ( for example ) within your app is an effective way to drive acquisition on page &amp; leads can be posted to your CRM or email system in real-time . 5 ) Engage with Fans on the go - With 44% of Facebook 's current 800M members accessing through mobile phones or tablets , you 'd do yourself a huge disservice to discount the experience for mobile visitors . But many page managers are unaware of how their special social media promotions/apps will work for mobile viewers . Take a look at the example below where someone was using a contest app to get votes to win a " Dream Job " : The experience here for the mobile user was an error code . They were unable to access the content , and unable to vote . This experience - especially if it is the first time engaging with a brand - is likely not the one you 'd be aiming for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook mobile quizzes or sweepstakes - that you ask your vendor about the mobile experience so you do n't risk losing conversions , leads or customers . - - - - Video from our Webinar : Slides

But here 's the thing " copying your best work does not make you a copy cat . It makes you an agile marketer . <p> Only 32% of marketers think that they are creating enough content " that means that a staggering 68% of marketers believe they 're falling short . By repurposing your content in interactive forms , you broaden your reach , strengthen your authority , and flex your creative muscles without going back to the drawing board . <p> Instead of starting from scratch every time you develop your editorial strategy , derive a portion of your planned content from past successes . Because interactive content generates twice the conversions of passive content , your repurposed pieces are bound to make an even bigger splash than your original efforts . <h> Step 1 : Investigate Your Options <p> As HubSpot reminds us , repurposing content is not the same as revamping your content . Think of revamping your content as redecorating ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you overhaul those old curtains and ugly cabinets with new features . <p> Repurposing , on the other hand , pulls apart an amazing house and uses the parts to build something completely different .

This is where you 'll get your page ready for your Facebook audience by following the steps outlined in the video and in detail , below . <h> Setting Up Your Facebook Page with Timeline <h> 1 . Cover <p> Your cover should represent your brand 's value and symbolically represent your company . This could be a photo of your team or a graphical representation of your tag line , for instance . The ideal size is : ? 851 x 315 pixels . You should NOT use the cover in a promotional way . Facebook policy prohibits promoting your brand with discounts , or calls to action ( i.e. " Download this now " ) or referencing Facebook features ( i.e. " Like our page " ) . <h> 2 . Profile Image <p> You will likely also need to change your Profile image ( 180x180 pixels ) . If you had a tall profile image it will likely get cropped and not be as powerful . Note that the profile is positioned within the cover ; consider an image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover . <h> 3 . About Section <p> The About section appears more prominently , just below the Profile image . The first 130 characters from your description are pulled for display here . You may need to edit this so your paragraph does n't get cut off ! <h> 4 . Tabs/Apps <p> There are 12 slots available for customized applications and tabs ( three rows of four apps ) . Two tabs are essentially fixed : The Photo Tab can not be removed , hidden , or moved . The Likes Tab , which displays the number page likes , can not be removed , but it can be swapped so it appears " below the fold . " ( Please note , users can still see how many likes you have and how many people are " talking about you " in the section next to the profile photo . ) To manage your tabs , click the down arrow to the right of your tabs . This will allow you to edit your tab settings , which includes the name of the tab and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timeline Feed ( Pin , Highlight , Hide ) <p> The Timeline feed has replaced the Wall , and is now the default Facebook landing page for visitors to your page . Your activity is displayed in chronological order , and you can control how your posts are displayed . <p> Highlight favorite posts so that they take up the width of the Timeline . This is especially effective when a post features an image or video . <p> Pin important , promotional , or particularly interesting posts to the top of your page . Pinned posts will stay at the top for 7 days and wo n't get pushed down by more recent posts . <p> Hide repeated posts , or activity you do n't wish to display . <p> You now know how to set up your Facebook Page Timeline ! But how do these changes impact your Facebook marketing strategy ? There are some very significant challenges Facebook marketers now have to face in light of this update .

@@98347011 @2547011/ <h> " Like Gating " for Facebook Apps <h> " Like Gating " for Facebook Apps <p> Yesterday , we released a much-anticipated new feature for SnapApp Facebook apps : " Like Gating . " ? When you enable this feature , users are required to like your Facebook page in order to access your app . This is a great way to get more likes for your Facebook page . <h> Benefits of like gating <p> Like gating is a popular and effective strategy for generating more " likes " for a Facebook page . If you have something exciting that your users want , such as a prize giveaway or promotion , and they can only access it by first liking your page , they will usually like your page in order to do so , which generates additional likes for your page . You can fuel this process by driving traffic to the like-gated page , or promoting the page through Facebook CPC ads , email newsletters or other media . That is the direct benefit of like gating . However , the real power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users like your page , your page then shows up in those users ' friends ' News Feeds , in updates like this : Those updates , in turn , drive more traffic back to your like-gated app , virally . Those users will convert into new likes , and the effect will spread to their friends , and to those users ' friends , and so on . If the reward behind your like gate is appealing enough , your page can quite literally promote itself and drive exponential like growth until you saturate your market . <h> Popular ways of using like gating <p> The key to an effective like gating promotion is to offer users something they genuinely want . Do n't like-gate an advertisement , like-gate an amazing prize giveaway . Most Facebook users recognize and happily accept like gating for what it is : a quid pro quo arrangement , where you provide them with something of value to them , and in exchange they like your page , thereby endorsing your page publically to all their friends and subscribing to read status updates from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances of like gating we 've encountered . Note the high value proposition presented to the user : <p> Like the page and get access to a sweepstakes giving away front-row concert tickets . <p> Like the page and get access to a 25% off coupon for anything in the store . <p> Like the page and get to vote on the next new flavor of the month . <p> Probably the most successful like gating campaign ever was undertaken recently by Taco Bell . In a PR effort to combat a class action lawsuit claiming their tacos did not actually contain " beef " , they launched a massive campaign asking fans to support them on their Facebook page . Fans were encouraged to express support by liking the page and downloading a like-gated coupon for a free taco . As an extra incentive to tell a friend , Taco Bell stipulated that the coupon would only become valid after a threshold of 10 million likes was reached . They only got 5.4 million likes , but they decided to activate everyone 's coupons anyway . At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown to 6.8 million fans , and , for what it 's worth , the lawsuit alleging that tacos did not contain beef was dropped . <h> How does like gating work in SnapApp ? <p> In your SnapApp account , select the option labeled , Require " Like " in order to access the app . There are two styles of like gates ? offered in SnapApp . The default option is a partially-transparent overlay on top of your app , which allows user to see your app but not use it . Users are prompted to like your page in order to access the app . Here 's a video showing how it works . The second option is that you can upload your own custom , opaque image for the like gate . This image can carry your branding , and can fill up the entire 500-pixel-wide Facebook page canvas . Here 's an example showing what that option looks like for the user . <h> How can I get started ? <p> If you already have a SnapApp account , just enable like gating for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with like gating and deploy it to Facebook .
