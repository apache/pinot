@@101240578 @5440578/ <h> Employee Self-ServiceG <p> Store associates lead complicated lives . You can write a weekly or monthly labor schedule ahead of time , but if something comes up " someone in the family gets sick , a child needs to be picked up from a game ; your perfectly scheduled store associate may not show up , disrupting smooth store operations . <p> Dealing with employee requests and notifications such as : <p> I 'm sick <p> What does my schedule look like for next week ? <p> How much Paid Time Off do I have ? , or <p> Can I swap a shift with Susan ? <p> add hours to store managers ' workload . Instead of store and department managers spending time editing labor schedules and responding to requests , your store associates should have the freedom and the tools to control their schedules within business rules . <p> With Reflexis Employee Self-ServiceG ( ESS ) , associates have a degree of control over their schedules . Our solution allows associates to take a first pass at adjusting their schedules to fit their needs .

He logs in to the ESS mobile app and either advertises that he has a shift that needs to be filled or looks for someone who wants to take on an additional shift . Maybe Caila wants extra hours to help her save for an upcoming vacation . Caila can pick-up the shift from Chris , and the system automatically checks to make sure that the switch is in accordance with labor laws , required skill-sets , etc . <p> This is just one example of how ESS can make life easier , and more fulfilling , for your store associates . ESS also allows associates to : <p> View their weekly/monthly schedules <p> Add/edit their time-off requests <p> View their accrual balances <p> Issue sick-leave notifications <p> Request vacation <p> View timecard details , such as raw punches , audit , special pay , and warnings . <p> Beyond the technical benefits that ESS provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Millennials and younger generations become a greater proportion of your workforce , they demand the tools to have a better work-life balance .

As Millennial workers feel they have greater control over their schedules and work-life balance , their loyalty to your company increases . <p> At the end of the day , store managers still hold responsibility for what happens in their stores . After shift-swaps or shift-requests are made and accepted by store associates , all the information is provided to store managers to make the final decision . Store managers can see things such as the skills and certifications that the associates requesting the swap have .
