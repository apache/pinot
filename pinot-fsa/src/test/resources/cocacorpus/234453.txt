@@23831188 @3831188/ <p> It 's hard to beat the classic good looks of chrome wire wheels . This probably explains why they were fitted to so many of our British classics . <p> However , many more cars left the factory without wire wheels . Fortunately , upgrading to a set today is as easy as 1-2-3 thanks to the Moss Wire Wheel Conversion Kits . Each kit comes with five wheels " do n't forget the spare " plus everything else necessary , including the adaptor hubs , knock-offs and all needed hardware . Finish choices include either silver paint or chrome plating . <p> We recently did a wire wheel conversion on a Triumph TR6 , and the entire project took less than an afternoon . <p> STEP 1 : REMOVE THE OLD HARDWARE <p> This step is fairly self-explanatory , as the old wheels are simply removed and put aside . <p> STEP 2 : FIT HUBS <p> Since the wire wheels use a center mounting point , a splined adaptor hub must be bolted to the stock hub .

A hacksaw or die grinder will work just fine . If using a hacksaw , use high-carbon steel blades " and start a new blade on each wheel . When going this route , new full-length studs will need to be installed before the disc wheels can ever be reinstalled . <p> The other option is to remove the hubs so that the stock studs can be replaced with shorter ones . A hydraulic press is needed to install the new studs . ( Hint : Moss stocks the shorter , wire wheel-spec studs . ) <p> Now the hubs can be physically bolted to the hubs . Each mounting nut should be torqued to 65 ft. -lb. and then retorqued after the car has been driven about 10 miles .

Moss includes a copy of these directions with every set of wire wheels sold , while a copy can also be found online . <p> REPLACING OLD HARDWARE <p> A lot of wire wheels have been in service for 40 or more years , and these components do age : splines become worn , while spokes loosen or go missing . If the hubs have worn splines , simply replace the unit . While wheels can be rebuilt , sometimes it 's just quicker and less expensive to replace them , too . Worn wheel splines are usually a sign that it 's also time to replace the entire wheel . Moss carries the wheels and hubsyeah needed to renew most original equipment wire wheel setups.

When I pressed in the clutch pedal to start the car , it moved back and the engine turned over , all before I turned the key ! <p> Puzzled , I tried to start the car , but nothing happened " no starter operation . Popping open the bonnet I could detect the faint small of smoked electrical wiring ! After getting the ' B push-started and arriving home , I started trouble-shooting . I disconnected the small white wire to the starter solenoid and rigged up a wire so I could see if the solenoid was getting 12 volts when I turned the key . <p> My multi-meter showed 12 volts to the starter solenoid even without the key in the ignition ! I then disconnected the solenoid wire at the starter relay end , thinking that maybe the relay had an internal short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire , which was now disconnected from anything at both ends ! !

About an inch into the bundle , I found chaffing on both the solenoid wire and one of the 12 volt lines that taps off the starter and that is live at all times . The culprit was the mounting bracket for the clutch hydraulic line . The wire bundle was resting against this bracket , and even though the wire bundle wrapping material appeared only slightly frayed , the insulation had completely worn off the wires inside . <p> The fix was easy " I clipped off the frayed wires , and re-spliced them with some butt connectors .

The car still could have jumped forward off the jackstands with me underneath . Usually I do not disconnect the battery since that causes my radio to zero and I have to reprogram my favorite stations and reset the radio 's clock ! <p> Next time you are under your MGB , after either disconnecting the battery or at least putting gear shift in neutral , unwrap a few inches of this wire bundle and check for chaffing at the point adjacent to the bracket where the clutch hydraulic line is attached . 
@@23831192 @3831192/ <p> Note : A more detailed version of this article with tech tips is available at britishmotoring.net . <p> By Michael Grant <p> The Question <p> Which oil should I use in my classic car ? It 's incredibly important to ask this question . Why ? The reduced level of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate ( known as ZDDP , ZDP or ZnDTP ) in modern motor oil has been linked to increasing numbers of tappet and camshaft failures in vintage engines . <p> What Exactly Is the Problem ? <p> The cam/tappet failure problems often begin with a freshly rebuilt engine that starts making expensive-sounding noises . Inspection might reveal that the bottom of one or more tappets is gone . Instead of a smooth , machined surface , the face of the tappet will look like the surface of the moon . If the problem is the camshaft , it will exhibit one or more worn lobes . <p> Just one failed tappet or cam lobe will create a problem , as the damage results from direct metal-to-metal contact . With metal debris in the sump , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Choosing an assembly lube and motor oil is critical in preventing this metal-to-metal contact . <p> Corrosion , which occurs over time when classics are not driven , is another serious issue . Normal motor oil is designed to lubricate , not to coat or protect metal surfaces from corrosion . All oil absorbs moisture from the atmosphere . Running the engine will eliminate this moisture , but leaving a car to sit for extended periods of time will lead to corrosion . Using an oil product that forms a clinging protective film on the exposed metal parts can minimize this problem . If the oil contains special corrosion inhibitors , all the better . <p> Repair shops specializing in British cars have been dealing with these issues for years , and most have developed a combination of parts , machine work , engine prep and lubricants to reduce these problems . Many shops cite assembly lube , oil and the amount of ZDDP in the oil as major concerns . <p> What Is ZDDP ? <p> Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate is an oil supplement that has served as the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils for the past 70 years " until recently . What does it do ? When exposed to heat and pressure , ZDDP forms a protective film on metal surfaces that prevents parts ( cam lobes and tappets , for example ) from making metal-to-metal contact . <p> Why Do I Suddenly Need ZDDP ? <p> ZDDP has been phased out because it damages catalytic converters . Small amounts of zinc and phosphorus in the ZDDP coat the catalytic material , reducing the effective life of the converter . The ZDDP level in motor oil was reduced from 0.15 to 0.12 percent ( 1,500 to 1,200 PPM ) in 1993 , and further reduced from 0.08 to 0.06 percent ( 800 to 600 PPM ) in API SM-grade oil in 2004 . But is this level enough for an older engine , especially when it is n't run frequently ? And is it enough to protect the cam and lifters in a freshly rebuilt older engine during the critical break-in period ? <p> The experience of hundreds of professional engine rebuilders , cam manufacturers and restorers indicates the mandated ZDDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 75 percent of reported cam/tappet failures were due to the reduction in ZDDP . Association Technical Bulletin 2333R ( November 2007 ) says current engine oils used by engine manufacturers in new car production should not be used for initial flat tappet/camshaft break-in . It recommends adding additional zinc for camshaft and lifter break-in . Most cam manufacturers also have specific instructions regarding assembly lube and break-in oil , citing cam/ tappet failures . <p> So What Should I Do ? <p> The following guidelines can help you prevent cam/tappet failure and protect your engine . <p> Initial Break-In Period ( First 30 minutes ) <p> Use oil with ZDDP at 0.14 to 0.15 percent by weight ( 1,400 to 1,500 PPM ) to provide the additional protection needed to maximize the chances of a successful cam/tappet break-in . <p> First 500 Miles After Initial Break-In <p> After that initial 20- to 30-minute break-in period , change the oil and oil filter . The oil you run after break-in will not need as much ZDDP ; 0.10 to 0.12 percent ZDDP will provide protection without risking chemical corrosion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 500 miles , change the oil and filter again , using oil with the same ZDDP level , 0.10 to 0.12 percent . <p> After the First 1,000 Miles ( Car Driven Infrequently ) <p> If you do n't drive your car once a week for 30 minutes or more with the oil between 170 and 200 degrees , consider using oil formulated specifically for classic cars . This oil has a mixture of additives designed to deal with the moisture , corrosion and acids in engines that sit for extended periods of time . Change your oil every 3,000 miles or every six months , whichever comes first . If you live in an area with high humidity , change the oil and filter four times a year . <p> After the First 1,000 Miles ( Car Driven Frequently ) <p> If you drive your car once a week for 30 minutes or more with the oil between 170 and 200 degrees , you have more options . Driving the car frequently will minimize the amount of acid , water and water vapor in the crankcase , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cam lobes and lifters . Using 20W-50 API SM oil with 0.08 percent ZDDP can be fine , but if you are more conservative , a ZDDP level of 0.10 to 0.12 percent will provide additional protection .

Just attend the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to be amazed at the advance in electronic gadgets from one year to the next . Automotive electronics are moving along at virtually the same pace " on-board engine-management systems literally control every facet of drivetrain operation . While part of the intrigue of owning a vintage car is a return to a simpler time , there 's no reason not to make modern upgrades , especially if they enhance the ownership experience and are non-invasive . <p> A perfect example is converting your car from a points-and-condensor ignition system to a more modern magnetic-impluse electronic system . This eliminates the need to replace and set points and replace condensors on a routine basis . More importantly , an electronic ignition doubles the amount of spark energy at the sparkplug for quicker starts , more power , and fewer emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vintage British sports cars . We decided to install one in a ' 75 TR6 . <p> Richard and Craig Tarnutzer volunteered their TR6 for the installation . The TR6 has been a great father-son project . Initially , Richard looked for a TR4 , but he eventually settled for a more-affordable TR6 . His Triumph is a mechanically solid California car that Richard and son Craig have been cosmetically restoring . Craig , who just turned 16 and has almost no mechanical experience , installed the Petronix Ignitor system in less than 30 minutes . He also added a Pertronix Flame-Thrower 40,000-volt ignition coil to further boost ignition output . Now the Tarnutzer 's TR6 starts better , idles smoother , and seems to have more get-up and go ! <p> 1 . The first step is to remove the distributor cap and push it out of the way . Do not remove the spark plug wires . <p> 4 . We wiped the distributor plate with a rag , then fastened the Ignitor adapter plate with the single countersunk flathead screw . <p> 7 . Push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributor housing and pull the wires through so there is n't a lot of slack inside of the distributor . <p> 11 . With the coil bolted back in place , we found that the Ignitor wire leads needed larger connectors for the spade-type connections on the coil . We snipped off the old ones and crimped the appropriate connectors onto the Ignitor wires . At this time , you could also trim them to the proper length . <p> 3 . Next , remove the points , condenser and grommet that fits in the housing of the distributor . The points and condenser simply unscrew from the plate . <p> 6 . Craig then slid the magnetic sleeve over the distributor shaft and points cam . Rotate it back and forth until you feel it line up , then push it all the way down . <p> 10 .

Al was then a young man living in Los Angeles and the lure of the TC was irresistible . Al became an avid TC enthusiast , and after reading about the successful road rallies being held on the East Coast , in the summer of 1948 he decided to organize one himself . It was one of the first rallies to be held on the West Coast . <p> The rally , which ended in Santa Barbara ( where we are now based ) , brought Al into contact with a bunch of fellow MG enthusiasts . He quickly discovered they all shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not widely available . Al saw the opportunity and opened an MG repair shop . <p> Although the company originally specialized in service , a growing demand for spare parts led to an ever greater emphasis on parts supply . After moving to Goleta in 1961 , Al published his first MG parts catalog in 1962 . <p> As enthusiasts embraced the British sports car movement , Moss Motors built catalogs for the MGA , MGB , Austin-Healey and Jaguar 's XK120-140-150 series . In 1977 , Al purchased 48 tons of ' obsolete ' inventory directly from Standard Triumph in England , a shipment which filled no less than four 40ft containers , and was in fact , the largest single buyout of TR2-3-4 spares ever . <p> By 1977 , Moss Motors was established as an industry leader .

Moss continued to update and revise its catalogs , and the business grew rapidly as more products were added to the line . <p> It was during the late seventies that Moss greatly expanded its product research and new product development activities . So many critical components had been discontinued , it was obvious that many British classics would be scrapped , simply because they could not be repaired for lack of parts . In order to keep the business and the hobby alive , Moss took on ever larger development projects . Ultimately , a complete upholstery manufacturing division was established to fill the demand for show quality interiors . The effort continues to this day , and is a great contributor to our strength . <p> In 1982 , Howard Goldman opened a retail car dealership , Moss Jaguar , in downtown Santa Barbara . This operation , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rover and earned a reputation as one of the premier dealers in the US . Harry , a former British car mechanic and repair shop owner , earned a national reputation as a meticulous , customer oriented service director and general manager . <p> In 1983 , Moss acquired a company called Start Your Engines in Beltsville , MD . Start Your Engines was one of the pioneering Triumph parts and restoration specialists . This acquisition not only helped us expand our Triumph range , but also yielded a number of Triumph specialists with considerable expertise , many of whom are still with Moss . In 1985 , Moss purchased a wholesale automotive supplier , eventually known as CARS . <p> By 1988 , Moss Motors was the largest supplier of vintage British sports car spares . The sales staff had grown from 4 to 18 and 12,000 square feet had been added to the main warehouse in Goleta .

Moss Motors stepped up and bought the lot . <p> Once again opportunity knocked and in 1989 Moss Jaguar was sold to help fund the acquisition of Classic British Sportscar Spares . This UK based organization included some of the most respected names in the industry . Among them were Cox &amp; Buckles , Britain 's foremost Triumph specialists and their associate company Triumphtune , the original Sprite &amp; Midget Centre in Richmond , Stafford 's MG parts in Manchester , and Naylor Bros in Shipley , West Yorkshire . The group became known collectively as Moss Europe . Also in 1989 , the Nisonger Corporation was purchased by the Milard Group , as the holding company for the various companies within Moss was known . <p> The transatlantic connection worked well , but early in 1993 a strategic decision was made to sell the European operation to Ingham PLC , a public textile and motor parts company .

At the same time the upholstery manufacturing and machine shop were consolidated into one nearby facility . <p> In 1994 an experiment in diversification led to our highly succesful Mazda Miata accessories program . The Miata , very British in concept , attracted an involved and enthusiastic customer base and Moss replied with a range of enthusiast products . <p> In late 1998 Howard decided it was time to step aside and leave the next generation of growth to a new team .

@@23831211 @3831211/ <h> The Ethanol Issue <p> By Moss Technical Services <p> Gasoline containing ethanol has become the new standard for fuel , and it presents a new set of challenges and work for classic car owners . You 've got to be vigilant now to ensure a good running engine and prevent damage to your cherished car . <p> What 's the problem , you ask ? <p> Ethanol , made from corn or grain , is added to gasoline to oxygenate it , replacing the older additive , MTBE . Names for gasoline mixed with ethanol include E10 , gasohol , corn fuel , alcohol fuel , and reformulated or renewable fuel . <p> The key problem is that ethanol absorbs water from the atmosphere . In fact , fuel with 10 percent ethanol absorbs up to 50 times more water than standard gasoline . Older gas tanks found in many classic cars vent to the atmosphere , increasing the likelihood that moisture will be absorbed into the gas tank at a rapid pace . <p> The end result of water in the fuel is phase separation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gasoline mixed with a little ethanol on top , and a thinner layer on the bottom consisting of water mixed with most of the ethanol . And it does n't take much water for this to happen " phase separation occurs in a gallon of 10 percent ethanol blend with just 3.8 teaspoons of water . <p> Vented or Closed Fuel Tank ? <p> Not sure whether your British car has a vented or closed fuel tank ? You need to know this detail in order to have a feel for how long the gas in your tank will remain good . A sure giveaway of a closed tank is the presence of a carbon canister , which was added for pollution control purposes along with the closed fuel tanks . It 's often located at the back of the engine compartment , on the passenger side . To verify what it looks like and the positioning in your car , look at the diagram of the engine compartment for your car model on the Moss website , mossmotors.com . Note that some aftermarket gas caps are vented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . <p> Reduced fuel longevity : A gasoline/ethanol blend absorbs water until it triggers phase separation . The blend has a 90-day product life in a closed tank , but lasts just 30 to 45 days in a vented tank often found in classic cars . With 10 percent ethanol blends , owners are supposed to replace the fuel in vented tanks about once a month by driving or draining , taking into consideration the humidity in the atmosphere and temperatures . <p> Lower fuel octane : The ethanol in a gasoline blend provides some of the octane rating . When phase separation occurs , the octane rating of the remaining fuel can drop by as much as three points . <p> Poor engine performance:The fuel pump could easily pick up a slug of the water/ethanol slurry at the bottom of the tank , interrupting the flow of gas to the engine . This will cause the engine to miss , run rough and possibly stall altogether . <p> Corrosion and rust : Water in the bottom of the fuel tank and inside the fuel lines will cause corrosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will loosen that up , along with bits of sediment and deposits . The resulting debris floating in the fuel could clog fuel filters , fuel lines and carburetor float valves . <p> Specific Parts Affected by Ethanol <p> Fuel tank : Ethanol could dislodge sediment and deposits in older gas tanks and fuel lines . Loose debris in the fuel could clog the fuel filter , or cause engine flooding if the carburetor float valve sticks . <p> Carburetor float valve : Float valve needles on early cars were brass , and these were replaced with plastic needles or brass needles with Viton ( a specific type of rubber ) tips . Ethanol can cause the plastic needles to swell up and stick either open or shut , which causes either massive flooding or starves the carburetor for fuel . Some owners have resorted to shaving down the plastic needle to get it to ride smoothly and seat properly . Instead , you can install an all-brass needle and seat , or a Vitontipped needle if available for your car model , which are not affected by lower levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found specifically/ only in the TR4 and 4A made of foam covered with a skin may deteriorate when exposed to ethanol . Other plastic floats , like those used by SU , may also be affected . <p> Hoses : Ethanol could dry out or deteriorate rubber hoses . <p> Seals : Ethanol could shrink , swell or deteriorate seals , depending on the material . <p> Gaskets : Ethanol may deteriorate the rubber in rubber/cork composite gaskets . Fiber washers and gaskets are not affected . <p> Run your engine on fresh fuel from a major supplier in a location with lots of traffic . <p> Add fuel stabilizers when you put gas in your car to lengthen the life span of the fuel . <p> Buy higher-octane gasoline to be certain your engine gets the minimum octane necessary for good performance . <p> Keep track of the dates you buy fuel , how much you bought , and how much is in the tank when left sitting for a period of time . <p> Keep a log book for reference . <p> If you have a closed tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hiss of air escaping when you take the gas cap off after driving . <p> Test your gas tank periodically to see if water is accumulating or phase separation has occurred . <p> Treat accordingly . <p> If you do n't have a fuel filter before the carburetor ( many British cars only have a screen ) , consider installing one to catch loosened rust and sediments from the gas tank before it clogs engine components . Moss offers one with a glass bowl for at-a-glance inspection , yet it features a period-correct look ( Fuel Pressure Regulator/ Filter #377-435 ) . Check your fuel filter often . <p> Consider adding a second fuel filter between the tank and the fuel pump to protect the fuel pump from damage from loose debris from the tank ( Moss part #377-310 ) . <p> Keep engine parts well lubricated to counteract the solvent effect of ethanol . <p> Regularly inspect all fuel system components , seals and connectors from the tank to the carburetor . Ensure there are no leaks and the system is in good shape . <p> Full or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fuel tank completely full or near empty ? The answer is n't clear . It all depends on how you 're using your car , the humidity where you live , the type of tank found in your car , and your willingness to closely monitor the situation . <p> During the driving season : <p> Some British car owners keep very little fuel ( treated with fuel stabilizer ) in their tank , and when they take it out , they first stop at the gas station to put in about the amount of gas they think they will need . That way they are always running fresh gas , and they park it back in the garage with a small amount of treated fuel to minimize the amount of gas that could go bad and separate . But British fuel gauges are notoriously inaccurate , so you could run the risk of running out of gas on the way to the gas station . <p> Other owners keep the tank completely full , which means the surface of the fuel exposed to the humidity in the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck rather than the larger surface area inside the tank . Of course absorption of water by the ethanol is affected by whether the tank is vented or not , and by the humidity at that time of year . But considering the short life span for ethanol/gasoline blends , you 'll have to add fuel stabilizers and drive the car enough to regularly burn up the gas so your whole tank of fuel does n't go bad . <p> During the winter : <p> Whether you 're storing your car over the winter or driving it every once in a while in cold temperatures , your strategy for your fuel tank may be different at this time of year . If you leave a vented tank full , even with fuel stabilizers , you 'll have phase separation and water in two months . That means draining the tank every two months to eliminate the bad fuel and harmful water . If you leave it until spring , you could have to deal with the effects of rust and also still have to drain the tank . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be able to get through the winter with fuel stabilizers , which gives the fuel a six-month life span . You could drive out of the garage come spring unscathed . To be sure , test the tank for the presence of water first , and emulsify or drain the tank contents if necessary . If you leave your tank near empty with just a bit of treated fuel in the bottom during the winter , you wo n't have much ethanol to absorb water into the tank or much gas to go bad . But the steel walls of a near-empty fuel tank will condense with the shifting cold-warm temperatures , creating more water in the tank and potentially rusting the sidewalls , as well as the floor of the tank where the water accumulates . This condensation would happen in both vented and closed empty tanks . <p> Ethanol Solutions <p> 1 . Use a fuel stabilizer when you put gas in your British car . <p> Most of us do n't drive our classic cars on a daily basis , so the short gasoline/ethanol life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 days in a closed tank , is a problem . In order to extend the life of your car 's fuel and delay the phase separation that will eventually occur , you can add a fuel stabilizer to your tank every time you put fuel into it if you 're not sure you 'll use the gas within the product life span . <p> E-Xtend doubles the fuel 's life to about 60 days in a vented tank , and about 180 days in a closed tank . It also contains antioxidants and degumming agents to fight sludge and prevent resin/gum deposits in the fuel tank . As a result , the fuel filter stays cleaner longer and the engine runs better . <p> For fuel with 10 percent ethanol , the ratio is one ounce of E-Xtend for every six gallons of fuel , so one 8-ounce bottle will treat 48 gallons of fuel . The longneck bottle makes it easy to pour into the filler neck . <p> When you 're not driving your car and putting fresh gas into the tank , or after the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tank to determine if water is present or if phase separation has occurred . <p> One test method is loosening the fuel tank 's drain plug and capturing a small sample of fuel from the bottom of the tank in a clear container for inspection . Since water collects at the bottom of the tank , you should be able to see the two layers if water is present " a pink layer of gasoline on the top , and a clear or white layer of water and ethanol on the bottom . It looks a lot like unmixed salad dressing . You can use a test kit on the drain sample if it appears mixed up . <p> If your tank construction allows a dipstick ( a dowel or rod works well ) to go from the filler neck all the way to the bottom of the tank , you can use a test kit for easier and more reliable results . ( This test method wo n't work on car models with a bent filler neck unless you can figure out a flexible dipstick that hits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indicator on the end of the dipstick ; it turns red where there is water in the fuel tank . For example , if there 's a half-inch of water in the tank , the stick shows a half-inch of red . <p> 3 . Add an emulsifier to treat separated fuel layers . <p> If you find water in the tank and phase separation has occurred , you can add an emulsifier to the fuel to remix the gasoline , ethanol and water . ( Note that if there 's an excessive amount of water , you may have to drain the contaminated fuel from the tank . ) <p> E-Zorb emulsifies the water/ethanol layer at the bottom of the gas tank created by fuel phase separation . The water and ethanol mixes back into the rest of the fuel in the tank . The water passes with the gasoline through the engine and is released as steam . The fuel regains the octane ( up to three points ) that was lost when most of the ethanol separated from the gasoline . <p> The ratio is one ounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 16 oz. ) bottle will treat 320 gallons of fuel . You 'll have to agitate the fuel and emulsifier in the tank by rocking the car from side to side , and bouncing it up and down . Make sure your suspension can handle this ! <p> Be sure to check out the Moss tech video on Dealing With Ethanol at mossmotors.com. 
@@23831224 @3831224/ <p> MGB Convertible Top Buyers GuideWhen looking to purchase a convertible top for your MGB there are a couple of key points of information you need to make a proper and informed decision . <p> 1 . What top frame do I have ? We will address the first part of this question , well first . The first thing to understand is that there are three different designs of folding bows , where the top folds down into the area behind the seats and one set of removable bows , where the top and bows are removed and stored in the trunk , or boot for British speakers . For British speakers , the top is also called " a hood " , which can get really confusing . <p> We call the first two folding bow designs " Grey Scissor Bows , because they are painted grey and the support arms fold towards the center of the car , like scissors.These bows were installed up to 1971 , when they were replaced by the superior Black Folding Frame design . <p> Interchangeability of Tops The four frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of MGB , and it is very important to identify what you have , because your new top must be correct for your frame design . This is also a good time to upgrade your car to a different frame and top if you wish . A popular alternative to the 1962- ' 70 Grey scissor folding frame is the two piece Grey stow-away frame . Changing to the Stow-Away frame is straight forward . The front bow assembly is unbolted from the original folding frame and reused . We recommend that chrome tonneau sockets ( 472-330 x 2 ) and pozi-drive screws ( 323-001 x 6 ) be used to make the installation look original . Because the Stow-Away design is a popular retrofit , we do offer tops with non-original zip out rear windows that make summertime driving more comfortable . <p> 2 . What was the original top material and what materials are available today ? The standard material for British tops was what we call Everflex . It is a pretty thin material that folds and bends easily . As far as today 's materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have that " as it left the showroom look " then go with the Everlfex . <p> Robbins Crush Grain Vinyl " The best American vinyl tops we 've seen , period . By using Haartz Supreme 36-oz. pinpoint-grain vinyl ( backed with pre-shrunk cotton cloth ) , you get a superior product . For greater durability and to ensure the seams remain water tight , seams are stitched , then electronically sealed . The 40-gauge rear window is made from Regalite B.U.V. Ultralight plastic , which offers superior resistance to UV rays and scratches . We offer tops in non-original American vinyl as an alternative to the more expensive British Everflex . Although the grain pattern is similar to Everflex , it is not going to pass as original . Feedback from customers generally indicates the American vinyl tops are a little stiffer than the Everflex . Aside from the originality aspect , these are superior tops in every way , and offer outstanding value for the money . <p> Robbins Imported English Everflex Vinyl " If you want your top to be as close to original as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . Made in England and imported by Robbins , this material is accepted as original for all MGBs . <p> Robbins Stayfast Canvas " Absolutely the finest cloth top available . If originality is not your primary concern , Robbins Stayfast offers an opportunity to upgrade your top . Stayfast fabric uses 100% acrylic Glen Raven surface cloth , laminated to a pre-shrunk cotton backing cloth . Stayfast is engineered for high tensile and tear strength , but the fabric stays soft , supple and color-fast . The 40-gauge rear window is made from Regalite B.U.V. Ultralight plastic for superior resistance to UV rays and scratches . Because it is a woven fabric , it looks like the top on a Rolls-Royce Corniche more than a top on a British Sports car , and the biggest problem when the top is up is that people just naturally want to touch it . Stayfast has a practical side as well . Stayfast canvas resists fading and shrinking better than vinyl and does not stiffen up at lower temperatures . This means you do n't have to be Hercules to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you describe how the seams are put together ? If a company is going to cut corners and save time and money this is the area in which they are going to do it , and many do . Many companies glue seams and put in one row ( if you are lucky two rows ) of stitching , and when first installed everything looks OK . As time marches on and the glue goes through the cold and hot cycles associated with daily temperatures , it starts to breakdown and puts all the stress on the seams . Without the additional holding of the glue the stitched seams will start to come apart . On the other hand Robbins spent their time , energy and resources figuring out a better way to hold seams together rather then searching out a better glue . The answer was heatsealing the seams . Heatsealing is essentially welding the material together which is stronger than any glue will be . On top of the heatsealing Robbins then reinforces the seams with double stitching to give the " joints " extra support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top ? All the necessary fasteners are included in our kits but they are not installed as there may be variations in the locations of existing mounting hardware . <p> 5 . Why Robbins Auto Tops ? Over the years , Moss has offered tops from a variety of manufacturers . We settled on Robbins for several reasons , the primary consideration being quality . Robbins has a reputation among British car owners and restorers that is second to none . Robbins is committed to manufacturing high quality products which offer long term value to convertible owners . <p> Quality Material &amp; Custom Workmanship : Robbins uses only first quality top material and original style components . Combine that with the finest custom workmanship , and you end up with well made long lasting tops that fit correctly and look sharp . <p> Computerized Cutting : Robbins has invested heavily in modern computer aided production equipment By using a Gerber- Cutting System and its CNC controls , materials can be processed without tooling by loading digitized patterns for cutting vinyl and canvas top material . This produces pieces that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tops proceeds smoothly , and the finished product is consistent and the installed fit is correct . <p> Factory Designs Duplicated or Improved : Robbins duplicates factory designs , and improves upon them when necessary . They add reinforcements where experience has shown them to be necessary . Advances in materials and technology have resulted in better heatsealing processes , which improves the quality and durability of the tops they make . Tops made with American Crush grain vinyl incorporate numerous modern features while the emphasis is on originality with the British Everflex tops . <p> Heatsealed Reinforcements : Robbins heatseals reinforcements in most of our products for extra strength and to prevent side to side shrinkage in tops . Heatsealed reinforcements will not bubble or fail over time as do most glued reinforcements . It takes more time and costs more , and you will never notice it looking at the top , but it means the useful life of the top is extended . <p> Finish and Detail : Robbins purchases full width cloth and vinyl binding materials that are run to our specifications , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other products . Our bindings are more supple and sew on easily without bunching around tight curves on tops . Stitching in our products is held to a uniform length , and we do not ship products with broken or erratic stitches . <p> Testing and Quality Systems : Robbins performs stretch testing , sew testing and heatseal testing on samples of every batch of material they receive . Thread and plastic sheets used to make the rear windows are also tested before any of the material is passed on to the production floor . Robbins passed the tough Ford Q1 Quality Audit , and they are currently working to obtain ISO 9000 quality system certification . They are committed to continuous improvement of their processes , products and level of service . <p> Continuity Since 1943 : Three generations of the Robbins family have owned and operated Robbins Auto Top Co . Their experience in the design , manufacturing and installation of convertible tops , glass and plastic windows , tonneau covers and related products is unmatched in the industry . <p> Using What They Manufacture : Robbins business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate their own shop as an R &amp; D center , where Robbins products are installed daily to check the fit and appearance . Not many other top manufacturers can say that . The advantages are many . We knew we had a problem with one of the Robbins MGB tops we carry , but it was intermittent and we could not pin it down . We finally arranged to have Robbins fit one of the problem tops on a customer 's car , they realized that the early 1963 folding top frame required a pattern of its own , so they made one . There are not many early ' 63 MGBs running around , but they did it anyway . <p> 6 . Do I have to have the top professionally installed ? Although good results may be achieved by non-professionals , best results are achieved by a professional with experience with MGB top installation . For this reason our tops do not come with installation instructions .

@@23831437 @3831437/ <p> One of the most frequently asked questions faced by the Moss Motors technical department is , " What size tire should I buy ? " In response , here 's a size-matters look at the four black round things that keep your sports car from dragging on the ground . <p> Luckily , British sports cars were originally designed with a fairly limited range of wheel and tire combinations ( see OEM Sizes chart ) . So , we can begin lumping some applications together . In the interest simplicity , the original fittings are followed by some caveats . ( Purists please note : We are quite aware of the minor production differences and have chosen the most popular OE sizes . ) <p> Behind The Numbers <p> These factory-fitment tires have Numeric System sizing . The first digits indicate the nominal cross-sectional width of the tire , and the last digits are the wheel rim diameter . The approximate diameter of the tires can be determined by digging into auld tire lore . An aspect ratio is the percentage of the section height to section width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compare this to the modern tires with 50-60 aspect ratios ( commonly called " series " ) and it becomes obvious that your classic chariot was designed to operate on tires that were very tall and skinny in comparison to the rubber strips masquerading as tires on today 's sport-compact street racers . <p> Original-style-bias-ply ( known to Brits as " cross-ply " ) tires have a much narrower tread width or contact patch than modern radial tires . This becomes an important issue when understanding the loading experienced by early suspension designs . With a typical tread width of less than 4 " , the original bias-ply tires break free easily , reducing the loading on the wheels and suspension . Watching early sportscar racing footage shows that the current sport-compact " drifting " craze is far from a modern phenomena . Going sideways around corners with the tail hanging out was the real test of sportscar driving . <p> Even with these early tires , wheel failure was a problem , and most manufacturers had to increase wheel strength to withstand spirited driving . <p> As tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radial tires were first fitted as options , then later as standard equipment . <p> The first radial tires to see service on British sportscars were labeled in the Metric Sizing System , which again did not have a stated aspect ratio . By this time , " low profile " tires were popular , and the aspect ratio ranged from 78 to 82 depending on manufacturer and date , the earlier tires being taller . Comparing the original-fitment radial tires with the earlier OE bias-ply sizes show how little diameter-and hence , geering-changed ( See Original Fitment Sizes chart ) . <p> Unfortunately , many of the original sizes are no longer available , so wider , lower-profile tires are substituted . The resulting domino effect causes changes in gearing and steering effort-and often a decrease in safety and handling . Much of these cars ' charm comes from their nimble feeling , which is often lost with overly wide tires . Heavy low-speed steering and lack of crispness when cornering are symptoms of too wide a tire . At a certain point , wider is n't better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tires that are matched correctly to the wheel . In some cases this means ordering tires from companies that specialize in vintage tires because modern radials are too wide to be safe on the original wheels . <p> Matching factory tire diameter is also necessary to retain correct odometer accuracy , ride height , and final-drvie gearing . Aesthetically , a tire that 's too short may look out of place in the wheelwell . The Typical Modern Tire Sizes charts give calculated dimensions of available tires ; compare these diameters and recommended wheel widths . ( Wheel width is measured between the two bead mounting surfaces of the wheel , not from edge to edge . ) <p> When completing a restoration many choices affect safety . Maintaining the car 's original look and handling are important to many restorers , yet when it comes time to choose tires , cost and availability often outweigh aesthetics . Luckily , a few companies ( some of which are listed below ) specialize in stock , period-correct-bias-ply tires for British sportscars for those who want to accurately restore early cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radials are available that fit well and offer increased hanging and safety . Just do n't be tempted to install an incorrect-size tire because it 's on sale . Use this article to help enjoy your sportscar the way it 's engineers intended . 
@@23831451 @3831451/ <p> Owners have been converting disc wheel MGAs to wire wheels for decades . Many started off with the front , which is easy . You need the appropriate splined hubs , knockoffs , and the brake drums . When they get to the rear , it gets more complicated . The entire MGA wire wheel rear axle housing is narrower , and the axles are 7/8 " shorter than those fitted to cars with disc wheels . This was done to compensate for the rear wire wheel hubs , which take up more room . If they had not made the axle narrower , the wire wheels would sit out too far , and your tires would rub up against the inside of the fender . The solution for many owners was to buy an entire MGA wire wheel rear axle . That is getting harder to do , and when you can find one , they are not necessarily cheap .

I 've also found that working on old sports cars is far more enjoyable when carried out in a well lit , clean and efficiently organized work area . <p> A good rugged workbench and an efficient parts washer are perhaps the two most important elements in any well equipped hobby shop and having priced " professional " parts washing equipment and a range of rugged workbenches , I realized that short of taking out a second mortgage , I needed to develop a more economical alternative . <p> The workbench/parts washing combination described below has served me well for a considerable number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " borrowed " from production parts washers then on the market , while the bench is typical of designs found in home handyman books .

I finished off the plywood top with tempered masonite which is smooth , relatively durable and easy to keep clean . While the masonite itself is glued in place , the oak edge is attached with screws to allow for removal and easy replacement of the cemented masonite . The edge trim screws , by the way , are chrome plated TD dashboard screws and provide a nice finishing touch ! <p> The parts washing aspect of the design is simple yet highly effective . The water filtration system could n't be more efficient as all solids and heavy greases settle to the bottom of the tank while the clean solvent floats to the surface of the water where it is recycled . The water truly does stay put and does n't mix with the solvent . I 've used my washer extensively and have never had to change the solvent or clean the tank .

By removing the midsection , and rewelding with continuous bead , the resized tank can be made airtight to eliminate solvent evaporation and fumes . However , since the bottom six inches or so is filled with water , rust could become a problem .

@@23831503 @3831503/ <p> Want to go to the next level with your supercharged Miata ? The Jackson Racing Air/Water Intercooler system is just the ticket . Increasing boost adds horsepower , but it also creates heat . One method to control detonation with increased boost levels is to retard your static timing . This cures detonation but also leaves you with sluggish throttle response in the lower end of the RPM range . Our Air/Water Intercooler uses a cooling core that fits in place of cross over tube . An extremely durable , high efficiency pump circulates coolant through a large heat exchanger . The result is a massive drop in intake temperatures , up to 100 degrees . Additionally , because our Intercooler is short in length , boost pressure drop is negligible . Highly advanced timing can be utilized along with more boost . This system comes complete with everything required for installation , including detailed instructions . It also includes Jackson Racing 's 2 year , 100,000 mile warranty .

@@23831573 @3831573/ <p> Gates ' PowerGrip clamps are an idea long overdue . Unlike worm style metal clamps that have a tendency to loosen for no reason . Or worse yet , use their razor like edges to cut a gash in a radiator hose leaving you stranded . PowerGrip clamps are made from a heat shrinkable thermoplastic material that provides a strong and dynamic seal . What 's more , they are completely resistant to all automotive fluids . For best performance , be sure to select the PowerGrip clamp that is closest to the OD of the hose once it is installed . Installation requires a heat gun ( a 1000 watt hair dryer will work ) to shrink the clamp to size . To remove an installed PowerGrip clamp , cut it with a soldering iron , or use the PowerGrip cutting tool . Use of any other cutting tool may damage the hose .

@@23831597 @3831597/ <h> The Moss MGTD Pickup Truck <h> Story by E. Alan ( Al ) Moss and Chris Couper <p> The MGTD pickup shortly after it was created by Richter Motors . Note the solid pickup bed and dark red color . Also note that it had traditional slotted TD wheels and painted headlamps . From Edition 18 of Moss Motors parts catalog <p> Like the first Arnolt cars , the MGTD pickup was created from the remains of two wrecked MGTD 's . <p> There was a speed equipment shop , catering to the hot rod and race car trade , called Bell Auto Parts , surprisingly enough , located in Bell , California . The owner was Roy Richter , an early builder and driver of midget racing cars In the mid-1950s , Roy opened an MG and Jaguar agency ( Richter Motors ) in South Gate . In 1951 or 1952 , Roy commissioned two of his employees , Chuck Reynolds and George Beavis to build a pickup truck from the remains of two wrecked TDs . Roy was the founder of Bell Helmets , today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importer of J2 Allards for a short time , winning the Santa Ana Blimp Base road race in 1950 . George Beavis hailed from Australia , where he was a champion Midget driver . Around 1953 , he campaigned a stock bodied TD with an Offy engine under the hood ! He later ran an MG-based Offy special . I nearly hired George in the early 70 's to run my machine shop stated Al . <p> The TD pickup was born . On the back cover of Moss Motor 's early T-Series catalogs , in the photo montage , there is a picture of the original pickup , still owned by Richter Motors , far right , 3 inches from the bottom . Al took this photo at one of the local road races . The truck was originally red in color , and remained so until Al purchased it . The two frames were welded together to provide about six additional inches in length . The body in back of the seats was finished off separate from the bed , which was a nearly square box , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configuration as regards to trim , lights , wheels , engine , etc . Rather unfortunately , instead of fabricating a gas tank to go under the bed , they made a vertical one to fit behind the seat , thus providing very limited room for the driver . <p> An early picture of the Moss version of the TD pickup . This was when Al Moss was in Los Angeles before he relocated Moss Motors to Goleta . <p> Around 1956 Al Moss was contacted by the current owner , wanting to know if he was interested in purchasing the truck . Al said , It was still located in East Los Angeles and I recall the two of us towing it with a rope to my Venice Blvd. shop . The vehicle was in pretty sad condition with a shot engine ( might have been a 1500 ) and in need of a major restoration , which Al gave it . Al completely dismantled the whole works , sandblasted all the body parts , painted the exterior and grille refrigerator white . Al installed a new Shorrock supercharger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of new chrome/polished Borrani knock-off wheels . Al put on as much TC trim as possible : door handles , headlamps with tripod inserts , " D " tail lamps , etc . The interior was all done in red leather . Al lined the bed with black Formica . Dale Runyan did the finishing touches : he made a beautiful top , cockpit cover and bed cover , all in black canvas-type top material . Al had the doors and bed hand lettered , as well as painting California Sports Car Club and Long Beach MG Club logos on each side . <p> While the truck was never used in Al 's business , he drove it regularly and it saw considerable service at many Southern California road races . These included Riverside , Pomona and probably Santa Barbara , where it towed a chariot to rotate the race judges and corner workers from turn to turn between races : sometimes quite a load but it handled it well . <p> The Moss version with chariot at a period race . <p> Al had a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears that the California DMV could not decide if it was a pickup or a roadster . He tried to get it registered as a pickup but the DMV stated it did not meet the minimum weight requirements . Al then tried to register it again as roadster but the DMV pointed out that it looked like a pickup truck . Al remembers ; Finally , I pointed out the bed cover , promised to NEVER EVER haul anything so much as a broom in back and they relented . So , I guess it is still a ROADSTER . <p> After Al moved to Santa Barbara in 1963 , he found he was not using the truck and subsequently sold it ( through Mike Goodman ? ) to the son of the owner of the Tiny Naylor restaurant chain in Los Angeles . I think he was using it to service their vending machines , stated Al . One day it got rear ended and the bed was rebuilt with an opening tailgate . Later on , the car changed hands several times and went to pot . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back . Once is enough to restore anything , so I called my good friend Jim Bigler and TOLD HIM HE WAS GOING TO BUY the pickup ! , remembered Al . Jim hemmed and hawed and said he did not want another vehicle , etc. etc. but Al prevailed and nearly forced him into buying it . At this time it was pretty much in need of another restoration . <p> The Moss version ( Goleta ) of the pickup prior to the accident that resulted in the tailgate change . Note the lettering on the rear . Also note the passenger . From Edition 18 of Moss Motors parts catalog . <p> In 1977 Al Moss coerced Jim Bigler of Commonwealth Classic Cars into buying it for his growing MG business . Jim purchased the pickup and a complete restoration was started , including new lettering in the old Moss Motors style designating the new owners business . Jim was planning on going to GoF XXIV , his first East Coast GoF , and wanted to go in style with the TD pickup as his masthead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . I concentrated on the body work , painting with white Dupont Imron enamel , and assembly , stated Chris . Tim Cane did the engine and transmission , and Evelyn Bigler did the softgoods . <p> Al provided Jim with a few photos and he made every effort to redo it as it was when Al had it . Even to the lettering , merely changing it from Moss Motors to Commonwealth Classic Cars . Al recalled , Jim was very proud of his job and anxious to show it to me . I first looked it over from the same side as the photos were taken , walked to the other side , and broke Jim 's heart ! On the left ( photographed ) side , at the rear , I had painted in small letters : " UNIT #7 " , which Jim duly replicated , on both sides . What his photos could not show , of course , was that on the other side it said : " UNIT #8 " . <p> While Al thought the pickup handled quite admirably , Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit like a truck . While the front end and suspension were strictly standard MGTD , the rear end had to be stiffened to allow for all the extra weight that could be carried Chris stated . Chris recalled , I had the opportunity to drive the MGTD pickup from Los Angeles to Detroit Michigan in 1977 to attend GoF XXIV in Dearborn . The ride was more like a MGTC than a MGTD . You noticed every bump in the road . One interesting part was driving through Kansas where there seemed to be an abundance of turtles on the roads . In the dark of night they made for interesting clatter and bone shattering thumps as they made their way around the rear tire and fender . For some odd reason even the steering was more like a TC . It seemed to have a lot of play in the wheel . Of course this may have been due to worn out parts . <p> Jim and Al again . Is there any wonder why the crankshaft gave out ? Notice the tailgate , the rear license plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red piping to match the red interior . This time the grill was painted to match the red interior while originally it was the body color . <p> During the entire trip I paid lots of attention to the oil pressure , remembered Chris . Each hour saw a noticeable drop on the gauge . After the 5 day trip Al Moss , Jerry Austin , Jim Bigler and Pete Thelander spent some time replacing the mainshaft bearings in the parking lot of the Dearborn Marriott . I did not have the pleasure of a return trip from Michigan back to California as I had arranged with a friend to cover that leg , recalled Chris . A few miles out of Detroit the crankshaft gave out and the pickup made the return trip to California in a U-Haul truck . <p> When Jim downscaled his MG business he sold the pickup back to the new owners of Moss Motors where it underwent another restoration and lettering . <p> MGTD Pickup Chronology <p> The MGTD pickup truck started life as an two ordinary MGTDs .
