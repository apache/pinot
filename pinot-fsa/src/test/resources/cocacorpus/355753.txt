@@76805266 @5505266/ <h> Menu <h> A Change of View : Using Visual Methods to Explore Experience in Qualitative Research <p> The topic of this bulletin arose from a talk given by Dr. Anna Bagnoli , who had used a variety of visual methods in addition to verbal interviews in order to holistically study young people 's identities. - Intrigued by the question of how such data could be collected and analysed to contribute to understandings of psychological topics , the author of this post recently carried out an interview with Dr. Bagnoli on behalf of the Open University Psychological Society ( Rouse , 2013 ) . - In this bulletin post the author will share what she has learnt from this interview and by researching the use of visual methods to explore experience and meaning . <p> The Use of Visual Based Methods in the Social Sciences <p> Whether it 's as a tool of assessment , a stimulus to trigger responses or a means of displaying cognitive models and presenting results , images have many uses in psychology ( Bagnoli , 2009 ; - Frith , Riley , Archer &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have involved coding or counting responses or behaviours. - More recently , interest has grown in performing qualitative research which focuses on the visual images themselves in order to explore participants ' experiences and meaning making ( Frith et al. , 2005 ) . <p> The use of images is not a new methodology but is rooted in disciplines such as anthropology and sociology ( Harper , 2002 ) . - Collier ( 1957 , as cited in Harper , 2002 ) highlighted the value of photographs as a visual tool in social research after using a photographic survey to help researchers to categorise the quality of housing in an examination of the environmental basis of stress ( Harper , 2002 ) . - Later , whilst exploring how families adapted to living in new environments , the research team used photographs of old and new surroundings to assist their interviews. - They found that the use of photos improved the quality of the interviews in many ways. - It prompted memory , reduced misunderstandings and elicited higher quality and more comprehensive interviews ( Harper , 2002 ) . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 ) named this method photo elicitation ' and it has since been used to research many topics in the social sciences , including experience of illness and homelessness ( Radley &amp; Taylor , 2003 ; Radley , Hodgetts &amp; Cullen , 2005 ) . <p> A valid approach ? <p> Described by Harper ( 2002 ) as a waif on the margins ' in disciplines such as psychology , photo elicitation and other visual methods have encountered some scepticism amongst social scientists and have only recently entered the mainstream ( Frith et al , 2005 ) . - Such wariness has been attributed to doubt over the validity of images , which are ambiguous and open to multiple and subjective interpretations. - This did not fit with psychology 's desire for objective data representing an accessible reality ( Frith et al. , 2005 ; Guillemin , 2004 ) . - Following the crisis of representation ' in social science there was a shift in thinking towards exploring meaning making and the construction of multiple realities. - From this perspective the ambiguous nature of visual data is not a difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted as reflecting a stable reality that the researcher can access. - Instead it is a way of constructing multiple realities influenced by social and cultural factors and situated in a particular time and space ( Frith et al. , 2005 ; Guillemin , 2004 ) . - This has led to an increasing acceptance that visual methods can provide valuable and valid data about issues of concern to the social sciences and there have been calls for further application of these methods to psychological questions ( Frith et al. , 2005 ) . <p> What Can We Learn From Visual Data ? <p> Beyond words <p> One advantage of visual methods is that not all participants are able to express themselves verbally , for example , young children. - Similarly , not all experience is best expressed through words ( e.g. pain ) and some people have a preference for visual expression ( Guillemin , 2004 ) . - Indeed , Bagnoli ( 2009 ) describes insight conveyed by images with a condensing quality , such as participants depicting themselves at a crossroads with different potential futures stretching ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion or production of images can aid the interview process by breaking the ice , prompting memory , improving the flow and content of the interview and helping establish rapport and shared understanding ( Harper , 2002 ; Bagnoli , 2009 ) . <p> The use of images can place control of the interview process with the participant , bringing out issues that are meaningful to them ( Frith et al. , 2005 ) . - This also elicits details that might otherwise be difficult to talk about leading to the disclosure of more sensitive issues and emotional details ( Bagnoli , 2009 ) . - Oliffe and Bottorff ( 2007 ) highlighted this in a study using photo elicitation to study men 's experiences of prostate cancer. - The authors felt that describing photos put participants in the role of expert , helping them to relate difficult details at their own pace . <p> A fresh perspective <p> The process of producing a visual image allows participants time to reflect on the topic being explored , which may not only produce rich and insightful images but inform a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants with the opportunity to reflect on experience in a different way. - This has been described as breaking the frame ' of experience ( Harper , 2002 ) . - For example , in photo elicitation studies participants are engaging with their environment and experience , of homelessness or as a hospital patient in a way that would not usually occur ( Radley &amp; Taylor , 2003 ; Radley et al . 2005 ) . <p> How Do Researchers Go About Collecting Visual Data ? <p> There are many ways of collecting visual data and the choice of method depends on the aims and theoretical perspective of the researcher. - This may include the following categories of visual data : <p> Visual methods can be used alone , in combination with verbal data or as one of a number of multisensory methods. - For example , Bagnoli ( 2004/2009 ) describes the use of multi-method biographies to holistically explore young people 's identities. - Methods included verbal interviews , written diaries and visual methods such as self-portraits , video diaries , relational maps and time-lines. - The aim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist with interviews as a kind of add-on ' but as an important method of eliciting and understanding experience in its own right ( Bagnoli , 2009 ) . <p> Some researchers have warned against using visual methods in isolation because this removes the image from the context in which it was produced ( Frith et al. , 2005 ) . - This was illustrated by Radley and Taylor ( 2003 ) who asked inpatients to photograph their hospital experience. - One participant 's photos of a bathroom only became meaningful in the context of her explanation. - The bathroom looking inwards represented the traumatic experience of pain , struggling and waiting for help following surgery. - The view looking outwards signified the end of that experience. - Photographs are described as being articulated into significance ' ( Radley &amp; Taylor , 2003 ) . <p> The collection of visual data varies according to : <p> who produces them " the researcher , participant alone or with input from the researcher <p> whether they pre-exist the research , are created for the research , are enduring or temporary ( Gibson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the topic of interest ( e.g. Guillemin , 2004 ) or is centred on the image ( e.g. Radley &amp; Taylor , 2003 ) . <p> These choices have different implications for data produced and analysis that can be conducted . <p> How Are Visual Data Analysed ? <p> Approaches differ but analysis often involves identification of themes which construct experience. - One framework recommends asking questions about the production of the image , the image itself and the relationship between the image and its audiences ( Rose , 2001 , as cited in Guillemin , 2004 ) . - Bagnoli ( 2009 ) uses a narrative analysis looking for the story told with multi-media coding , linking data collected through different mediums . <p> Examining the process through which an image was created is often viewed as a vital part of the analysis ( e.g. Radley &amp; Taylor , 2003 ) . - Attention is paid to what is made visible and what remains hidden. - This is important to understanding the construction of a particular reality ( Frith et al. , 2005 ) . - For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hospital inpatients was constricted by their mobility . <p> Other important considerations include : acknowledgement of the researcher 's part in the production process , identification of contradictions within the data and analysis of images within the context of data collected through other means ( Bagnoli , 2009 ; Radley , 2010 ) . <p> Challenges of Visual Methods <p> Researchers have reported that a minority of participants are uncomfortable with using visual methods and may occasionally refuse to engage with activities such as drawing ( Bagnoli , 2009 ) . - Interestingly , Guillemin ( 2004 ) incorporated refusal to take part into the data analysis , speculating that those who felt unable to draw were still coming to terms with and making sense of on-going medical conditions . <p> Activities may impose a particular way of thinking about the world. - Bagnoli ( 2009 ) gives the example of relational maps which assume participants see themselves at the centre of a relational world , allowing no opportunity for people to express an experience of aloneness. - There may also be problems of inclusivity. - Bagnoli ( 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take part in producing timelines due to difficulty with the concept of time . <p> Practical Difficulties <p> Studies involving photographs and videos are often limited by organisational rules. - This has occasionally proven unexpectedly useful , for example , although hospital authorities would not allow patients to take photographs alone ( in case they included other patients ) Radley and Taylor ( 2003 ) found that being present whilst patients chose and set up pictures led to field notes that were valuable during analysis. - - Other practical considerations include ensuring those involved know how to use technology such as cameras and the risk of losing data through accidents ( Gibson &amp; Riley , 2010 ) . <p> Ethical issues <p> The need for confidentiality and informed consent may mean that images have to be shared in an altered form e.g. in videos and photos faces may be blurred and voices disguised ( Frith et al. , 2005 ) . - Even then participants could be identified by those who know them e.g. by location or build ( Gibson &amp; Riley , 2010 ) . - If the participant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent it may not be possible to publish the image ( Rouse , 2013 ) . - Other ethical issues include questions around copyright ownership and potential negative interpretations following publication that are beyond the control of both researcher and participant ( Frith et al. , 2005 ) . <p> A Multisensory Approach <p> There are clearly many issues to consider when using visual methods , but they open up a fascinating opportunity to elicit and understand experience. - Images are used for other purposes in qualitative research e.g. conversation analysts examine interactions using video footage ( Gibson &amp; Riley , 2010 ) . Although verbal methods have been privileged our experience of the world is multisensory and researchers are acknowledging this through the use of increasingly multisensory approaches ( e.g. Taylor &amp; Coffey , 2009 ) , contributing to a rich understanding of people and the social world from multiple perspectives . <p> Lorna graduated from the Open University in 2009 with a BSc ( honours ) in psychology and is currently studying for an MSc in Psychological Research Methods at Anglia Ruskin University .

@@76805296 @5505296/ <h> Menu <h> Do Smokers Consist of a Single Group ? <p> When you think of a smoker , it is likely that you are imagining someone who goes through a pack of cigarettes per day and can often be found running to the nearest store to maintain their supply . Perhaps you amuse yourself watching your friend conspicuously leaving work to stand outside and huddle around their cigarette in the rain . Your assumption would often be correct as the majority of smokers are dependent on nicotine and smoke throughout the day . These daily smokers account for approximately 89% of current smokers in the UK ( Herbec , Brown and West 2014 ) , and between 67%-75% of smokers in the USA ( Coggins , Murrelle and Carchman 2009 ) . However , what about this missing proportion of smokers ? <p> As smoking restrictions become more and more stringent , the proportion of light smokers is predicted to increase ( Coggins et al . 2009 ; Shiffman 2009 ) . Although light smoking is often perceived as being less harmful , it is associated with- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other types of cancer as heavy smoking . For example , one prospective study found that male and female light smokers had a significantly increased risk of ischaemic heart disease and lung cancer in comparison to non-smokers ( Bjartveit and Tverdal 2005 ) . Furthermore , a systematic review found that light smokers show an intermediate risk between non-smokers and heavy smokers , - but interestingly they share the same risk for heart disease as heavy smokers ( Schane , Ling and Glantz 2009 ) . Considering this , it is important to understand what the differences are between the groups , and how we can identify them. - - - <h> What are the differences in smoking patterns ? <p> Table 1 shows the number of cigarettes smoked per day by light and heavy smokers in a small range of studies that include figures for both groups . Although there is some fluctuation , smoking rates are approximately 15 and 4 cigarettes per day for heavy and light smokers respectively . Additionally , it is interesting that light smokers often engage in voluntary days of abstinence . Compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study found that light smokers only tend to use cigarettes on only four days per week ( Shiffman , Tindle and Li 2013 ) . This suggests that light smokers are relatively free of nicotine dependence as the half-life of nicotine in the body is approximately two hours ( Advokat , Comaty and Julien 2014 ) . This is usually the time heavy smokers start to crave their next cigarette , but it appears that light smokers are comfortable without smoking for hours and even days after all of the nicotine has been metabolised and left the body . <p> Table 1 <p> Mean Number of Cigarettes Smoked Per Day in Light and Heavy smokers <p> Study <p> Smoking Group <p> Cigarettes Per Day <p> Herbec et al . ( 2014 ) <p> Daily <p> Non-Daily <p> 13.90 <p> 5.20 <p> Shiffman et al .

Whilst this does not provide a full explanation , non-daily smoking as a young adult is indeed an important risk factor for becoming a daily smoker later in life . One cohort study found that non-daily smoking at age 21 was associated with an odds ratio of 3.60 to becoming a daily smoker at age 38 upon follow-up ( Robertson , Losua and McGee 2015 ) . In terms of public health , this highlights the need for research to focus on non-daily adolescent smokers as they could be the target of interventions before they progress into heavier , daily smoking . However , it is not only a transient state on the road to becoming a heavy smoker . The non-daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been smoking for an average of 18 years , and those in Shiffman et al . ( 2013 ) had smoked an estimated 42,000 cigarettes . This suggests that light , non-daily smoking can also be a consistent behaviour pattern that can last throughout adulthood . <h> What are the reasons people report for smoking ? <p> Non-daily smokers appear to show markedly different smoking habits , but they also show large differences in their reported reasons for smoking . The dominant paradigm of addictive behaviour for smokers centred around continuing to use cigarettes to avoid experiencing the aversive effects of withdrawal ( Shiffman 2009 ) . This motive appears to be consistent with heavy smokers as they cite cravings , tolerance , and a loss of control over cigarette availability- as influences to smoke ( Shiffman et al . 2012a ) . This is also consistent in young heavy smokers- as- higher scores of nicotine dependence was associated with smoking due to craving and habit in a sample of college students ( Piasecki , Richardson and Smith 2007 ) . <p> On the other hand , non-daily smokers report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to smoking cues , weight control , sensory experiences of smoking , and positive reinforcement have been cited as motives for non-daily smokers ( Shiffman et al . 2012a ) . This is inconsistent with daily smokers as rather than avoiding the negative experiences of smoking , they appear to smoke for the positive experiences . This has led non-daily smokers to be labelled as indulgent ' , as they tend to smoke to enhance the experience of situations that are already positive such as drinking alcohol in a bar with friends ( Shiffman , Dunbar and Li 2014 ) . As well as showing different habits and smoking patterns , non-daily smokers report being motivated to smoke by substantially different reasons to those normally proposed in daily smokers . <h> How can you measure cigarette consumption ? <h> Definitions of light and heavy smoking <p> You may have noticed that a few different terms have been used such as : light smoker ; non-daily smoker ; occasional smokers . This is mainly because no one can agree on a consistent definition , and several have been used across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy smoking has been used to highlight the contrast between consumption levels . However , this classification is associated with the largest range of criteria between studies ( Husten 2009 ) Secondly , daily and non-daily ( or intermittent ) smoking is associated with a much more consistent pattern of use in contrast to light and heavy smoking ( Shiffman et al . 2012a ; 2012b ; 2014 ) . This is due to the number of cigarettes per day fluctuating , but smoking less than daily is a key indicator of this consumption pattern . Finally , there is a dichotomy between low and high nicotine dependence . This also appears to be a valid characterisation as non-daily/light smokers consistently exhibit significantly less nicotine dependence on every common measure ( Shiffman 2012b ) . However , it is important to note that in reality , dependence and smoking behaviour exists along a continuum . Even within different dichotomies , there is a large amount of variation across the supposedly homogeneous- sub-groups . <h> Measuring light and heavy smokers <p> On a final note of measurement , it is crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many questionnaires simply ask are you a smoker ? ' which may not detect non-daily smokers as they commonly do not identify with being a smoker ( Schane et al . 2009 ) . For example , in one study approximately 50% of light smokers said they might not admit to being a smoker ( Shiffman et al . 2013 ) . This suggests simply asking whether people smoke or not might not be the best strategy , as they may just get no ' as an answer . Clearly , more nuanced approaches are necessary to detect the low number of cigarettes consumed by this group . Fortunately , there are some additional measures of cigarette consumption that can provide a more sensitive answer : <p> A diary measure of the number of cigarettes smoked over a period of time <p> Breath Carbon Monoxide ( CO ) in a single session <p> Average CO over a number of sessions <p> Hair cotinine ( a metabolite of nicotine ) or nicotine levels <p> However , what are the best measures to use ? An intensive diary account is considered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuming for smokers which may deter some participants ( Wray , Gass and Miller 2015 ) . When comparing this to the less motivationally intensive measures , it appears that a single daily report of cigarettes across a number of days is the measure most strongly correlated with the intensive diary . Furthermore , when the level of exhaled CO is averaged across multiple testing session , this provides a valid biomarker for measuring cigarette consumption in light smokers ( Wray et al . 2015 ) . As well as these accuracy benefits , using a handheld CO monitor is cheap and does not require the expertise associated with analysing hair cotinine and nicotine levels . Due to the heterogeneous nature of smokers , it is crucial that the complexities in identifying light smokers are fully appreciated . <h> Conclusion <p> In summary , there is a clear distinction between different types of smoker but it is often neglected in research . Despite an apparent lack of nicotine dependence , both types of smoker find it difficult to remain abstinent with only a small difference between the cessation failure rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 ) . This is important for public health as although they form a minority of smokers , they share the same risk factor for heart disease as heavy smokers , and have an elevated risk of lung cancer ( Bjartveit and Tverdal 2005 ; Schane et al . 2009 ) . Considering the number of light smokers is predicted to increase as smoking restrictions tighten ( Coggins et al . 2009 ; Shiffman 2009 ) , it is crucial that this group is understood better . Research should focus on the individual differences in the determinants of smoking behaviour to better understand what is motivating light and heavy smokers . This knowledge will hopefully- translate into more effective smoking cessation treatments that cater to the individual needs of- each smoker . <p> I 'm James Bartlett , a PhD- student at Coventry University , UK . The aim of my- project is to create a profile of cognitive mechanisms associated with substance use in light and heavy smokers .

This literature review examines research articles published from 1997 onwards regarding the neurophysiology of pain relief during hypnosis or placebo treatments using functional brain imaging ( fMRI or PET ) . The focus was on acute produced nociceptive pain . There seems to be both similarities and clear differences in the brain activity changes between hypnosis and placebo treatments . These results show that hypnosis is not equal to common placebo in terms of brain activity thus questioning the suggestion that the pain reducing properties of hypnosis are just one form of placebo effect . <p> Keywords:hypnosis , pain , placebo effect <h> Introduction <p> Pain is categorized as a separate sense with both an emotional and a sensory component . Its main purpose is to warn about the potential damage of bodily tissues and to motivate action to prevent such damage . Pain sensation is processed at several levels before it becomes a perception . Previous experiences , mood , expectations and stress are only a few of the factors that are known to modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2003 ; Villemure &amp; Bushnell , 2009 ) . This kind of modification is called the top-down regulation , which means that we have a neurobiological system which , when activated by , for instance , expectations , may cause neurophysiological changes that affect perceiving of pain . <p> There are several ways of how the top-down regulation can modulate pain , such as through the use of placebos or hypnosis . However , the research of these two is often done in parallel and their neurobiological relation or even similarity is yet unclear . So far the only known study conducted on both treatments has shown that highly hypnotizable individuals report feeling less pain during hypnosis than during placebo condition ( McGlashan , Evans &amp; Orne , 1969 ) . This result implies that the effects of placebo and hypnosis are at least to some extent separate processes . <p> Opinions about the nature of hypnosis are strongly divided in scientific circles ( Kallio &amp; Revonsuo , 2003 ) . Some consider its effect to be based on an altered state of consciousness , dissociation or trance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influences of social psychological factors like meeting expectations and role play . There are also those who see both sides to be correct in certain conditions . <p> Views on placebo treatment also vary ( Kupers , Faymonville &amp; Laureys , 2005 ) . One perspective is that the effects are due to conditioning and previous experience . Another is that placebo effects are based on expectations , no matter how those were formed . Attitudes towards placebo treatment are often more negative than those towards hypnosis , because placebo condition requires some amount of deceiving , which is ethically dubious . <p> The development of brain imaging techniques has increased the interest to research phenomena such as hypnosis and placebo effects , which were previously seen as purely psychological . By using modern functional imaging techniques , brain activity changes can be localized from blood oxygenation level in functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and through glucose uptake rate in positron emission tomography ( PET ) . <p> In this literature review , the latest research ( 1997-2009 ) in the fields of hypnotic and placebo analgesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the alleviation of acute experimentally produced nociceptive pain , which differs from chronic clinical pain in respect to brain functioning ( Apkarian , Bushnell , Treede &amp; Zubieta , 2005 ) . Another criteria for the chosen articles was the use of functional brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and PET . The purpose was to compare the localized activation changes in placebo and hypnosis treatments and to find out whether hypnosis differs from placebo in terms of neurophysiology . This issue is not known to have been investigated before . <p> First , placebo and hypnosis are examined from the viewpoint of the scientific research . Next , similarities and differences found in the activity of distinct brain areas and neurotransmitters are reviewed . Finally the results are summarised and proposals for future research are made . <h> Definition and research of placebo and hypnosis <p> Placebo treatment is often used in medical research as a control state when the power of the real treatment is to be extracted from the overall clinical effect . All procedures are preserved , but the ingredient designed to be efficient is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient 's experience of therapeutic efficacy without any active medication being given . In the studies of placebo effect , the placebo is used as the main condition and the control condition is otherwise the same , but the participant is specifically told that the treatment is inert and unable to , for example , soothe pain . <p> The state of hypnosis is usually reached by deep relaxation or special induction , after which various types of suggestions might be used . These can be for instance commands , propositions or descriptions of pleasant autobiographical memories that do not contain any message of pain relief ( Faymonville et al. , 2000 ; Vandenhuyse et al. , 2009 ) . The control condition is often the alert resting state . <p> In both placebo use and hypnosis , the direction of the effect can be altered by means of proper suggestions . When , in placebo condition , the treatment is said to enhance pain and the participant reports a greater sensation of pain , it is called the nocebo effect ( reviewed in Benedetti , Lanotte , Lopiano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the intensity of perceived pain can be increased ( Derbyshire , Whalley , Stenger &amp; Oakley , 2009 ) . <p> Placebo and hypnosis pain treatments differ greatly . In placebo research , a diversity of aids , such as creams and pills , are used . Therefore the impact of previous knowledge and experience of medical treatments can not be excluded from the placebo effect . In addition , the use of these aids leads to physical sensations , which are known to reduce perceived pain ( Bellieni et al. , 2007 ) . The same does not apply to hypnosis . In contrast , in hypnosis treatments visualization is mainly used which results in activation of visual cortex ( Faymonville et al. , 2000 ; Rainville et al. , 1999 ) . This is not seen in placebo research . <p> The researchers of placebo effect sometimes use additional conditioning ( Bingel , Lorenz , Schoell , Weiller &amp; B++chel , 2006 ; Wager et al. , 2004 ) . This means that before the actual brain imaging experiment the participant gets the same treatment as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are milder in the placebo condition than in the control condition . Consequently the person is assured that the treatment works and , as a result , the obtained placebo effect is greater ( Vase , Riley &amp; Price , 2002 ) . This kind of convincing is not used in the studies of hypnosis . <p> The easiest way to find out the level of pain experienced by the participants is to ask them to rate it . In placebo and hypnosis research categorical scales are used , for example a scale of 0-10 , where zero refers to no pain and ten to highest possible pain . People have individual differences in pain thresholds and the purpose of research is not to cause damage . Therefore at the beginning of an experiment , individual pain limits are defined and pain stimuli kept within those limits in all conditions . <p> In the studies of placebo effect , the participant 's suggestibility is evaluated . This is usually done after the experiment by examining how much the belief in treatment efficacy decreased the participant 's pain ratings ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . In the research of hypnosis , only the person 's hypnotizability is explored , applying standardized questionnaires . The level of suggestibility is not evaluated . However , there is evidence that it might be essential for localization of the brain activity changes ( Scott et al. , 2008 ; Wager et al. , 2004 ) . At the same time it has been found that hypnotizability and suggestibility are relatively stable and independent traits ( De Pascalis , Ray , Tranquillo &amp; D'Amico , 1998 ) . <p> When evaluating the functional changes of the brain , it is important to remember that there are certain differences , some of which are listed above , in placebo and hypnosis treatments ' procedures which could appear as differences in brain activity . Then again , the similarity in the neural activity patterns may be partially explained by the common rules of pain research , such as the induced pain being expected and its cognitive evaluation required , rather than by resemblance of the treatments . <h> Brain structures involved in pain reduction <p> The pain pathways proceed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate . The recognition , interpretation and evaluation of pain signals continue in different parts of the brain . One pathway goes through the thalamus towards the somatosensory cortex where the origin , quality , magnitude and length of the pain perception are processed ( Hofbauer , Rainville , Duncan &amp; Bushnell , 2001 ; Hunt &amp; Mantyh , 2001 ) . The valence and emotional significance are evaluated and the response of the autonomic nervous system is mostly generated on another path , which proceeds from medulla to thalamus , amygdala , hippocampus , cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex ( Hunt &amp; Mantyh , 2001 ; Rainville , Duncan , Price , Carrier &amp; Bushnell , 1997 ; Singer et al. , 2004 ) . <p> The entity of those brain structures activity of which changes during the pain experience is called the pain network ( reviewed in Apkarian et al. , 2005 and Peyron , Laurent &amp; Garc+a-Larrea , 2000 ) . The primary and secondary somatosensory cortex , insula , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) and thalamus are those parts of the pain network whose functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation . Here these structures will together be referred to as the pain processing regions . The prefrontal cortex is associated with the anticipation of , focusing attention to and cognitive evaluation of pain . The cooperation of different structures of the pain network produces the pain perception . <h> The pain network <p> In studies of the placebo effect , pain alleviation is always seen to be related to activity changes in the pain processing regions ( Craggs et al. , 2008 ; Kong et al. , 2006 ; Liebermann et al. , 2004 ; Price , Craggs , Verne , Perlstein &amp; Robinson , 2007 ; Scott et al. , 2008 ; Wager et al. , 2004 ; Zubieta et al. , 2005 ; Zubieta and Stohler , 2009 ) . In the study of Wager et al . ( 2004 ) participants ' hands were treated with a cream which was said either to be an efficient analgesic or just an inert control product . The pain was caused by mild electrocutaneous stimulation . Using fMRI the researchers found out that the reduction of perceived pain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ACC and amygdala . <p> Similar results were obtained in a PET study of IBS-patients ( Price et al. , 2007 ) . The participants ' neural activity changes were monitored while the bowel was mechanically distended . Placebo cream use was associated with diminished activity in thalamus , insula , ACC and somatosensory cortex . In a longitudinal study of the same kind , IBS-patients kept a diary of their symptoms in between the experiments ( Liebermann et al. , 2004 ) . It appeared that decrease of activity in cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex in placebo condition correlated with smaller amount of symptoms reported by the patients . <p> Reduced pain ratings during the pain treatment with hypnosis are also associated with functional changes in the pain processing regions of the brain ( Faymonville et al. , 2000 ; Faymonville et al. , 2003 ; Rainville et al. , 1999 ; Vandenhuyse et al. , 2009 ) . Vandenhuyse et al . ( 2009 ) used laser beams that are known to activate only the pain receptors to cause pain to the participants ' hands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and habituation . Participants were given suggestions encouraging a retrieval of some pleasant autobiographical memories which did not contain any message relating to analgesia . EEG activity was monitored by the researchers so that participants could be prevented from falling asleep . Decrease of the reported pain was associated with smaller activity in thalamus , insula , ACC , somatosensory cortex , motor cortex and basal ganglia . <p> In some studies of pain relief the activity of the pain processing regions is found to decrease ( Price et al. , 2007 ; Wager et al. , 2004 ) while in others it seems to increase ( Bingel et al. , 2006 ; Craggs et al. , 2008 ; Kong et al. , 2006 ) . These differences in the results may have several explanations . One of the proposed reasons is whether the final analyses are done only on the data of the participants who experienced the placebo effect ( Wager et al. , 2004 ) or also those whom the treatment did not seem to affect ( Kong et al. , 2006 ) . However , Kong et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups and noticed that the direction of activity changes remained the same . The researchers concluded that the variation of the results in the field illustrates the view that there are several placebo effects - for instance one that is mediated by the opioids and another one that is not - instead of one . <p> The second explanation for the variations in the results might be the nature of blood circulation changes , which are linked to the increased synaptic activity and energy consumption . Therefore both excitatory and inhibitory processes are seen , as both consume energy , and the exact functional meaning of detected changes can not be evaluated ( Peyron et al. , 2000 ) . In this case , the greatest impact of functional brain imaging is the localization of those changes . <p> In addition to changes in the pain processing regions , activity is found to increase in the prefrontal cortex during both placebo treatments ( Craggs et al. , 2008 ; Kong et al. , 2006 ; Liebermann et al. , 2004 ; Scott et al. , 2008 ; Wager et al. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al. , 2009 ) and hypnosis ( Faymonville et al. , 2000 ; Faymonville et al. , 2003 ; Rainville et al. , 1999 ; Vandenhuyse et al. , 2009 ) . In a PET-study of placebo made by Zubieta et al . ( 2005 ) the pain was produced by injections of hypertonic solution into participants ' jaw muscle for 40-60 minutes so that their pain ratings remained the same . Before the experiment they had an injection of physiological solution which in the placebo condition was said to be a powerful analgesic . Participants were asked to rate how much they expect the pain to be alleviated by this treatment . The activity increased in the dorsolateral parts of the prefrontal cortex as well as in ACC , insula and nucleus accumbens . The bigger the pain relief one expected , the greater was the growth in functionality in one 's prefrontal cortex . <p> Wager et al . ( 2004 ) also noticed that the activity in prefrontal cortex was associated with anticipation of pain relief . In that study , the pain was caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of the pain , its peak and the late phase . A warning light was shown just before the water started to warm up . It appeared that larger activity in prefrontal cortex after the warning light correlated with decrease in reported pain and smaller activation of the pain processing regions - ACC in the start phase and insula and thalamus in the late phase . These results support the view that top-down pain alleviation requires the pain signals to continue for a certain period of time to start working to its full magnitude . This would explain why the placebo effect is greater with longer lasting stimuli ( Vase , Petersen , Riley &amp; Price , 2009 ) . <p> In the study of hypnotic analgesia , Faymonville et al . ( 2000 ) compared the ratings of pain induced on the hand by thermal stimulator , given while at rest , during pleasant recollection or during pleasant recollection under hypnosis . It appeared that only hypnosis affected the pain perception . PET-imaging showed that activity changes in ACC , medial prefrontal cortex , visual cortex and caudate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vandenhuyse et al . ( 2004 ) also found that functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex , insula and somatosensory cortex increased during hypnotic pain relief . <p> All in all the changes in activity in the pain processing regions in both hypnosis and placebo treatment imply that the pain perception is actually diminished by the treatments and the effects are not due to some sort of response bias . The additional activation of prefrontal cortex means that cognitive evaluation and attention are most likely to play an important part in placebo and hypnosis induced analgesia . The correlation of prefrontal activity changes with expectations for and the magnitude of pain relief might mean that efficacy of both treatments is based on changing the expectations of the participants . <h> Other brain structures <p> Based on the presented evidence of the similarities of neural activation changes , the analgesic power of hypnosis could be largely explained by the placebo effect . However , a closer look at the study results shows that there are also some significant differences . <p> In the research of placebo analgesia the decrease of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the limbic system that are not included in the pain network . These are the amygdala ( Bingel et al. , 2006 ; Craggs et al. , 2008 ; Scott et al. , 2008 ; Wager et al. , 2004 ; Zubieta et al. , 2009 ) , hypothalamus ( Zubieta et al. , 2009 ) and hippocampus ( Craggs et al. , 2008 ; Kong et al. , 2006 ) . Furthermore , alterations are seen in the periaqueductal grey ( PAG ) ( Bingel et al. , 2006 ; Scott et al. , 2008 ; Wager et al. , 2004 ; Zubieta et al. , 2009 ) and nucleus accumbens ( Scott et al. , 2008 ; Zubieta et al. , 2005 ; Zubieta et al. , 2009 ) . Similar changes have seldom been detected in the studies of hypnosis . In a PET-study by Scott et al . ( 2008 ) , placebo treatment was related to increase of activity in PAG and decrease of it in ACC , amygdala and nucleus accumbens . The functional change in nucleus accumbens alone explained almost a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the functional connectivity between ACC , amygdala and PAG was found to increase in the placebo condition ( Bingel et al. , 2006 ) . <p> Kong et al . ( 2006 ) used fake acupuncture with needles set in the spots inactive according to the theory of meridians . Acupuncture was chosen as an interesting alternative because Western people do not have much experience of and thus are less familiar with it . FMRI was used to image the brain activity changes before and after the treatment when rating painful stimuli . After the treatment the functionality was seen to increase in ACC , insula , prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and pons . Greater activity of amygdala and hippocampus in the placebo condition was also seen in the study of IBS-patients ( Craggs et al. , 2008 ) . <p> Conversely , in the research of hypnosis treatment , diminished pain ratings are associated with activity changes not only in the pain network , but also in the occipital cortex ( Faymonville et al. , 2000 ; Rainville et al. , 1999 ) and basal ganglia ( Faymonville et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vandenhuyse et al. , 2009 ) . This does not seem to happen during placebo treatment . For example the functional connectivity was seen to increase between ACC , insula , thalamus , prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia and to decrease between ACC and visual cortex during hypnotic analgesia ( Faymonville et al. , 2003 ) . <p> Placebo treatment and hypnosis cause activity changes in both similar and different brain regions ( Table 1 ) . The placebo effect is related to the function of the limbic system areas that are involved in processes such as emotions and memory and autonomic processes . It is also related to the activity of PAG , which is rich in opioid receptors , and the activity of nucleus accumbens , which is informally known as the craving center . At the same time in hypnosis parts of the brain that pertain to movement regulation and imagery processing are activated . <p> Table 1 <p> Brain areas activated in hypnosis and placebo treatments <p> Brain area <p> Hypnosis <p> Placebo <p> Somatosensory cortex <p> X <p> X <p> Insula <p> X <p> X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> X <p> Prefrontal cortex <p> X <p> X <p> Amygdala <p> X <p> Hypothalamus <p> X <p> Hippocampus <p> X <p> PAG <p> X <p> Nucleus accumbens <p> X <p> Occipital cortex <p> X <p> Basal ganglia <p> X <h> The role of neurotransmitters <p> The most researched neurotransmitter systems in pain alleviation are opioidergic , involving endogenous opioids and their receptors , and dopaminergic , which relates to dopamine and its receptors . The research of the placebo effect shows that dopaminergic activity is increased during the placebo analgesia ( Scott et al. , 2008 ; Zubieta et al. , 2009 ) . Scott et al . ( 2008 ) used dopamine tracer and PET-scanning and discovered that raised dopaminergic activity in nucleus accumbens was associated with lower pain ratings . <p> There is some indirect evidence of dopaminergic mediation of the pain relieving effect of hypnosis too . The level of hypnotizability was found to be related to a higher amount of dopamine metabolites in the spinal fluid ( Spiegel &amp; King , 1992 ) and to the genes involved in the regulation of dopamine secretion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately these results do not tell us anything about the dopaminergic activity during the actual hypnosis treatment . <p> It has long been known that the amount of opioids released in the body increases during painful experiences ( Levine , Gordon &amp; Fields , 1978 ) . Nowadays opioidergic activity is examined closer using PET and opioid tracers . These methods show that placebo treatment increases this activity in the ACC , insula , prefrontal cortex , amygdala , nucleus accumbens and PAG ( Scott et al. , 2008 ; Wager et al. , 2007 ; Zubieta et al. , 2005 ) . However , when opioidergic activity is studied with the opioid antagonist naloxone the results are inconsistent . Some studies showed that the placebo effect is blocked by naloxone ( reviewed in Sauro &amp; Greenberg , 2005 ) ; but there are also results suggesting that naloxone has no effect on placebo efficacy ( Vase , Robinson , Verne &amp; Price , 2005 ) . These kinds of contradictory results support the view of several placebo effects instead of one ( reviewed in Stewart-Williams &amp; Podd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious expectations and mediated by opioids , while another one , perhaps based on acquired conditioning , may not be mediated by them and therefore not affected by naloxone ( Amanizio &amp; Benedetti , 1999 ) . <p> In a few studies conducted on the role of opioids in the hypnotic analgesia no effect of naloxone was found ( Goldstein &amp; Hilgard , 1975 ; Moret et al. , 1991 ) . This means that opioidergic activity does not seem to mediate the effect of hypnosis on pain perception . However this conclusion needs to be tested further , at least with bigger sample sizes . <p> According to results obtained until now and presented here dopamine plays an important role both in placebo and hypnosis effects . The significance of opioids , which are well-known as the body 's own pain killers , is unclear . More research is needed especially on the neurochemistry of hypnosis . <h> Conclusions <h> Summary <p> Many similarities have been found between hypnotic and placebo analgesia . First of all , functional brain imaging studies show that neither of the treatment effects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observation that decreased pain ratings are associated with activity changes in the pain network of the brain . This network comprises of somatosensory cortex , ACC , insula , thalamus and prefrontal cortex and its activity is known to be changed along with the pain experience ( Apkarian et al. , 2005 ; Peyron et al. , 2000 ) . Second , there are some results which suggest that both placebo and hypnosis effects are mediated by dopaminergic activity and caused by changes in expectations . <p> Based on these results it can be concluded that the analgesic effect which treatment with hypnosis may have on acute produced pain is probably more than just placebo effect in terms of brain functionality . This supports the previous result according to which placebo and hypnosis are different processes of top-down regulation ( McGlashan et al. , 1969 ) . However , the recent knowledge is insufficient to make assumptions on whether the state of hypnosis can be described as altered consciousness or are the results rather the manifestation of differences in treatment procedures between placebo and hypnosis . In the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placebo treatment . <h> Discussion <p> At the present time the study of the placebo effect and hypnosis seems to have different approaches : in the field of placebo the focus is set on the neurochemical processes , while study of hypnosis is most often an investigation of its efficacy as a treatment in clinical practice . The nature of hypnosis is highly debated ( Kallio &amp; Revonsuo , 2003 ) , and currently there is insufficient scientific evidence to support or reject either viewpoint . However comparing hypnosis and placebo treatments in the same study might bring new insight on the matter . <p> Another direction for future research would be to examine the role of different treatment elements in the alleviation of pain . For instance , how important are hypnotic induction and its deepening for the magnitude of pain alleviation ? Or how much do quality and quantity of suggestions affect the decrease in the perceived pain ? Conditioning is seen as an important part of the placebo effect ( Amanizio &amp; Benedetti , 1999 ) ; however , the reputation of hypnosis also creates certain expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it play in the effect of the hypnotic pain treatment ? The additional conditioning used in the placebo studies could also be exploited in the research of hypnosis . <p> There is a lot of inconsistency in both placebo and hypnosis research . The comparability of study results would be increased if some common standards were found . For instance hypnotizability and suggestibility are qualities that should be measured systematically and used in the data analysis , because they might confound the results ( Scott et al. , 2008 ; Wager et al. , 2004 ) . <p> The interaction of the body and the mind is complex . In a spiritual trance , some martial arts or life-threatening situations the perception of pain is sometimes reported to disappear completely . Even simple relaxation or distraction is often enough to gain an analgesic effect . Placebo effect and hypnosis are thus only two forms of the mind-body coaction . <p> The significance of pain is assimilated early in life . Gradually we learn the limits of our body , internalize the ways to avoid pain and the commonly accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain in punishing and bringing pleasure . The pain produced in the laboratory settings is different from the pain in every-day life which usually comes unexpectedly . Still , by means of scientific study pain alleviation can be better modelled , understood and applied . The goal of pain research on hypnosis and the placebo effect is to utilize the obtained knowledge in the treatment of pain , to be able to use more efficiently our own abilities and resources to diminish the suffering .

@@76805352 @5505352/ <h> The Deconstruction of Gilles de la Tourette 's Syndrome <h> Abstract <p> The present deconstruction of Gilles de la Tourette 's Syndrome introduces this complex disorder using an existential paradigm . An analysis of the history of constructed reason and power highlights the assumptions of ' disorder ' that infiltrate society and serves to critique predisposed thought with reference to Tourette 's . The review considers the representationalist theory of language and concepts within psychiatric discourse . A brief analysis of previous case studies shows Tourettic energy as part of the individual ' self ' and introduces a comparison of Tourettic movement to more mutual human experience , such as music and poetry . Past research that explores preventative social interaction is introduced , which show positive advancements in treatment by challenging the conventions of internal etiology and which highlights the importance of reducing attached stigma . <h> Introduction <p> Over a century since its first formal diagnoses by the man whose name became the eponym for the condition , Gilles de la Tourette 's syndrome remains an enigmatic phenomenon with no consistently identifiable pathology . Individuals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2008 , p. 454 ) as well as an inherently misinformed public image . Tourette 's is referred to as a syndrome as it presents itself by a cluster of symptoms . The American Psychiatric Association ( DSM-IV-TR , 2000 ) states the symptomology as multiple motor tics with the occurrence of one or more phonic tics . Although it does not state their appearance or form , common simple tics include blinking , twitching and coughing , whilst complex tics may consist of more elaborate movements such as twirling and phonic behaviours that involve different sounds , singular words or even whole phrases . Echolalia , the mimicking of others vocalizations and palilalia , the repetition of one 's own language , have also been reported in cases of Tourette 's , as well as the repeatition of gestures , known as echopraxia . Narrative approaches have considered further composite behaviour as Tourettic , such as a burst of energy when playing an instrument ( Sacks , 1995 ; Steingo , 2008 ) . For formal diagnosis , two other conditions must also be met . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of 18 . Secondly , the symptoms must present themselves for over a year with less than three consecutive months of respite . Therefore , not only do tics wax and wane , suggestive perhaps of some external influence , tics are not idiosyncratic to Tourette 's but may exist on a continuum , experienced at a lesser extent by members of the " normal " population . <p> Tourette 's syndrome is often diagnosed with co-morbid conditions . The most commonly reported are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ( Cohen , Sade , Benarroch , Pollak &amp; Gross-Tsur , 2008 , p. 299 ) . Tourette 's however , even when diagnosed without these associated behavioural complexities , is still reported as a social and academic disability despite regular reports of IQ levels , indicating that the syndrome is " unrelated to intelligence " ( Miller , 2001 , p. 535 ) . It is therefore proposed that there must be wider social implications attached to the diagnosis . Hollenbeck ( 2003 ) explains that " Tourette 's differs from other neuropsychiatric disorders in one simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I tic , I am usually not the problem . You are . " Here Hollenbeck introduces the paradox of Gilles de la Tourette 's syndrome ; a ' disease ' that only becomes apparent in the context of social and political milieu , or what we may more commonly consider public space ( Davis , Davis &amp; Dowler , 2003 ) . This is not to suggest that the suffering caused by Tourette 's is illusionary . Having Tourette 's can be a distressing experience ; however , what Hollenbeck implies is that a large part of this distress may not be the tic itself , but the stigma it evokes from the public . Therefore , through eradicating this stigmatization at least part of the discomfort can also be eradicated . <p> In 2009 , Culter , Murphy , Gilmour and Heyman provided research that highlighted the damage caused by stigma . They reported children diagnosed with Tourette 's Syndrome as having a lower subjective quality of life and , crucially , the most significant reasons effecting this quality of life were social/emotional problems rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) also reported children with Tourette 's as having lower self-perception in areas including appearance , social relations and psychological well-being . Although unrelated to tic severity , it is questionable whether some co-morbid conditions reported , such as anxiety , sleep disorders and further mental health problems ( Dodel et al. , 2010 , p. 1060 ) could be related to this stigma . <p> The clinical implications suggested by the research points towards peer education regarding the syndrome in order to challenge people 's tendency to form opinions on physicality . In Madness and Civilisation , Foucault notes that this is a common trait in people 's perception of madness and suggests , " what the eighteenth century had first noticed about it ( madness ) was not the secret interrogation , but only the social effects : the torn clothes , the arrogance in rags " ( Foucault , 2009 , p. 190 ) , a sentiment highlighting a history of how physical representation proceeds and dominates any real understanding of the internal condition . <h> Social Construction of Abnormal Behaviour <p> To understand how , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Tourette 's in our modern world , it is important to understand how we arrived at assumptions of abnormality through the construction of knowledge . Since the age of the Enlightenment there have been strong distinctions between what is viewed as reason and what is viewed as unreason . This is reflected in the way Tourette 's used to be viewed as a ' moral ' disease , a ' weakness of will ' ( Sacks , 1995 ) laying outside of constructed reason . The act of separating reason from unreason is social , and society is often ruled through elite power , which inherently leads to exclusion of anyone deemed different from this power . Although we no longer live in a feudal system under the rule of sovereign power , Foucault ( 1991 ) argues that the main function of modern disciplinary power is still " hierarchical observation " and " normalizing judgment " ( p. 170 ) . The key difference being that disciplinary power acts to subtly correct those deemed different , replacing overt public punishment conducted through the sovereign . Porter ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of power " and noted that " labeling insanity is primarily a social act , a cultural construct . " He argues " do we call people mentally ' confused ' because we find them confusing ? " ( pp. 8-20 ) . This interpretation of how we organize human behavior is particularly relevant to the Tourettic individual who has been deemed abnormal , despite the fact that their symptoms are often cathartic , resulting in a return for them to their internal normal state . Evans ( 1998 ) explains that , apart from a minority of tics that causes excess strain on certain muscle groups , " the noises and other tics do not disable ... to be disabled infers a social context . If I " have " TS ( sic ) and live on a desert island , am I disabled ? " ( p. 13 ) . Here , Evans shows how normality is no longer a personal function but a social construct . <p> It may be that government and power not only legitimise power but " make new sectors of reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Parker , Georgaca , Harper , McLaughlin &amp; Stowell-Smith , 1995 , p. 59 ) . This construction of reality has led to behaviours that do not fit into established belief systems being punished only for these behaviours to be deemed acceptable when viewed retrospectively . What is socially constructed as abnormal in present day belief systems may not be viewed as abnormal in the future . An example of this is the early modern tradition of labelling certain behaviours as being traits of witchcraft . Szasz ( 1960 ) went as far as to say , " Mental illness exists or is " real " in exactly the same sense in which witches existed or were " real " " ( p. 117 ) . Jung ( 1970 ) furthers this comparison ; although the belief system may have changed , as a society we still torment those seen to be different and states " We no longer subject him to the test of drinking poison ; we do not burn him or put screws on him ; but we injure him by means of moral verdicts pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reflected in the way we treat those individuals we deem mentally abnormal and the stigmatisation received by those we put into this category . <p> Evans ( 1998 ) cites a personal account of someone with Tourette 's who expresses this parallel and the consequent feeling of being judged , " You feel ' on trial ' like your entire social being and worth is bought under scrutiny of strangers , and why ? Just because you make an involuntary noise that other people find upsetting " ( p. 1 ) . The example here shows how strongly people 's lives are affected through how we judge what we perceive to be normal by using only our own experience of life . Jung ( 1970 ) used the example of the Western tendency to view ' primitive ' cultures as having an inferior consciousness . He compared the differences between the rituals of ' primitive ' and Western man , comparing culture specific social norms , such as the insult caused by standing on ones shadow to the offence caused by a gentleman leaving his hat on indoors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ours , and his evil is just as bad as ours . Only the forms under which good and evil appear are different ; the process of ethical judgment is the same " ( p. 147 ) . Yet nearly 80 years later , the trend remains that everything outside personally constructed reason is wrong and this is seen in the misunderstood attitudes towards those with syndromes such as Tourette 's . Bilokreli ( 2009 ) recalls that when sharing the news to other teacher staff that she would have a boy with Tourette 's Syndrome in her class , " I was perhaps most bothered and astonished when the response from others was laughing " ( p. 2 ) . <p> The potential for humour related to Tourette 's syndrome has been exploited by the media in comedy series such as The Simpsons ' episode " Marge Gets a Job " ( 1992 ) and South Park 's " Le Petit Tourette " ( 2007 ) , with such examples focusing on an exaggerated form of coprolalia , the utterance of ' anti social ' words , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 349 ) , or the misguided image of associated violence . Perverse pleasure extracted at the expense of the Tourettic individual becomes voyeuristic and presents the argument that it is no longer the individual who is problematic but it is the society that is acting ' sick . ' The label Tourette 's in turn becomes synonymous with these extreme and misinformed media representations and becomes a loaded discourse used for stigmatization . Wahl ( 2003 ) explains , " Words have power ... words reflect and shape prevailing attitudes , attitudes that in turn shape social behaviour " ( p. 14 ) . As coprolalia is " out of context with the ongoing conversation " ( Miller , 2001 , p. 543 ) its function is not for offense . This in turn should eradicate any loaded discourse associated with the words , something often not portrayed in media representation . Parker et al. , ( 1995 ) note that it is professional discourses that inform and also modify common representations of mental illness . This suggests that although media representation reaches a wider social audience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stigma , only exists because psychiatry decides to create the label and has marked it as unreason . <p> One suggested motive as to why Tourettic symptoms present so dichotomously to constructed reason is their shattering of the unwritten governed rules that patrol public space . Although public brings about connotations of inclusion , Davis , Davis and Dowler ( 2003 ) note that for people with Tourette 's this space is exclusionary . They describe public space as " the realm of politics and economics separated from the domestic sphere " ( p. 103 ) , embodying everything that has been constructed . This space then rejects Tourettic movement , which becomes " disruptive to the order and health of public space " ( p. 105 ) . Fruend ( as cited in Blackman , Mitchell , Burton , Jenks , Parsons , Raman &amp; Williams , 2003 ) comments that " self control and a state of vigilance is essential " ( p. 358 ) which often appears to be lacking in Tourettic movement and sound . <h> Tourette 's and the Self <p> However , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-control over their actions . Human beings have a readiness to " organize their experience and to interpret their social lives according to narrative plots " ( Sarbin , 1998 , p. 177 ) , therefore , anything that breaks this is seen as abnormal and unwanted . Tourette 's , with its appearing unpredictability , breaks the constructed narrative of how we imagine one should behave . For this reason , the symptoms of Tourette 's are often treated as if they are alien to the sufferer . It is assumed that the tic derives from a place " outside the autonomous or real self " ( Schroeder , 2005 , p. 107 , emphasis in the original ) , however , this does not correspond to reports from individuals with Tourette 's who explain " I do the tic " ( ' Mr A ' , as cited in Cohen &amp; Leckman , 1992 , p. 320 ) . Tics can create a release or catharsis ; perhaps the most cited comparison is that of scratching an itch , often preceded in the same way by the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as a premonitory sensory urges , although sometimes the tics are more autonomous , such as eye blinking ( Leckman , Bloch , Scahill &amp; King , 2006 , p. 645 ) . <p> In 2009 , Steinburg , Baruc , Harush , Dar , Woods , Piacentini &amp; Apter reported that although the premonitory urge to tic was not associated with tic severity in a child population , it was correlated with obsessions , depression and anxiety . Interestingly , when split into two age groups ( age 10 and below and age 11 to 15 ) , anxiety was only significantly correlated with premonitory urge in the older age group . This may suggest that these older children have reinforced anxiousness caused by the premonitory urges , of being ' incapable of preventing ' the tic ( Chaturvedi , Gartin &amp; Murdick , 2011 , p. 57 ) and the associated fear of any social embarrassment that may be caused . <p> Stigma is created because Tourettic movements are often outside of aesthetically and socially accepted movements and sounds . One individual with Tourette 's explains how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to explain them all as ; kinda like a habit . So let 's say biting nails , you get that urge you always get to bite your nail . Sometimes you do n't think about it but as soon as you see it you got to do it again . ( Brad , as cited in Bilokreli , 2009 , p. 52 ) . Although inconvenient , like a personal habit of biting nails , tics are part of the self and self-behaviour . <p> Through more deconstructive and narrative approaches to evaluating Tourette 's syndrome , a greater empathetic understanding of how it feels to tic can be reached , and the more positive aspects of the syndrome can be explored . This approach also highlights that Tourette 's is not as simple as a physical disease that must be expelled from the body , as Sacks ( 1995 ) explains , the ' it ' is not next to , but conflated with the ' I ' ( p. 73 ) . The chapter ' A Surgeons Life ' is the account of Sacks ' time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pseudonym ) . The case study highlights the problems faced by the surgeon because of his Tourette 's , but also considers the condition as an indispensable part of his character . This ambivalence is seen when Bennett is displaying a tic of compulsively touching a lamp . Sacks questions as to why he sits next to it if it disturbs him so , to which Bennett answers ' sure it 's a disturbance ... but it 's also stimulation ' ( p. 83 ) . This introduces an interesting paradox that although Tourettic individuals appear deterministic in their movements , there may be a connection to what Lloyd ( 2007 ) describes as a Kantian view of a performative actor whose actions are " independent of the social-political world " ( p. 57 ) . <p> This unique element of Tourette 's introduces the question whether there are any ' advantageous ' elements of the syndrome as suggested in more philosophical contexts . One focus has been the unique relationship between Tourette 's and music . There appears a repeated use of Tourettic terminology for band names and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and punk band Pussy Tourette . Sorensen ( 2005 ) notes , " Tourette Syndrome has become a trope for the whole post-modern condition . " He suggests that the usage of Tourette 's in band names and songs expresses a " sub cultural bricolage , a practice where negative or stigmatic labels are embraced , both for their ( out-group ) shock value and for their ( in-group ) semiotic value in signaling cool deviance " ( pp. 1-2 , emphasis in the original ) . However , could there be a more natural link between Tourette 's and music , a more literal reason why the two often collide in popular culture ? Is there a Tourettic element to music ? John Lethem 's book Motherless Brooklyn ( 2000 ) depicts the life of a lead character who is a Tourettic detective . At one point he explains , " I do n't know whether The Artist Formerly Known as Prince is Tourettic or obsessive-compulsive in his human life , but I know for certain he is deeply so in the life of his work " ( Lethem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real life accounts of an affinity between Tourette 's and music have included Sacks ' account of Witty Ticcy Ray , a Tourettic jazz pianist who was ; famous for his sudden and wild extemporizations , which would arise from a tic or a compulsive hitting of a drum and would instantly be made the nucleus of a wild and wonderful improvisation , so that the ' sudden intruder ' would be turned to a brilliant advantage . ( Sacks , 2007 , pp. 102-103 ) . <p> Sacks concluded that , although intrusive , Tourette 's syndrome could be used for creativity . Steingo ( 2008 ) describes his account of this dialectic experience between music and Tourette 's , noting how " unexpected impulses seem to have given my playing a particular creative flair " ( p. 30 ) . He also introduces the work of Robert Ashley , an avant-garde composer whose 1996 piece " Autonomic writings " were inspired by his own Tourette like impulses . Steingo notes , " Ashley performs his Tourettic voice as his ( own ) voice . No longer the symptom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tourettic voice " ( pp. 30-31 , emphasis in the original ) . <p> Music is often cited as a more primitive phenomenon , with an energy that transcends the formalities of language but , essentially , is still rule governed . These rules , however , are more intrinsic in nature and it could be posited that they derive from traditions older than formal language , therefore , when creating music , procedural knowledge is essential . Cutietta and Stauffer ( 2005 ) note its role in " performing patterns appropriately , sensing the common beat , performing in tune " and explain that all these things help the musician " develop understanding of the unwritten syntax " ( p. 127 ) . It could be suggested that the relationship between Tourette 's and music is due to difference in the usage of procedural knowledge . Walenski , Mostofsky and Ullman ( 2007 ) support this phenomenon through research that cites Tourette 's as advantageous in children when accessing rule-governed procedural knowledge . They were much quicker than a control group at forming rule governed past tenses , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' walk-ed . ' The researches asserted that the same neurological processes that createe the intense energy of tics also helps the individual access the information more quickly . <p> The research also suggests that Tourettic impulse may have a relationship with language . Schleifer ( 2001 ) discusses the connection between Tourettic tics and poetry . Like music , poetic discourse involves rules and governance , but these are outside of normal language , they have a more mythological and intrinsic base . He likens both poetry and phonic tics to ' primal cries . ' One example of Tourettic tics taking a poetic form is recorded in Sacks ' 1995 book chapter A Surgeons Life . He refers to Bennett , the surgeon with Tourette 's , and his compulsion to voice out-loud thoughts running through his mind in a reduced and repeated expression . Thus , he says , when the weather is nice he may want to be out in the sun getting a tan . This thought will be in the back of his mind while he is seeing his patients in the hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nurse may say , Mr. Jones has abdominal pain , ' and I 'm looking out the window saying , Tanning rays , tanning rays ' ' ' ( Sacks , 1995 , p. 84 ) . Here Bennett 's expression reflects Heidegger 's function of poetic language , which expropriates " world and things into the simple one-fold of their intimacy " ( Heidegger , 1971 , p. 210 ) . Bennett has removed the personal subjectivity of his thoughts and expressed them in a more pure form of language . However , Bennett also recalls , when referring to some of his more unusual tics , " One can not always find sense in these words ; often it is just the sound that attracts me . Any odd sound , any odd name , may start repeating itself , get me going " ( p. 88 ) , thus highlighting the role of sound . Similarly , poetry is , to a degree , based on the sounds within language . The words are often chosen for more than their idiosyncratic meaning but because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kushner ( 2001 ) refer to a relationship between coprolalia and poetry , noting that cursing relies on innuendo and euphemism and therefore , like poetic words , their force can " exceed(s) their immediate context " ( p. 550 ) . Schleifer ( 2001 ) suggests " resources of language most starkly apprehensible in the extremity and dysfunction of Tourette 's Syndrome are a source of much of poetry 's power " ( p. 568 ) . <p> Interestingly , a primitive part of the brain charged by emotion , known as the basil ganglia , is the area most referred to in neurological accounts of the syndrome . Tourette 's shows that language is , in part , connected to older circuits of the brain and may not be as unique to higher cortical functioning as often assumed . Schleifer ( 2001 , p. 566 ) notes how this " connection between body and spirit has often been denied " , most notably since the Enlightenment . However , poetry accepts the mythological and archetypal elements of language . Carl Jung ( as cited in Clarke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's range of consciousness " ( p. 1 ) . In the 1600 's Thomas Browne stated , " We are only that amphibious piece between a corporal and spiritual Essence , that middle form that links those two together " ( as cited in Dunn , 1950 , p. 140 ) . It could thus be argued that the energy that creates Tourretic tics is representative of this spiritual essence , the same essence that motivates poetry and music , stemming from a more primal element of our amphibian brain . However , unlike the arts , Tourettic behaviour is not socially accepted in an increasingly corporal world and is therefore stigmatised and discouraged . At the very least this allows the questioning of " the very basis of Western Metaphysics " ( Steingo , 2001 , p. 30 ) and by highlighting the relationship between poetry , music and Tourette 's , we begin to fathom a normality of the existence of less subjective impulses that may influence performativity . Similarly to how Freud suggested art arose from the same psychological mechanisms as Neurosis ( as cited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of our own Tourettic voices . <h> Implications for Treatment <p> The functions of these reports are not to romanticise the dark side of the condition however , but to help create informed choices in terms of treatment . The interaction of Tourettic behaviour with personality and the self highlights certain considerations when choosing medication in an attempt to relieve symptoms . Cohen and Leckmen ( 1999 ) explain , " In a strange way , there may also be a loss to humanity , since the biological vulnerability may also have an adaptive value " ( p. 19 ) and go on to describe these values as energy , humour and a general zest for life . Side effects of medication can cause weight gain , increase lethargic behaviour and sleepiness and may cause cognitive blunting ( Hendren , 2002 ) ; therefore attempting to reduce the tics may compromise this energy . A further issue with medication is that within child psychiatry , the choice to medicate is often externally made . By receiving medication , the child is being adversely made to feel like there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expelled . Burd et al. , ( as cited in Stern , Blair &amp; Peterson , 2007 , p. 10 ) claim that up to 40% of cases go on to be symptom free in adulthood , yet despite this , because of the attached stigma , the syndrome may still affect individuals in measurable ways other than symptom severity . For example , Meyers ( as cited in Hendren , 2002 ) reported a population of 114 individuals with Tourette 's as having a four times higher rate of unemployment in adulthood and , essentially , those who were employed were underemployed in jobs below trained skill , indicative of a lasting discrimination . <p> Medication also points to an entirely internal etiology of the syndrome , removing any focus on external factors . Even more , humanistic research has shown ignorance of the more complex personality element . For example , 0'Quinn and Thompson ( 1980 ) presented an article that explores research conducted with five young people diagnosed with Tourette 's disorder , assessing related language , speech and learning deficits . The article was described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted the social and educational problems experienced ; the cause of dysfunction was still largely attributed to neurobiological actions . The researchers also noted that teachers should be briefed on the disruption that those with Tourette 's might cause and that flexibility in teaching style may need to be adopted . However , these problems were still viewed as mainly linear consequences of the individual 's condition . More recent studies have begun to show how symptoms of Tourette 's can be made worse through external social factors that disrupt the notion of an ' internal disease . ' In 1995 Silva , Munoz , Barickman and Friedhoff noted that " Tourettes symptomatology fluctuates secondary to environmental factors " ( p. 305 ) and that anxiety producing events , such as starting a new school , increased Tourettic tics . Lin et al . ( 2007 ) noted that depression was a predictor of tic severity and , importantly , this depression was best predicted by psychosocial factors . Compared to the control group those who suffered from Tourettic and/or obsessive-compulsive symptoms were more likely to suffer with depression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in support for a link between stigma and symptom severity . Miller and Kaiser ( 2002 ) recognize the core feature of stigma to be the devalued social identity , which in turn leads to an array of stressors . <p> The clinical implication of these reports is discussed by Silva et al. , ( 1995 ) , " The potential effect of environment on symptomatology may lead the physician to consider that temporary increase in tics may respond more appropriately to a period of acclimation to the environment than to an increase in medication dose " ( p. 312 ) . However , this view is still considered secondary in mainstream psychiatry . Gilbert ( 2006 ) , although noting that the presence of tics is " not an indication for medical treatment " ( p. 639 ) , suggests symptom-suppressing medication should be reserved for cases where there is " a significant social impairment , function impairment , pain or class room disruption . " Although perhaps justifiable for relieving painful tics , there is an argument that the side effects of medication are not worth risking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , there have been some recent advancements in clinical practice that have begun to concentrate on environmental factors as well as explore non drug based therapy . Research has mainly focused around children within a school environment , as Holtz &amp; Tessman ( 2007 ) explain , many of the social adjustment problems suffered by individuals with Tourette 's ' have their roots in negative childhood experiences in the classroom ' ( p. 531 ) . <p> In 2007 , Turton and Rayner showed how evidence supporting an existential form of clinical practice could prevent the need for medication . They developed strategies to work with a school child suffering with Tourette 's , hypothesizing that reported misbehavior was a direct result of a hostile environment , present because of stigmatization in the classroom . They conducted behavioral therapy not only with the child , but also with his peers and teachers , and set up a peer support group with both a decline in tic severity and challenging behavior as a result . Particular classroom considerations may also be important , involving practical interventions such as using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in exams , scheduled breaks as well as managing peer reactions . Showing media and books that portray individuals with Tourette 's in a positive light within the educational environment has also shown positive effects ( Chaturvedi , Gartin &amp; Murdick , 2011 ) . In 2002 , Woods presented an educational video about Tourette 's to one group of their sample prior to showing a video of an actor/actress portraying Tourette 's symptoms . This group rated more positive attitudes regarding the actor/actress than a second group , who had not seen the prior educational video . Holtz &amp; Tessman ( 2007 ) reported similar finding , noting that an intervention video can lead to ' greater knowledge , positive attitudes , and behavioural intentions ' ( p. 531 ) . <p> Another recent area of research has been Comprehensive Behavioural Interventions for tics ( CBIT ) . Woods , Piacentini &amp; Walkup ( 2010 ) explain , ' the brain is very responsive to environmental cues ' and that ' over time , with repeated cueing , the brain can be trained to respond in predictable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something referred to as neuroplasticity , and knowledge about the phenomenon is key to CBIT . CBIT works in three stages , the first is looking at what environmental factors make tics worse and the second stage is challenging such factors ( for example , through the classroom implications mentioned above ) . The third stage is direct therapy with the individual and consists of Habit Reversal Therapy , which has received the most empirical support of the behavioural interventions for Tourette 's ( Woods , Conelea &amp; Himle , 2010 p. 519 ) . Habit Reversal Therapy involves creating awareness and self-monitoring of tics and then encourages the individual to create a ' competing response ' when the premonitory urge to tic is felt , for example through a voluntary behaviour that is ' physically incompatible ' with the tic ( Piacentini Woods , Scahill , et al. , 2010 , p. 4 ) . In 2010 , Piacentini , Woods , Scahill , et al. , presented a controlled trial using Habit Reversal Therapy in a large sample of children and adolescents . Using the Yale Global Tic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy over a 10-week period showed a significant reduction in tics to the controls . Importantly , 62.5% continued to show a reduction of tics after a six-month period , showing potential long-term benefits after treatment has ended . However , it appears that support has yet to be disseminated to those in need of treatment ( Woods , Conelea &amp; Himle , 2010 ) and that behavioural therapies are far from a first line treatment option . It is argued that it is not only the recently supported efficacy that makes behavioural therapy a viable treatment option , but also the ethical and philosophical implications . Looking for environmental cues for tics helps prevent an internalisation of symptoms , whilst peer education helps ' normalise ' tics . Importantly , these clinical findings support the socially constructed ideology of mental health . By actively removing the stigma attached to the label , the condition itself is decreased . These results also have implications for cases with co-morbid symptoms . Cohen et al. , ( 2008 ) found anxiety and depression in children with Tourette 's syndrome was " markedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADHD and OCD " ( p. 299 ) . By tackling environmental issues , this may then break what Harris ( 1996 ) calls the ' cyclical effect ' ( as cited in Turton &amp; Rayner , 2007 , p. 346 ) , where negative experience is created through a hostile environment , and the environment becomes more hostile due to this increase in negative experience . However , unfortunately in society today , stigma will still prevail , and therefore treatment for Tourette 's still revolves heavily around tic reduction . One huge advantage of behavioural therapy is that it is free from the side effects that often come hand in hand with medication . <h> What now ? <p> These studies indicate positive advancements in the treatment of Tourette 's through consideration of social construction in relation to the syndrome . They begin to shift the focus away from internal etiology , thus reducing attached shame and stigma . However , personal accounts of living with the syndrome still point to feelings of exclusion . Foucauldian analysis of the history of constructed reason and power can help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deconstruction , we can begin to address and challenge such predisposed thought . Tourettic energy is no longer alien , but conflated , albeit complexly , with the individual self , and is shown to be comparable to more mutual human experience , such as music and poetry . However , the research into Tourette 's has just began , and a greater extent of further analysis and research is required to improve understanding into a condition which , as Sacks ( 1995 ) notes , is almost as complicated as human nature itself . Crucially , however , it is clear that an existential approach is necessary in a syndrome so bound in philosophical significance .

@@76805362 @5505362/ <h> The Attentional Blink as an Indicator of Sexual Interest <h> Abstract <p> Using implicit measures in psychological assessment is new in research . The Attentional Blink is a widely supported phenomenon in the cognitive literature . It has been reported that emotionally salient stimuli , particularly those of a sexual nature , can produce it , leading to lower recall of a neutral target presented after the stimulus item . This study looked at the Attentional Blink as a measure of sexual interest . It also looked at the use of computergenerated ( CG ) images as an alternative to real images . Findings showed that nude images produced the largest Attentional Blink , real images are most effective , and CG images produced some effect . These finding are promising for the development of CG images of children for use in paedophile assessment . <p> Keywords:paraphilia ; attentional blink ; computer generated images <h> Introduction <p> In recent years , there has been an increasing clinical interest shown in sex offending . This is partly due to the increase in acknowledgement of the levels of sex abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The implementation of the UK Criminal Justice Act ( 1991 ) has led to assessment and treatment plans being implemented for incarcerated sex offenders , and the number of people being referred for evaluation and treatment is also increasing . Assessment of sex offenders needs to take a number of factors into consideration such as behaviour , cognitions , and social factors . There is no comprehensive system for evaluating sex offenders , and many methods of assessment are used , including selfreport methods such as diaries and questionnaires ( Towl &amp; Crighton , 1996 ) and physiological measures , such as the penile plethysmograph ( PPG ) . The purpose of assessment has three main goals : to look at the risk of recidivism , to identify what treatment plan is most suitable , and to evaluate the outcome of these treatments to see if they have been successful ( Beckett , 1994 ) . <p> One of the main areas of difficulty with assessment of sex offenders is due to the fact that we are not sure who or what we are dealing with . In light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been suggested . <p> The generic term ' sex offender ' applies to those convicted of a sex crime , which includes rape , molestation and sexual harassment ( Hill , 2005 ) . The DSMIV uses the term ' paraphilias ' to describe " recurrent , intense sexual urges , fantasies or behaviours that involve unusual objects , activities or situations and cause clinically significant distress or impairment " ( American Psychiatric Association APA , 2000 , p. 571 ) . There are various headings and categories involved in the DSM 's formal definition of sexual deviations . In cases where a child and an adult are involved , this is characterised as paedophilia . There are however , further breakdowns of categories ( Geffner , Franey &amp; Falconer , 2003 ) such as gender preference ; exclusivity ( attracted only to children ) , or nonexclusivity ( also attracted to adults ) ; and if the offence is limited to incest or occurs outside the family also ( Green , 2002 ) . These variations are important in the classification of sex offenders so that appropriate treatment methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be noted that a paedophile is only classed as a sex offender if a sexual offence has been committed . <p> There is no widely accepted theory of sex offender behaviour at the present time . Many studies suggest abnormalities at a biological level ( Fedoroff , Peyser , Franz , &amp; Folstein , 1994 ; Mendez , Chow , Ringman , Twitchell , &amp; Hinkin , 2000 ; Saleh &amp; Berlin , 2003 ) . The behavioural theory of sex offending proposes that the behaviours develop due to conditioning , and the development of cognitions that reinforce this behaviour ( Becker &amp; Murphy , 1998 ) . This can be due to repeating what has been learnt ( e.g. witnessing abuse as a child ) or can be reinforced through rewarding behaviour ( e.g. masturbation ) . Becker and Murphy further argue that poor social and interpersonal skills also play a role in behavioural theories . <p> Current research is focusing on multifactor theories of sex offender behaviour . The Integrated Theory of Sexual Offending ( ITSO ; Ward &amp; Beech , 2005 ) proposes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual offending . This theory brings together information gathered from areas including clinical assessment , neuropsychology , and psychopathology . The ITSO posits that there are three sets of factors interacting : biological ( such as genetic and brain development ) , ecological ( social , environmental , and cultural ) , and neuropsychological factors . The current physical environment may be an important contributor , through the offender manipulating the availability of potential victims and also by creating the specific circumstances that may trigger the offending behaviour . <p> Neuropsychological factors include the motivation/emotion system associated with cortical , limbic and brain stem brain structures . Defects in this system may be due to problems in an individual 's cultural upbringing , or negative individual experiences . There may be difficulties in understanding and expressing emotions appropriately ( Ward &amp; Beech , 2005 ) . ITSO proposes that the dynamic interaction of these factors can lead to sexual offending . The consequences of the sexually abusive behaviours maintain a positive feedback loop , which maintains further behaviour of the same kind ( e.g. improvement in mood through sexual arousal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in turn , functions as a positive reinforcer . <p> Other multifactor theories of sexual offending include the Pathways Model ( Ward &amp; Siegert , 2002 ) , Marshall and Barbaree 's Integrated Theory ( 1990 ) and the Relapse Prevention Model ( Laws , Hudson , &amp; Ward , 2000 ) . Not all of the theories will be discussed in detail here due to space restrictions . Generally , current theories of sex offenders tend to be multifactorial in nature . <p> Due to the nature of sex offending , there are many obstacles in the way of obtaining accurate evaluation . Legal action , social bias , and selfadmission can all be barriers to obtaining honest and open information ( Clipson , 2003 ) . This is one reason why a variety of methods should be used in the assessment of sex offenders . Some of the most commonly used measures will be discussed here . Most research up to recent years has focused on the use of explicit measures of sexual interest . <p> The penile plethysmograph ( PPG ) ( Freund , 1963 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in males . This instrument measures changes in penile volume in response to certain stimuli . The PPG can directly measure levels of sexual arousal to normal stimuli , and compare this to levels of arousal to sexualised stimuli . Tong ( 2007 ) suggests that the probability that an individual might act on their arousal is strongly linked to the individual 's pattern of sexual arousal , and therefore gaining an accurate assessment of this pattern can be an important step in gauging inclination to sexual deviancy . The PPG is used in up to 1/3 of treatment programs for assessing sex offenders ( Knopp , Rosenberg &amp; Stevenson , 1992 ) . It has been found to be particularly useful in differentiating between sexual interest in children and sexual interest in adults ( Beckett , 1994 ) . However , it requires highly trained professionals to administer and interpret it , specialised equipment , and long testing sessions . It is limited also to assessing sexual arousal , and not sex drive or cognitive association about sex ( Brown , Gray &amp; Snowden , 2009 ) . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have used the PPG had major methodological issues . The PPG is also quite an invasive method of assessment <p> Other instruments and methodologies are being examined for their usefulness in assessing sexual offenders . One of these is using implicit measures of sexual interest . These measures are thought to be able to tap into automatic reactions , associations and attitudes , thus avoiding faking and social desirability answers that may taint other methods such as selfreports . Typically , the term implicit measurement refers to methods whose responses are difficult to consciously control ( Ciardha &amp; Gormley , 2009 ) . Many utilise speeded categorisation tasks , viewing time tasks and choice reaction time ( Gawronski , 2009 ) . <p> The Abel Assessment for Sexual Interest ( AASI ) is a psychosexual measure ( Able , Huffman , Warberg &amp; Holland , 1998 ) . It consists of two parts : The Abel Screen Visual Reaction Time ( VRT ) , and the Abel Questionnaire for Mean . In the VRT section , participants are presented with 160 digital images of clothed children , adolescents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate the attractiveness of the stimulus image from highly sexually disgusting to highly sexually arousing . The computer records the length of time that each slide is viewed . It also records the subjective rating of the image on the scale mentioned above . The theory proposes that the longer the image is viewed for , the more arousing the participant finds it . The Abel Questionnaire for Men makes up the second part of the AASI . It is a selfreport measure that looks at problematic sexual behaviours . The questionnaire looks at many aspects of the participant 's background including history of arrests , accusations , attempted sexual assault , convictions , type , and number of victims , cognitive distortions , social desirability , and behaviours . A study by Abel et al. , ( 2004 ) found that the AASI is a valid instrument for identifying molesters . The AASI uses only clothed images , as it is illegal to carry naked images across state lines . This measure was designed to assess for previous sexual offending in participants . Responses are compared to data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitivity and specificity to prepubescent and pubescent boys and high sensitivity but low specificity to prepubescent and pubescent girls when compared to the PPG ( Abel , Jordan , Hand , Holland , &amp; Phipps , 2001 ; Gray &amp; Plaud , 2005 . ) The AASI takes less time than the PPG to administer and score , and is less invasive . It also does not appear to have a problem with nonresponders , which is seen with the PPG ( Tong , 2007 ) . Fischer and Smith ( 1999 ) have tested the vulnerability to faking of the AASI , and while Abel proposed that the results were internally consistent , Fischer and Smith commented that the results of the analysis of variance were not published , and that only some of the categories were analysed ( Kalmus &amp; Beech , 2005 ) . <p> Following on from the AASI , and using some similar methodology , Glasgow , Osborne and Croxen ( 2003 ) developed the Affinity model to assess expressed sexual interest , and not sexual arousal . They looked at the length of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be significantly correlated with sexual interest ( Abel et al. , 1998 ; Lang , Searles , Lauerman , &amp; Adesso , 1980 ; Quinsey , Ketsetzis , Earls , &amp; Karamanoukian , 1996 ; Quinsey , Rice , Harris , &amp; Reid , 1993 ) . 28 males and 28 females in four age categories ( toddlers , preadolescents , adolescents , and adults ) are presented . All of these images are clothed , similar to the AASI . Participants are also asked to rate attractiveness . Worling ( 2006 ) looked at these methods of assessment for use with adolescents and found that the internal consistency for the measures was acceptable . <p> One of the most well known implicit measurement techniques is the Implicit Association Test ( IAT ) , developed by Greenwald , McGhee , and Schwartz in 1998 . It is similar to cognitive priming procedures as it attempts to measure the underlying automatic evaluations of implicit attitudes . The IAT looks for automatic associations between words . Participants are asked to categorise these words as pleasant or unpleasant . It should be easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unpleasant words ( e.g. insect and weapon words ) , as these are compatible . This idea is used to look at attitudes such as race . Problems with the IAT include low testretest reliability ( Cunningham , Preacher &amp; Banaji , 2001 ) and greatly varying ability to predict behaviour across studies ( Friese , Hoffman &amp; Schmitt , 2008 ) . <p> The IAT has been used in the assessment of sex offenders . Gray , Brown , MacCulloch , Smith , and Snowden ( 2005 ) developed the childsex IAT for this use . This follows the aforementioned IAT style test , but involved adult versus child words , and sex versus not sex words . They found that using this method revealed an association between children and sex in a group of child sex offenders . A further study from 2008 ( Snowden , Wichter &amp; Gray , 2008 ) looked at the ability of implicit measures to predict sexuality . They used the IAT and the priming task . Both methods had good ability to predict sexual preference . The measures also correlated strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray , and Snowden looked at cognitive associations between children and sex , in men convicted of paedophilic offences . They found that only child sex offenders had implicit associations between children and sex . Banse , Schmidt and Clarbour ( 2010 ) compared results from explicit and implicit measures , and found that specific IAT 's and viewing time tasks discriminated between nonoffenders and child sex offenders nearly as well as explicit measures in a mostly nondenying sample . This research is promising for newer , more accurate assessment methods . <p> Another implicit measure that is being researched involves the use of rapid serial visual presentation ( RSVP ) . This measures the " attentional blink " ( Raymond , Shapiro , &amp; Arnell , 1992 ) . In this method , a stream of images is presented in very quick succession ( approximately 20 milliseconds each ) . It has been found that if participants only need to search for one target image ( T1 ) in the stream , accuracy is usually high . When participants must look for two targets however , accurate recall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it appeared within 200 500 ms of T1 . This is due to attentional resources being depleted as a result of attending to T1 ( Raymond et al. , 1992 ) . When participants view an emotionally salient or arousing image , the attentional blink has been found to be enhanced , resulting in a reduction in accuracy when reporting a target image following later in the image stream ( Barnard , Ramponi , Battye , &amp; Mackintosh , 2005 ) . The emotionally salient/arousing images act as an additional target , a T1 . Arnell , Killman , and Fijavz ( 2007 ) developed an experiment in which participants performed a single target search . The target was preceded by a tobeignored image . They found that when this item was a sexual word , the accuracy for the target was reduced . Most , Smith , Cooter , Levy and Zald ( 2007 ) also found that erotic pictures produced an even more robust effect than negative images , which had previously been thought to produce the strongest reaction ( Most , Chun , Widders , &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2008 ) focused on these findings and used them to examine the effects of using images of children as a distractor target in a sample of paedophiles . They proposed that more errors would be made by a group of child sex offenders when presented with images of children compared to a control group . This proposal was upheld by the findings . The child molester group made more errors when the distractor target was that of a child , than when it was of an animal , that is , the child had an attention capturing effect , which could indicate an abnormal interest in children ( Beech et al. , 2008 ) . <p> Part of the difficulty of assessing paedophiles is the problem of using real nude images of children . It is illegal and highly unethical . Recently , the use of computerised images has been suggested to avoid these issues . If these images elicit the same reaction as real images , they would be extremely useful for assessing paedophiles . <h> Aims of Study <p> The purpose of this study is to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second aim is to discover if clothed images have the same effect as nude images , and thirdly , to see if computergenerated images have the same effect as real images . Stability over time will also be assessed . <h> Method <h> Participants <p> There were 145 participants , 121 females ( 83.4% ) and 24 males ( 16.6% ) . The average age was 21 years , ranging from 19 to 45 . Three participants were listed as bisexual ( 2.1% ) , with the remainder reporting as heterosexual . <h> Materials <p> Images were displayed on a blank projector screen that was present in the lecture hall . Participants ' responses were recorded on forms prepared by the experimenter , with a cover page collecting demographic information including age , sex , and sexual orientation . These forms were identical for first test and second test . The computer program that was used was developed as part of the RSVP study by Dr. S. Hammond . The program was written in Delphi and runs on a Windows platform . Data was analysed using PASW Statistics 17 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The participants completed the experiment twice , with a oneweek gap . The experiment was repeated to test reliability . Reliability in this case is concerned with consistency over time ; therefore , a testretest method is used . There should be a high positive correlation of the results from the first and second tests to indicate reliability . The stimulus image was used as the independent variable ( Appendix ) . There were two presentations of each type of stimulus image , a total of 32 stimulus images ( 16 variations of stimulus images , each presented twice ) . The programme consists of 32 sets of a series of eight images ( seven neutral , one stimulus ) displayed for 20 ms each . Stimulus images were whole body , and the age differentiation was between " young adult " ( &lt;30 years approx. ; &gt;20years approx. ) and " older adult " ( &gt;60 years approx . ) . All images were colour . Computer generated images of children were not used in this study due to difficulties in gaining ethical approval in a limited timeframe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control for primacy and recency effects , the first and last images were always neutral images ( chair , apple etc . ) . In between images were randomised by the programme and presentation order was the same for the first and second tests . The stimulus image was used to investigate whether sexual attraction to the stimulus image resulted in decreased accuracy in identifying the target image ( the image immediately following the stimulus ) . The accuracy of target identification was used for data analysis . An incorrect image ( an image that did not appear in the set ) was listed as one of the options to identify guessing/selecting all options . <h> Procedure <p> Participants were instructed on how to complete the experiment . They were told that a series of images would be shown on the projector and following this , another screen would be shown with a list of six items . Participants were to tick the box next to each items name that they had seen presented . They were allowed approximately 20 seconds to complete this before presentation of the next set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of images . The participants were thanked , and the experiment was finished . Presentation for second test was the same . <h> Ethics <p> Before taking part in this experiment , participants were advised that naked images would be presented on screen , and that they did not have to participate if this would make them uncomfortable . Participants had the right to withdraw at any stage of the study , and were given the contact details of a sexual orientation organisation . Participants remained anonymous throughout the study , by using a selfselected password . Any questions or concerns could be forwarded to the experimenter , and an email address was provided for this . <h> Results <h> Examination of the Main Effects of the Experiment <p> A fiveway Analysis of Variance ( 2 sex of participant by 2 sex of target by 2 age of target by 2 target image type by 2 clothed status of target ) was performed . A split plot design was employed in which all target effects were repeated measures . The results of this are shown in Table 1 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Effect <p> F <p> p <p> ? 2 <p> Sex of participant <p> 2.992 <p> .087 <p> 0.020 <p> Sex of target <p> 1.010 <p> .317 <p> 0.007 <p> Age of target <p> 15.38 <p> &lt; .001 <p> 0.097 <p> Image type ( CGI/Real ) <p> 21.601 <p> &lt; .001 <p> 0.131 <p> Clothed status <p> 110.567 <p> &lt; .001 <p> 0.436 <p> The sex of the participant was not significant , neither was the sex of the target . However , three factors were found to have a significant main effect . These were the age of the target image , the image type , and whether the target image was nude or clothed . The main effect means are presented in Table 2 . <p> Table 2 <p> Mean Attentional Blink for the Three Significant Main Effects <p> Main Effect <p> Means <p> S.E. <p> Young vs .

Images of younger individuals caused a greater Attentional Blink than those of older people . However , the effect size is small ( 0.097 ) , despite its statistical significance . The image type also had a significant result with real images creating a greater Attentional Blink than CG images . This had quite a large effect size of 0.131 . Finally , whether the image was clothed or nude had a highly significant effect . Nude images produced a much larger Attentional Blink than clothed images . The effect size was also high , with partial eta squared being 0.436 . <h> Commentary <p> Nude images work best in eliciting an Attentional Blink . CG images are not as effective as real images so the option of using CG images as an alternative to real photographic images has less promise than was anticipated . The low effect size found with the sex of the target is not unexpected because it does not take the sex of the participant into account . For this reason the effects are best analysed in interaction with the sex of the participant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Table 3 , the 2way interactions with participant sex are presented . <p> Table 3 <p> Interactions with Sex of the Participant <p> Effect <p> F <p> p <p> ? 2 <p> Sex of target <p> 3.217 <p> .075 <p> 0.022 <p> Age of target <p> 0.021 <p> .884 <p> 0.000 <p> Image type ( CGI/Real ) <p> 0.963 <p> .328 <p> 0.007 <p> Clothed status <p> 2.796 <p> .097 <p> 0.019 <p> It is surprising that the interactions with participant sex by sex were not greater than observed in Table 3 . No effect manifested statistical significance at the 5% level although a weak 10% level of significance was observed for sex of target and clothed status . The interaction of participant sex by target sex is plotted in Figure 1 . This shows that the main effect occurs for males , in that female stimuli trigger greater Attentional Blink than male stimuli . While the opposite effect is found for females , this is at a much lower level indicating the differential effect of the technique for males and females . This suggests that Attentional Blink as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It also might have been expected that the Attentional Blink in male participants would be more triggered by nude images than it was in the female participants ; however , the Attentional Blink is equally triggered by nude images for males and females in this study . <h> Other Significant Effects <p> A number of other significant interactions were observed that throw some light onto the manner in which Attentional Blink is generated . These are presented in Table 4 . <p> Other significant findings in the data analysis included the interactions between the age of the target and the type of image , type of image and clothed status , and also a threeway interaction between the target sex , age of target and clothed status . <p> It was found that when the image type was CG , this discriminates the older adult images from young adult images better than real images . The young images caused a greater Attentional Blink than the older CG images . This had a moderate to large effect size of 0.126 . It is interesting to see that CG images can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen plotted in Figure 2 . <p> Looking at the image type by clothed status interaction shows that CG images do not discriminate nude from clothed as well as the real images do . There were however , lower scores ( and therefore more of an Attentional Blink ) from nude CG images than from clothed real images and clothed CG images , which indicates that the CG images may be useful . <p> A further significant interaction was seen between sex of target , age of target , and whether the image was clothed/nude . When the images were clothed , the largest Attentional Blink was seen for young females . This was followed by old males , old females and the least Attentional Blink was found for young males . See Figure 3 . This would seem to indicate that sexual interest is most apparent for young females . When looking at the nude condition however , we see that young males caused the largest Attentional Blink . See Figure 4 . These results are more like what was expected , as the majority of the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show the most sexual interest for males . <h> TestRetest Reliability ( Stability ) <p> An important consideration when developing an assessment device is its stability over time . In this study , 45 individuals performed the task twice , one week apart . A correlational analysis was used to test the reliability of scores between first test and second test . The Pearson correlations were for Male images AB : r = 0.47 , n=45 , p&lt;0.01 ; for female images AB : r = 0.48 , n=45 , p&lt;0.01 ; for CG images AB : r = 0.47 , n=45 , p&lt;0.01 ; and for Real images AB : r = 0.35 , n=45 , p&lt;0.05 . All of these results are statistically significant , showing moderate stability over time . However , it should be clear that , interpreted as reliability coefficients , these correlations are quite small , raising questions about the temporal consistency of Attentional Blink for this task . <h> Discussion <p> The results from this study show some very interesting findings . Initially , and counterintuitively , it appears that the sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This seems to suggest that the Attentional Blink as a measure of sexual interest may not be as robust as previously thought . When examined further , however , we see that there is in fact an increased Attentional Blink shown from the male respondents to female stimuli , and the effect is being weakened by the female participants . This is not really an issue , as most research will involve male participants , due to the majority of paedophiles being male ( Adshead , Howett &amp; Mason , 1994 ) . <p> Using clothed images was not as effective in eliciting the Attentional Blink as using nude images . This indicates that the sexual provocation of the image is a big factor in assessing sexual interest . It also means that using real clothed images of children in paedophile assessment may not be useful , which further underlines the importance of developing CG images for this purpose . <p> The nude CG images used in this study did have more of a reaction than the clothed images , whether they were real or CG . This finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by Laws and Gress ( 2004 ) . Computergenerated images of older adults had less of an effect on recall accuracy than either CG images of younger adults or either age group of real images . This is interesting as it suggests that the CG images discriminated age better than real images . This result may prove useful as perhaps it could be repeated using images of children . It was unexpected to have found this difference as with the real images , the difference in Attentional Blink shown for young and older adults is very small . <h> Limitations of the Study <p> The results of this study were based on student samples , and consisted overwhelmingly of heterosexual females , which is not ideal as the measure is being looked at for use with sexually offending paedophiles . The number of male participants was small . Also , the sample was quite young , due to it being all students . A more varied age group may have got some quite different results , with there being more of a variation in sexual interest , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study were heterosexual also , which is not representative of a normal sample . There are limits of generalising to sex offenders . However , it is still assessing sexual interest , which exists in any sample . <h> Suggestions for Future Research <p> It would be useful to run the study again with a large allmale sample to see if the nude/clothed effect would be repeated for males . Although the effect for clothed images was weaker , this does not necessarily preclude their usefulness . When assessing paedophiles , the attentional blink just has to be stronger for images of children over images of adults , not necessarily strongly . In fact it may be more unobtrusive to use clothed images when assessing this population . <p> While CG images did not work as effectively as real images , they did show some promise . Perhaps more developed and realistic images could be used . The sample age was also young as it was all students , a larger range of ages could provide some interesting findings . At further study could look at using images of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at .

Although research has focused on the ( un ) fair treatment provided by management , people in organisations also form fairness perceptions from several other sources of justice . The aim of this project is to examine the joint effect of multiple sources of justice ( the organisation , managers , coworkers , and customers ) on relevant organisational outcomes , such as employees ' commitment , well-being , and performance . Mapping the sources of justice and their effects represents a key aspect to improve employees ' quality of working life while enhancing organisational effectiveness .

Influence of Workplace Procrastination on Work Outcomes and Employee Well-Being <p> Supervisor : Baran Metin , PhD student , University of Utrecht , The Netherlands <p> Abstract : Soldiering can be described as expending the least effort still acceptable to avoid punishment at work . For instance , delaying to do work tasks , using internet for non-work purposes , or taking longer coffee breaks may each be referred to as examples of soldiering . Occupational Health Psychology ( OHP ) mainly focuses on employee well-being , safety and health ; however , OHP research rarely examines idle employee behaviour . Current technology alters the traditional ways of detecting time spent engaging in non-work activity . Thus , we aim to a ) understand the characteristics that lead to soldiering ; b ) investigate outcomes of soldiering ; c ) to determine if this behaviour is harmful ; and d ) to compare the soldiering level of different cultures . We hope to develop evidence to understand and address this phenomenon . <p> Abstract : People want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growing prominence of empirical evidence that demonstrate the potential of organisational justice to create powerful benefits for organisations and employees , too . Perceptions of justice are positively related to a broad range of organisationally relevant outcomes , including employees work engagement and performance . At the same time , perceptions of injustice lead to various undesirable employee attitudes and behaviors . Aforementioned imposes questions that we will explore : what if employees simultaneously experience both , fair and unfair treatment ? How will this affect their work engagement and performance ? Moreover , we will examine whether these reactions to justice ( mis ) alignment are universal or culturally dependent , and thereby contribute to this yet insufficiently explored area . <p> Abstract : In spite of great economic potential , mergers and acquisitions are often unsuccessful because of psycho-social factors among employees .

They are asked to experience potential trauma as part of their role . They are trained to be resilient and understand that with the role comes potential damage to their well-being . To be able to continue to respond throughout their careers they must demonstrate a degree of resilience . However , regular and extended exposure may lead the personnel to default to dissociative behaviours in order to cope .

@@76805439 @5505439/ <h> Menu <h> Bayesian Statistics : Why and How <p> Bayesian statistics is what all the cool kids are talking about these days . Upon closer inspection , this does not come as a surprise . In contrast to classical statistics , Bayesian inference is principled , coherent , unbiased , and addresses an important question in science : in which of my hypothesis should I believe in , and how strongly , given the collected data ? - <p> After briefly stating the fundamental difference between classical and Bayesian statistics , I will introduce three software packages JAGS , BayesFactor , and JASP to conduct Bayesian inference . I will analyse simulated data about the effect of wearing a hat on creativity , just as the previous blog post did . In the end I will sketch some benefits a " Bayesian turn " would have on scientific practice in psychology . <p> Note that this post is very long , introducing plenty of ideas that you might not be familiar with ( regrettably , they are not found in the standard university curriculum ! ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayesian inference for psychologists . Wherever possible , I have linked to additional literature and resources for more in-depth treatments . <p> After you have read this post , you will begin to understand what the fuss is all about , and you will be familiar with tools to apply Bayesian inference . Let 's dive in ! <h> Classical Statistics <h> What is probability ? <p> Classical statistics conceptualizes probability as long run relative frequency . For example , the probability of a coin coming up heads is the proportion of heads in an infinite set of coin tosses . This is why classical statistics is sometimes called frequentist . At first glance , this definition seems reasonable . However , to talkabout probability , we now have to think about an infinite repetition of an event ( e.g. , tossing a coin ) . Frequentists , therefore , can only assign probability to events that are repeatable . They can not , for example , talk about the probability of the temperature rising 4 -C in the next 15 years ; or Hillary Clinton winning the next U.S. election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequentists can not assign probabilities to theories and hypotheses which arguably is what scientists want ( see Gigerenzer , 1993 ) . <h> p values <p> Because of the above definition of probability , inference in classical statistics is counterintuitive , for students and senior researchers alike ( e.g. , Haller &amp; Kraus , 2002 ; Hoekstra , Morey , Rouder , &amp; Wagenmakers , 2014 ; Oakes , 1986 ) . One notoriously difficult concept is that of the p value : the probability of obtaining a result as extreme as the one observed , or more extreme , given that the null hypothesis is true . To compute p values , we collect data and then assume an infinite repetition of the experiment , yielding more ( hypothetical ) data . For each repetition we compute a test statistic , such as the mean . The distribution of these means is the sampling distribution of the mean , and if our observed mean is far off in the tails of this distribution , based on an arbitrary standard ( $alpha = .05$ ) we conclude that our result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure below " inspired by figure 1 in Wagenmakers , 2007 . <p> It is very easy to gloss over these specific assumptions of classical statistics because properties of the sampling distribution are often known analytically . For example , in the case of the t-test , the variance of the sampling distribution is the variance of the actual collected data , divided by the number of data points ; $hat sigma2 = sigma2 / N$ . <p> Inference based on p values is a remarkable procedure : We assume that we did the experiment an infinite amount of time ( we did n't  ) , and we compute probabilities of data we have n't observed , assuming that the null hypothesis is true . This way of drawing inferences has serious deficits . For an enlightening yet easy to read paper about these issues , see Wagenmakers ( 2007 ) . If you think that you could need a more detailed refresher on p values they are tricky ! see here . <h> Confidence Intervals <p> Recently , the ( old ) new statistics has been proposed , abandoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals ( Cumming , 2014 ) . As we will see later , parameter estimation and hypothesis testing answer different questions , so abandoning one in favour of the other is misguided . Because confidence intervals are still based on classical theory , they are an equally flawed method of drawing inferences ; see Lee ( n.d. ) and Morey et al . ( submitted ) . <h> What are parameters ? <p> Tied to the classical notion of probability , classical statistics considers the population parameter as fixed , while the data are allowed to vary ( repeated sampling ) . For example , the average difference between men and women in height is exactly 15 centimeters . We can intuit that confidence intervals , as well as statistical power , are not concerned with the actual data we have collected . Why ? <p> Assume we collect height data from men and women , and compute a 95% confidence interval around our difference estimate this does not mean that we are 95% confident that the true parameter lies within these bounds ! For the actual experiment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 95% confidence intervals state that , if we were to repeat our experiment an infinite amount of time , in 95% of all cases the parameter will be within those bounds ( Hoekstra , Morey , Rouder , &amp; Wagenmakers , 2014 ) . This must be so because we can only talk about probability as relative frequency : we have to assume repeating our experiment , even though we only conducted one ! <p> It is important to note that all probability statements in classical statistics are of that nature : they average over an infinite repetition of experiments . Probability statements do not pertain to the specific data you gathered ; they are about the testing procedure itself . Extend this to statistical power , which is the probability of finding an effect when there really is one . High-powered experiments yield informative data , on average . Low-powered experiments yield uninformative data , on average . However , for the specific experiment actually carried out once the data are in we can go beyond power as a measure of how informative our experiment was ( Wagenmakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I explain what this entails when using Bayesian inference for hypothesis testing . <h> Bayesian Statistics <h> What is probability ? <p> In Bayesian inference , probability is a means to quantify uncertainty . Continuing with the height example above , Bayesians quantify uncertainty about the difference in height with a probability distribution . It might be reasonable , for example , to specify a normal distribution with mean $mu = 15$ and variance $sigma2 = 16$ <p> We most strongly believe that the height difference is 15 centimeters , although it could also be 10 , or even 5 centimeters ( but with lower probability ) . However , we might not be so sure about our estimates . To incorporate uncertainty , we could increase the variance of the distribution ( decrease the " peakedness " ) , say , in this case , to $sigma2 = 16$ . The plot below compares possible prior beliefs ( click on the image to enlarge it ) . <p> In the Bayesian world , probability retains the intuitive , common-sense interpretation : it is simply a measure of uncertainty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one single true value in some ontological sense , men are on average exactly 15 centimeters taller than women , we quantify our uncertainty about this difference with a probability distribution . The beautiful part is that , if we collect data , we simply update our prior beliefs with the information that is in the data to yield posterior beliefs . <h> Bayesian Parameter Estimation <p> There 's no theorem like Bayes theorem Like no theorem we know Everything about it is appealing Everything about it is a wow Let out all that a priori feeling Youve been concealing right up to now ! George Box <p> Because parameters themselves are assigned a distribution , statistical inference reduces to applying the rules of probability . We specify a joint distribution over data and parameters , $p ( textbfy , theta ) $ . By the definition of conditional probability we can write $p ( textbfy , theta ) = p(textbfytheta)p(theta)$ . The first term , $p(textbfytheta)$ , is the likelihood , and it embodies our statistical model . It also exists in the frequentist world , and it contains assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether they are normally distributed or Bernoulli distributed . The other term , $p(theta)$ , is called the prior distribution over the parameters , and quantifies our belief ( before looking at data ) in , say , height differences among the sexes . <p> Combining the data we have collected with our prior beliefs is done via Bayes theorem : <p> With Bayes rule we are solving the " inverse probability problem " , that is we are going from the effect ( the data ) back to the cause ( the parameter ) ( Bayes , 1763 ; Laplace 1774 ) . <p> Classical statistics has a whole variety of estimators , such as maximum likelihood and generalized least squares , which are investigated along specific dimensions ( e.g. bias , efficiency , consistency ) . In contrast , Bayesians always uses Bayes rule , which simply follows from probability . This is why we say that Bayesian statistics is principled , rational , and coherent . Let 's take a look at a simple example to see how the two estimation approaches differ . <h> A simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads both times . What is your estimate that the next coin flip comes up heads ? We know that flipping a coin several times , with the flips being independent , can be described binomially with likelihood : <p> where $N$ is the number of flips and $k$ is the number of heads . The likelihood $L ( theta textbfy ) $ is just the probability expressed in terms of the parameter $theta$ , instead of the data $textbfy$ ( and need not sum to 1 ) . For example , assuming $theta = .5$ , the likelihood is : <p> We see that $theta = 1$ maximizes the likelihood ; in other words : $theta = 1$ is the maximum likelihood estimator ( MLE ) for these data . Maximum likelihood estimation is the workhorse of classical inference . In classical statistics , then , the prediction for the next coin coming up heads would be 1 . This is somewhat counterintuitive ; would that really be your prediction , after just two coin flips ? What does the Bayesian in you think ? <p> First , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Invoking the principle of insufficient reason , we use a prior that assigns equal probability to all possible values of $theta$ : the uniform distribution . We can write this as a Beta distribution with parameters $a = 1 , b = 1$ : <p> where $textbfK$ is the normalizing constant and not of importance for now . $a$ and $b$ can be interpreted as prior data . In our example , $a$ would be the number of heads and $b$ would be the number of tails . Remember that in Bayesian inference we just multiply the likelihood with the prior . The Beta distribution is a conjugate prior for the binomial likelihood . This means that when using this prior , the posterior will again be a Beta distribution , making for trivial computation . Plugging in Bayes rule yields : <p> The point with the most probability density , the mode , is $ ( a 1 ) / ( a + b 2 ) $ which in our case yields $1$ . However , as we see when looking at the distribution , there is substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean of the posterior distribution , $a / ( a + b ) $ , as our best guess for the future . Thus , the prediction for the next coin flip being heads is $.75$ . Note that classical estimation , based on maximum likelihood ( $thetaMLE = k / N = 2 / 2$ ) , would predict heads with 100% certainty . For more on likelihoods , check out this nice blog post . For more details on Bayesian updating , see this . <p> What can be seen in conjugate examples quite clearly is that the Bayesian posterior is a weighted combination of the prior and the likelihood . We have seen that the posterior mean is : <p> Both the maximum likelihood estimator $thetaMLE = k / n$ and the mean of the prior $a / ( a + b ) $ are weighted by terms that depend on the sample size $n$ and the prior parameters $a$ and $b$ . Two important things should be noted here . First , this implies that the posterior mean is shrunk toward the prior mean . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrinkage yields a better estimator ( Efron &amp; Morris , 1977 ) . For a nice tutorial on hierarchical Bayesian inference , see Sorensen &amp; Vasishth ( submitted ) . <p> The second thing to note is that when $n$ becomes very large , the Bayes point estimate and the classical maximum likelihood estimate converge to the same value ( Bernstein-von Mises theorem ) . You can see this in the formula above . The first weight becomes 1 and the second weight becomes 0 , leaving only $k / n$ , which is the maximum likelihood estimate . Therefore , when different people initially disagree ( different prior ) , once they have seen enough evidence , they will agree ( same posterior ) . <p> Note that identical estimation results need not lead to the same model comparison results . I find the argument that because the estimation converges , we can just go on doing frequentist statistics rather disturbing . First , you never have an infinite amount of participants . Second , the prior allows you to incorporate theoretical meaningful information into your model , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Third , and most important , estimation and testing answer different questions . While parameter estimates might converge , Bayesian hypothesis testing offers a much more elegant and richer inferential foundation over that provided by classical testing ( but more on this below ) . <h> Markov chain Monte Carlo <p> Using a simple example , we have seen how Bayesians update their prior beliefs upon seeing new data , yielding posterior beliefs . However , conjugacy is not always given , and the prior times the likelihood might be a unusually formed , complex distribution that we can not track analytically . For most of the 20th century , Bayesian analysis was restricted to conjugate priors for computational simplicity . <p> But things have changed . Due to the advent of cheap computing power and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques ( MCMC ) we now can estimate basically every posterior distribution we like . <h> Bayesian hypothesis testing <p> Parameter estimation is not the same as testing hypotheses ( e.g. Morey , Rouder , Verhagen , &amp; Wagenmakers , 2014 ; Wagenmakers , Lee , Rouder , &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while each observation tells you something about the parameter , not every observation is informative about which hypothesis you should believe in . To build an intuition for that , let 's throw a coin ( again ) . Is it a fair coin ( $theta = .5$ ) or a biased ( $theta neq .5$ ) coin ? Assume the first observation is heads . You learn something about the parameter $p$ ; for example , it ca n't be equal to 0 ( always tails ) , and that a bias toward heads is more likely than a bias toward tails . Looking only at the parameter estimate thus carries some evidence against the null hypothesis . However , in fact you have learned nothing that would strengthen your belief in either of your hypotheses . Observing heads is equally consistent with the coin being unbiased and the coin being biased ( the Bayes factor is equal to 1 , but more below ) . Inference by parameter estimation is inadequate , unprincipled , and biased . <p> In order to test hypotheses , we have to compute the marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( because it is just a constant ) . As a reminder , here is the formula again : <p> Let 's say we compare two models , $M0$ and $M1$ , that describe a difference in the creativity of people who wear hats and others who do n't  . The parameter of interest is $delta$. $M0$ restricts $delta$ to 0 , while $M1$ let 's $delta$ vary . This corresponds to testing a null hypothesis $H0 : delta = 0$ against the alternative $H1 : delta neq 0$ . In order to test which hypothesis is more likely to be true , we pit the predictions of the models against each other . The prediction of the models is embodied by their respective marginal likelihoods , $p(textbfyM)$ . For the discrete case , this yields : <p> The Bayes factor is a continuous measure of evidence : $BF01 = 3$ indicates that the data are three times more likely under the null model $M0$ than under the alternative model $M1$ . Note that $BF10 = 1 / BF01$ , and that when the prior odds are 1 , the posterior odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture many different observations , their prior on parameters $p(theta)$ is spread out wider than those of simpler models . Thus there is little density at any specific point because complex models can capture so many data points ; taken individually , each data point is comparatively less likely . For the marginal likelihood , this means that the likelihood gets multiplied with these low density values of the prior , which decreases the overall marginal likelihood . Thus model comparison via Bayes factors incorporates an automatic Ockhams razor , guarding us against overfitting . <p> While classical approaches like the AIC naively add a penalty term ( 2 times the number of parameters ) to incorporate model complexity , Bayes factors offer a more natural and principled approach to this problem . For details , see Vandekerckhove , Matzke , &amp; Wagenmakers ( 2014 ) . <h> Two priors <p> Note that there are actually two priors " one over models , as specified by the prior odds $p(M0) / p(M1)$ , and one over the parameters , $p(theta)$ , which is implicit in the marginal likelihoods . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model or hypothesis is over the other , prior to data collection . It is irrelevant for the experiment at hand , but might be important for drawing conclusions . For example , Daryl Bem found a high Bayes factor in support of precognition . Surely this does not by itself mean that we should believe in precognition ! The prior odds for pre-cognition are extremely low at least for me so that even if multiplied by a Bayes factor of 1000 , the posterior odds will be vanishingly small : <p> We can agree on how much the data support precognition ( as quantified by the Bayes factor ) . However , this does not mean we have to buy it . Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . <h> Savage-Dickey trick <p> For the univariable case , computing the marginal likelihood is pretty straightforward ; however , the integrals get harder with many variables , say in multiple regression . Note that while parameter estimation is basically solved with MCMC methods , computing the marginal likelihood is still a tough deal . However , when testing nested models , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can use a neat mathematical trick that sidesteps the issue of computing the marginal likelihood " the Savage-Dickey density ratio : <p> That is , take the ratio of the posterior density at the point of interest , for example $delta = 0$ , and divide it by the prior density at the point of interest . Note that unlike to the p value , the Bayes factor is not limited to testing nested models , but can compare complex , functionally different models ( as is common in cognitive science ) . We will see a nice graphical depiction of Savage-Dickey later . <p> Let us revisit our coin toss example . We flipped the coin twice and observed heads both times . Suppose we want to test the hypothesis that the coin is fair " that is $theta = .5$ . Using the Savage-Dickey density ratio , we divide the height of the posterior distribution at $theta = .5$ by the height of the prior distribution at $theta = .5$ . Recall that : <p> The data are $1frac13$ times more likely under the model that assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a nice first lesson in Bayesian inference that prominently features coin tosses with interactive examples , see this . For an excellent introduction to the Savage-Dickey density ratio , see Wagenmakers et al . ( 2010 ) . <h> Lindleys paradox and the problem with uninformative priors <p> Uninformative priors like $textUnif ( -inftytext , +inftytext ) $ can be used in parameter estimation because the data quickly overwhelm the prior . However , when testing hypotheses , we need to use priors that are at least somewhat informative . One can see the problem with uninformative priors in the Savage-Dickey equation . These priors spread out their probability mass such that at each point there is virtually zero density . Dividing something by a very , very small number yields a very , very high number . The resulting Bayes factor favours the null hypothesis without bounds ( DeGroot , 1982 ; Lindley , 1957 ) . Consequently , we need to use informative priors for hypothesis testing . Rouder , Morey , Wagenmakers and colleagues have extended the default priors initially proposed by Harold Jeffreys ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see Rouder &amp; Morey ( 2012 ) , but should be given some thought and possible adjustments before used . <h> Creativity example <p> We want to know if wearing hats does indeed have an effect on creativity . Instead of collecting real data , we just simulate data , assuming a real effect of Cohens $d = 7 / 15$ . <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> 6 <p> 7 <p> 8 <p> 9 <p> set.seed(666) <p> x&lt;-rep ( 0:1 , each=50 ) <p> y1&lt;-rnorm ( 50 , mean=50 , sd=15 ) <p> y2&lt;-rnorm ( 50 , mean=57 , sd=15 ) <p> dat&lt;-data.frame ( y=c ( y1 , y2 ) , x=x ) <p> boxplot ( yx , dat , col=c ( 'blue ' , ' green ' ) , <p> xlab='condition ' , ylab='creativity ' ) <h> Classical Inference <p> In classical statistics we would compute p values . Because the t-test is simply a general linear model with one categorical @ @ @ @ @ summary ( lm ( yx , dat ) ) <p> ## Call : <p> ## lm ( formula = y x , data = dat ) <p> ## <p> ## Residuals : <p> ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max <p> ## -43.120 -10.578 0.219 11.295 33.223 <p> ## <p> ## Coefficients : <p> ## Estimate Std . Error t value Pr(&gt;t) <p> ## ( Intercept ) 49.028 2.195 22.339 <p> If you are not familiar with R , this output might look daunting . Note that the t-test as a general linear model states that <p> In the R output , ( Intercept ) is $beta0$ , while x is $beta1$. $beta0$ is the mean of the group in which our categorical predictor is 0 , i.e. the group which did not wear hats . The group that did wear hats , on the other hand , gets a creativity boost of 6.944 . The p value for this difference is $p = .028$ . We would conclude that the probability of observing these data or more extreme data given that there really is no effect is only 2.8% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say our result is statistically significant . Although we have not computed $p(H1textbfy)$ , we would conclude that the result supports the alternative hypothesis . Is this really so ? <h> Bayesian Inference <p> Below I introduce three sofware packages for Bayesian inference . The first one , JAGS , is very low-level and does not readily provide Bayes factors . Its primary use is to estimate the posterior distribution . In our present example , we are interested in the difference between the two groups , specifically in the effect size . As mentioned earlier , we can use uninformative priors for parameter estimation . To get a feeling for slightly informative priors , however , I will specify default priors when using JAGS . Subsequently we will compute Bayes factors using the BayesFactor R package and the graphical software JASP . <h> Using JAGS <p> JAGS ( " Just Another Gibbs Sampler " ) implements MCMC methods ( as discussed above ) to sample from the posterior distribution . This is especially needed when the posterior distribution is not available in closed form say when we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of our prior belief , we will specify our prior beliefs over the effect size $delta = mu / sigma2$ . As suggested in the literature , we might want to use a default prior . For a detailed rationale of so-called default priors , see pages 6 and 7 of this , Rouder , Speckman , Sun , Morey , &amp; Iverson ( 2009 ) , and Rouder &amp; Morey ( 2012 ) . For a more thorough treatment of the default prior approach pioneered by Harold Jeffreys , see Ly et al . ( in press ) . <h> Constructing a default prior <p> What is our prior on the effect size ? We might want to use a normal distribution centered on 0 : <p> beginequation* delta sim textNormal ( 0 , g ) endequation* <p> The more difficult question is how to specify the variance , $g$ . If we specify large values , then we say that we also expect very high values for the effect size , like 2 or 3 . This never happens in psychology ! Perhaps we should choose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not quantify our uncertainty about the variance with a probability distribution ! <p> This is what we will do , using the inverse Gamma distribution which has two parameters : <p> Now when we integrate out the parameter $g$ , that is incorporate our uncertainty about the variance in our belief about the effect size , this elaborate prior specification simplifies to : <p> beginequation* delta sim textCauchy(r) endequation* <p> The Cauchy distribution has only one parameter , $r$ . It is similar to a normal distribution , but with fatter tails ( indicating greater uncertainty ) . The scale parameter $r$ influences the width of the distribution ; the higher the parameter value , the wider the distribution " meaning greater probability density at the tails . <p> Are we done ? Not quite ! We still need to specify a prior over the variance . Because we do not make inference about the variance , we can give it a noninformative , Jeffreys prior . We approximate the Jeffreys prior using an inverse Gamma distribution with very small shape and rate parameters ( e.g. Morey , Rouder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also have to specify a prior distribution over $beta0$ , the mean of the group that did not wear hats . Again , because our inference does not depend on this parameter , we assign it an uninformative prior : <p> Note that the specification in JAGS does not use the variance $sigma2$ , but precision , which is $1 / sigma2$ . Therefore , to specify a high variance , we would use a low precision . <p> Although it is possible to compute Bayes factors directly in JAGS , for example using the product-space method ( Lodewyckx et al. , 2011 ) or conditional marginal density estimation ( Morey et al. , 2011 ) , it is primarily used to estimate posterior distributions of parameters of interest . In the example that follows , we will compute Bayes factors with easier-to-use software and use JAGS to estimate posterior distributions . By the way , if you are lost with all those different distributions , check out Richard Moreys nice interactive visualisations . <p> which is the specification used in JAGS ( <p> 24 <p> 25 <p> library ( 'rjags ' ) # for communicating with JAGS <p> library ( 'ggmcmc ' ) # for nice visualizations <p> options ( scipen=100 , digits=5 ) <p> modelstring&lt;- ' <p> model <p> ### priors <p> sigma dgamma ( .00001 , .00001 ) # Jeffreys prior <p> d dnorm ( 0 , invg ) # prior on effect size d <p> invg dgamma ( 1/2 , rsqr/2 ) # prior on variance of d <p> b0 dnorm ( 0 , .0001 ) # mean of the non-hat group <p> tau &lt;- pow ( sigma , -2 ) # precision = 1/variance <p> b1 &lt;- d * sigma # difference between non-hat &amp; hat <p> ### likelihood <p> for ( i in 1:N ) <p> yi dnorm ( mui , tau ) <p> mui &lt;- b0 + b1 * xi # t-test as a general linear model <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' d ' ) <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... <p> The plot below shows the posterior distributions of b0 ( the mean in the no-hats condition ) , b1 ( the difference between the two groups ) , and d ( effect size ) : <p> How wonderful ! Instead of a point estimate , we get a whole distribution . It is important to check if the MCMC algorithm actually converged on the posterior distribution . Run the commands below to monitor convergence : <p> We can be 95% confident that the effect size is between .034 and .802 . There is substantial variability , but that 's just how things are ( also this ) . Note that , in this case , the frequentist confidence interval coincides with the Bayesian credibility interval . <p> What John Kruschke and other advocates of " Hypothesis testing via Estimation " would have us look at to draw inferences is only these posterior distributions . Simplifying a bit , if the 95% credibility interval of d excludes 0 ( or some specified region of interest , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is an effect . Note that this is somewhat unprincipled " how strongly should we believe in an effect ? And it is biased against $H0$ " we will see below that there is not much evidence for an effect . <p> Note also that we might have outliers in our data , rendering the normal distribution inadequate . Thanks to JAGSs flexibility , we can easily substitute the normal distribution with a t-distribution , which has fatter tails . This would make our inference more robust , see e.g. chapter 16 in Kruschke ( 2015 ) . <p> Concluding the section on JAGS , I want to say that JAGS offers a lot of flexibility , but at the price of complexity . Below I introduce you to more user-friendly software , which also enables us to easily compute Bayes factors for common designs . However , if you are doing multivariate statistics like structural equation modeling , there is no way around software like JAGS . If you are interested in cognitive modeling of the Bayesian kind , you also need to use JAGS . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagenmakers ( 2013 ) . <h> Using BayesFactor <p> The BayesFactor R package written by Richard Morey computes the Bayes factor for a variety of common statistical models . Similarly to the frequentist analysis above , we specify the t-test as a general linear model and use the function <p> 10 <p> 11 <p> library ( 'BayesFactor ' ) <p> lmBF ( yx , dat ) <p> ## Bayes factor analysis <p> ## -------------- <p> ## 1 x : 1.8934 -0% <p> ## Against denominator : <p> ## Intercept only <p> ## --- <p> ## Bayes factor type : BFlinearModel , JZS <p> The resulting Bayes factor is $BF10 = 1.84$ , that is the model that assumes an effect of hat is 1.84 times more likely then the model that assumes no effect " given a so-called JZS prior specification . JZS stands for Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow . This prior is basically the same we have specified before . For a more detailed rationale , see Rouder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package also does ANOVA , multiple regression , proportions and more do have a look ! For a more detailed explanation of the Bayesian t-test , see this . For a tutorial on regression that uses the BayesFactor package , click here . <p> JASP is a slick alternative to SPSS that also provides Bayesian inference ( and it does APA tables ! ) . First , let us write the data to a . csv file : <p> 1 <p> LONG ... <p> Open JASP , read in the . csv file , and run a Bayesian independent t-test . Checking Prior and Posterior and Additional Info gives us a beautiful plot summarizing the result : <p> Above you can see the Savage-Dickey density ratio , i.e. the height of the posterior divided by the height of the prior , at the point of interest ( here $delta = 0$ ) . <p> Is this result consistent for different prior specifications ? Checking Bayes factor robustness check yields the following result : <p> We see that across different widths ( 0-1.5 ) of the Cauchy prior , the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a width of 200 , what would happen ? Lindley would turn around in his grave ! As mentioned above in the section on Lindleys paradox , uninformative priors should not be used for hypothesis testing because this leads the Bayes factor to strongly support $H0$ . You can see that in the graph below . <p> Setting aside unreasonable prior specifications , the Bayes factor is not very different from 1 . This means that our data are not sufficiently informative to choose between the hypotheses . While the Bayes factor is a continuous measure , it might be reasonable to label certain categories depending on the magnitude of the Bayes factor . Several labels have been proposed . For an overview , see this . To get some intuition how a Bayes factor " feels " , see here . <p> Because the data are not compelling enough , we run an additional 20 participants per group : <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> 6 <p> set.seed(1000) <p> x&lt;-rep ( 0:1 , each=20 ) <p> y1.2&lt;-rnorm ( 20 , mean=50 , sd=15 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dat.2&lt;-data.frame ( y=c ( y1.2 , y2.2 ) , x=x ) <p> dat.both&lt;-rbind ( dat , dat.2 ) <p> A quick look tells us that the Bayes factor in favour of the alternative hypothesis is now roughly 25 : <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> 6 <p> 7 <p> 8 <p> 9 <p> lmBF ( yx , dat.both ) <p> ## Bayes factor analysis <p> ## -------------- <p> ## 1 x : 24.94 -0% <p> ## Against denominator : <p> ## Intercept only <p> ## --- <p> ## Bayes factor type : BFlinearModel , JZS <p> We can see how the Bayes factor develops over the data collection using JASP . First , let 's write the data to disk again : <p> 1 <p> LONG ... <p> Running the same analysis in JASP in order to get those stunning graphs yields : <p> Checking Sequential Analysis yields : <p> This plot shows how the Bayes factor develops over the course of participant collection . <p> JASP includes several interesting datasets . I encourage you to play with them ! Peter Edelsbrunner and I recently gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can find the materials here . <h> Advantages of Bayesian inference <h> The right kind of probability <p> I do n't  think that researchers are really interested in the probability of the data ( or more extreme data ) , given that the null hypothesis is true and the data was collected according to a specific ( unknown ) sampling plan . Rather , I believe that scientists care about which hypothesis is more likely to be true after the experiment has been conducted . In the same vein , we do n't  care about how often , in an infinite repetition of the experiment , the parameter estimate lies in a specific interval . We prefer a statement of confidence . How confident can I be that the parameter estimate lies in this specific interval ? <h> " Subjectivity " <p> " Today one wonders how it is possible that orthodox logic continues to be taught in some places year after year and praised as objective , while Bayesians are charged with subjectivity . Orthodoxians , preoccupied with fantasies about nonexistent data sets and , in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are in no position to charge anybody with subjectivity . " Jaynes ( 2003 , p. 550 ) , as cited in Lee &amp; Wagenmakers ( 2014 , p. 61 ) <p> Bayesian inference conditions only on the observed data , that is it does not violate the likelihood principle , and so is independent of the researchers intentions . This might sound surprising , but p values are inherently subjective " in a really nasty way . For theoretical arguments about that , see Berger &amp; Berry ( 1988 ) and Wagenmakers ( 2007 ) . Scientific objectivity is illusionary , and both frequentist and Bayesian methods have their subjective elements . Crucially , though , Bayesian subjectivity is open to inspection by everyone ( just look at the prior ! ) , whereas frequentist subjectivity is not . <h> Optional Stopping <p> " The rules governing when data collection stops are irrelevant to data interpretation . It is entirely appropriate to collect data until a point has been proven or disproven , or until the data collector runs out of time , money , or patience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 239 ) <p> Bayesians do not have an optional stopping problem ( Edwards et al. , 1963 ; Rouder , 2014 ) . Recall that in classical statistics , you can not collect additional data once you have run your test , because this inflates the nominal $alpha$ level ; that is it will rain false positives ( Simmons , Nelson , &amp; Simonsohn , 2011 ) . For example , let 's say you test 20 participants and get $p = .06$ . You can not test another batch of , say 5 , and run your test again . In a sense , you are in limbo . You can neither conclude that $H1$ is supported , nor that $H0$ is supported , nor that the data are uninformative . On other occasions you might want to stop early because the data show a clear picture , and running more subjects might be expensive or unethical . However , within the framework of classical statistics , you are not permitted to do so . Using Bayesian inference , we can monitor the evidence as it comes in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection once the data are informative enough " say the Bayes factor in favour of $H0$ or $H1$ is greater than 10 . For a recent paper on sequential hypothesis testing , see Sch+nbrodt ( submitted ) . <h> Continuous Measure of Evidence <p> The Bayes factor is a continuous measure of evidence and is directly interpretable . While inference in current statistical practices relies on an arbitrary cutoff of $alpha = .05$ and results in a counterfactual ( probability of at least as extreme data , given $H0$ ) , Bayes factors straightforwardly tell you which hypothesis is more likely given the data at hand . <h> Supporting the null <p> Bayes factors explicitly look at how likely the data are under $H0$ and $H1$ . Recall that the p value looks at the probability of the data ( or more extreme data ) , given that $H0$ is true . The logic behind inference , called Fishers disjunction , is as follows : either a rare event has occured ( with probability $p$ ) , or $H0$ is false . In the form of a syllogism , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y is very unlikely . <p> ( Premise ) y . <p> ( Conclusion ) $H0$ is very unlikely . <p> This reasoning is flawed , as demonstrated by the following : <p> ( Premise ) If an individual is a man , he is unlikely to be the Pope . <p> ( Premise ) Francis is the Pope . <p> ( Conclusion ) Francis is probably not a man . <p> Nonsense ! The problem is that in classical inference , we do not look at the probability of the data under $H1$ . The data at hand , Francis being the Pope , are infinitely more likely under the hypothesis that Francis is a man ( $H0$ ) than they are under the hypothesis that Francis is not a man ( $H1$ ) . <p> P values , because they only look at the probability of the data under $H0$ , are violently biased against $H0$ ( we have already seen this in our creativity example ) . For a more detailed treatment , see Wagenmakers et al . ( in press ) . A study looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found in Wetzels et al . ( 2011 ) . A tragic , real-life case of how a p value caused grave harm is the case of Sally Clark ; the story is also told in Rouder et al . ( submitted ) . <p> Bayesian inference conditions on both $H0$ and $H1$ , thus it also allows us the quantify support for the null hypothesis . In science , invariances can be of great interest ( Rouder et al. , 2009 ) . Being able to support the null hypothesis is also important in replication research ( e.g. Verhagen &amp; Wagenmakers , 2014 ) . <h> Conclusion <p> I hope to have convinced you that Bayesian statistics is a sound , elegant , practical , and useful method of drawing inferences from data . Bayes factors continuously quantify statistical evidence either for $H0$ or $H1$ and provide you with a measure of how informative your data are . If data are not informative ( $BF sim 1$ ) , simply collect more data . Credibility intervals retain the intuitive , common-sense notion of probability and tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I that the parameter estimate lies within a specific interval ? <p> JAGS , BayesFactor , and especially JASP provide easy-to-use software so that you can actually get stuff done . In light of what I have told you so far , I want to end with a rather provocative quote by Dennis Lindley , a famous Bayesian : <p> " the only good statistics is Bayesian statistics . Bayesian statistics is not just another technique to be added to our repertoire alongside , for example , multivariate analysis ; it is the only method that can produce sound inferences and decisions in multivariate , or any other branch of , statistics . It is not just another chapter to add to that elementary text you are writing ; it is that text . It follows that the unique direction for mathematical statistics must be along the Bayesian roads . " Lindley ( 1975 , p. 106 ) <h> Suggested Readings <p> For easy introduction , I suggest playing with this and reading this , this , this , and this . Peter Edelsbrunner and I recently did a workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( slides , code , exercises , reading list ) on github . For a thorough treatment , I suggest Jackman ( 2009 ) and Gill ( 2015 ) . For an introduction more geared toward psychologists , but without a detailed account of Bayes factors , see Kruschke ( 2015 ) . For an excellent practical introduction to Bayesian cognitive modeling , see Lee &amp; Wagenmakers ( 2013 ) . <h> Important Note <p> Bayesian and frequentist statistics have a long history of bitter rivalry ( see for example McGrayne , 2011 ) . Because the core issues " e.g. what is probability ? " are philosophical rather than empirical , most of the debates were heated and emotional . There was a time when Bayes was more theology than tool . Although Bayesian statistics " in contrast to our current statistical approach " is a coherent , principled , and intuitive way of drawing inferences from data , there are still open issues . A Bayesian is not a Bayesian ( Berger , 2006 ; Gelman &amp; Shalizi , 2013 ; Morey , Romeijn , &amp; Rouder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be foolish to think that Bayesian statistics could single-handedly turn around psychology . The current " crisis in psychology " ( Pashler &amp; Wagenmakers , 2012 ) wont be solved by reporting $BF10 &gt; 3$ instead of $p &lt; .05$ . Bayes can not be the antidote to questionable research practices , " publish or perish " incentives , or mindless statistics ( e.g. Gigerenzer , 2004 ) . However , because Bayes factors are not biased against $H0$ , allow us to state evidence for the absence of an effect , and condition only on the observed data , Bayesian statistics increases both the flexibility in data collection and the robustness of our inferences . With the above tools in the trunk , there is no reason not to use Bayesian statistics . <h> References <p> Mr. Bayes , &amp; Price , M. ( 1763 ) .

@@76805446 @5505446/ <h> Menu <h> My Experience in Publishing in an APA Journal <p> Publishing in an APA journal might seem like an unattainable goal for someone who is still an undergraduate or master student . However , if you have good research , and supervisors who support you , there is a great chance you will achieve your goal. - I was lucky enough to perform my final year dissertation with two fantastic supervisors , and it was this research that later went on to become the journal article being published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology : Human Perception &amp; Performance . However , it was a very long road to travel down which I will re " travel with you in the following paragraphs of this post sharing the experiences I had . <p> - How it all began " the project <p> The project began in October 2010 where the idea for the project was born followed by a phase of initial testing in January 2011 . After having handed in my dissertation in July of 2011 , I went travelling . Before leaving to go travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work we had performed would be submitted to a high impact journal . The two experiments that I had performed for my dissertation project had to be rewritten by my supervisor who became the lead author of it and afterwards submitted to the journal . Returning in January 2012 , I received correspondence from my supervisors saying that the work had been reviewed and that revisions were required before it could be accepted . <p> The important question " which journal to choose ? <p> The main thing that I learnt through this process is that writing a paper for a journal is a very long process . Throughout my undergraduate degree I found it agonising to wait for essay marks which generally required the patience to wait for only six weeks . But this is nothing when compared to the patience required to submit to a journal . When your paper is submitted to a journal , it is first assessed by an editor who must decide whether it will fit in with the tone of the journal in question . This is a key point , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is incredibly important to look at articles already published in that journal . If your work is much longer , or if you struggle to find an article in the same area of content , then you are unlikely to be published in this journal , since you are not the main group of interest for this journal . <p> The review process : There might be criticism <p> If the editor agrees that your work would fit in the journal , your paper will be reviewed by experienced reviewers usually experts in the field . If you are asked to revise your article , try not to take the reviewers ' comments personally . As they ( probably ) do not know you , they are just giving their honest ( you hope ) opinions regarding your research . It can be very difficult to take criticism at the best of times , but when you have worked for so long on something , it is very easy to ignore everything negative said about your paper. - Even if it may seem to you that the reviewer clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , they do . Do your very best to look at the paper from the reviewers ' point of view , and if you think it will improve your work change what they have asked you to change . <p> Furthermore , as it is very likely that you will have referenced at least one of the reviewers in your work , be very cautious . The nature of scientific research is that theories are made and are supported by some evidence and contested by others . If you are contesting a reviewer 's theory it is not a good idea to talk about how poorly the author has performed their research . Remain very respectful and discuss the research rather than the author . <p> One of my professors offered a pearl of wisdom to me . They told me , that while being asked to rewrite a section of an article or change a part of an experiment is very annoying ( and you nearly always disagree with the reviewers points ) , once you have rewritten the paper you will almost never prefer the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrade your paper so treat the review as advice and take the chance to make your piece of research stronger . <p> During the review process of mine and my professor 's paper one of the reviewers held an alternative view to the one that my research reported and so disputes were inevitable about the interpretation of the results and the conclusions we had drawn . While it is important to take on board what is being said by the reviewers , the work is your own and so you should make the final decision about it . Although you can disagree with the reviewers , do not make them angry . Reviewers do have the right to deny reviewing your work , in which case another reviewer will be sourced . However , this only slows down the entire process . But if the editor asks you to change something , make sure you do , no questions asked . The best you can do is hope that the change you need to make is a small one . This of course is not always the case . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , were not small . In fact , we were asked to submit a long article instead of a short one which required us to run two additional experiments . So there I was , coming back from my travels delving straight back in to running more experiments . Luckily , we had discussed and thought about additional experiments before receiving such feedback which sped up the process a little so we could collect additional data right away . Once the new data had been analysed and the paper rewritten , it was ready to be submitted again , after satisfying the reviewers by correcting all of the key points and concerns raised before . The experiments were finished and the writing up complete by October of 2012 . The journal article was accepted in December of 2012 and is now available online and will very soon be in print . As you can see , it can take several months for you to hear anything back about your work . The best advice I can give you is to forget about your paper after having it submitted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not get the impression that you have waited for a long time . <p> The decision " what if it is rejected ? <p> When you do hear back from the journal you will either be told that the article has been accepted and then you can celebrate . Otherwise the reviewers/editor have concerns and raise doubts that the article will not be accepted . The worst that can happen is a rejection of your paper. - Throughout the course of my PhD I have learned that journals have a high rate of rejection . While your work may not be a good fit for that particular journal , it may fit elsewhere but you can not reply to more than one journal at once . One very valuable piece of advice I have received ( this may seem obvious , but apparently it happens a lot ) is that you should make sure that the work you submit to a journal is formatted in the way the journal requires you to . There is absolutely nothing to be gained from annoying an editor by submitting an article that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like being rejected by your crush for prom and then turning straight to their friend and asking them instead . <p> Who are the authors ? <p> Finally , a really tricky aspect of writing a research paper is the decision about who gets to be an author and the order in which the names should appear on paper . You might say this is obvious and it should just be based on contribution and you would be right . But what is contribution ? I am not going to go into this here . But here is a pretty good article discussing it . It is indeed a difficult decision , but remember that just collecting data for an experiment is not enough to be considered an author . This can be a real problem when students who have completed projects as part of their dissertation are not considered authors of the final paper which is submitted to the journal . <p> Conclusion <p> Publishing your thesis in a top journal requires many steps and aspects , writing up the paper ( usually by or with the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right journal , extending and doing additional work , dealing with reviewers all of which can take up quite a bit of time. - If you endure through this process , it is a great feeling to have made a contribution to science and the knowledge of the world !

Hierarchical regression analyses showed that both job resources and optimism exerted a positive effect on work engagement and its three dimensions of vigor , dedication , and absorption . The moderation results showed that optimism can diminish the negative impact of low job resources on work engagement . These findings provide evidence to the importance of including personal resources in future research conducted on motivational process . Additionally , these findings provide significant suggestions for the utilization of these resources in organizational practice too , i.e. , in staff recruitment , retention and development . <p> The role of personality has been recognized widely in work psychology and particularly in stress-related well-being research ( Kahn &amp; Byosiere , 1992 ; M+kikangas , Feldt , Kinnunen , &amp; Mauno , 2013 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources in predicting well-being has become crucial . Interest in personality characteristics influencing the perception of and reaction to the same environmental features has increased . A recent review of personality differences in occupational well-being ( M+kikangas et al. , 2013 ) , however , demonstrates that we still lack full understanding of the role of personality in employee well-being . The emergence of positive psychology ( Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi , 2000 ) has given rise to novel challenges and posed the question of what kind of personality nourishes employees ' occupational well-being , including work engagement . <p> In response to this question , the objective of the present study is to investigate the role of optimism in the relationship between job resources ( organizational climate and job control ) and work engagement for a sample of Finnish young managers ( N = 747 ) . Work engagement , as one of the central concepts of occupational well-being in the field of positive occupational psychology , is defined as a positive , fulfilling , work-related state of mind characterized by vigor , dedication , and absorption ( Schaufeli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Engaged employees are enthusiastic , dedicated , and fully involved in their work ( Bakker , Schaufeli , Leiter , &amp; Taris , 2008 ) . <p> Job resources on their own have been found to be robust predictors of positive occupational well-being ( Bakker &amp; Demerouti , 2007 ; Mauno , Feldt , M+kikangas , &amp; Kinnunen , 2010 ) . The inclusion of one of the flagships of positive psychology " optimism " however , brings additional complexity as it is expected , in addition to exerting direct influence , to moderate the effect of the mentioned job resources on the experience of work engagement . Therefore , we aim to investigate whether optimism , as a personal resource , offsets the negative effect of low job resources on work engagement , and in addition , whether optimism facilitates the mobilization of job resources and as a result leads to higher levels of work engagement . <p> By examining the associations between the selected variables it is possible to she 'd light on the mechanisms underlying the generation of positive experiences at work . Furthermore , it helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to affect individuals and enhance their well-being . Managers are our target group as their work affects whole teams and even organizations . The more vigorous , dedicated and absorbed managers are in their daily work , the better they are able to execute their tasks and transmit the positive experiences to their subordinates ( e.g. , Schaufeli &amp; Salanova , 2008 ) . <h> Job Demands-Resources Model ( JD-R Model ) : Motivational Process <p> In the current study the association between job resources , optimism and work engagement are approached from the viewpoint of the Job Demands-Resources model ( Demerouti , Bakker , Nachreiner , &amp; Schaufeli , 2001 ) . According to the model , job resources refer to those physical , psychological , social , or organizational aspects of the job that are ( a ) functional in achieving work goals , ( b ) reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological costs , and ( c ) stimulate personal growth , learning and development . In contrast , job demands are those physical , psychological , social and organizational features which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The JD-R model proposes that job demands and resources evoke two different psychological processes that lead to the development of job strain and motivation ( Bakker &amp; Demerouti , 2007 ) . The first is health impairment caused by excessive job demands when job resources are scarce , and the second motivational process . Herewith , we focus on the latter one as it bears more relevance to the novel questions posed in the context of positive psychology ( Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi , 2000 ) . The motivational process implies that job resources possess a motivational potential leading to high work engagement , low cynicism and excellent performance . It is assumed that job resources play an intrinsic motivational role as they foster employees ' growth , learning and development , or an extrinsic one by serving as a means to achieve work goals . <p> The job resources in the focus of the present study are job control and organizational climate . Job control is particularly important in a manager 's work as it determines the extent to which he/she can autonomously decide the timing and method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed been the core dimensions measured in studies of job control ( see Mauno et al. , 2007 ) . Timing control describes the extent to which an employee can choose the order of task completion and the pace of work . Method control refers to the amount of influence an employee can exert on the way a job gets done , on his/her ability to vary his/her work and on the breadth of choice over the methods used to complete the job ( Mauno et al. , 2007 ) . Organizational climate , on the other hand , refers to the milieu in which managerial work is done as well as on the support received from colleagues , and it may have a notable effect on the occupational well-being of young managers at the beginning of their careers . Among the characteristics of a good organizational climate are the relationships and trust between co-workers , good co-operation and work morale , work community 's ability to deal with conflict in a constructive manner ( Bakker , Hakanen , Demerouti , &amp; Xanthopoulou , 2007 ) as well as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2005 ) . Based on this theoretical model , we formulate our first hypothesis : <p> We focus here on the moderating role of optimism in the relationship between job resources and work engagement . Optimism is defined as a generalized expectation of positive experiences and outcomes throughout one 's life ( Scheier , Carver , &amp; Bridges , 2001 ) . Optimists are more likely to view stressful work situations as challenging rather than threatening . They exhibit both a situational and a dispositional tendency to rely on active , problem-focused coping , and are reportedly more planful in stressful events ( Carver , Scheier , &amp; Weintraub , 1989 ) . As a characteristic of personality , optimism is assumed to protect the individual from the negative impact of stress factors ( Feldt , M+kikangas , &amp; Aunola , 2006 ; M+kikangas et al. , 2013 ) . Optimism could be argued to be a basic requirement in managerial work , as managers are expected to look trustfully to the future , anticipate positive results , and be innovative . Optimistic managers are more likely to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in work . Thus , optimism is expected to influence directly managers ' experience of work engagement . Recent studies have accumulated evidence of the association of optimism with work engagement as well as its interaction with job resources . Optimism was found to be strongly associated with work engagement among cancer survivors ( Hakanen &amp; Lindbohm , 2008 ) . The effects of optimism have usually been studied in combination with other personal resources such as self-esteem , self-efficacy ( see M+kikangas , Kinnunen , &amp; Feldt , 2004 ; Xanthopoulou et al. , 2007 , Xanthopoulou et al. , 2009 ) as well as meaning in life ( see van den Heuvel , Demerouti , Schreurs , Bakker , &amp; Schaufeli , 2009 ) . In this study , we wanted to concentrate solely on the relationship between optimism and work engagement and validate it in a sample of young managers . As there is some previous evidence about the positive relation between these two variables , we therefore hypothesize : <p> Hypothesis 2 : Optimism is associated with high work engagement . <h> Optimism as a Moderator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship between unfavorable work characteristics and negative outcomes . It has been established that optimism exerts a moderating effect on the relationship between daily hassles and health outcomes ( Fry , 1995 ) , hassles and physiological symptoms ( Lai , 1996 ) , perceived stress and depression ( Sumi , Horie , &amp; Hayakawa , 1997 ) , and psychosocial stressors and psychological well-being ( M+kikangas &amp; Kinnunen , 2003 ) . To our knowledge , there have not been studies investigating a moderating effect of a personal resource in the relationship between favorable work characteristics and positive outcomes . In the light of positive psychology we test a new moderator hypothesis , i.e. , whether optimism moderates the relationship between job resources and work engagement . On the one hand , optimism buffers the negative effect of low job resources on work engagement , and on the other , optimism facilitates the mobilization of job resources thus enhancing the experience of work engagement . This hypothesis fits well within the Conservation of Resources ( COR ) theory ( Hobfoll , 1989 ) , according to which different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more positive outcomes . The possibility of moderating effects of personal resources in the relationship between job resources and work engagement has indeed been recognized earlier ( e.g. , Xanthopoulou et al. , 2007 ) , but not tested empirically . In light of the above theoretical settings , we formulate our third and final hypothesis : <p> Hypothesis 3 : Optimism moderates the relationship between job resources and work engagement , i.e. , high optimism buffers the negative effect of low job resources on work engagement ( 3a ) , and increases the positive effect of high job resources on work engagement ( 3b ) . <h> Method <h> Participants <p> The present study utilized questionnaire data collected from Finnish young managers ( N = 747 ) in 2006 . The sample consisted of all members of two Finnish national labor unions ( the Union of Salaried Employees and the Union of Professional Engineers ) whose professional title referred to management position and who were 35 years or younger . The selection criteria were met by 1904 union members . In Finland , a large majority of employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of industry ( Ahtiainen , 2011 ) and , therefore , this sample is relatively representative of the target group . <p> Questionnaires were returned by 933 union members , of which 186 respondents were currently not in managerial position or in employment and were thus omitted from the sample . The total number of respondents was 747 , which yielded a response rate of 43.4% ( 747/1718 ) . The average age of the participants in 2006 was 31 years ( range 24 " 35 , SD = 3.2 ) . A large percent of the participants were men ( 85.5% ) . The majority of participants were engineers ( 67.4% ) and the others were technicians ( 6.1% ) or had other professional qualification ( 24.5% ) . A small percent ( 1.9% ) had no professional qualifications . Of the participants 8.5% were in upper management , 48% in middle management , and 43.5% in lower management ( Hyv+nen , Feldt , Salmela-Aro , Kinnunen , &amp; M+kikangas , 2009 ) . <h> Materials and Procedure <p> All the composite variables were created by averaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high score represents a higher level of the construct . <p> Job control was measured with four items indicating the degree of perceived control over timing and method at work ( Feldt et al. , 2004 ; M+kikangas et al. , 2007 ) : e.g. , I have control of my work pace and I have control of how I do my work . The subjects responded on a five-point scale ( 1 = not at all , 5 = very much ) . Cronbach 's + for the scale was .79 . <p> Optimism was measured using the abbreviated version of The Revised Life Orientation Test developed by Scheier , Carver , and Bridges ( 1994 ) . It consisted of six items ( e.g. , In uncertain times , I usually expect the best ; I 'm always optimistic about my future ) using a 5-point response scale ranging from 1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree . The negatively worded items were recoded so that a higher value corresponded to higher optimism . Cronbach 's + for the scale was .76 . <p> Work engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engagement Scale ( Schaufeli , Bakker , &amp; Salanova , 2006 ) consisting of nine items as the construct validity of the short version ( vs. the 17-item scale ) has proven to be better with this sample of Finnish young managers ( Sepp+l+ et al. , 2009 ) . The items reflect the three underlying dimensions of work engagement and were each measured with three items : vigor ( e.g. , At my work , I feel bursting with energy ) , dedication ( e.g. , My job inspires me ) , and absorption ( e.g. , I get carried away when I am working ) . All items of the scale were scored on a seven-point frequency-based scale , ranging from 1 = never to 7 = always . Cronbach 's + for the whole scale was .93 . <p> Managerial level was used as a demographic variable in the analysis . The variable was recoded so that the six initial levels were grouped into three : 1 = top management and upper managerial level ; 2 = upper middle and lower middle management ; and 3 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken as the background variable . <h> Results <p> Data was analyzed using SPSS 18 . Table 1 presents mean scores , standard deviations , and correlations between the study variables . Organizational climate correlated with work engagement and its dimensions weakly to moderately ( between r = .20 and r = .34 , ) . The strongest correlation was observed with dedication ( r = .34 ) , and the weakest with absorption ( r = .20 ) . The correlations between job control and work engagement as well as its dimensions were slightly weaker . Pearson correlation coefficients were in the range between r = .17 ( with absorption ) and r = .28 ( with dedication ) . Optimism correlated with work engagement and its dimensions weakly to moderately ( between r = .09 and r = .28 ) , the weakest correlation being observed with absorption ( r = .09 ) and the strongest with dedication ( r = .28 ) . <h> Testing of Hypotheses <p> Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted in order to investigate the main effects of the antecedents on work engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderating effect of optimism ( Hypothesis 3 ) . More specifically , the analyses were conducted in the following steps : managerial level ( step 1 ) and job resources ( step 2 ) were followed by optimism ( step 3 ) and the interaction terms Organizational Climate x Optimism and Job Control x Optimism ( step 4 ) . Before calculating the interaction terms , the job resource variables and optimism were standardized ( Aiken &amp; West , 1991 ) . Standardized beta values were used to establish the explanation rate of each variable separately , and the magnitude of R2 change at each step " to determine the variance explained by the variable(s) in the step . To establish a moderating effect , the standardized beta values of the interaction terms ( Organizational Climate x Optimism and Job Control x Optimism ) were studied together with the R2 change of the final step . To confirm support for Hypothesis 3 , we needed to show that the beta values of the interaction terms were statistically significant . <h> Regression analyses : Main Effects <p> Standardized beta values from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table 2 . Managerial level effect exerted a statistically significant effect only on absorption . Job resources were associated positively with work engagement , and thus the Hypothesis 1 was supported . More specifically , job control exerted a positive effect on the total score of work engagement as well as its sub-dimensions . The + coefficients varied between 0.09 and 0.17 . In addition , organizational climate had a positive effect on work engagement and its dimensions ( + coefficients varied between 0.14 and 0.25 ) . In addition , the Hypothesis 2 was also supported as optimism associated positively with work engagement . Optimism showed a positive effect on work engagement , vigor and dedication ( + coefficients between .16 and .20 , p &lt; .001 ) , with the exception of absorption , where the effect was not statistically significant . Overall , the whole model including managerial level , job resources and optimism explained 6 " 20% of the variance of work engagement and its sub-dimensions . <h> Optimism as a moderator <p> Optimism moderated the relationship between job control and a dedication dimension of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p = .009 ) , thus lending partial support to Hypothesis 3a . The graphical representation of the significant interaction presented in Figure 1 . We plotted significant interactions following the recommendation made by Aiken and West ( 1991 ) : we computed separate regression lines for employees with high optimism ( 1 SD above the mean ) and low optimism ( 1 SD below the mean ) . The moderator result implies that high optimism buffers the negative effect of low control on dedication . Thus , in situations when employees can not exert sufficient control over timing and method , the presence of optimism mitigates that effect thus preserving the levels of dedication . However , in an environment where job control is high , the level of optimism does not exert a notable effect , thus disconfirming hypothesis 3b . <h> Discussion <p> This study investigated the association between job resources and optimism and work engagement among large sample of Finnish managers ( N = 747 ) . In particular , it focused on the main effects of two job resources " organizational climate and job control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work engagement . In addition , the moderating effect of optimism in the relationship between job resources and work engagement was examined . <h> Main and Moderator Effects <p> A significant main finding of the current study is the establishment of moderation between job control and dedication , which lent partial support to Hypothesis 3a , namely , high optimism buffers the negative effect of low job resources on work engagement . According to the results , optimism was able to ward off the negative effect of low job control on dedication demonstrating that optimism can have a protective function under circumstances of low control . This finding is noteworthy and in line with research pointing to the fact that optimism leads to more effective coping strategies and better well-being ( Feldt et al. , 2006 ; Lai , 1995 ; M+kikangas et al. , 2003 ; Riolli &amp; Savicki , 2003 ; Sumi , 1997 ; Sumi et al. , 1997 ) . In an organizational context , this is particularly relevant for middle and lower management , where the extent of control over time and method is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends positive messages to the work community and in particular to a manager 's subordinates . <p> Instead , the Hypothesis 3b was not supported , namely , in the case where job control was high , optimistic employees did not report particularly higher levels of work engagement than those who were less optimistic . Optimism seems to primarily play a protective role against the negative effect of low job resources . It is possible that support for this hypothesis would have been found if we had investigated the relationship between optimism and so-called challenge stressors , which contain both stressful and challenging aspects ( Cavanaugh , Boswell , Roehling , &amp; Boudreau , 2000 ; LePine , Podsakoff , &amp; LePine , 2005 ) . <p> The first and second hypotheses , which predicted that job resources and optimism are directly associated with high work engagement , also received wide support , which is in line with existing studies ( see Bakker et al. , 2007 ; Xanthopoulou et al. , 2008 ) . All these three antecedents demonstrated a significant positive effect on the dependent variables . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not exert a statistically significant effect . However , taken together with the fact that absorption was the dimension least explained by the present set of antecedents , these findings may be indicative of the different nature of absorption in comparison to the other two dimensions ( see also Demerouti et al. , 2010 ) . <p> Altogether , the above finding provides evidence that both job and personal resources are important for the experience of work engagement in consistence with the JD-R model and research findings ( Demerouti et al. , 2001 ; for a review of studies , see Salanova , Schaufeli , Xanthopoulou , &amp; Bakker , 2010 ; for a meta-analysis , see Halbesleben , 2010 ) . Optimism demonstrated the highest main effect on vigor . This may indicate a slight discrepancy with the model proposed by Shirom ( 2010 ) , which assumes that vigor is predicted primarily by work-based resources . On the other hand , it does not rule out the possibility that personality characteristics may influence the level of vigor , but suggests that these effects are mediated by work-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research <p> There are some limitations which should be acknowledged when evaluating the results of the study and their generalizability . First , the present sample consisted of young , predominantly male , managers at the beginning of their careers , having a technical or engineering background . Thus , results obtained herewith are valid primarily for this sample which is rather homogenous in terms of gender and age . Second , by including two job resources , the study design utilized only the motivational path of the JD-R model departing from the assumption that job resources are more predictive of work engagement than job demands ( Bakker et al. , 2007 ; Mauno et al. , 2007 ; for a meta-analysis see Halbesleben , 2010 ) . However , job resources function in combination with job demands . Thus , both the independent effects of job demands as well as their interaction with job resources remained unexplored in the present study . <p> The generalizability of findings can be improved in several aspects in future research . First , more diverse samples , including representatives of different educational backgrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work experience should be considered so that the effects of demographic variables can be taken into account . The effect of gender also merits further attention when studying the antecedents of work engagement as gender has been found to be related to personality characteristics , and consequently influences the level of psychological well-being ( see M+kikangas et al. , 2003 ; Mauno et al. , 2007 ) . Second , job resources should be parallel with job demands as studies point out that work engagement can be experienced even when job demands are high ( Bakker et al. , 2007 ; Mauno et al. , 2007 ) . Exploring the underlying mechanisms and circumstances under which demands lead to increased engagement is a worthwhile research objective . Third , the inclusion of other personality constructs ( self-esteem , self-efficacy , sense of coherence , locus of control ) may bring to light additional main and interaction effects on work engagement . <p> Finally , the moderation effect should be considered with caution . Although the interaction between job control and optimism was statistically significant , the effect was relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , it should be taken into account that moderator effects are quite rare and difficult to detect , and even 1% contribution to the total variance merits attention ( McClelland &amp; Judd , 1993 ; M+kikangas &amp; Kinnunen , 2003 ; Parkes , 1994 ) . <p> In all , despite the shortcomings listed above , the current study contributed to previous research in several ways . The inclusion of a personal resource among the set of work engagement antecedents enabled the examination of its moderator effects , which has potential practical implications , for example , in the recruitment , retention and personal development of personnel . This study also complemented the rather scarce research on young managers ' well-being , and the findings can be utilized in designing interventions and training programs aimed to enhance this target group 's occupational well-being . In future , research should focus on different interactions between job demands , job resources and personal resources that may affect the experience of work engagement . <h> Practical Implications and Conclusions <p> On the basis of the results obtained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job resources and optimism are essential in the generation of positive occupational well-being . Furthermore , high optimism can mitigate the adverse effect of low job control on the experience of work engagement or a dimension thereof . Although it is difficult to draw extensive conclusions about the additional value of non-work characteristics in the JD-R model , the study provided evidence of the importance of personal resources to the motivational process , and demonstrated that their incorporation increased the overall predictive power of the model . The consideration of personality characteristics is worthwhile as individuals perceive and react to the environment in different ways , which may lead to different experiences of psychological well-being . <p> The practical implications of this finding may benefit organizations : by encouraging optimism and reinforcing it as a personal resource , organizations are able to counterbalance the periods when job control can not be exerted in full measure . Enhancing employees ' optimism may , for example , be achieved through specific training techniques such as goal clarification and personal development plans ( Luthans , Avey , Avolio , Norman , &amp; Combs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the face of low job resources . The fact that optimism may be influenced by training provides evidence that it can be construed as a state , which is malleable and open to development ( Luthans , Avey , Avolio , &amp; Peterson , 2010 ) , and not just a fixed dispositional trait as suggested in the early work of Scheier and Carver ( 1985 ) . From a human resource management perspective , hiring and retaining optimistic employees may turn into a valuable reserve in times of crises , when autonomy is restricted by external factors ( e.g. , economic crisis , periods of restructuring , mergers and acquisitions ) . The findings of this study highlight the need for organizations to understand the mechanisms underlying employees ' positive experiences and protecting them from the negative effects of adversities , because this understanding leads to consistent well-being in the workforce and improved organizational outcomes . <h> Appendix A <p> Table 1 <p> Means and standard deviations , and Pearson correlations between the study variables . <p> Riolli , L. and Savicki , V.

Think . Think . <p> HOLD on a second . <p> What did the PhD student who hit on my friend 's girlfriend 's friend the other day say he was doing for his thesis research again ? A meta-analysis ! <p> At once , I transform the ideas into the form of a mobile phone text message , and immediately send it to my friend 's way . Now , all I have to do is pray that his crush on my friend 's girlfriend 's friend is deep enough for him to want to write an article for JEPS Bulletin . <p> Back to the draft article , although it is very engaging , I still feel that the write-up can be improved by presenting more concrete arguments , backed up by reliable references . - Thus , I decide to write back to the author with the reviewed draft article as feedback , for him to make the necessary changes . While writing the email reply , I receive an incoming email from the Scientific Affairs Team , asking if anyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new JEPS manuscript . Well , why not ? I can do it during my lunch breaks . I reply yes , finish up the reviewed draft article email reply , and send another email to my teammates to share my list of new article topics for JEPS Bulletin . <p> Done for the day , as a JEPS Bulletin Editor . Maybe I 'll tweet about some older JEPS Bulletin posts later , just to do a little promotion . <p> What is the big lesson ? <p> For a researcher , what would perhaps be the best thing that can happen to one is the moment when the researcher makes a ground-breaking discovery in his or her research . What we do next is to inform everyone about the discovery , by presenting at international conferences and publishing the findings on high-impact journals . As researchers , we fantasize about such moments and dream of the day when we will be widely recognized for our contribution in our field of expertise . As a JEPS Bulletin Editor , I have edited articles of various topics related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each time I review a draft article , I discover new information that can be shared with my readers . By discovering new topics and also writing my own articles for the Bulletin , I found a place to develop and express my creativity . Through the review and feedback process of the draft article , I exchange knowledge with the writer and we learn something new from each other . When I publish the article on JEPS Bulletin , I know I have just helped another person enhance his or her work portfolio . Most importantly , I have just shared what the writer and I have learned from each other , with the rest of the world . The significance of my work may be negligible , but the excitement and sense of satisfaction I get from my job is no less than making a new research discovery . <p> The bottomline is , there are actually countless ways we can use and things we can do to contribute to the scientific world , and it does n't  just have to be about making the headlines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written on the daily work schedule of a JEPS Bulletin Editor , as published on the April 2013 issue of the EFPSA Internal Newsletter .

@@76805464 @5505464/ <h> Menu <h> What happens to studies that accept the null hypothesis ? <p> Source : Scargle , 2000 <p> " The literature of social sciences contains horror stories of journal editors and others who consider a study worthwhile only if it reaches a statistically significant , positive conclusion ; that is , an equally significant rejection of a hypothesis is not considered worthwhile " ( Scargle , 2000 ) . <p> This is a footnote in Jeffrey D. Scargles , an astrophysicist working for NASA , article about the publication bias in scientific journals . Usually , the psychologist in me would go all defensive of our precious little social science , but then one discovers this : a couple of researchers trying to publish a paper debunking Bems research on ESP ( in layman terms , ESP means predicting the future ) . More- precisely , their woes while trying to publish a paper with nonsignificant results . How many papers have you read that have nonsignificant results , that accept the null- hypothesis ? I have a feeling you have the same answer as me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those papers ? And what 's the implication of such a bias in publishing for science at large ? <p> Before delving deeper into the subject , we should- explicitly- state what the publications bias ( or its extreme formulation , the file-drawer problem ) is , which was best explained in an- influential- work by Rosenthal ( 1979 , p. 638 ; as cited in Scargle , 2000 ) : <p> researchers and statisticians have long suspected that the studies published in the behavioral sciences are a biased sample of the studies that are actually carried out The extreme view of this problem , the " file-drawer problem " , is that the journals are filled with the 5% of the studies that show Type I errors , while the file drawers back at the lab are filled with the 95% of the studies that show nonsignificant ( e.g. , p &gt; .05 ) results . <p> This is basically a problem with the untruthfulness- of the publication process in science , especially in social sciences where almost all quantitative analysis is based on statistical ( non ) significance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the results are significantly different from the expected null- hypothesis . But what if were fishing for results , which is precisely the case if a bias for- publishing- only significant results exists ? To put it even more metaphorically : if we fish long enough , we will certainly score big game ; whatever our research subject might be . Be it personality traits or precognition , as in Bems case . <p> Ritchies experience in trying to publish a study offering a proof that no precognition exists when replicating Bems research was , as stated in Tom Bartletts ( 2011 ) - article , was rejected out of different reasons . No reviewer will hopefully openly state that a study is rejected specifically because it does not show a significant effect ( contrary to Scargles horror story from the introduction ) . Still , the question iswhat was the real reason of rejection ? Even in such a- controversial- study as Bems , where the scientific community would make a statement by publishing nonsignificant results from a replication study , this study was rejected . By publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pseudoscientific ESP research with sound empirically grounded data , and yet they still refuse to publish it ? <p> All this makes it sound like there 's an intricate- conspiracy- within the scientific community , plotting in the shadows and disallowing the publication of marginal or no effect studies . I think that the absurdity in that is self evident . <p> My take on it is that this is yet another incarnation of human cognition in an institution , taken into a sophisticated- extreme in the most elaborate human- epistemological endeavorscience . This artifact of human cognition has been called by psychologists the confirmation bias for decades . What is it precisely ? <p> confirmation bias connotes a less explicit , less consciously one-sided case building process . It refers usually to unwitting selectivity in the acquisition and use of evidence . The line between deliberate selectivity in the use of evidence and unwitting molding of facts to fit hypotheses or beliefs is a difficult one to draw in practice , but the distinction is meaningful conceptually , and confirmation has more to do with latter than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case-building unwittingly , without intending to treat evidence in a biased way or even being aware of doing so , is fundamental to the concept . ( Nickerson , 1998 ) <p> Science , as an organized- endeavor- of research , the ultimate epistemology of the modern world , just transformed this normal and typical artifact of human cognition into something compatible with the critical methodology its based on . The publication bias . Looking for and publishing only evidence that support your theories and- hypotheses is ethically questionable at best , or an example of scientific dishonesty and data fishing at worst . But what if the publication process , the mechanism that guards the gates of cited scientific literature has the bias built into it ? Then the scientists would remain true to their trade , and still fulfill their basic cognitive need . To publish results that support their theories and leave everything else in the shadow . <p> You do the research , you 're an honest researcher , but you only publish the research that supports your ideas . Not because you are dishonest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting edge , top notch and most importantly , - significant studies . When you take such a system and couple it with statistical significance as the ultimate demarcation criterion of publishable and unpublishable you get a science which has the confirmation bias systemically built into it . <p> On a practical level , you get a system of journals that will not publish Ritchies study , even if it proves something the true , proper scientists at large want proven that ESP is a pseudoscientific research problem that should not be even considered for publication in serious journals . <p> Ivan Flis is a PhD student in History and Philosophy of Science at the Descartes Centre , Utrecht University ; and has a degree in psychology from the University of Zagreb , Croatia .

@@76805499 @5505499/ <h> Menu <h> The implications of bite-size science <p> Doing research takes a long time . Writing a paper based on the data acquired through research takes a long time . The review process of that paper , when its finally written , takes a long time ( in some cases , 11 years ) . To shorten this- arduous- process the practice of shorter article formats in scientific journals is rising in prominence . This is what we call bite-size scienceshort reports usually covering one study . What are the benefits and what are the costs of moving to such brief formats ? <p> Nick Haslam ( 2010 ) has compared three psychology journals and their citations through a 6 year period . All three journals have well-established formats for longer and shorter articles . For example , Psychological Science has " research articles " ( less than 4,000 words ) , " research reports " ( less than 2,500 words ) and " short reports " ( less than 1,500 words ) . What Haslams study has concluded is that longer articles have a- slightly- higher possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , " short- articles- yield a similar or higher rate of such articles highly cited ones on a per-page basis " ( Haslam , 2010 , p. 263 ) . - This leads the author to conclude that short articles " appear to be somewhat more efficient in generating scientific influence than standard articles " ( Haslam , 2010 ) . <p> However , they remain more critical of bite-size science than Haslam . They draw attention to the problematic side of his analysisthe proposed edge of bite-size articles actually being an artifact of our citation measure . Bertamini and- Munaf+ ( 2012 ) explain it through this- hypothetical- example : <p> There are some technical problems with a citation impact- adjusted for length , and it should not be taken as a bona fide- superior measure of impact . If the same findings can be written in either a short or long format , and assuming that the two- articles would get cited equally , the impact per page would be- higher for the short article , but it would be misleading to say- that the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , suppose I conduct two studies providing- converging evidence for the same conclusion and I can publish- them in one long article or in two short articles . My colleagues- A. Friend and A. Foe always cite all my work because it is- relevant for what they do . They will cite either one long or two- short articles in all their publications . Based on their citations , - each of the three articles would have the same impact , but on- a per-page measure , the shorter articles are more influential. - This would be purely because of how we measure impact , not- because of a difference in influence ( p. 68 ) . <p> Another problem arises when we take into account that shorter articles usually include only one study and less data ( especially a smaller sample size ) . Coupled with the publication bias , this will lead to what- Bertamini and- Munaf+ ( 2012 ) gravely suggest as an " even greater contamination of the literature by false positive findings " ( p. 69 ) . <p> When all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interconnected problems in scientific publishing of psychology . Bite-size articles are seen as a viable option to ramp up more published papers ( catering to the- Impact Factor metric , despite its problems ) , which in turn only- aggravates- the publication bias and lessens the already questionable practice of publishing replication studies among psychologists .

@@76805519 @5505519/ <h> Menu <p> Twitter is stereotypically portrayed as a website for following celebrities and posting mundane tidbits . Recently , I realized that Twitter could be used as an academic tool " to share and receive ideas and information in an educational context . Indeed , students and early career researchers should be capitalizing on Twitter to learn new information , connect with others , and share interesting thoughts . <p> Learn <p> The first thing I did on Twitter was search for researchers in my areas of interest . Very quickly , I found the profiles of some academics whose work I enjoyed . This is one of the advantages of Twitter being able to curate ' your content so that your interests alone come through . Contrast this with a science news website , which usually represents the hottest ' topics in science at that moment . Oftentimes , it is better to have information on your interests , rather than the most popular stories . Another advantage for Twitter over news websites is that you can usually find links to original sources . This makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's paraphrasing . <p> Twitter is also useful for providing interesting information you would not otherwise be reading . The bite-sized nature of tweets means you can be engaged without committing . In fact , Twitter requires very little effort . You can spend five minutes a day flicking through your feed ' and learn about some of the latest developments or debates in your research area . This fast delivery of information is highly valuable in the busy life of an academic , and is largely unparalleled . <p> One of Twitter 's greatest advantages is that you get new content . Many tweets contain links to articles published in the last year , if not the last week . These can come from the Twitter accounts of journals , research groups , or the authors themselves . Twitter keeps you involved , on the cusp of new developments in your field . You can also track development of new ideas , from fledging what if ? ' thoughts from the people you follow . <p> Connect <p> Perhaps the most obvious definition of Twitter is a social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ micro-blogging service with social network features . Twitter makes it easy to network with colleagues , research groups , and organisations , even if they are halfway around the world . These advantages are not unique to Twitter ; for instance , Facebook allows connections with distant colleagues . However , Twitter prevails with its low requirement for commitment . Replying to a tweet feels easier and more informal than replying to an email . Also , an email can get lost in an inbox , whereas academics may be quicker to reply to a tweet of course , this depends on how many followers they have ! Lastly , Twitter is useful for casually reaching out ' for instance , I tweeted the JEPS account ( @efpsajeps ) proposing that I write this very article . <p> Not only can you connect with people you know , you can find new , interesting people in your areas of interest . I initially followed high-profile ' academics but , as I used Twitter more , I found some that other people were tweeting about interesting research too . These people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These people could conceivably become fellow conference attendees , so it may be useful to connect with them beforehand . <p> On that note , Twitter is a great tool for conferences . Prior to a conference , Twitter can be used to announce speakers , changes , calls for abstracts , and so on ( Reinhardt et al. , 2009 ) . However , Twitter 's greatest value is during the conference to encourage commentary , facilitate conversations , and much more ( Ross et al. , 2011 ) . Conferences often use a hashtag ' which allows attendees to follow just the content that is linked to that conference . For instance , tweets during last year 's Society for Neuroscience conference was tagged #SfN13 . Afterwards , Twitter can be used to maintain relationships with people these could be useful contacts or future colleagues ! In general , Twitter is a fantastic medium for networking . <p> Lastly , Twitter is like a mailing list , in that you can receive information about opportunities straight to your feed . For instance , I frequently find tweets about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through Twitter , I found out about a public engagement opportunity in my city ; days later , I attended a meeting with those people ! There are often job listings as well , which is great if you are hoping to work in the lab of someone you follow on Twitter you get the news without having to constantly search their website . Also , sources such as Nature Jobs ( @naturejobs ) can be found on Twitter . These updates are less invasive than email alerts you can scroll past a tweet without more than a cursory glance , rather than have several emails clogging up your inbox . <p> Share <p> Twitter is more than just consuming knowledge and information . To effectively use Twitter , you have to tweet to pass on knowledge as well . In a qualitative study of 45 academics , Veletsianos ( 2012 ) found that the dominant use of Twitter was for sharing information , media , and resources . As mentioned , Twitter is often seen as a micro-blogging ' platform . This means you can write fledgling thoughts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These preliminary ideas can take flight with input from your Twitter followers . Your followers may pick up on something in your tweet and engage in discussion , which might turn into a research question ! Alternatively , you can comment on an interesting paper you have just read perhaps even tweeting the authors . This direct contact is usually rare outside a conference context . Thus , early career researchers can benefit from getting their name out there ' . <p> In particular , it is important to increase your online profile . While LinkedIn is handy for detailed , CV-like information , Twitter shows you are actively involved and interested in your research topics . Creating a digital identity ' is useful for drawing attention to your work and accomplishments . For example , I have been applying to summer research scholarships , and have tweeted about my completion of various applications . Not only does this let me keep track of my academic timeline , people who view my profile will know what I am doing . In this way , the most direct benefit of Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a plethora of uses for Twitter in this regard . In psychology , Twitter can be useful for recruiting participants . More generally , Twitter can be used to promote a blog article , disseminate recent findings , and share data . Twitter facilitates the ethos of open science ' through publicizing drafts of manuscripts , and inviting comments on recent publications . While self-promoting a few times a day is acceptable , Twitter users should be wary of promoting too much , as this can easily get annoying for followers . Plus , it clutters up your Twitter feed for anyone browsing your profile . In any case , Twitter is highly valuable for getting your research out there ' and consumed by the masses . Who knows , your admired academics may even tweet you back with a comment . <p> Following people <p> In the academic world , there are several types of Twitter accounts : individuals , research groups , departments or institutes , universities , publishers , societies/organisations , conferences , and services . There are also funny accounts such as @AcademicsSay , @lolmythesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early career researchers , such as @ECPsych , @EarlyCareerBlog , and @ECRchat . Hashtags are another way of connecting with people and joining a conversation . Relevant ones include #phdchat , #phdadvice , #postdoclife and #ECRchat . <p> Advice <p> 1 . If you have a Twitter account already that is used for personal tweets , make a new one . The last thing you want is for colleagues to be inundated by irrelevant tweets about daily life . <p> 2 . Use your name if possible , or a username that is relevant to your interests . For instance , my full name was taken so I combined my interest in neuroscience with my surname to make synapticlee ' . <p> 3 . Clearly set goals for what kind of Twitter account you want .

@@76805521 @5505521/ <h> Menu <h> Life is a box of chocolates <p> Sitting in a classroom and being lectured , I often felt a sense that I should not question what I am being taught . This was not due to any fault of the lecturers who mostly were very welcoming of students ' opinions . However , simply knowing that this was an area that they had spent years researching and seeing them sharing at their computers screen , or head in a book every time you look through their office window gave the sense that they must have all the answers and have a justified reason for their opinions whereas mine always felt too subjective to be taken seriously . During my undergraduate degree , my essays became more and more focused on the areas which we had been taught in class and less inclusive of the breath of what were my own opinions . This was simply because having a controversial argument seemed to lead to more frustration in conceiving the lecturer 's than arguing what was the popular ' approach . <p> My undergraduate degree did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark I was expecting . This resulted in a loss of self-confidence and I was prepared to dismiss Psychology altogether afterwards . Due to this I was initially reluctant to apply for a position as a temporary psychology research assistant , as I believed that I would competing against those I was no rival over . My confidence was also dampened by my confusion that some marks felt overgenerous , while some felt very much the opposite . Despite this , the initial application only required five hundred words on why I wanted the position and I decided there was nothing lost in applying . I set about exploring the research proposal set out in the brief and used this to compare how it had a similar aspect to my undergraduate dissertation . <p> To my surprise , I got to the interview stage and was feeling more motivated and decided that there was no point in wasting this opportunity , although still convinced I would not be given the role . I set about researching the area to show my interest . This was very much more independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance on what other researchers had already found as I only had the brief outlined in the advert to go on . However , I found this a lot more interesting as I did not feel restricted as to what argument to support . <p> The interview seemed to go well and I explained that the research area was on a similar topic to my undergraduate dissertation project , what I had found previous research had already researched and their findings and my ideas on future methodology . When I left I was surprised that it had lasted forty minutes and did n't know whether to take this as a good sign or that I 'd rambled on for too long . To my disbelief , I was soon emailed that I 'd received the post . Although I was overjoyed and excited about this , I also felt dread at the prospect of working with a senior lecturer , as I was worried he would regret his offer . <p> I found the initial research progress to be very different to a student assignment as I had no recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ideas but was told to just review the relevant research area , presumably because at this stage the methodology was still flexible and my- did n't want my research review to be restricted to what he had already found . With no real guidance , as when a student where you can begin research by basing it around what you have been taught , I did another general literature review to establish in further detail what had already been found and what gaps had been missing . <p> Upon finishing my undergraduate degree I had many mixed feelings and a large part of me wanted to go through it all again . I felt a lack of confidence that I had n't achieved enough and I wanted to prove that I could do better . The research assistant role gave me a lot of my confidence back as I worked well with my supervisor and I felt I was having a positive influence on the research . I would recommend anyone who may be reluctant to apply to do so anyway . My main point of sharing this experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role even if you feel lack of self-confidence . I am still not sure why I was offered the role over other people as I never asked and still assume it 's either because no one else applied . I decided however not to focus on why I was offered the job because it was in the past and rather to focus on achievements during the post . <p> Due to the confidence this post has given me I am now considering doing a masters in transpersonal psychology , continuing my interest in how people rationalize , hopefully doing research on those that are prone to addiction . <p> Zoey Hudson graduated from Anglia Ruskin University with a BSc ( Hons ) Psychology in 2012 .

@@76805540 @5505540/ <h> Menu <h> The transformation of science <p> " Progress is impossible without change ; and those who can not change their minds can not change anything . " - ( George Bernard Shaw ) <p> Nothing is as permanent as change . These various proverbs referring to the surpassing of time we experience can not only refer to daily processes . While human beings and nature change , sience and research intend to describe and investigate those changes . This post intends to give an insight into the transformation of academia and research and contrast the previous philosophy of research to the actual one discussing implementations for todays research possibilities. - Some information in this post derive from a discussion of numerous researchers ( Brew , 1997 ) of a variety of disciplines discussing whether external or intellectual factors or both have- changed in our post-modern research community . Therefore , it is to investigate whether the academic content or research methodologies have been transformed . <p> The roots of research <p> Thinking back to all those great researchers of old times , such as Galileo Galilei ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have considered research as another option to view the world in a more realistic , nature based view . Religion and other transcendent believes have become less credible to explain the world those human beings living at that time . As scientific ideas have been forbidden in the earlier centuries , research has undergone an extreme revolution since then . At the beginning those sciences developed that were able to explain the world and physical happenings in a descriptive way . The new idea of research in those times had been called- positivism that followed a rational and mechanistic , objectivist , realist empiricist tradition of inquiry . Positivism is based upon the assumption that there is one solution to a worldly question , one perspective and one explanation : <p> Kuhn ( 1970 ) redirects our gaze from the disembodied subject of reason as the source of knowledge to a source in paradigms , traditions and knowledge-producing communities . . . . Kuhn points to the scientist , the subject of science , who is formed and acts through an unconscious acceptance of traditional , community-based authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working in and changing the world . ( Usher &amp; Edwards 1995 : 36-37 ) . <p> But those positivistic ideals have long ceased to dominate our view of science , but- include attempts to define research methodologies which transcend the rules of positivism ( see for example , Brew 1991 As researchers have systematically and empirically managed to investigate knowledge others have produced , criticize it and create other theories , they have started to realize that in several cognitive and social matters , not only one perspective one solution can be considered the scientific truth , but that many social and cognitive attempts to describe the " truth " depend on personal interpretation . Psychology as a social science underlies those numerous divers interpretations of a subject , a thought and a construct . In accordance with this philosophy of science as a way to reflect upon knowledge and human thinking , the purpose of science has transferred from " discovering the truth " to " describing via construct a part of the world " . This definition has lead to a greater ambiguity and more coexisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of research methods . Nevertheless , experts agree <p> Our research today <p> Today , research is in a state of transition from a relatively stable view of its methodology and purpose towards an uncertain and far more diffuse pattern of studies , the nature of knowledge is changing ( Brew , 1991 ) . Academia and science is not only limited to a few genius that revolution the scientific world , but almost everyone having pursued an academic career can become a scientist examining a small portion of the world . Almost everything can get investigated in our information technology world that defines itself as the generation of knowledge. - Due to technological advances ideas can be spread quicker and easier and an exponential amount of new research fields has opened up in the past decades . Experts ( Brew , 1991 ) have evidenced three main reasons for the change in research : <p> 1 . External pressures are changing research methods <p> Due to technological advancement , computers facilitate the collection and storage of an almost unlimited amount of information . Although research has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of subjects ( e.g. cognitive neuroscience ) that have been untouched before , can be examined in detail and the last mysteries of the human brain solved . In some subject areas the existence of databases has transformed the discipline as there is information available which was n't available before . Having material in a database means that the researcher is able to concentrate on higher level activities . <p> 2 . There is a shift to short term project-based research . <p> While in the early 20th century , research was almost a lifetime achievement and if you were lucky , you could present ONE new theory to humanity in your life , todays social sciences revolve around the idea to produce numerous significant contributions to the academic world throughout the course of your research career . Publishing and producing knowledge ( regardless of how valuable these results are ) have become most of the researchers priorities related to the ideas of a society in which consumption and innovation is so deeply rooted . Limited fundings and governmental restrictions intensify this competitive production of knowledge . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or construct a new theoretical idea , but it is crucial that you are the FIRST to do so and competent enough to get it published : <p> Research used to be something you steeped yourself in . . . a month or two at a time and thengetting out there for an extended period whereas now . . the culture of research and the climate ofthe present is that research is about . . define a project in order to get a grant . . . you sort of doresearch . . . it 's largely defined by which grants you get . . . . . no time more money creates avery different kind of methodology in a way , which for me is problematic .

@@76805549 @5505549/ <h> Menu <h> How to write a good literature review article ? <p> When writing research articles , most students feel confident enough to make a good paper out of the research they have conducted . But when it comes to writing literature review articles , this confidence may quickly evaporate if one does n't have much experience with them . So , what exactly is a literature review article , and how to avoid the most common pitfall on the road to writing one ? <p> By the time you have decided to write a literature review on the topic of your interest , you have probably already acquired some knowledge in the area . Writing a good literature review , however , requires more than just merely listing the main theoretical approaches to the problem and the research they have generated . It has to review the topic in a critical , unbiased and holistic way , which makes connections between the different lines of research , points out any inconsistencies and suggests directions for further research . Here are some more specific tips that will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cite <p> The number of sources you will have to go through depends mainly on how much interest your topic has generated among researchers . But even if it has just recently become popular among psychologists , chances are that you may have to read at least a few dozens of them . Although it might be tempting to cite every relevant source that you come across , try to choose only the most representative and informative ones . Of course , unlike research articles which often have severe space limitations , literature review articles naturally allow for a more in-depth theoretical and research review . However , you should make sure that the number of sources you choose to cite is reasonable for the total length of your article . When in doubt , always consider your readers you 're not writing to show them how many studies you have read , but to give them an informative and complete overview of the topic . For example , if there are two sources that essentially cover the same content without offering different perspective , you can consider leaving out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature research on your topic , always keep in mind that the sources you choose to cite should be as up-to-date as possible . Your readers wo n't get much insight of the problem if you 're summarizing the state in which the theories were two decades ago . Of course , this does n't mean that you should completely ignore the older works altogether , but that you should try to focus on the more recent ones . <p> If you ca n't go into much detail about some theoretical perspective or experimental approach , refer your readers to sources which will give them more information ( e.g. , other literature reviews or meta-analyses ) . Do n't just expect that they will figure out things just as easily as you do , because some of your readers may have little knowledge in the topic . The skillful and considerate writer is able to anticipate the questions of his readers and to answer them as they read along . <p> Evaluating the literature critically <p> When you are reading the literature on your topic , do n't just passively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to detect any possible inconsistencies like theoretical issues , methodological flaws , sample size and generalizations . A good literature review will not only summarize the information , but also point out weaknesses in the experimental procedures as well as possible theoretical conflicts . It builds on the current knowledge by identifying gaps in the available literature and suggesting future directions for research . This will not only allow you to ask new questions about the problem , but also to put the old questions in new context . <p> Writing in an unbiased manner <p> Your readers will not gain much from reading your literature review article if it fails to deliver a holistic and bias-free approach to the problem . Moreover , the reviewers of your work will not be all too happy to read a literature review that is clearly biased in favour of a single point of view , since the odds are that at least one of them will have views different from your own ( Sternberg , 2003 ) . It is natural that you may consider one theory as a better explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also consider different theoretical perspectives . Make sure that you 're not leaving out works that are clearly relevant to your topic . Ask yourself questions like : Did I point out any weaknesses of my perspective ? Did I discuss studies contrary to it ? Did I allow for alternative explanations of the phenomenon being reviewed ? <p> Structuring your literature review article <p> Unlike the distinct and consecutive sections of research articles that we are all familiar with , sometimes it can be- difficult to decide on the structure of your literature review article . Before making any final decisions , it may be- well worth the time to consider a few different options and then choose the one which presents your text in the most coherent and informative way . If your article turns out to be a longer one , you can also consider outlining its structure in the beginning of your text . By saying how you will present your review to the readers , they will know what to expect and will be better prepared to assimilate what you have to say . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoretical approaches in a logical way ( e.g. , chronologically , according to the conclusion they make ) . But however you may decide to structure your article , try to make it as easy for the readers to understand as possible . <p> Martin Vasilev is an Editor in JEPS .

Horizon 2020 is a- G80 billion heavy EU programme for research and innovation . In Brussels , they call it a flagship initiative aimed at securing Europes global- competitiveness . A natural question that arises when considering such an- enormous fund is will the end results of that funding be Open Access ? Since Horizon 2020 is still in the works , so to say ( it has to pass numerous steps before being implemented , including a vote in the European Parliament ) , it is important to stay informed and possibly take part in the public discussion that follows such a grand project . <p> When Chris Noone and I attended the Right to Research meeting in Budapest almost two months ago , one thing become obviously clear to us as students coming from Europe . Unlike our American counterparts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and us personally as students , were much less involved in public discussion of policy , or actually participation in the decision making process , on the EU level . The American student organizations at our Budapest meeting were highly involved in the decision making on the federal level , where such decisions had consequences on their studies and lives . Us as students knew a lot about national level policies and practices in research and Open Access , but the EU level legislation and possible future plans were a great unknown . <p> I 'd go as far to say , in my observation , that US federal-level student organizations are there to lobby and represents students in a- distinctly- federal context . On this side of the pond , where the collective ( European ) identity is much less exhibited and the tradition of political representation and organization among students on such a high level is relatively underdeveloped in certain aspects , our international organizations are oriented toward our members not to outward representation toward federal ( in the American dictionary ) institutions .

The media buzz surrounding this massive- G80 EU wide research framework can be interpret to state that the EU is following suit after the strong legislation from the UK and the US in the same vein thus enabling OA for research funded through Horizon 2020 .

In the funding framework that 's currently in effect ( Framework Programme 7 , or FP7 ) , only seven areas are Open Access ( about 20% of the total budget ) . FP7 also included the OpenAIRE project a central repository- facilitating- the implementation of green OA archiving within the funding framework .

The following paper will review supporting literature for creating a treatment package for targeting the misuse of a communication device in brief detail by using key elements in ABA . It will examine various types of attention ( or response ) that may reinforce the problem behaviour , as well as intervention methods , such as functional communication training and noncontingent reinforcement . In addition , the necessity of extinction for effective intervention will be considered . A review of the literature may help inform the development of a successful treatment package that could be implemented within applied settings . Additional desirable outcomes include : reduction in aberrant behaviour , accessing attention appropriately , establishing the correct use of the communication device and increase in manding levels .

An academic year in Cyprus is divided in fall and spring semester , which means that the courses last for about 3 to 4 months .
