@@106415475 @1815475/ <h> Using English Syntax to Enhance Your Writing <p> The effective use of English syntax in your writing can change everything . Using syntax well is not just about how you write and punctuate a sentence , it is about how the sentence is put together and constructed . Yes , a grammatically correct sentence is great , but it is the well-crafted sentence that makes a massive difference to the reader . <p> Confused ? Let 's start by taking a look at the difference between syntax and grammar . <h> The difference between syntax and grammar <p> Prescriptive grammar involves a set of rules that speculate the way in which language should be written and punctuated to follow agreed conventions . In a sense , grammar does n't  add enhanced meaning to your sentences ; it simply prescribes the form that should be used . Syntax is concerned with how- a sentence is worded and structured and involves the type of sentence used ( declarative , interrogative , exclamatory , imperative ) ; the order in which the words appear ( passive , active ) ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If my written English is grammatically correct why do I need to be concerned with syntax ? <p> There is a distinct difference between writing that is grammatically correct and writing that is interesting to read . Syntax adds meaning and vibrancy to your sentences , where grammar simply ensures that the rules of language are followed within that sentence . This is also , essentially , the difference between professional editors and proofreaders . An editor will make your writing more interesting , while a proofreader will just check for mistakes . <p> Let 's look at an example : <p> His long-held wish was to walk slowly through the tortuous mountain paths that his grandfather had carved out of the earth many years ago . <p> Syntax would refer to the sentence being declarative : stating a wish that the boy had . It would also refer to the length of the sentence and the way it is constructed in a manner that mimics the long , twisted paths in the mountain , and the long time the boy had been wishing to walk them . <p> Grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not split : " to walk slowly " rather than " to slowly walk " , and would necessitate correct subject-verb agreement . <p> A well-crafted sentence can make all the difference to a reader . It can convey the writer 's message more clearly and more effectively . Careful syntax is the difference between a messy , meandering piece of writing and a crisp , powerful piece of writing . <h> Editing for syntax <p> There are a number of things that you should think about when editing for syntax : <h> Is the meaning of the sentence clear ? <p> This should be the first question you ask when scrutinizing your English syntax usage . The problem you will have answering it , concerns the fact that you wrote the material yourself in the first place and , as such , you may- think that the meaning is clear when quite often it is n't . Just because an idea or- meaning is clear in your own head does not mean that the reader will interpret it in the same way . Let 's look at an example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Is the young girl using the broom to hit the man , or is she hitting a man who is holding a broom ? <p> Another area that can cause great confusion is the misuse of punctuation marks . Our " Dear John Letter " perfectly illustrates how a few misplaced punctuation marks can make a world of difference to the meaning of a written communication . <p> When editing a document , you need to look beyond the grammar alone and consider how your reader may interpret your writing . If there is scope for unintended confusion , reword it or improve the punctuation . <h> Does the sentence contain repetition ? <p> One thing that many writers are guilty of is over-emphasizing a single point , and they often do this by repeating the same information using different words . For example : <p> James was really scared ; he was really frightened . <p> The second sentence part of this sentence , " he was really frightened " is completely unnecessary because the reader has already been informed that James was scared . Many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composing their written documents because they are emptying their heads onto the paper or screen and are trying to emphasize the points they want to get across . If you have a tendency to do this , it is important that you recognize the impact it can have on the quality of your writing and look for repetitious words or phrases during the editing phase . <h> How does the sentence/paragraph end ? <p> Many people understand the importance of ending each line or stanza in a poem with the correct word , maybe because it needs to rhyme or because they want to make an impact . However , very few people extend this understanding to their syntax and written prose and fail to recognize the importance that the last word has on making an impact . For example : <p> In a fit of rage , Mary threw down the towel that she was cleaning Peters brow with . <p> The use of the word " with " at the end of the sentence has very little impact on the reader . However , if we reengineer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary stopped cleaning Peters brow and threw down the towel in a fit of rage . <p> This is much more dramatic and punchy and will ignite the readers emotion much more than the first version . <p> Its not just the sentence that needs to end appropriately because syntax is more than just looking at isolated sentences. - We also need to consider the paragraph as a whole and consider the way in which the sentences work together . A paragraph should contain one idea or encapsulate one part of the action and the sentences contained within this paragraph should help to build this idea . When editing your work , you should consider how the sentences within the paragraph are interacting with one another and whether the order of them effectively achieves the aim of your communication . <h> Is the sentence active or passive ? <p> Many people will tell you that writing in passive voice is ineffective . This is not actually the case , and there are occasions where it is actually more suitable to write in passive voice than it is to write in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more information . However , what is important is that the voice used within a document is appropriate to the communication intentions . If , for example , you want to communicate the fact that the action is happening at arms length , - passive voice is perfectly acceptable . On the other hand , if you want to inject energy and directness into your writing , then sentences that are written in the active voice will be much more powerful . <h> Does this sentence create the effect I want ? <p> Great writing stretches far beyond writing grammatically correct sentences . Great writing involves considering how these sentences can be best used to invoke a response from the reader through the use of appropriate syntax . For example , you may wish to create tension . One method of doing this is through using short , fragmented sentences . Alternatively , if you 're looking to portray a sense of unorganized chaos or confusion , long sentences that contain many clauses will be more beneficial . <p> Using English syntax to enhance your writing is not something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edit your work with the explicit intention of assessing how your sentences are constructed and what they communicate to the audience .

The Semi-Colon <p> The semi-colon is an immensely useful punctuation mark for those who are looking to slam two slightly related clauses together into a single triumphant sentence . <p> Semi-colons are most commonly used to merge two independent clauses . For example : <p> There 's a crocodile in the toilet . He has a lot of hair growing out of his ears . <p> At present , the two sentences are separated by a full stop / period . If you were to read them aloud they would sound like this : <p> There 's a crocodile in the toilet . *Pause* He has hair growing out of his ears . <p> If you were to insert a semi-colon in place of the full stop / period , the pause would be much shorter and the sentence would look like this : <p> There 's a crocodile in the toilet ; he has a lot of hair growing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pause between the two independent clauses and is therefore used instead of a conjunction , such as and , yet , but , or , nor , for and so . <p> OR <p> A semi-colon can also be used as a super-comma , to separate items in a long list . For example : <p> At the chocolate factory , I scoffed acid balls , they were super sour ; everlasting gob stoppers , I spat mine out after an hour ; curly toffees , rather yummy ; and iced fancies , they made me sick . <h> 2 . The Comma <p> Everyone loves the comma . The problem is that quite a lot of people love it TOO MUCH . Commas are great for inserting pauses into sentences and breaking them up into manageable chunks .

Theres efficiency for you . <h> 3 . The Full Stop / Period <p> The period , or full stop as the British call it , is never going to set any hearts on fire , but its pretty much one of the most important punctuation marks we have . It tells you when the sentence is complete and you can take a breath . Period usage is second nature for most people and our brains do n't  really even register them most of the time . We do tend to notice if they 're missing though <h> 4 . The Colon <p> There are plenty of jokes that can be made regarding the name of this punctuation mark but were far too sophisticated for that ( youve no idea how much restraint that took ) . The colon is most commonly used to introduce and can be used to introduce anything : - words , phrases , lists , names or quotations . For example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind : peanut butter cupcakes . <p> The buffoon finished his feast in seconds : " I 'll never eat again , " he said . <h> 5 . The Quotation Mark <p> We 've all " seen " them . They seem to show up " everywhere " these days , more often than not when they should n't " like in this sentence ! To stay on the safe side , quotation marks should really only be used to show that you 've stolen the words of someone else . <p> The use of quotation marks is complicated by the fact that there are two types in use : double quotation marks and single quotation marks . Confuse the two at your peril . <p> Double quotation marks are used to directly and exactly quote the words of someone : <p> " I was absolutely amazed to find a crocodile in the bathroom brushing his teeth , " Mother said . <p> Single quotation marks are used to quote someone who is quoting someone else : <p> " I could not believe my ears when the crocodile said , Can I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quotation marks are not valid substitutes for italics and should not be used as such . To you and me , its Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet , NOT " Romeo and Juliet " . <p> Incidentally , punctuating your spoken English with air quotes is also just plain wrong .

The good news is that proofreading symbols are no longer as important as they once were . The wide-spread availability of computers means that the majority of proofreaders now highlight the required changes on an electronic copy of the document . In addition to this , instead of merely pointing out that there is an issue , most proofreaders now actually fix the problem and use the track changes tool on the word processor to show the client where the corrections have been made . The client is then free to either accept or reject each change as they see fit . This methodology makes the proofreading process much more efficient and allows the proofreader to provide the client with much more help than making a few squiggles here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed otherwise , Vappingos proofreaders always use the track changes functionality in Microsoft Word . This is much more useful to you than proofreading marks alone because it provides you with practical help with your written English ; it both highlights mistakes AND shows you how to remedy them .

Regardless of the method you choose , proofreading- is a critical part of the writing process and should never be overlooked . Here are 10 top methods for proofreading your written documents . <h> Do n't  rely on spelling and grammar checkers . <p> Spell checkers are great as the first port of call and will be useful in assisting you to identify high-level errors . However , automated spelling and grammar checkers are severely limited and they can not identify many common grammatical errors . Furthermore , they often make serious mistakes that can mislead even the most diligent writer . If you 're looking for evidence of this , you will benefit from checking out the following posts : <h> Proofread for one error at a time <p> Proofreading really is a meticulous and time-consuming process , but the more you put into it , the more you get out .

This will make it easier to spot issues and you can vary the proofreading technique you use on each pass to suit the type of mistakes you are searching for . <h> Read each word slowly <p> One technique that the majority of professional proofreaders use is to read the writing they are proofreading out loud . This forces you to voice every single word and involves your auditory senses in the process , meaning that you can hear how the text actually sounds when it is read . Trying to read something quickly forces your brain to skip some words and make unconscious corrections . If you do n't  believe us , check out this post : <h> Break the text into manageable chunks <p> Breaking the text into separate sections provides you with more manageable tasks . Read each section carefully and then take a break before you progress to the next . This will prevent you from feeling overwhelmed by the task ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of writing that you are proofreading . This technique is especially useful if you are proofreading a very large document , such as a thesis or dissertation . <h> Circle punctuation marks <p> This method may seem over the top but it is one of the most effective methods out there for spotting punctuation mistakes . By circling every single punctuation mark , you force yourself to look at each one in turn and question if it really has been used correctly . <h> Read the writing backwards <p> This proofreading method is useful for identifying spelling mistakes because it forces you to concentrate on each word in isolation . Start with the last word in your text and follow each one separately until you reach the beginning of the document . While you are doing this , you are not really interested in punctuation and grammar ; you are focusing entirely on how the words have been spelled . Many proofreaders also recommend reading papers backwards , sentence by sentence . This encourages you to consider each sentence in isolation out of the context of the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammatical errors . <h> Note the errors you make on a frequent basis <p> Proofreading writing on a regular basis can help you to identify your own strengths and weaknesses and understand where you make mistakes . If you are aware of the common errors you make , you can learn to look for them during the writing process itself and , over a period of time , will learn to avoid them altogether . Keep style guides and grammar rules to hand as you proofread , and look up any areas that you are uncertain about . Over time you will develop your knowledge and your writing skills will improve . <p> If you think you could benefit from the services of a professional proofreader , please consider our online proofreading services .

In the case of editing , we recognize that there is a considerable overlap between substantive editing and line editing and , for this reason , we operate a model that is a combination of both processes. - Our editors will generally start the editing process with a substantive pass through the entire manuscript. - They will check the overall structure of the document , correct any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logically. - They will then revisit the editing process and , on the second pass , will perform further copyediting while ensuring that references , citations , and quotations are correct. - Finally , they will proofread the document in order to identify any mistakes they have missed through pass one and two . <p> Here at Vappingo we do not use a special markup language on a customer 's manuscript or paper unless they specifically request it. - Instead , we mark the changes we have made by activating the Track Changes tool in Word. - We then send our customers two versions of their document : a version that includes all the changes and editor comments , and a version in the final form , with all such changes accepted .

The Exclamation Mark <p> Once a highly respected serious punctuation mark , the exclamation mark is in serious threat of becoming nothing more than a glorified emoticon . The exclamation point is used to add an air of emotion to a sentence : <p> I cant believe it ! I think I have fallen in love with a hairy-knuckled oath ! <p> Note the use of just one exclamation mark in the above sentence . Not two , not three , not four just one . Despite the modern day mentality of heightening emotion by adding numerous exclamation marks at the end of a sentence , you really do only need one . <p> A second potential use of an exclamation mark is to accompany mimetically produced sounds : <p> Ha ! I knew it ; you just cant resist hairy knuckles on a man . Does he comb them ? <h> 8 . The Question Mark <p> The question mark is probably one of the most important punctuation marks because it has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply by appearing at its close : <p> You are so amazingly clever . <p> The above flattering phrase becomes drenched in an air of sarcasm when you add the all important question mark : <p> You are so amazingly clever ? <h> 9 . Brackets <p> Parentheses are used to set aside messages that are not really essential to the meaning of the text . They are always used in pairs and can contain one or more sentences that may include references , definitions , further information or editorial comments . There are three main rules governing the use of parentheses : <p> 1 ) Use parentheses to enclose words that are included as an aside . <p> There were one hundred ( 100 ) gremlins banging at the door demanding ice cream . <p> 2 ) To enclose words or figures that clarify the existing sentence . <p> I refused to answer the door because ( 1 ) I am not particularly fond of gremlins , ( 2 ) I had just got out of the shower , and ( 3 ) I had no ice cream in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop should appear inside the parenthesis if it contains a full sentence . <p> I have enclosed a picture of the damage the gremlins have done to my property ( attachment A ) . <p> I have enclosed a picture of the damage the gremlins done to my property . ( Please see attachment A. ) <p> It is grammatically acceptable to use commas instead of parentheses but , because the parenthesis have the effect of acting as an aside , they are generally used to denote that the information is less important . <h> 10 . The Hyphen <p> The hyphen is a punctuation mark used to join words and to separate syllables of a single word . It can be produced by pressing the key that appears on the top right of a computer keyboard and should never have spaces before or after it . Neither should a hyphen ever be confused with a dashwell cover that one next . <p> The most popular use of a hyphen is to join two compound adjectives e.g. hairy-handed .

@@106415534 @1815534/ <h> What is a Double Negative ? <p> Source : www.failblog.com <p> What is a double negative and do you need to care ? <p> The quick answer to this is yes . Some people believe that there is a place for them in written English and others argue that they are non-standard and should not be used . Regardless of your opinion , you need to be able to identify them and understand the impact that their use may have on the meaning of your sentence . <h> What is a double negative ? <p> A double negative occurs when a clause contains two negative words that serve to cancel one another out . They are generally acceptable in informal language as a means of intensifying a negative meaning . However , it is important to recognize that their usage can cause confusion for a reader and it is , therefore , advisable that they are completely avoided in formal written English . <h> Two negatives make a positive <p> One of the main problems associated with double negatives is that when you use two negative words in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people who mistakenly use a double negative in a clause actually say the opposite of what they intended to say . For example , if you were to write , " I do n't  have no problems , " the words do n't  and no would cancel each other out and you would effectively be saying : " I have money . " <h> Are there situations when it is okay to use a double negative ? <p> Yes . Occasionally , double negatives can be useful when a writer wants to emphasize a negative quality . For example , the clause , " I can not disagree with you " is a double negative " " I agree with you " would be the positive descriptor " however , using the negative form places an emphasis on the fact that , while there is no basis on which to disagree , the agreement is tentative . Similar clauses are , " I wont ask you not to do that , " and " I am not unhappy , " " I 'm not sure that I did n't  say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It is often very difficult to proofread your own writing because you are very familiar with its content , and you know what it should say . Sadly , what your written communications should say , does not always mirror what they actually do say . If you 're an ESL student , or grammar and punctuation are n't  exactly your forte , you will find proofreading an extremely difficult and time-consuming- process . <p> If you really must insist on proofreading your own work then break the task up into manageable chunks , making sure that you approach each element in a methodical manner . Our proofreaders checklist contains a list of steps that you can progress through in order to ensure that your draft is proofread fully . <h> Proofreaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tightrope <p> Have all the necessary equipment you will need to walk the tightrope . Print out any style guides you are required to follow , instructions for the document and have a good dictionary and thesaurus to hand . <p> Prepare yourself mentally . Do n't  even contemplate stepping out onto the proofreading tightrope unless you are of the right frame of mind . Proofreading requires a great deal of concentration and effort and if you 're " just not in the mood , " do n't  even attempt it . Get your composure , clear space in your head and focus fully on the task in hand . <p> Ensure that all the basic safety nets have been deployed . Run the automatic grammar and spell check software on your word processor as the first port of call . This will help to identify glaringly obvious spelling and grammar errors . However , do n't  rely on this as your sole proofreading tool . Spell checkers are very limited and have some major flaws . They are great for preparing your document for full proofreading , but you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your final document is perfect . <h> Step Two : Walking the Highwire <p> Proofread the document very slowly . Take one small step at a time and focus your full attention on every single word and punctuation mark . If it helps , use a piece of paper to uncover each word in turn . The more carefully you approach the task , the higher your chances are of completing it without any mistakes . <p> If necessary , stop for a rest . If you find your concentration waning , take a break . It is far better to stand still for a while than it is to rush to the other side and make fatal errors . If you were to walk across a tightrope , you would n't even attempt it if you did n't  believe that you could complete the task safely . Think of proofreading in a similar light ; if you are not going to be able to put your full attention into the task then do n't  attempt it until you can . A document that is 1/2 or 1/4 proofread is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> Just like tightrope walking , proofreading has many different elements . Instead of attempting everything at once , consider completing several passes of the document ; one for spelling , one for punctuation and one for vocabulary . If you have the time , do each of these tasks on a separate occasion . This will give you even greater focus and you will identify a greater number of mistakes . <h> Step Three : Reap the Rewards <p> When you finally reach the opposite side of the proofreading tightrope give yourself a big pat on the back and relax . You have faced your fears head on and hopefully emerged unscathed . Best of all , you can publish your document with confidence , knowing that it contains no mistakes that could detract from all your hard work . <h> Not Confident ? <p> If proofreading really is n't for you , then consider utilizing the services of a professional .

However , it really is worth taking the time to learn about this punctuation mark and when it should be used , as the correct use of it in your writing can really make a difference to the power of your communication . There are basically three situations in which you should use a semi-colon : <h> To connect two independent clauses . <p> An independent clause is a simple sentence that can stand completely on its own and make perfect sense . For example , the two sentences below are independent clauses : <p> The naughty gremlin licked the giant 's ear . <p> The giant was not very happy . <p> People often mistakenly link two independent clauses together using a comma : <p> The naughty gremlin licked the giant 's ear , the giant was not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent clauses together you can use a semi-colon : <p> The naughty gremlin licked the giant 's ear ; the giant was not very happy . <p> This unites the two similar ideas and eliminates the pause that would occur between them if you had used a full stop to separate the two clauses . Basically , the semi-colon serves the purpose of linking the two sentences so that the reader knows that they are connected to one another . Had he or she opted to use a period between the two clauses , the reader would have known that the gremlin licked the giant 's ear and that the giant was n't very happy but would not necessarily have known that the giant was unhappy BECAUSE the gremlin licked his ear . <h> When clauses are connected by a conjunctive adverb . <p> A conjunctive adverb is a word that is used to indicate a connection between two independent clauses that occur in one sentence . The following words are examples of conjunctive adverbs : <h> Conjunctive adverbs <p> also <p> however <p> otherwise <p> consequently <p> likewise <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthermore <p> moreover <p> therefore <p> hence- <p> nevertheless <p> nonetheless <p> When a conjunctive adverb is used to connect two independent clauses in a sentence , it should be preceded by a semi-colon and followed by a comma . Let 's look at an example : <h> Independent clause one : <p> The hairy baboon was far too fat to fit in the cage . <h> Independent clause two : <p> He could not travel to the new zoo . <h> Conjunctive adverb used to link the sentence with semi-colon used to connect the ideas : <p> The hairy baboon was far too fat to fit in the cage ; therefore , he could not travel to the new zoo . <h> To separate items in a list <p> The semi-colon is extremely useful when presenting long lists that already include commas : <p> The hairy baboon couldnt decide what to eat next : Oreos , which he likes to dip in his coffee ; peanut butter , which he thinks tastes amazing on toast ; strawberries and custard , which is sickly sweet ; or a nice big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost he needs to tackle the ironing . <p> Knowing when to use a semi-colon can be very rewarding and can add a great deal of power to your writing . Remember that practice makes perfect , so keep trying and , if you 're ever confused , err on the side of caution and separate sentences using a period ( full stop ) , as opposed to a comma .

It 's impossible to emphasize how important the right topic is in writing a persuasive essay . It 's often the difference between an average paper that is nevertheless difficult to write , and an outstanding paper that gives you no real trouble . A persuasive essay " also called an argumentative essay " should be passionate and convincing . Therefore , it 's vital to choose an essay topic that you can be passionate and convincing about .

Your professor has read so many dull , unfocused papers about global warming that they 're all beginning to look alike .

An essay about the existence of aliens is possibly one your professor has read before , but what about one dealing with the ethics of scientists broadcasting messages into space without the rest of humanity 's approval ?

This is another idiom that evolved from a story contained within the Bible . During the time of the Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt , Moses parted the Red Sea . After the change in leadership from Moses to Joshua , God performed the same miracle , telling Joshua to part the Jordan River so that his people could enter the promised land . On this occasion , however , he tested the faith of the people by telling them that they must first get the soles of their feet wet , i.e. they must walk into the water and have faith that God will help them .

When you let your hair down , you give yourself to the moment and enjoy what is happening around you with no worries or cares . <p> The phrase derives from the 17th century when women always wore their long hair pinned up . To be seen in public with your hair down was to disgrace yourself and risk creating the perception that you were unkempt . However , women would often let their hair down in private , especially at bedtime , and hence to have your hair down became synonymous with being relaxed and at ease . <h> Examples of phrase in use : <p> You should have seen Kim dancing at the wedding last night .

Some unscrupulous merchants may sneakily switch the animal the customer had chosen for a catan animal that was readily availableand the customer may not notice this until they arrived home , by which point it would be too late .

Monetary savings or assets that will be used at a later date . <p> To have a nest egg means to have some savings that are intended for the future . A nest egg may be in monetary form , or it may be in a different form of assets , such as stocks and shares , jewelry or a retirement plan . <p> The origin of this idiom is very hard to trace . Many sources believe that it alludes to the age-old practice of placing a china egg in a hens nest to encourage her to lay . Perhaps the implication was that the egg could be retrieved at a later date when it was needed elsewhere . <h> Examples of idiomatic phrase : <p> She has a nice little nest egg for her retirement . <p> Do n't  spend all your money , make sure you have a nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write home about <p> Fig . Not particularly special , mediocre . If someone uses the idiom " nothing to write home about " they are implying that the subject or thing to which they are referring was satisfactory but is n't something that stood out in any way . They have nothing special to say about it , and therefore it is n't worth writing a letter home to tell others about it . It is believed that this idiomatic expression first became popular during World War I when soldiers on the front line would communicate with their friends and families back home via letters . If they had nothing to write home about , then the implication was that nothing special had happened that was worth taking the effort to write a letter about . <h> Example of phrase in use : <p> I ate all my food in the restaurant but it was nothing to write home about by any means . <p> The hotel was in a good location but the rooms were nothing to write home about . <h> pipe dream <p> Fig. an aspiration or ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pipe dream , it means they have an impossible notion or a wish that they dream of achieving . - People use the idiom to refer to someone who has unrealistic plans and dreams . <h> The origin of the idiomatic phrase : pipe dream <p> There are two explanations available concerning the origin of the idiom pipe dream . - The first concerns opium and the fact that this drug , when smoked through a pipe , caused people to hallucinate and have dreams . - As such , the phrase pipe dream emerged as a means of describing a dream that was unrealistic and illusionary . <p> The second potential explanation for the idiom pipe dream derives from the story of Samuel Heatherstump , an Englishman whose job it was to empty the chamber pot of royalty . - He dreamed of a waste sewerage system where the offending waste could be washed away via a system of pipes . - People laughed at him and said that his " dream of pipes " was unachievable . However , he never gave up and eventually did achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demonstrates that we should not always be quick to downgrade the dreams of other people as pipe dreams ! <h> Examples : <p> He is still in love with Janice . - He thinks she will notice him one day and they will live happily ever after ; its just a pipe dream . <p> Darren is dreaming of quitting his job and starting his own business . Well see if he can turn his pipe dream into reality .

My Top Tip <p> My best tip is just to pay attention to everyday things . Often there is an idea hiding right under your nose- if you look at common things &amp; give it a slight twist or draw a parallel to something else .

From this , I drew the parallel to ask my readers to think about what they are planting in their own life that could bloom year after year . Bob Wilson Thanks to Robert Wilson of SmArtful Coaching <h> 29 . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prong approach to content development .

Thanks to Laura Connell of For Those About To Shop <h> 32. 5 Key Sources For Blog Topics <p> To find new topics , talk to people . Tell them what you do and take note of the questions they ask you . These are great topics . Think of the top 10 reasons people should be interested in your topic/product/service . Each reason is the start of a blog post . If you hired someone to write about you/your company/your team , what insights would you give ? What challenges are people in your field facing ? Stay calm and write about each one . What challenges do your customers face ? Have you got solutions ? Thanks to Caroline De Gruchy of C.R. Visuals <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our clients , I usually determine their strategy for the blog and then whittle the conventional " 25 styles " of blog posts down to a handful of the most appropriate .

The result is usually an actionable schedule . Thanks to Stephen Terlizzi of Tanis Communications , Inc. <h> 34 . Crowd Source Your Blog Content <p> Let your readers dictate what types of posts you do on your blog . Keep a running list of the questions that readers ask , and then do posts based on what topics are the most popular .

Your content is guaranteed to be popular if you are giving people exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyday Fashion <h> 35 . Picture Cultural Icons Dealing With Your Topic <p> I am an attorney in Northern Virginia , and I write a blog called " Thoughts on Wills and Estate Planning " . My top tip for coming up with new and interesting content is to picture how various cultural icons might deal with your topic . For example , after I saw the latest Harry Potter movie , I took some random elements of the plot and tried to apply them to estate planning . This enables me to use some creativity- but also helps me create more relatable posts on what can be an otherwise dry topic . Thanks to Scott Zucker of The Zucker Law Firm , PLLC <h> 36 . Challenge Of Blogging About Writing <p> As a newly published author , I maintain several social media sites . To update my blog , I do a variety of things .

Trending And Interesting Leads To Fantastic Content <p> One of the great things about our blog is that it spotlights some of the coolest items that we feel bargain-hunters will be interested in . Sometimes it 's a rare car or it could be a 70s pinball machine- or even growing lights . Our tip is to make your posts content about something in demand and standing out from the ordinary . We do this by checking trending phrases everywhere online and picking the most interesting ones that match auction items in our own database . Then we blog about them . Thanks to Ian Aronovich of GovernmentAuctions.org <h> 38 .

Ex : News about Company X allowing 50 percent of its workforce to telecommute inspires me to write my opinion on that news OR to give tips on convincing employers to allow telecommuting . Two great angles from the same news ! Thanks to Brie Reynolds , Content Manager of FlexJobs <h> 39 . Consider what your customers need to know <p> I 'm relatively new to blogging , but to get started I simply made a list of questions my clients ask me . These range from " How often should I get a massage " to specific benefits for different medical conditions . I 've also included questions that many people are embarrassed to ask their massage therapist but my close friends have asked me , such as " what if I fall asleep and snore " and " should I leave my underwear on or take it off " .

@@106415606 @1815606/ <h> 10 Ways to Increase Your Alexa Rank in Less Than a Week <p> Alexa rank is quite often overlooked in peoples quest to top Googles rankings . While it has very little association with Google and SEO , it is a crucial measurement for site monetization and anyone who wishes to advertise on their site really does need to know what the Alexa rank is and how their site can achieve a high rank . This article explains Alexa rank and describes some of the steps you can take to improve your scores and create a website that is in demand . <h> Alexa Rank in Brief <p> Alexa rank is a system for scoring websites based on the amount of traffic that they receive . The Alexa rank is very basically calculated by measuring the number of visits to a site made by people who have the Alexa toolbar installed and it consists of a three-month rolling set of data that measures both the number of page views and the number of users who visited those pages . <h> Why Alexa Rank is Important for Your Site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs that wish to gain revenue from advertising . Many advertisers use a sites Alexa rank to decide how much an advertisement on that blog or site is worth ; the higher your Alexa rank , the more traffic your site is getting and therefore the higher the value of advertising space on your website . Many people argue that the Alexa rank is very limited because it only counts traffic from users who have the Alexa toolbar installed . In addition to this , they believe that the Alexa ranking system is skewed towards tech websites that attract the type of users who would have such a bar installed ; does an ordinary " Joe Blogg " web surfer even know what Alexa is , never mind have the toolbar ? My view is actually quite straightforward , it really does n't  matter if the results are skewed or not ; if you want to achieve a high advertising revenue from your site or blog then you need a high Alexa rank ! <h> I Need a High Alexa Rank : What Should I do ? <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexa rank but the first thing you need to do , if you have n't already , is install the Alexa toolbar .

Before you follow any of them , make sure that you have the Alexa toolbar installed . <h> 10 Ways to Increase Your Alexa Rank in Less Than a Week <p> 1 ) Install an Alexa widget on your site . This will allow Alexa to track all visitors to your blog , including those that do n't  have the Alexa toolbar installed themselves . Its an absolute must if you want to get credit for as many visitors to your site as possible . Most blogging platforms have Alexa plugins readily available , but if you want the code to install one yourself , you will find it on the Alexa site . <p> 2 ) Try and participate in webmaster forums . Find suitable topics that you can contribute to and include your URL and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make . The type of people who use these forums are the type of people who will have the Alexa toolbar installed and there 's a chance they will visit your site and simultaneously increase your Alexa rank . <p> 3 ) Connect with technology users using your social accounts . For the same reason as number one , these types of users will probably have the Alexa toolbar installed and if you Tweet about your site there 's a chance they may visit . <p> 4 ) Try and create content on your site that will appeal to webmasters . Tools , widgets and applications will all attract webmasters who are looking for quality content for their sites . If they visit your site to access these tools then your Alexa rank will benefit . If you cant conceive great content ideas , find articles that will be useful for your target customers and get them rewritten for your brand .

Although this is a costly option it will undoubtedly bring you traffic , so do consider using it to boost your Alexa rank . You may also wish to consider buying advertising space on technology and web resources sites . <p> 7 ) Create an Alexa category on your blog or site . Create posts that advertise your position and progress and continually update them to let your visitors know how you 're performing . Having content on your site related to Alexa will attract webmasters who are looking for further information on this ranking tool . <p> 8 ) Ask for feedback . Visit as many webmaster forums and help sites as possible and participate in the discussions that you find there . Ask people to visit your site and give feedback on it . This will generate visitors while also hopefully creating some productive feedback on how your site can be improved . <p> Give them a go and let us know how you get on .
