@@24975531 @4975531/ <h> Managing risk <h> Process and framework <p> IHG has an established risk management process and framework embedded in all regions . The long-term strategic goals are aligned with the IHG core purpose Great Hotels Guests Love and include these key elements : <p> safety and security of guests , employees and other third parties ; <p> brand strength supported by operational excellence in risk management at all hotels and corporate locations ; and <p> maintenance and promotion of the reputation of the Company . <p> Our approach has been to enable and support hotel owners , staff and corporate functions to manage risk effectively . This is accomplished by giving them a systematic approach and framework to follow and by providing them with tools to do the job . <h> Safety and security in hotels <p> A strategic framework for hotel safety and security has been designed for owned and managed hotels and is illustrated below showing the identified groups of risks and describing the management activities carried out to mitigate the risks . <p> The red wheel illustrates the groups of risks which IHG 's risk managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their management teams in order to minimise the risks and keep the hotels safe . <p> Over the years we have developed risk management strategies to assess and treat individual types of risk . This has involved developing policies , standards and guidelines , raising awareness levels , training staff on the controls and systems which have been developed for their use and reviewing and reporting upon progress and continued risks . These management activities are represented by the purple wheel . <p> Security risks , particularly the threat of terrorism , have increased . In recent years , IHG has developed an increasingly sophisticated response that is intelligence-led and risk-based . The security risk environment is highly dynamic and needs to be managed both centrally and locally in hotels . In common with all risk strategies , there are three elements that must be developed and maintained : physical and technical systems , people capabilities and processes and procedures . <h> Hotel safety framework <h> Corporate risk management <p> The management activities shown above are being adapted and applied to manage corporate risks . This initiative is led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and integrated with quarterly strategic reviews . <p> IHGs Risk Management function has recently reviewed the way in which corporate risk and the major risks to IHG are managed and is seeking to develop a framework to improve risk management capability further , represented diagrammatically below : <p> Each year , risk identification workshops are run with the senior IHG management . The output is a Group Risk Register , divided into areas of accountability for each member of the Executive Committee . <p> The Executive Committee uses the findings to identify the major areas of risk for IHG and to assign accountability for cross-functional leadership between them . The Executive Committee prioritises and co-ordinates efforts to optimise the management of major risks to IHG . <p> Risk owners then identify existing controls as well as the ability , benefit and cost to improve them . This work is documented in Risk Action Plans that support the risks that are reported in the Group Risk Register . <p> Executives review the risks at quarterly strategic reviews as part of their business review with the Chief Executive and strategy team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major reports each year to the Executive Committee and the Board on hotel safety and security as well as a further report on the major risks to IHG . <p> The Internal Audit function is separately responsible for providing assurance across the Group . They report their findings to the Audit Committee . This ensures separation of duties between the Risk Management and Internal Audit functions and hence supports good governance . <p> The Board is ultimately responsible for the Groups system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness . In order to discharge that responsibility , in 2008 the Board considered the most recent Major Risk Review which involved extensive consultation throughout the business . <p> The Group is subject to a variety of risks which could have a negative impact on its performance and financial condition . The following section describes some of the risks that could materially affect the Groups business . The factors below should be considered in connection with any financial and forward-looking information in this Annual Report and the cautionary statements . <h> 2009 risk factors <p> The risks below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some risks are not yet known to IHG and some that IHG does not currently believe to be material could later turn out to be material . All of these risks could materially affect the Groups business , revenue , operating profit , earnings , net assets and liquidity and/or capital resources . <h> The Group is reliant on the reputation of its brands and the protection of its intellectual property rights <p> Any event that materially damages the reputation of one or more of the Groups brands and/or failure to sustain the appeal of the Groups brands to its customers could have an adverse impact on the value of that brand and subsequent revenues from that brand or business . <p> In addition , the value of the Groups brands is influenced by a number of other factors , some of which may be outside the Groups control , including commoditisation ( whereby price and/or quality becomes relatively more important than brand identifications due , in part , to the increased prevalence of third-party intermediaries ) , consumer preference and perception , failure by the Group or its franchisees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations ( including fire and life safety requirements ) , or other factors affecting consumers willingness to purchase goods and services , including any factor which adversely affects the reputation of those brands . <p> In particular , where the Group is unable to enforce adherence to its operating and quality standards , or the significant regulations applicable to hotel operations , pursuant to its management and franchise contracts , there may be further adverse impact upon brand reputation or customer perception and therefore the value of the hotel brands . <p> Given the importance of brand recognition to the Group 's business , the Group has invested considerable effort in protecting its intellectual property , including registration of trademarks and domain names . However , the controls and laws are variable and subject to change . Any widespread infringement , misappropriation or weakening of the control environment could materially harm the value of the Groups brands and its ability to develop the business . <h> The Group is exposed to a variety of risks related to identifying , securing and retaining management and franchise agreements <p> The Groups growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaining management and franchise agreements . This is an inherent risk for the hotel industry and franchise business model . Competition with other hotel companies may generally reduce the number of suitable management , franchise and investment opportunities offered to the Group and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to engage a manager or become a franchisee . The terms of new management or franchise agreements may not be as favourable as current arrangements and the Group may not be able to renew existing arrangements on the same terms . <p> There can also be no assurance that the Group will be able to identify , retain or add franchisees to the Group system or to secure management contracts . For example , the availability of suitable sites , planning and other local regulations or the availability and affordability of finance may all restrict the supply of suitable hotel development opportunities under franchise or management agreements . In connection with entering into management or franchise agreements , the Group may be required to make investments in , or guarantee the obligations of , third parties or guarantee minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant franchisees or groups of franchisees may have interests that conflict , or are not aligned , with those of the Group including , for example , the unwillingness of franchisees to support brand improvement initiatives . <p> Changes in legislation or regulatory changes may be implemented that have the effect of favouring franchisees relative to brand owners . <h> The Group is exposed to the risks of political and economic developments <p> The Group is exposed to the inherent risks of global and regional adverse political , economic and financial market developments , including recession , inflation , availability of affordable credit and currency fluctuations that could lower revenues and reduce income . A recession reduces leisure and business travel to and from affected countries and adversely affects room rates and/or occupancy levels and other income-generating activities , resulting in deterioration of results of operations and potentially reducing the value of properties in affected economies . The owners or potential owners of hotels managed or franchised by one group face similar risks which could adversely impact IHGs ability to retain and secure management or franchise agreements . More specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , accordingly , is particularly susceptible to adverse changes in the US economy . <p> Further political or economic factors or regulatory action could effectively prevent the Group from receiving profits from , or selling its investments in , certain countries , or otherwise adversely affect operations . For example , changes to tax rates or legislation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates could decrease the proportion of profits the Group is entitled to retain , or the Groups interpretation of various tax laws and regulations may prove to be incorrect , resulting in higher than expected tax charges . <p> In order to develop , support and market its products , the Group must hire and retain highly skilled employees with particular expertise . The implementation of the Groups strategic business plans could be undermined by failure to recruit or retain key personnel , the unexpected loss of key senior employees , failures in the Groups succession planning and incentive plans , or a failure to invest in the development of key skills . Some of the markets in which the Group operates are experiencing economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outside the hospitality industry for suitably qualified or experienced employees . Failure to attract and retain these employees may threaten the success of the Groups operations in these markets . Additionally , unless skills are supported by a sufficient infrastructure to enable knowledge and skills to be passed on , the Group risks losing accumulated knowledge if key employees leave the Group . <h> The Group is exposed to the risk of events that adversely impact domestic or international travel <p> The room rates and occupancy levels of the Group could be adversely impacted by events that reduce domestic or international travel , such as actual or threatened acts of terrorism or war , epidemics , travel-related accidents , travel-related industrial action , increased transportation and fuel costs and natural disasters , resulting in reduced worldwide travel or other local factors impacting individual hotels . A decrease in the demand for hotel rooms as a result of such events may have an adverse impact on the Groups operations and financial results . In addition , inadequate preparedness , contingency planning or recovery capability in relation to a major incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the brand or the reputation of the Group . <h> The Group is reliant upon its proprietary reservations system and is exposed to the risk of failures in the system and increased competition in reservations infrastructure <p> The value of the brands of the Group is partly derived from the ability to drive reservations through its proprietary HolidexPlus reservations system , a central repository of all hotel room inventories linked electronically to multiple sales channels including IHG owned Internet websites , third-party Internet intermediaries and travel agents , call centres and hotels . <p> Lack of resilience in operational availability could lead to prolonged service disruption and may result in significant business interruption and subsequent impact on revenues . Lack of investment in these systems may also result in reduced ability to compete . Additionally , failure to maintain an appropriate e-commerce strategy and select the right partners could erode the Groups market share . <h> The Group is exposed to certain risks in relation to technology and systems <p> To varying degrees , the Group is reliant upon certain technologies and systems ( including IT systems ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are highly integrated with business processes . Disruption to those technologies or systems could adversely affect the efficiency of the business , notwithstanding business continuity or disaster recovery processes . The Group may have to make substantial additional investments in new technologies or systems to remain competitive . Failing to keep pace with developments in technologies or systems may put the Group at a competitive disadvantage . The technologies or systems that the Group chooses may not be commercially successful or the technology or system strategy employed may not be sufficiently aligned with the needs of the business or responsive to changes in business strategy . As a result , the Group could lose customers , fail to attract new customers or incur substantial costs or face other losses . <h> The Group is exposed to the risks of the hotel industry supply and demand cycle <p> The future operating results of the Group could be adversely affected by industry overcapacity ( by number of rooms ) and weak demand due , in part , to the cyclical nature of the hotel industry , operations or other differences between planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occupancy levels would adversely impact the results of Group operations . <h> The Group may experience a lack of selected development opportunities <p> While the strategy of the Group is to extend the hotel network through activities that do not involve significant amounts of its own capital , if the availability of suitable development sites becomes limited for IHG and its prospective hotel owners , this could adversely affect its results of operations . <h> The Group is exposed to risks related to corporate responsibility <p> The reputation of the Group and the value of its brands are influenced by a wide variety of factors , including the perception of key stakeholders and the communities in which the Group operates . The social and environmental impacts of business are under increasing scrutiny , and the Group is exposed to the risk of damage to its reputation if it fails to demonstrate sufficiently responsible practices in a number of areas such as safety and security , sustainability , responsible tourism , environmental management , human rights and support for the local community . <h> The Group is exposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of litigation from many parties , including guests , customers , joint venture partners , suppliers , employees , regulatory authorities , franchisees and/or the owners of hotels managed by it . Claims filed in the US may include requests for punitive damages as well as compensatory damages . Exposure to litigation or fines imposed by regulatory authorities may also affect the reputation of the Group . <h> The Group may face difficulties insuring its business <p> Historically , the Group has maintained insurance at levels determined by it to be appropriate in light of the cost of cover and the risk profiles of the business in which it operates . However , forces beyond the Groups control including market forces , may limit the scope of coverage the Group can obtain and the Groups ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates . Other forces beyond the Groups control , such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters may be uninsurable or simply too expensive to insure . Inadequate or insufficient insurance could expose the Group to large claims or could result in the loss of capital invested in properties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could leave the Group responsible for guarantees , debt or other financial obligations related to such properties . <h> The Group is exposed to a variety of risks associated with its ability to borrow and satisfy debt covenants <p> The Group is reliant on having access to borrowing facilities to meet its expected capital requirements . The majority of the Groups borrowing facilities are only available if the financial covenants in the facilities are complied with . If the Group is not in compliance with the covenants , the lenders may demand the repayment of the funds advanced . If the Groups financial performance does not meet market expectations it may not be able to refinance its existing facilities on terms it considers favourable . The availability of funds for future financing is , in part , dependent on conditions and liquidity in the capital markets . <h> The Group is required to comply with data privacy regulations <p> Existing and emerging data privacy regulations limit the extent to which the Group can use customer information for marketing or promotional purposes . Compliance with these regulations in each jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies and associated processes which could increase operating costs or reduce the success with which products and services can be marketed to existing or future customers . In addition , non-compliance with privacy regulations may result in fines , damage to reputation or restrictions on the use or transfer of information . <h> The Group is exposed to the risks related to information security <p> The Group is increasingly dependent upon the availability , integrity and confidentiality of information and the ability to report appropriate and accurate business performance , including financial reporting , to investors and markets . <p> The reputation and performance of the Group may be adversely affected if it fails to maintain appropriate confidentiality of information and ensure relevant controls are in place to enable the release of information only through the appropriate channels in a timely and accurate manner . <h> The Group is exposed to funding risks in relation to the defined benefits under its pension plans <p> The Group is required by law to maintain a minimum funding level in relation to its ongoing obligation to provide current and future pensions for members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . In addition , if certain plans of the Group are wound up , the Group could become statutorily liable to make an immediate payment to the trustees to bring the funding of defined benefits to a level which is higher than this minimum . The contributions payable by the Group must be set with a view to making prudent provision for the benefits accruing under the plans of the Group . <p> In particular , the trustees of IHGs UK defined benefit plan may demand increases to the contribution rates relating to the funding of this plan , which would oblige relevant employers of the Group to contribute extra amounts . The trustees must consult the plans actuary and principal employer before exercising this power . In practice , contribution rates are agreed between the Group and the trustees on actuarial advice , and are set for three-year terms . The last such review was as at 31 March 2006.

@@24975608 @4975608/ <h> Group financial statements <h> Notes to the financial statements 21 - 30 <h> 21 Financial risk management policies <h> Financial instruments <p> The Group 's treasury policy is to manage financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs . The activities of the treasury function are carried out in accordance with Board approved policies and are subject to regular audit . The treasury function does not operate as a profit centre . <p> The treasury function seeks to reduce the financial risk of the Group and manages liquidity to meet all foreseeable cash needs . Treasury activities include money market investments , spot and forward foreign exchange instruments , currency options , currency swaps , interest rate swaps and options and forward rate agreements . One of the primary objectives of the Group 's treasury risk management policy is to mitigate the adverse impact of movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates . <p> The US dollar is the predominant currency of the Group 's revenue and cash flows and movements in foreign exchange rates , particularly the US dollar and euro , can affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover . To hedge this translation exposure the Group matches the currency of its debt ( either directly or via derivatives ) to the currency of its net assets , whilst maximising the amount of US dollars borrowed . <p> Foreign exchange transaction exposure is managed by the forward purchase or sale of foreign currencies or the use of currency options . Most significant exposures of the Group are in currencies that are freely convertible . <p> Interest rate exposure is managed within parameters that stipulate that fixed rate borrowings should normally account for no less than 25% and no more than 75% of net borrowings for each major currency . This is achieved through the use of interest rate swaps and options and forward rate agreements . <p> The treasury function ensures that the Group has access to sufficient funds to allow the implementation of the strategy set by the Board . At the year end , the Group had access to 944m of undrawn committed facilities . Medium and long-term borrowing requirements are met through the 1.1bn Syndicated Facility and short-term borrowing requirements are met from drawings under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the financial covenants in its loan documents , none of which is expected to present a material restriction on funding or investment policy in the near future . In addition , the Group had surplus cash of 179m which is held in short-term deposits and cash funds which allow daily withdrawals of cash . Most of the Group 's surplus funds are held in the UK or US and there are no material funds where repatriation is restricted as a result of foreign exchange regulations . Credit risk on treasury transactions is minimised by operating a policy on the investment of surplus cash that generally restricts counterparties to those with an A credit rating or better or those providing adequate security . <h> Sensitivities <p> Based on the year end net debt position and given the underlying maturity profile of investments , borrowings and hedging instruments at that date , a one percentage point rise in US dollar interest rates would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 1m ( 2005 1m ) . <p> A general weakening of the US dollar ( specifically a one cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Group 's profit before tax by an estimated 1m ( 2005 1m ) . <h> Hedging <p> Interest rate risk The Group hedges its interest rate risk by taking out interest rate swaps to fix the interest flows on between 25% and 75% of its borrowings in major currencies . At 31 December 2006 , the Group held interest rate swaps with notional principals of USD100m and EUR80m ( 2005 USD200m and EUR160m ) . The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of borrowings under the syndicated loan facility and they are held on the balance sheet at fair value in other financial assets and other payables . <p> Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the unrealised gains and losses reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective . When the hedged item is recognised , the cumulative gains and losses on the hedging instrument are recycled to the income statement . <p> Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on income streams denominated in foreign currencies . When appropriate , the Group hedges a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out forward exchange contracts . When hedge accounting is applied , the spot foreign exchange rate is designated as the hedged risk and so the Group takes the forward points on these contracts through financial income or expense . <p> Forward contracts are held at fair value on the balance sheet as other financial assets and other payables . <p> During the year , a 3m ( 2005 nil ) foreign exchange gain was recognised in finance income , relating to gains on forward contracts that were not classified as hedging instruments under IAS 39 . During the prior year , gains of 6m were recycled to the income statement from the unrealised gains and losses reserve in respect of effective hedges . <p> Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation The Group designates its foreign currency bank borrowings and currency derivatives as net investment hedges of foreign operations . The designated risk is the spot foreign exchange risk ; the interest on these financial instruments is taken through financial income or expense and the derivatives are held on the balance sheet at fair value in other financial assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the underlying exchange rates are taken to the currency translation reserve until an operation is sold , at which point the cumulative currency gains and losses are recycled against the gain or loss on sale . <h> 22 Financial instruments <h> Interest rate risk <p> For each class of interest bearing financial asset and financial liability , the following table indicates the range of interest rates effective at the balance sheet date , the carrying amount on the balance sheet and the periods in which they reprice , if earlier than the maturity date . <p> 31 December 2006 <p> Effective interest rate % <p> Total carrying amount m <p> Repricing analysis <p> Less than 6 months m <p> 6 months -1 year m <p> 1-2 years m <p> More than 5 years m <p> * These items bear interest at a fixed rate . <p> Cash and cash equivalents <p> 0.0 5.2 <p> ( 179 ) <p> ( 179 ) <p> <p> <p> <p> Secured bank loans ( floating ) <p> 8.5 <p> 7 <p> 7 <p> <p> <p> <p> Obligations under finance leases <p> 9.7 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Euro floating rate <p> 4.0 <p> 54 <p> 54 <p> <p> <p> <p> effect of euro interest rate swaps* <p> ( 1.0 ) <p> ( 54 ) <p> <p> 54 <p> <p> US dollar floating rate <p> 5.7 <p> 53 <p> 53 <p> <p> <p> <p> effect of US dollar interest rate swaps* <p> ( 1.2 ) <p> ( 51 ) <p> <p> 51 <p> <p> Sterling floating rate <p> 5.6 <p> 102 <p> 102 <p> <p> <p> <p> Net debt <p> 134 <p> ( 68 ) <p> <p> 105 <p> 97 <p> Foreign exchange contracts <p> ( 4 ) <p> ( 4 ) <p> <p> <p> <p> 130 <p> ( 72 ) <p> <p> 105 <p> 97 <p> 31 December 2005 <p> Effective interest rate % <p> Total carrying amount m <p> Repricing analysis <p> Less than 6 months m <p> 6 months -1 year m <p> 1-2 years m <p> More than 5 years m <p> * These items bear interest at a fixed rate . <p> Cash and cash equivalents <p> 0.0 4.5 <p> ( 324 ) <p> ( 324 ) <p> <p> <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 28 <p> <p> <p> 28 <p> <p> Secured bank loans ( floating ) <p> 2.9 8.5 <p> 10 <p> 10 <p> <p> <p> <p> Unsecured bank loans : <p> Euro floating rate <p> 2.9 <p> 141 <p> 141 <p> <p> <p> <p> effect of euro interest rate swaps* <p> ( 0.4 ) <p> ( 55 ) <p> <p> 55 <p> <p> US dollar floating rate <p> 4.7 <p> 162 <p> 162 <p> <p> <p> <p> effect of US dollar interest rate swaps* <p> 0.2 <p> ( 87 ) <p> 87 <p> <p> <p> Hong Kong dollar floating rate <p> 4.7 <p> 71 <p> 71 <p> <p> <p> <p> Net debt <p> 88 <p> ( 82 ) <p> 87 <p> 83 <p> <p> Effect of currency swaps : <p> Receive and pay fixed* <p> ( 1.5 ) <p> 3 <p> 3 <p> <p> <p> <p> Receive and pay floating <p> ( 2.0 ) <p> 2 <p> 2 <p> <p> <p> <p> 93 <p> ( 77 ) <p> 87 <p> 83 <p> <p> Interest rate swaps are included in the above tables to the extent that they affect the Group 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate debt by fixing the interest rate , shown above as the effect on the debt 's floating rate , on an amount equal to their notional principal , for a period of time represented by the figures in each column .

The bonus and matching shares in the 2006 plan are released on the third anniversary of the award date . Under the 2006 plan a percentage of the award ( Board members 80% ; other eligible employees 50% ) must be taken in shares and deferred . Participants may defer the remaining amount on the same terms or take it in cash .

As a result of this exchange , 23,195,482 shares were put under option at prices ranging from 308.48p to 593.29p . The exchanged options were immediately exercisable and are not subject to performance conditions . During 2006 , 3,678,239 ( 2005 4,138,482 ) such options were exercised , leaving a total of 4,055,674 ( 2005 7,909,002 ) such options outstanding at prices ranging from 308.48p to 593.29p for 2005 and 2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is October 2012 . <p> The Group recognised a cost of 18m ( 2005 17m ) related to equity settled share-based payment transactions during the year . <p> The aggregate consideration in respect of ordinary shares issued under option schemes during the year was 20m ( 2005 10m ) . <p> The following table sets forth awards and options granted during 2006 .

Quantifying the temporary differences is not practical . However , based on current enacted law and on the basis that the Group is in a position to control the timing and realisation of these temporary differences , no material tax consequences are expected to arise . <h> 27 Authorised and issued share capital <h> Authorised ( ordinary shares and redeemable preference share ) <p> At 31 December 2006 , the authorised share capital was 160,050,000 , comprising 1,400,000,000 ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 50,000 . <p> Allotted , called up and fully paid ( ordinary shares ) <p> note <p> Number of shares millions <p> m <p> During 2004 and 2005 , the Company undertook to return funds of up to 750m to shareholders by way of three consecutive 250m share repurchase programmes , the third of which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007 . During the year , 28,409,753 ( 2005 30,600,010 ) ordinary shares were repurchased and cancelled under the authorities granted by shareholders at general meetings held during 2003 , 2004 , 2005 and 2006 . Of these , 11,122,753 were 10p shares in the capital of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and 17,287,000 were 113/7p shares in the capital of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC . <p> On 27 June 2005 , the capital reorganisation ( by means of a scheme of arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985 ) was completed . Under the arrangement , shareholders received 11 new ordinary shares and 24.75 cash in exchange for every 15 existing ordinary shares held on 24 June 2005 .

In accordance with the merger relief provisions of Sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985 , the 443 million shares are recorded only at nominal value . <p> On 1 June 2006 , shareholders approved a share capital consolidation on the basis of seven new ordinary shares for every eight existing ordinary shares . This provided for all the authorised ordinary shares of 10p each ( whether issued or unissued ) to be consolidated into new ordinary shares of 113/7p each . The share capital consolidation became effective on 12 June 2006 . <p> Whilst the authorised share capital comprises one redeemable preference share of 50,000 , following its redemption in September 2005 , this redeemable preference share has not been re-issued . <p> At 1 January 2005 <p> 622 <p> 697 <p> Issued under option schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programmes <p> a <p> ( 19 ) <p> ( 22 ) <p> Capital reorganisation <p> b <p> ( 161 ) <p> ( 632 ) <p> Issued under option schemes <p> 1 <p> <p> Repurchased and cancelled under repurchase programmes <p> a <p> ( 11 ) <p> ( 1 ) <p> At 31 December 2005 <p> 433 <p> 43 <p> Share capital consolidation <p> c <p> ( 53 ) <p> <p> Issued under option schemes <p> 4 <p> 1 <p> Repurchased and cancelled under repurchase programmes <p> a <p> ( 28 ) <p> ( 3 ) <p> At 31 December 2006 <p> 356 <p> 41 <p> The authority given to the Company at the Annual General Meeting on 1 June 2006 to purchase its own shares was still valid at 31 December 2006 .

On adoption of IFRS , cumulative exchange differences were deemed to be zero as permitted by IFRS 1 . <p> During the year ended 31 December 2006 , the impact of hedging net investments in foreign operations was to reduce the amount recorded in the currency translation reserve by 32m ( 2005 9m ) . The fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations outstanding at 31 December 2006 was a 3m asset ( 2005 5m net liability ) .

@@24975617 @4975617/ <h> Responsible procurement <p> We take steps to engage responsible procurement , both by driving innovation with suppliers and conducting business responsibly . <h> Our supply chains <p> Our supply chain activities can be split into two broad categories corporate supply chains and hotel supply chains . Our corporate supply chains cover procurement for our corporate offices and are mainly focused on items such as technology and professional services . At the hotel level , supply chains cover procurement for all items required for running a hotel and cover a wide range of items including food , linens , cleaning supplies and furniture . Hotel procurement happens both at the local level and for some locations , via centralised purchasing arrangements that are available to our hotels . Our hotel owners will also have supply chains at different stages of their hotels life cycle , for instance at the construction stage for new build hotels . <h> Our suppliers <p> IHGs Vendor Code of Conduct sets out the standards under which IHG suppliers are expected to operate , including in relation to human rights and modern slavery across such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced labour and the exploitation of children .

As of January 2016 , over 1600 suppliers have signed up to the IHG Vendor Code of Conduct . <p> IHG suppliers are requested to pass through our supplier registration process through which the relevant due diligence information is gathered . It is only upon passing through the supplier registration process that a supplier can become an IHG accredited supplier . <p> IHG franchised hotels are independently owned and operated , however , all of our hotels and owners , both managed and franchised , have a shared commitment to responsible business .

In 2015 , we developed and rolled out a Sustainable Seafood Policy which applies to all IHG branded hotels globally and which clarifies that shark fin is not permitted to be served in our hotels bars and restaurants . <p> In 2016 , we further strengthened our commitment by stipulating that 90% of our top ten seafood products are sourced sustainably in the Americas , Europe and Greater China by 2020 , unless otherwise impactable .

IHG is publishing its report during the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) , in Davos , which highlights the erosion of trust in public and private sector institutions as one of its key trends . <p> Many companies focus on the 3Cs of organisational wealth : Financial Capital , Intellectual Capital and Human Capital .

Millennials look for places that have family-centric activities where their children will be well taken care of and will have fun . Boomers prefer everyone to be together in a multi-generational way . <p> The report argues that the changing nature of the family is also impacting how the consumer builds trust .

Elsewhere , both India and South East Asia exhibited steady growth , with the exception of Thailand which suffered from political instability in the first half of the year and saw a double digit decline in RevPAR . <p> On an underlying1 basis , revenue was up 2% and operating profit up 5% . This reflects solid like-for-like performance in our fee-based business , partially offset by investment in long-term business development and the political unrest in Thailand . Reported revenue increased 5% ( 10% CER ) to $242m and operating profit decreased 2% ( up 1% CER ) to $84m , impacted by the receipt of $6m in liquidated damages during 2013 . <p> We opened 4k rooms ( 19 hotels ) including nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the iconic InterContinental Double Bay Sydney . We signed 8k rooms ( 32 hotels ) , including the second Hotel Indigo property in the Middle East , a 1,000-room Holiday Inn in Manila and four InterContinental hotels across the region . <p> 2015 : <p> Investment into long-term business development will continue , and combined with a small number of minor refurbishments and contract renewals will have an approximately $3m negative impact on 2015 operating profit . <p> Greater China contributed 11% of our operating profit before central overheads in the year . Over the last 30 years , we have developed the leading managed hotel business in Greater China with 78k rooms open and a further 54k rooms in the pipeline . We achieved our highest ever openings in the year of 11k rooms , increasing our system size by 14% , whilst signing 16k rooms , our best year for hotel signings since 2007 . Having originally developed our business in tier one cities and the eastern seaboard , our more recent growth has focused on tier two and three cities . Tier two and three cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent two-thirds of our open rooms and over 90% of our pipeline rooms . <p> Comparable RevPAR increased 1.6% , led by an improvement in occupancy , with fourth quarter RevPAR down 2.0% . Total RevPAR declined by 3.4% as hotels opened in lower RevPAR markets . Our performance was significantly ahead of the industry , reflecting IHGs scale and operational excellence in the region , and was achieved in a challenging environment with slower macro-economic conditions , government austerity measures and protests in Hong Kong . Trading was strongest in tier one cities , especially Shanghai and Guangzhou , which benefited from high levels of transient and corporate business . Tier two and three cities continue to see strong levels of demand growth , but have been impacted by higher levels of new supply as these markets develop . <p> Reported revenue increased 3% ( 3% CER ) to $242m driven by fee revenue up 9.5% , and operating profit was up 9% ( 10% CER ) to $89m . Managed profit was up 24% to $63m , reflecting improvements in operating margin , 15% net room growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5m to EBIT . This was partially offset by performance of our owned InterContinental hotel in Hong Kong where operating profit fell $5m , due to the continuing redevelopment of the area adjacent to the hotel and protests in central Hong Kong . <p> We opened our 50th Holiday Inn Express hotel in 2014 and with 50 more in the pipeline , Holiday Inn Express is the largest international limited service brand in China . In February 2015 , we opened our first hotel for the HUALUXE Hotels and Resorts brand , which is based on four key priorities that Chinese guests want and that IHG identified through an in depth Chinese consumer insights study . <p> 2015 : <p> We will invest a further $5m into regional overheads in our China business in 2015 , particularly for the training and development of the highly skilled workforce needed to deliver our service commitment at our hotels , thereby allowing us to outperform for our owners , and grow our share of new hotels being developed . <p> Gross capex guidance remains unchanged at up to $350m per annum into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders in 2014 <p> Final dividend increase proposed of 11% to 52 , which equates to a full year dividend of 77 , up 10% , reflecting the cash generative nature of our business model . <p> $763m returned to shareholders in July via $2.93 per share special dividend with 12 for 13 share consolidation and $500m share buyback programme completed , with 3.4m shares repurchased for $110m in the first half . <p> Efficient balance sheet provides flexibility <p> Year-end net debt of $1,533m ( including $218m finance lease on InterContinental Boston ) is up $380m on 2013 due to the return of funds to shareholders , partially offset by proceeds from asset disposals . <p> Year-end borrowings position represents a net debt / EBITDA ratio of 2.1x , 2.6x on a pro forma basis including the $430m acquisition of Kimpton in January 2015 . <p> Foreign exchange volatile currency markets impact reported profit <p> Foreign exchange movements impacted 2014 reported profit by approximately $9m ; underlying1 operating profit of $648m would have been $639m at actual 2014 exchange rates . This was driven by a weakening of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced reported revenue , whilst the British pound appreciated in the first half increasing reported overheads . <p> Currency markets have been volatile in recent months with a significant strengthening of the US dollar , and we expect foreign exchange to have a continued impact on 2015 reported profit .

Recent changes to the Venezuelan exchange rate had an unfavourable impact on managed operating profit of approximately $2m , with a further $2m impact expected in the second half . <p> We opened 9k rooms ( 74 hotels ) in the half , including the first two properties for our new EVEN Hotels brand . Signings of 19k rooms ( 158 hotels ) are up 25% year on year2 , as the hotel debt financing environment continues to improve , and included over 100 hotels ( 12k rooms ) for the Holiday Inn brand family .

The continuing political unrest in Thailand is expected to have a $2m impact on managed operating profit in the second half of the year .

InterContinental Hong Kong , our only owned hotel in the region , reported a $3m decrease in revenue to $66m and a $3m decrease in operating profit to $19m due to the continuing impact from the significant redevelopment of the area adjacent to the hotel ; this is expected to continue into the second half . <p> We opened 4k rooms ( 9 hotels ) in the half , including five Crowne Plaza hotels , taking our system size for the brand in the region to 25k rooms .

Openings of 430 hotels ( 59,353 rooms ) reflected , in particular , continued expansion in the US , the UK , the Middle East and China . <p> At the end of 2008 , the IHG pipeline totalled 1,775 hotels ( 245,085 rooms ) . In the year , room signings of 98,886 rooms led to pipeline growth of 19,213 rooms .

Excluding this , revenue decreased by 0.6% to $155m and operating profit fell by $3m to $38m . Growth remained strong in the Latin America region , where rate-led RevPAR growth exceeded 15% . Offsetting this was a fall in revenues from hotels in the US , driven by RevPAR declines in the fourth quarter . <p> The franchised results in the Americas benefited from increased royalty fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , fees associated with signings and conversions declined as a result of lower real estate activity , due to the adverse impact of the global financial crisis , and lower liquidated damages collected on hotels exiting the system . <p> In EMEA , revenue and operating profit* from continuing operations increased by 5.3% to $518m and 27.6% to $171m respectively . During the year , the region achieved RevPAR growth of 3.6% driven by gains across all brands operated under managed and franchise contracts . <p> In the owned and leased estate , continuing revenue decreased by 1.6% to $240m .

Operating profit increased by 19.6% to $55m as revenue gains were partially offset by continued infrastructure investment in China and Southern Asia . <p> Franchised revenues increased from $16m to $18m driven by the receipt of $4m of liquidated damages .

Steve was an outstanding executive and a great colleague , and our thoughts are with his family . Our Group Finance Director Richard Solomons is now in place as interim President of the region , in addition to his current role .

In the half we hit the target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60,000 rooms on a net basis by the end of 2008 . This is a big milestone and we have passed it six months early . Growth looks set to continue as we have been signing two hotels a day into our development pipeline , which now stands at almost 1,800 hotels . The $1 billion relaunch of Holiday Inn is progressing well and early feedback from our franchisees and our guests is encouraging . <p> " Over the last three years we have worked hard to strengthen the foundations of the business through investment in our brands , technology , reservation systems , loyalty programme and our people . This investment not only drives our room growth , but helps us outperform during times of economic uncertainty . Generally RevPAR growth slowed through the second quarter , and market conditions have become more challenging , particularly in the US . However , the long term trends for the travel industry remain positive and our broad portfolio of brands and fee based business model positions us well to take full advantage of this. <h> Rooms : record openings and pipeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first half . InterContinental signings of 4,407 rooms ( 12 hotels ) took its pipeline to 21,284 rooms ( 67 hotels ) , triple its size when the brand was relaunched in 2004. 45,034 rooms ( 365 hotels ) have been signed into the Holiday Inn brand family since its relaunch was announced in October 2007 . Of these , 24,327 rooms ( 203 hotels ) were signed in the first half , taking the Holiday Inn brand family pipeline to 133,038 rooms ( 1,121 hotels ) . <p> The pipeline of rooms now stands at 242,349 ( 1,788 hotels ) , with each brand at record levels . The pipeline outside the Americas now stands at 91,150 rooms ( 359 hotels ) , 38% of the total pipeline . <p> 23,729 rooms were added to the system and 10,658 were removed in line with IHGs strategy of driving quality growth . This gave 13,071 net room additions for the first half , 76% ( 5,641 rooms ) more than in the first half of 2007 . <h> Americas : continued growth in a more challenging market <h> Revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset by strong rate growth .

US RevPAR was up 8.4% , including rate growth of 2.0% . <p> Revenue increased 9% to $194m and operating profit increased 35% to $97m . After adjusting for the owned hotel disposals in 2010 and excluding the impact of a $10m liquidated damages receipt in the managed business in 2011 , revenue was up 9% and operating profit up 23% primarily driven by an 11% increase in franchise royalties . A $3m decline in regional costs was due to timing of costs related to our self-insured healthcare benefit plan . <p> We signed 6,059 rooms ( 50 hotels ) in the first quarter . This was almost 1,300 rooms more than the same period in 2010 , driven by Holiday Inn signings , demonstrating the continuing benefits of the relaunch . 11,812 rooms ( 42 hotels ) were opened into the system , including 6,986 rooms at the Las Vegas Sands Venetian and Palazzo InterContinental Alliance Resorts , and the 513 room Holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> EMEA continued strength in signings <p> RevPAR increased 3.0% , including rate growth of 1.6% .

We will achieve this by further strengthening our existing brands , launching new brands and ensuring our hotels are known for industry-leading guest experiences delivered by talented people and best-in-class delivery systems . The global economy remained uncertain throughout 2011 , but the strength of IHGs preferred brands , underpinned by our global systems and scale , drove good growth in revenue and operating profits . <p> One of my immediate priorities on being appointed Chief Executive was to ensure that IHG was optimally structured to derive maximum benefit from our scale and expertise in each geographic region .

We will use our powerful revenue systems and innovations to drive growing revenues into IHG branded hotels . We will also add new and rebranded hotels to our system . In 2011 we delivered 6.2 per cent global RevPAR growth , beating the industry in key markets , such as the US and Greater China . We grew our system size by two per cent in the year and our industry-leading 13 per cent of the active new-build global pipeline demonstrates our ability to continue to increase our share of room supply . <p> We will achieve progressive and sustainable margin growth and higher returns for owners by capitalising on benefits of scale and efficiency .

Preferred brands <p> In a competitive world , preferred brands are a prerequisite to deliver market share growth . Our brands are already some of the best recognised in the industry , but in order to drive meaningful increases in share , we have to make them work harder . <p> The Holiday Inn relaunch continues to drive results for both IHG and our owners . In 2011 , the brand once again grew its industry segment premium and for the first time ever was awarded Highest in Guest Satisfaction among Mid-Scale Full Service Hotel Chains in the coveted J.D.

Crowne Plaza has been a great success story for IHG and is already the worlds fourth largest full-service upscale hotel brand , generating $3.9 billion in total gross revenues per annum . It does suffer from some inconsistencies , however , especially in North America , and a three-phase , multi-year programme will address this , raising all Crowne Plaza hotels to the same standard around the world . <p> We also see the opportunity to leverage the value of the IHG family of brands through select partnerships . The first InterContinental Alliance Resort opened during 2011 , we continue to expand Holiday Inn Club Vacations and we entered into a joint venture to launch the Holiday Inn Express brand in India . <p> In 2012 we will launch two new brands to exploit untapped profitable market segments , in the midscale segment in the US and in the upper upscale segment in China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners in relation to these new brands and are very excited about the opportunities they will bring . <h> 2 . Talented people <p> Our brands represent a promise to our guests . It is our people who deliver that promise and bring each brand to life . So aligning all 345,000 people working in our hotels and corporate offices around the world as brand ambassadors is critical to our success . <p> We need our people to deliver consistent brand experiences to our guests which requires significant effort and innovation and the engagement of our third-party hotel owners . This is a big task but we have made great progress over the past few years with an innovative and effective approach . We have launched our suite of People Tools which help our owners and managers to hire , train , involve and recognise the best employees for their brands , and more recently piloted a unique approach to revitalise the back of house space in our hotels . <p> Our efforts in this area have been rewarded and for the first time IHG has been placed in Fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as winning a host of other awards . <h> 3 . Best-in-class delivery <p> We continue to leverage our global scale and the power of our systems to drive a greater share of industry demand into our hotels . We do this by ensuring our distribution channels are aligned with the needs of our guests , whilst driving the most profitable revenues for our owners . In 2011 , 69 per cent of total rooms revenue was booked through IHGs channels or direct to hotels by our 63 million Priority Club Rewards members . <p> Our innovations continue to lead the industry . During the year we introduced our Best Price Guarantee , designed to drive more guests to book through our direct websites .

@@24976005 @4976005/ <p> Research also finds that guests from emerging markets are travelling more than their developed market counterparts , and have the highest expectations for hotels to deliver personalised experiences <p> A new report published today by InterContinental Hotels Group ( IHG ) , Creating Moments of Trust the key to building successful brand relationships in the Kinship Economy , suggests that to win guest loyalty in the future , hotels need to deliver a global , local and personalised experience . The research also shows that personalised brand experiences which resonate with the local culture are particularly important for the fast-growing number of international travellers from emerging markets . <p> The collision of these three dimensions , accelerated by the rapid rise of technology-enabled personalisation in recent years , is changing the experience guests expect when they travel . Hotel brands that are able to become truly " 3D " by delivering localised and personalised experiences through trusted global brands - will build the trust that is needed to sustain lasting relationships with guests and outperform in the future . <p> Last year , IHG published : The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brand relationships in the hospitality sector .

Hotel brands have traditionally concentrated on being 2D how to be both global and local . But our research shows that the rise of personalisation means brands must be 3D in order to build both trust and lasting relationships with guests and to win in a highly competitive global market . <p> " We know that our guests trust IHGs global brands to deliver on a promise of quality and consistency time and time again .

" <p> The report , surveying more than 7,000 international travellers , shows that over the last 12 months , emerging market travellers have been travelling more frequently than their developed market counterparts . Whilst they are more likely to look to a global brand for an assurance of quality , emerging market travellers are also more likely to make choices based on differences between hotel chains . This group prize personalisation and fit with local culture most highly of those surveyed . These trends point to the importance of trusted global brands being able to deliver the combination of localised , personalised experiences . The report also shows that initiatives that allow guests to create their own experiences through technology are equally important , particularly to the Millennial Laptop and Latte business traveller group which has the most trust in global brands to be innovative . <p> IHG is already addressing the growing consumer demand for 3D brands in a number of ways . Two examples include the development of our two newest hotel brands : HUALUXE Hotels &amp; Resorts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and EVEN Hotels , the first mainstream holistic wellness hotel brand . These new brand launches build on IHGs existing focus on delivering a higher degree of localisation and personalisation across our portfolio of trusted global brands . <p> Findings in the report include : <p> Global : Travellers think that global hotel brands do a better job than local hotel brands on several dimensions , including safety and consistency . Travellers also expect global brands to do a better job at offering the most innovative features and services . This is especially true for the younger generation of business travellers - 75% of the Millennial ' Laptop and Latte ' business travellers ( a new traveller group IHG identified in last year 's Kinship Economy Report ) think that global hotel brands do a better job of being innovative compared to 66% of all travellers . <p> Local : Travellers now expect global brands to be relevant in terms of local tastes , customs and cultures .
