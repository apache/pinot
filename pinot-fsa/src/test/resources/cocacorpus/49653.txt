There have been many people and organizations that have made my time at college incredible , but one experience stands out for me as I enter the real world in less than a year - my experience as a student employee at my campus bookstore . To incoming freshmen or students who want to make some money and develop great communication skills , I highly recommend working at your campus bookstore . Here are the 5 reasons to apply to work at your campus bookstore : <h> 1 . Develop real-world skills and have something on your resume you can talk about ! <p> From being on both sides of the interview process for many roles , I have seen the value that work experience provides in the conversation . In past interviews , the individual has commented on their appreciation for my work experience at the bookstore or holding a job throughout my college career . As a student employee , you not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you also learn other skills like time management , interpersonal and conflict resolution communication skills . There are also times that the projects you could be working on at the bookstore could also have the potential to relate directly to the career path you are looking to take . <h> 2 . Make connections with other students , parents , alumni and members of the community <p> Every time I talk to a student about why they like working at their campus store , I hear the same thing : the interactions with the customer and serving as an ambassador for their campus . Often times , the bookstore is the first interaction or impression that a prospective student has of an institution . Students , parents , alumni and members of the community all come into the store with different questions and needs . It is always awesome to tell a parent about your major , listen to stories about campus from alumni-parents , and help new students find their course materials . You begin to gain a deeper appreciation for your school and all that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an understanding of the world of textbooks <p> Textbooks are notoriously expensive . I know the feeling of swiping your savings account ( the money you had saved because you were hoping to use it for spring break ) to spend on hundreds of dollars of textbooks . Also , a huge fear students have is getting to class and having the wrong book or edition . By working at your campus store , you can learn the ins and outs of the world of textbooks to better assist customers , too . You learn why textbooks are so expensive and find ways to save money . You learn about the different ways you can purchase your own course materials ( new , used , or digital ) , too , helping you to make informed purchases .

I even met one of my sophomore year roommates from working at the store ! By working at your campus bookstore , you will get to meet other students outside of your dorm , student organization , or friend group . These are the people you will talk to after you get to work after a long day and the people who will pump you up to ace an exam after your shift ! Not only are the student employees great , but you will interact with the awesome full-time staff . I know that the relationships I have built with my adult co-workers are ones I will treasure for years to come . I stop by my store whenever I am around campus ! <h> 5 . Be one step ahead in knowing what is happening on campus and what is coming to the store <p> The bookstore is often a central hub of any campus . Stores often work in conjunction with other departments on campus to host events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can be in the known about these events and promotions . You can always be one step ahead of your peers in picking up the coolest new spirit wear or technology release .

By working at the bookstore , I scored a great deal on a Bluetooth speak because I knew when a great promotion was happening and bought a cool sweatshirt with my university logo before it sold out ! <p> - <h> Lauren is a student at Miami University of Ohio who is a Business Development Intern at RedShelf.

@@40595310 @595310/ <h> Blog <p> With social media being more prominent than ever before , it is important for college campuses to not only be involved , but also to engage with users campus-wide . Take a look at these 8 ways for your college campus to utilize social media and rock at it ! <h> 1 . Coordinate your strategy across campus <p> Ensure that social media managers have strong relationships with numerous departments across campus . This constant communication will help social media management and therefore reinforce the strategy to be unified whole across campus . Within social media management , it is also important to continue the cross-communication and dialogue between all interested parties . For example , if a high school freshman student is excited to apply for admission in a few years , it would be imperative for that social media manager to alert the admissions office that there is a particular enthusiastic student that made an inquiry through one of the social platforms . It is important for the social media management team to mine these conversations that might already be taking place and proactively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 2 . Choose what suits you <p> There are hundreds of social media platforms out there ! But this does n't mean that your school needs to have a presence on every single one of them . Quality over quantity is always the best case scenario . Decide what outlets make sense for your audience and your brand , and then be present there ! Since you already developed your strategy , you have a pretty good idea of what platforms will help you tackle your goals for social media ! <h> 3 . Get students involved <p> Students are the lifeblood of many academic institutions ; use them ! The student body should be an integral part of the school 's social media strategy , and what better way to utilize it than by giving the students the ability to foster their own skills and ideas through the use of social media . There are numerous ways to get students involved in a school 's social strategy . For example , allow students to showcase their own school spirit by live-tweeting at campus events or interviewing alumni to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy , it could lead to more traction and engagement across campus ! <h> 4 . Get the " big guns " on social ! <p> While this may sound like an outlandish idea , the truth is that many University presidents and/or chancellor 's have social media accounts and use them effectively ! This potential tone of transparency signals to the student body a genuine interest in communicating with the campus community as a whole . For example , the President at Amherst Colleges , Biddy Martin , tweets to more than 6,000 followers about campus events and frequently responds to comments and other questions from the community . <h> 5 . Blog ( duh ! ) <p> While a blog focuses a bit more on content , it is a great way to be a venue for topics that would interest your community . A blog serves multiple purposes and the content can be aimed at a variety of audiences , even prospective students , for example ! <h> 6 . Get creative <p> Want to increase your social media presence on campus ? Get everyone involved ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poll your audience , and reach your student body . Not only will you receive tons of feedback from your target audience , but you will also be able to tap into these tools and utilize the engagement as resources for the future . <h> 7 . Enhance your brand <p> Bring brand awareness to your campus and get your student body 's heart beating for their college or university . Pictures are social media gold so keep that in mind when curating content to post on your platforms . Your students may have chosen to attend your college or university , but it will be important for the social media management team to find new ways to enhance and grow brand loyalty to further its voice . <h> 8 . Be a place to connect <p> An important measure of a school 's success with social media is whether its students and alumni can use the school 's various social platforms to connect with each other .

These innovations are central to most historical narratives , including the development of social complexity , the rise of the state , the role of the steppe horseman , the spread of gunpowder , the rise of the west , the bureaucratization of military institutions , the industrial revolution and the rise of firepower , strategic bombing and nuclear weapons , and the creation of " people 's war .

@@40595350 @595350/ 66413 @qwx476413 <p> Practically Speaking aims to address four key objectives for students : 1 ) readability , 2 ) clarity , 3 ) applicability , and 4 ) affordability . Regarding the first **27;347;TOOLONG wisdom of Samuel Johnson seems apt : " What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure . " Maximum effort has been devoted to writing a textbook that might ignite the interest of student readers , not induce a coma . Textbooks are not meant to read like Stephen King novels , but they do not need to be a horror by reading like an instruction manual for setting up your new flat-screen TV . Consequently , I attempted to practice what I teach about gaining and maintaining attention by using the attention strategies discussed in Chapter 5 . There are novel and humorous examples , stories , quotations , photos , and cartoons ; intense , dramatic , and poignant illustrations ; colorful and vivid language and metaphors ; startling statistics and historical facts sprinkled throughout every chapter . The writing style is conversational and the perpendicular pronoun " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more engaging than impersonal references such as " this author experienced " or " a student in the author 's class . " In addition , second-person pronoun references to " you " are employed frequently to address readers directly.A second objective--clarity--is addressed in a variety of ways . The organization of each chapter follows the rules of good organizational logic presented in Chapter 7 . Such logic can be examined by perusing the Table of Contents . In addition , headings and subheadings are carefully chosen and worded to produce maximum clarity as well as originality . Finally , copious illustrations and explanations are provided to clarify all important public speaking concepts and processes.A third **34;376;TOOLONG concerted effort to demonstrate the practical utility for students of becoming competent public speakers . The first chapter addresses in detail such applicability . The remaining chapters elaborate on this important objective . Numerous pop culture references and newsworthy events are used as illustrations , further revealing the applicability of competent public speaking for students.A fourth **29;412;TOOLONG become a national issue shared by students and faculty alike . A 2012 Oxford University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at U. S. universities and community colleges revealed that almost 75% of respondents viewed price as an " extremely or very important " feature of a public speaking text . I am a longtime member of the bookstore/textbook committee on my campus that strives to find ways to make textbooks more affordable for students . Every effort has been exerted to make Practically Speaking an attractive but affordable alternative to other much more expensive choices . Oxford University Press is a non-profit publishing company , so this alone provides considerable price advantage for students surviving on tight budgets . The lean size of Practically Speaking also helps reduce the price . <p> Practically Speaking aims to address six different objectives for teachers of public speaking : 1 ) sound scholarship , 2 ) standard yet innovative coverage , 3 ) brevity , 4 ) recency , 5 ) logical organization , and 6 ) useful ancillaries . The first objective , sound scholarship , is critically important . Providing substantial theory and research to bolster the advice offered to novice student speakers counters the oft-heard , naive claim that public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory and research , advice provided will appear as little more than the personal opinion of the author , easily trivialized or ignored and often at odds with the opinions of others . It is bound to strike the more alert student readers that authors who insist on inclusion of research and evidence for student speeches but include little research and evidence to support their advice offered in a textbook seem contradictory . We never want students to equate relatively short texts such as Practically Speaking with being " lightweight " or insubstantial . The careful scholarship in Practically Speaking is evident in every chapter . More than 500 references are cited and the communication competence model , carefully developed in Chapter 1 , serves as the theoretical basis for all advice offered . In addition , Chapter 9 on skepticism is the only chapter of its kind in public speaking texts that so thoroughly explains the theoretical underpinnings of critical thinking for public speakers.A second objective for public speaking teachers--standard yet innovative coverage--is addressed in several ways . All standard topics found in any reputable public speaking text and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Practically Speaking . Innovative coverage includes the opening chapter on communication competence . There is a separate chapter on speech anxiety , offered in only a few public speaking texts . A full chapter on gaining and maintaining attention , not typically found in other public speaking texts , emphasizes that speakers must do far more than merely gain immediate attention of their audiences . The much greater challenge is to keep that attention throughout a lengthy speech . A full chapter on skepticism , already mentioned , is yet another innovation of Practically Speaking . Finally , two full chapters on persuasive speaking provide both a theoretical explanation for how persuasion works generally and specific strategies for persuading public speaking audiences . Results from the Oxford survey showed that three-quarters of respondents believed that a chapter on foundations of persuasion is " extremely or very important . " A chapter on persuasive speaking strategies was similarly embraced by 85% of respondents.A third objective--brevity--was identified by 72% of respondents to the Oxford survey as variously " important " to " extremely important . " A significant 85% of respondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start speaking right away " is important . In standard , lengthy texts , students have to read hundreds of pages before they learn the basics for a simple first or second speech . Standard texts typically do not cover introductions and conclusions , for example , until almost 200 pages of text have been read . Students will have read the bulk of Practically Speaking when they reach 200 pages . Practically Speaking gets students " up and running " quickly . Another related concern in the Oxford survey identified by almost half the respondents was that students do not read the text . Reading a textbook of 500 pages or more can be daunting . Practically Speaking is about half the size of most standard-sized public speaking texts . Its brevity is far less intimidating and more likely to be read.A fourth objective--recency--is always a challenge because of the lag period between finishing a manuscript and completing the textbook production process that typically takes months . As someone with a Bachelors degree in American history , I value the use of historical examples for illustrations . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and processes in public speaking . I have included both , some examples as recent as 2013 and others centuries old . Great speakers and powerfully illustrative events do not occur in only one brief time period . We can learn from both the old and the new . This is true for references as well . About half of the more than 500 references are between 2008 and 2013 while many of the rest are more " classic " citations.A fifth objective--logical organization--produced some juggling of chapters . There is no perfect organization for any public speaking text . Practically Speaking is organized similar to most such texts . Several reviewers of Practically Speaking , however , suggested moving the chapter on delivery to early in the text . Their advice and rationale seemed cogent . Delivery is an immediate concern of students when they give their first speech . Addressing this concern early seems warranted . Consequently , the delivery chapter was moved from Chapter 13 to Chapter 3 . Likewise , speech anxiety is addressed very early in Chapter 2 because it is an immediate and significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication competence , all chapters can be moved to a different order if so desired.A final objective--useful ancillaries--is addressed in several ways . An instructors ' manual accompanies Practically Speaking . Dozens of activities and assignments are provided to supplement what most teachers already use . A test bank is provided . A glossary of key terms is also included at the end of the text . Videos of student sample speeches are an additional ancillary .

In doing so , we wanted to provide you with some tips to market your bookstore to college students so that they keep coming back for more ! <h> 1 . Be where they are <p> Millennials are a highly social audience , and use digital more than ever before . It is crucial for you to be where they are , and communicate with them in the ways they are used to communicating with retail and brands likes yours . Social media platforms are a great start . Ensure that you have an active presence on the platforms your students are already using to communicate with each other , like Facebook , Twitter , or Instagram .

Provide them a free lunch , or hold a raffle for some must-have items within the store . Students will definitely flock to the store if they are feeling luck enough for a chance to win . And it 's a great way to showcase some of the new items in the store , or any major sales taking place . <h> 3 . Unique is key ! <p> Stock up on cool and unique products for your audience and be ahead of the trends ! Take notice in what your student body is wishing for , or talking about .

Create an inviting space <p> With so many areas on campus vying for the students attention , make sure to make your bookstore an inviting place and one they want to continue to visit throughout the year . You can decorate with your school 's colors , play trendy radio stations , or entice them with something that makes them curious to stop in the store . For example , make your store a winter wonderland during the colder months , or get spooky for Halloween .

Be sure not to forget about those that commute to school or those that live in off-campus housing . Find ways to attract them to the store , and provide spaces for them to sit and stay awhile , before heading off for home . <h> 8 . Utilize your student workers <p> There is no better way to appeal to your target audience than by going to the source itself , beginning with your student workers !

It is difficult for many students to master basic concepts in computer science and programming . A large portion of the confusion can be blamed on the complexity of the tools and materials that are traditionally used to teach CS1 and CS2 . This textbook was written with a single overarching goal : to present the core concepts of computer science as simply as possible without being simplistic.Perhaps the greatest source of complexity in introductory CS courses is the use of traditional systems languages such as C++ and Java . These languages evolved to solve problems that arise in large-scale programming where the primary emphasis is on structure and discipline . They were not designed to make writing small or medium-scale programs easy . The recent rise in popularity ( in industry , if not necessarily in academia ) of scripting languages , such Python , suggests an alternative . Python is flexible and makes experimentation easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Python is a great laboratory for the neophyte programmer.Python is a natural choice as a first programming language because its basic structures are very clean and well-designed .
