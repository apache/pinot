Tactical Gaming was represented by Xbox One competitive squad , - TG Chesapeake- and- I had the pleasure of speaking to TG Clammie who led the squad in the tournament . <p> NT : Hi Clammie , how are you ? - Can you give me an overview of what the event was about ? <p> TG Clammie : - The Grinders event was a competitive 4v4 MLG variant tournament consisting of the top amateur teams in the community . ProWGL was the host of this tournament . It basically lasted two weeks , from November 10th until November 25th . The tournament- did not consist of a bracket , but had a maximum of 60 matches that you could play . You gained a certain amount of points per win and a small amount for every lost . Who ever had the most points by midnight on November 25th won and the top 15 teams got paid . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grind out a lot of matches to make it up to 60 within two weeks , which is a very short amount of time . <p> NT : - Who did you compete in this tournament with ? <p> TG Clammie : - I ( TG Clammie ) competed with the rest of my squad , TG Chesapeake , which includes : TG Distinct , UpscaleTie , and o L00NEY who joined us in the middle of the tournament . Considering we were only three players for a good amount of time during the tournament , we at times played with a few other members in TG , such as : TG Toxicity and RackCrackem . It was necessary to do so , considering we had to grind as many matches as possible during this two week period . <p> - NT : - How did you perform ? <p> TG Clammie : - We landed top 30 out of 50-60 teams . Overall it was a very mediocre placement , definitely not the best we could have done . <p> NT : - Would you do this again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournament like this in December but we decided not to participate in it to make sure that we could get the roster issues under control and get more practice . On another note , we are looking to participate in the upcoming Call of Duty Championship . The qualifiers are February 7th and 8th . Wish us ( TG Chesapeake ) good luck ! <p> NT : - Did you expect a better placing ? <p> TG Clammie : - Yes of course I did . I expected us to land in the top 15 but roster issues made that difficult . Every night we picked up someone new which we all had to adapt to each others game-play on the spot . This made it difficult to consistently beat other top amateur teams . <p> NT : - Was the tournament good ? <p> TG Clammie : - Yes it was definitely a learning tool at the very beginning of Advanced Warfare . It helped us discover areas that we needed to work on in the future to improve as a team . <p> For anymore information or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to give us a follow on twitter ! @TGChesapeake <p> Here is some gameplay videos from Chesapeake <p> Well Done to Chesapeake for playing and Good Luck in the CoD Championship Qualifiers if you play . <p> The beta for Battlefield Hardline releases tomorrow and with that means that you might want to know and understand a few things first .

Im Dominique , A.K.A. niqniq935 . That 's pronounced neek-neek = I started out in Defiance back in March 2013 and stayed until they closed down , from there I transferred to Halo until Grand Theft Auto was opened and became the Executive Officer of PS3/1st Battalion over there . Then onto MineCraft where I was the BGC for a bit but that did n't  work out to well so I 'm here now . So , a little bit about me , I 'm 17 years of age and my favorite things to do are game , karate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background is Jamaican . I 'm going into my Senior year of high school and hopefully , I get into my dream school , The University of Pennsylvania . <p> divider <p> NT : The day you got recruited/joined what was going through your mind and what feelings/emotions did you have ? <p> niqniq935 : - Well I was recruited through the Defiance forums . I had saw a commercial about the game so I googled it , WrathfulBadger , who is n't in TG anymore , had made a post about TG on the forums and it popped up . I read through it and thought ah , why not ? . My main platforms are SONY consoles so I joined the PS3 Brigade . I signed up and was so excited for my first practice . <p> divider <p> NT : From your first day in TG till now what has it been like and did you enjoy your time here so far ? <p> niqniq935 : - My first day in TG was completely hilarious . I joined on a practice day so I got in practice and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Malvee ) , a member who HDed not too long ago . We had tons of fun . Then people just started disappearing left and right so I stepped up as SA and then SL of the ST squad in DF/PS3/1st . I set up recruitment nights and was constantly hitting the forums to try and get more members but the game failed because of lack of support from the developers . When I went onto the Halo division , it was alright , it was a little more formal than I was used to so I had to tone down . GTA was completely nuts lol , its a destructive game so yes practices were organized but there was so much goofing off , it was so fun . Now in TF , everything is a blast . As a member of CoC , I have paperwork but its necessary for the smooth running of the division , so I 'm not too daunted by it . Overall , my time in TG so far has been a whole lot of fun and I 've met a lot of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to achieve within TG ? <p> niqniq935 : - Well I 've only been here for a year , but I 've moved up fast . I want to go up to a DO but I do n't  think I 'd want to go any higher , I like the interaction with members too much . <p> divider <p> NT : Which member(s) have been a big help or a big influence / motivator so far in TG for you ? <p> niqniq935 : - Malvee/Hollywood X and TG Robin . They motivated me to step up as SS in Defiance . Even though the division failed trial phase , we tried our hardest to get it going . Next would be Lad , the current MINE DO . As XO over in GTA , he helped me better develop my leadership skills and also pushed me to do my best . I really do look up to him as one of the best members of CoC I 've worked with . When I went to MINE , he gave me a chance as BGC but sadly there was n't enough interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked with him for about 3 months , he s great as well . He s a great guy , he s helpful and easy to approach . Thanks guys . <p> divider <p> NT : What 's some things you like about TG and really respect on how it is done ? <p> niqniq935 : - TG is the first and only clan Ive been in , so I 'm not too experienced on how other clans do things but TGs structure really is A1 . It allows everything to run pretty smoothly but at the same time TG has a familial and communal feel to it . Yes , it has rules but that does n't  mean you cant interact and joke around with your CoC during practice . <p> divider <p> NT : What tips would you give to people wanting to be a successful Squad Staff/Battalion Staff ? <p> niqniq935 : - Volunteer to step up during practices is the first step . Your CoC has to see that you have the initiative to step up and be a leader in some aspect . When you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your complete 100% . Then go above and give that extra 50% that shows you go past your normal duties and are an asset to the battalion . <p> divider <p> NT : What division would you like to see in TG that is not in TG now ? <p> niqniq935 : - d like to see Destiny and The Division as divisions in TG . Both games have great potential and already have a lot of TG members interested . <p> divider <p> NT : Where did you find out about TG ? <p> niqniq935 : - The Defiance forums . Post number 7 . I was one of those people who completed the BC as soon as possible , I really was that excited . <p> divider <p> NT : What are some tips/advice you think you could give to just-joined members going into there IN squads ? <p> niqniq935 : - Even though you many want to get out and head into competition and such right away , IN has a purpose .

And so the greater chance you guys have at winning matches .

I was playing some CoD:MW3 in pubs and Mr. 246 ( James 246 ) found me and sent me a message if I was interested in joining TG . At first I had to think about it , as I had only ever been in one clan before ( a HALO clan forget the name ) . It took a few days and constant persistence from James to get me to join . I signed and and proceeded with Boot Camp . At first I was like wow a test really , but as I read through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , maturity , respect ) . It took me two attempts to get through Boot Camp , but it was worth it . <p> divider <p> NT : From your first day in TG till now what has it been like and did you enjoy your time here so far ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - My first day/practice in TG I did not attend ( not sure why ) , and the second practice I also missed ( family commitments ) unfortunately this was my first and only AWOL I received ( thanks Bob2232 ) . However when I did finally attend I loved it . It was back in Kokoda ( IS ) on Hardhat and we were going through callouts and man that was fun . I knew from my first practice that I was going to be here for the long run . Fast forward a few months and I was Squad Assistant ( SA ) of Kokoda , and man did I love running and training the new recruits into TG . Fast forward a few more months and I was SL now , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ( thanks to Ravenhaven and Oilad for giving me the opportunity = ) My next big promotion was n't until I sadly left the CoD Division to Defiance where I became Executive Officer ( XO ) of Defiance in no time ( thanks Koston for giving me a chance at BTN Staff ) , and my number one goal was to do whatever it would take to make Defiance pass trial phase ( which resulted me going on a mass recruitment spree ( approx 70 recruits ) , but sadly this was short lived due to the Division failing . Now back to CoD , this time a SA of Narva ( ST ) ( my first chance to lead a structured competitive team ) . Fast forward a few months and at last I was XO once again , and man I was grateful for the position ( thanks to Ravenhaven and Pain ) . I knew I would make them proud and support Pain ( CO ) with whatever he needed . It was also around this time I got accepted into WT ( Graphics ) ( thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be in my WT position today : ) . Fast forward a few months and sadly CoD : Ghosts ruined CoD for me , so I decided to jump ship and give Titanfall a go , and fast forward a few more months and now I am where I sit today , leading Titanfall PC and the Graphics Team ( thanks James , and Prof for giving me the opportunity to show you what I can do ) , and doing what ever it takes to make them work , most importantly for my members to enjoy Titanfall , and become a family ( just like TG ) . <p> divider <p> NT : What else do you want to achieve within TG ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Honestly I achieved what I set out to . I currently hold a BGC position which I will do to the best of my ability and what it takes , as well as am a leader for the Graphics Team ( which I never saw coming ) . If another opportunity arises and I know that I can be a beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for now I am happy where I sit , and am grateful for the opportunity you all have given me . <p> divider <p> NT : Which member(s) have been a big help or a big influence / motivator so far in TG for you ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Man this is a hard one as there is too many to name , but I will do my best ( apologies if I did n't  name you ) . First it has to be Mr. 246 ( James 246 ) himself . From day one I have looked up to you . Your leadership , recruitment skills and friendliness are what I have aspired to achieved ( and for some I think I have out mastered ; ) ) . He has been one of my main motivators in TG since day one and still is . Thanks James for all you have done : ) . Next would have to be TG Ravenhaven . Both a TG friend and a good friend in life who I know has my back , and I have his . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mentored me to become a great leader and role model . Thanks Rodney , I could not have got here without you . Now to TG-TheProfessor . Man where do I start . Your designing skills and graphics are awesome and I have always wished to be as good as you and other fellow graphic designers . Your trust in me to lead the Graphics Team is greatly appreciated and I will not fail you . Now I know I have missed a lot of you , but you all know who you are and I appreciate everyday what you have done for me . <p> divider <p> NT : What 's some things you like about TG and really respect on how it is done ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - I love the structure and overall close nit family it has . Yes from time to time the structure can be what gets in the way , but at the same time every system has its flaws . And the family friendship within TG is great . Its what a community is all about , and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity ) . Plus for those that know me those fun ( and sometimes drunk ) Skype calls we have , man these always are fun times partying up and pub stomping/recruiting all while having fun and chatting with friends ( I suggest you all give it a go , Skype calls can be very fun and enjoyable with fellow TGers ) . <p> divider <p> NT : What tips would you give to people wanting to be a successful Squad Staff/Battalion Staff ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Give it your all . Show you deserve to be in the position you are . If you lack on leadership skills , work on perfecting them . - If you really show that you deserve the position and not just carry out your duties , but go above and beyond them eventually you will be- recognised- for you hard work ( just like myself ) and- one day it will pay off- . But in all seriousness just give it your all and be what you think it takes to be in a Staff position- <p> divider <p> NT : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in TG now ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Probably Destiny . It looks like a game I would enjoy , and so would TG so I think it would great Division to have . It has great potential and hopefully can offer a game that members in TG would be keen to play . <p> divider <p> NT : Where did you find out about TG ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - I found out via a recruitment message from James246 , during a CoD:MW3 game . Before that I had only seen TG members play , but not know what it stood for , nor anything about the clan . <p> divider <p> NT : What are some tips/advice you think you could give to just-joined members going into there IN squads ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Do n't  feel scared or alienated in ( IN ) . You have as much of a right to be there as the next member . Do n't  be worried about your voice or to speak up if you do n't  understand something , this is what ( IN ) is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what TG can offer . Yes at times it may be boring , but trust me once you graduate and join a Structured Squad ( ST ) pracs will become more enjoyable and a learning curve . Give TG a go before you give up on it . Yes TG is a clan that is not for everyone , but for those that decide to stay it becomes more then just members , but a friends . <p> divider <p> Thanks for your time TGxAUSSIEPRO and good luck with whatever else you do in TG ! I know you 'll continue to do great things ! Let us know if you 'd like to see more of these in the future and leave suggestions for members below ! <p> Last week we reported on how the developers of the hugely successful game Titanfall , Respawn Entertainment , dropped CTF from the online line up for the PC version of the game . This prompted many complaints from the PC community but unlike many developers , Respawn have listened to the gamers and brought back Capture the Flag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Respawn explained the reason why the game mode was dropped . Respawn explained that the main reason the game mode had been dropped was due to the low number of players playing it and that only 1% of the player base were trying to play CTF . Due to the low amount of players , the matchmaking system was taking a long amount of time , giving players a bad experience of the game . <p> However , Respawn received many complaints from the PC community and fans of the CTF game mode . Most gamers were happy to sit and wait whilst others said Respawn needed to fix the matchmaking system to broaden the search . In a response to this , Respawn have brought back CTF and are introducing a test of wider region searches , meaning that if players have been searching for 1-5 minutes without starting a game , then the search will widen to include neighbouring continents , so players will eventually get to start a game . <p> Respawn have also announced that they are also working on features to increase visibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lobby will show " connecting " , when players are joining to avoid players already in the lobby to leave early believing that nobody is joining . <p> Finally Respawn are also adding a " last resort re-balance " to lobbies , so 6v4 will become 5v5 and players will be shuffled about to even out the skill levels . <p> This is a great move by Respawn , having feared they may lose a large portion of their gaming community , they have listened to what the players want and have acted on it . Respawn have not only brought back a game mode but have also announced the changes they are making to make the game even more enjoyable , even mentioning that they are working on new game modes to be released in the future . A good move by the developers and something other developers should take note of . <p> Are you happy CTF has returned ? What do you think about the other changes ? Let us know by commenting below .

Put in the other section of the app saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is all we need to know- <p> In this Squad Leader Spotlight , the series where we interview TG members from around the divisions , we were able to interview TGxAUSSIEPRO , TF Division / PCbde /- BGC <p> quoteHi TG , my name is Cameron Warton , A.K.A. AUSSIE PRO , the Brigade Commander for Titanfall PC . I am currently 21 years old from Sydney , Australia . I am a 2nd year Accounting student , half way through my degree . Due to my great time management skills I can set time aside each week for TG related duties , including working on graphics for both my shop , and also for WT . I am a giver in life and am happy to lend a hand where ever I can , and to a family like TG I am happy to help out wherever I can. /quote <p> divider <p> NT : The day you got recruited/joined what was going through your mind and what feelings/emotions did you have ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Honestly back in late May , 2012 I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CoD:MW3 in pubs and Mr. 246 ( James 246 ) found me and sent me a message if I was interested in joining TG . At first I had to think about it , as I had only ever been in one clan before ( a HALO clan forget the name ) . It took a few days and constant persistence from James to get me to join . I signed and and proceeded with Boot Camp . At first I was like wow a test really , but as I read through the questions I was liking TG a lot more ( structure , maturity , respect ) . It took me two attempts to get through Boot Camp , but it was worth it . <p> divider <p> NT : From your first day in TG till now what has it been like and did you enjoy your time here so far ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - My first day/practice in TG I did not attend ( not sure why ) , and the second practice I also missed ( family commitments ) unfortunately this was my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However when I did finally attend I loved it . It was back in Kokoda ( IS ) on Hardhat and we were going through callouts and man that was fun . I knew from my first practice that I was going to be here for the long run . Fast forward a few months and I was Squad Assistant ( SA ) of Kokoda , and man did I love running and training the new recruits into TG . Fast forward a few more months and I was SL now , taking on more responsibility but knew I would give it my all ( thanks to Ravenhaven and Oilad for giving me the opportunity = ) My next big promotion was n't until I sadly left the CoD Division to Defiance where I became Executive Officer ( XO ) of Defiance in no time ( thanks Koston for giving me a chance at BTN Staff ) , and my number one goal was to do whatever it would take to make Defiance pass trial phase ( which resulted me going on a mass recruitment spree ( approx 70 recruits ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division failing . Now back to CoD , this time a SA of Narva ( ST ) ( my first chance to lead a structured competitive team ) . Fast forward a few months and at last I was XO once again , and man I was grateful for the position ( thanks to Ravenhaven and Pain ) . I knew I would make them proud and support Pain ( CO ) with whatever he needed . It was also around this time I got accepted into WT ( Graphics ) ( thanks Prof for giving my the opportunity . Without it I would n't be in my WT position today : ) . Fast forward a few months and sadly CoD : Ghosts ruined CoD for me , so I decided to jump ship and give Titanfall a go , and fast forward a few more months and now I am where I sit today , leading Titanfall PC and the Graphics Team ( thanks James , and Prof for giving me the opportunity to show you what I can do ) , and doing what ever it takes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy Titanfall , and become a family ( just like TG ) . <p> divider <p> NT : What else do you want to achieve within TG ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Honestly I achieved what I set out to . I currently hold a BGC position which I will do to the best of my ability and what it takes , as well as am a leader for the Graphics Team ( which I never saw coming ) . If another opportunity arises and I know that I can be a beneficial asset filling the position I will go for it , but for now I am happy where I sit , and am grateful for the opportunity you all have given me . <p> divider <p> NT : Which member(s) have been a big help or a big influence / motivator so far in TG for you ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Man this is a hard one as there is too many to name , but I will do my best ( apologies if I did n't  name you ) . First it has to be Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have looked up to you . Your leadership , recruitment skills and friendliness are what I have aspired to achieved ( and for some I think I have out mastered ; ) ) . He has been one of my main motivators in TG since day one and still is . Thanks James for all you have done : ) . Next would have to be TG Ravenhaven . Both a TG friend and a good friend in life who I know has my back , and I have his . He has taught me many of my admin duties as well as mentored me to become a great leader and role model . Thanks Rodney , I could not have got here without you . Now to TG-TheProfessor . Man where do I start . Your designing skills and graphics are awesome and I have always wished to be as good as you and other fellow graphic designers . Your trust in me to lead the Graphics Team is greatly appreciated and I will not fail you . Now I know I have missed a lot of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate everyday what you have done for me . <p> divider <p> NT : What 's some things you like about TG and really respect on how it is done ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - I love the structure and overall close nit family it has . Yes from time to time the structure can be what gets in the way , but at the same time every system has its flaws . And the family friendship within TG is great . Its what a community is all about , and this is what I think makes TG such a great community ( unity ) . Plus for those that know me those fun ( and sometimes drunk ) Skype calls we have , man these always are fun times partying up and pub stomping/recruiting all while having fun and chatting with friends ( I suggest you all give it a go , Skype calls can be very fun and enjoyable with fellow TGers ) . <p> divider <p> NT : What tips would you give to people wanting to be a successful Squad Staff/Battalion Staff ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the position you are . If you lack on leadership skills , work on perfecting them . - If you really show that you deserve the position and not just carry out your duties , but go above and beyond them eventually you will be- recognised- for you hard work ( just like myself ) and- one day it will pay off- . But in all seriousness just give it your all and be what you think it takes to be in a Staff position- <p> divider <p> NT : What division would you like to see in TG that is not in TG now ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Probably Destiny . It looks like a game I would enjoy , and so would TG so I think it would great Division to have . It has great potential and hopefully can offer a game that members in TG would be keen to play . <p> divider <p> NT : Where did you find out about TG ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - I found out via a recruitment message from James246 , during a CoD:MW3 game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not know what it stood for , nor anything about the clan . <p> divider <p> NT : What are some tips/advice you think you could give to just-joined members going into there IN squads ? <p> TGxAUSSIEPRO : - Do n't  feel scared or alienated in ( IN ) . You have as much of a right to be there as the next member . Do n't  be worried about your voice or to speak up if you do n't  understand something , this is what ( IN ) is all about . Its a learning process and chance for you to see what TG can offer . Yes at times it may be boring , but trust me once you graduate and join a Structured Squad ( ST ) pracs will become more enjoyable and a learning curve . Give TG a go before you give up on it . Yes TG is a clan that is not for everyone , but for those that decide to stay it becomes more then just members , but a friends . <p> divider <p> Thanks for your time TGxAUSSIEPRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I know you 'll continue to do great things ! Let us know if you 'd like to see more of these in the future and leave suggestions for members below ! <p> In this Executive Officer- Spotlight , the series where we interview TG members from around the divisions , we were able to interview TG- Horizon- , CoD- Division / 360bde / 2nd /- XO <p> quoteHey guys , I 'm Horizon ( everyone calls me Andy ) and I 've been in TG for a year and a half now . I joined TG after finding a post on the Call of Duty forums , while looking for a more structured clan . My initial aim was to play competitively with other like-minded members , but after being given the opportunity to be Battalion Staff I never looked back . I 'm currently at University studying Computer Science and mainly play CoD in my spare time . /quote <p> divider <p> NT : The day you got recruited/joined what was going through your mind and what feelings/emotions did you have ? <p> TG- Horizon : - Excitement When my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never thought of how far I would get in TG , but I was excited to start playing with like-minded people who wanted to do well ! My first practice was great fun , and showed me that I 'd definitely come to the right place . Learning the rules and regs showed me that TG was organised , and playing with the people in that first practice showed me that working as a team is invaluable , and that I would n't be going anywhere anytime soon . <p> divider <p> NT : From your first day in TG till now what has it been like and did you enjoy your time here so far ? <p> TG- Horizon : - Its been great for every second Ive been in TG . The community is welcoming and friendly , and progressing up the CoC shows that people are confident in your abilities . Overall its been a learning experience , I partook in the Ranger School program for a while which really increased my leadership abilities and this has applied to real life as well as TG . TG is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . I 've made so many friends throughout my ( short ) career in TG and I 'm sure I 'll make more . <p> divider <p> NT : What else do you want to achieve within TG ? <p> TG- Horizon : - Progressing up the CoC is the standard answer here . Being in the XO position now and in the CO position before , I can say that its a great feeling to help out members and ensure that your own little section of TG is a tight unit . I 'd like to move up the CoC , taking on more responsibility and making sure that its all running smoothly , but ultimately I 'm quite happy here , having fun and meeting great new people as they filter into the division . <p> divider <p> NT : Which member(s) have been a big help or a big influence / motivator so far in TG for you ? <p> TG- Horizon : - When I first joined , TG Hoggy was the XO in CoD 360 2nd and he showed me how an XO should be . I enjoyed serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on leave recently , as he provided knowledge and support throughout my initial time in TG . <p> TG Q Meister was the person I served under for a quite a long time as XO and ran a great brigade . It was always good knowing that I had someone confident and competent above me who would help me out with no questions asked ! We made a great team , Q. <p> Finally , TG Callum , who is my current CO . We 've always been good friends and to this day Callum has shared his great knowledge and abilities with me . We work well together and I know well work well together in the future . <p> divider <p> NT : What 's some things you like about TG and really respect on how it is done ? <p> TG- Horizon : - The structure and the community . The structure ensures that everyone is mature and well-mannered , which is a refreshing thing compared to the standard CoD player nowadays ! The community will always be incredible its a collection of gamers who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> divider <p> NT : What tips would you give to people wanting to be a successful Squad Staff/Battalion Staff ? <p> TG- Horizon : - Theres never anything you cant achieve . Given time and ability , you can get the position you want . Show your leadership skills , show your confidence and show your dedication to your current role . That way , you 'll stand out as a great candidate . To be a successful member of the CoC , make sure you hold yourself to the highest standard , always striving for more . <p> divider <p> NT : What division would you like to see in TG that is not in TG now ? <p> TG- Horizon : - Probably something like World of Warcraft , although its not feasible to do . I- - think any MMORPG game allows for great teamwork in a clan like TG and would be good fun to be in , but it needs to be possible to connect to people all over the globe and not be separated by servers ! <p> divider <p> NT : Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - I was searching for a good clan to join after Black Ops 2 was released and stumbled across TG on the Call of Duty forums . I really liked the sound of the structure , signed up , and did n't  regret it for a second ! <p> divider <p> NT : What are some tips/advice you think you could give to just-joined members going into there IN squads ? <p> TG- Horizon : - Listen to your CoC and take in the information it may seem a lot at the start but its worth it in the end . Also , do n't  forget to have fun , its the whole point of playing games , enjoy yourself ! <p> divider <p> Thanks for your time TG Horizon- and good luck with whatever else you do in TG ! I know you 'll continue to do great things ! Working with you I know you will . Let us know if you 'd like to see more of these in the future and leave suggestions for members below !

I 'm starting to get a hang of the recoil pasterns and bullet spread of the guns I 've been using . The new unlock system is great .

Let us know in the comments below or on Twitter @TacticalGaming <p> Visceral Games have released the minimum and recommended PC requirements for the highly anticipated game , Battlefield Hardline , yesterday as the open beta went live . <p> The requirements are very similar to those for Battlefield 4 , which many expected after Visceral Games tweeted in January saying , " If your PC can run BF4 it shouldnt have a problem with Hardline . " <p> Battlefield Hardline will take up to 60GB hard drive space and at least 4GB RAM . Visceral have confirmed that PCs with 4GB of RAM or less may experience problems during the beta as they are still in the process of fixing the overall experience for computers with less space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to get an idea as to how each division is doing within the various divisions in the 2nd Corps . To start this off we get an overview from the Corps Commander Lt General Honest Outrage <p> " Right now in Second Corps , we are looking forward to things to come ! ! We have Battlefield Hardline due very soon , which may see some changes to the division and to Second Corps , we have DLC on its way this year for Battlefield 4 , we have some changes coming to Minecraft Division PC Brigade , which will make the Minecraft experience we offer our members and visitors to our server much , much better . Titanfall is just about to roll out their ATCs , giving all of our members the opportunity to earn themselves some nice badges for their dossiers . " <p> DoTA Division led by : TG-Tru3 <p> DoTA divisions most recent tournament was the 1v1 hosted by TG Altair , the results are as follows : <p> 1st place : TG mageck claiming a prize of any item from the DoTA 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TG FrainBreeze claiming a prize of any item from the DoTA 2 in-game store worth up to -5 <p> 3rd Place : PhazonP claiming a prize of any item from the DoTA 2 in-game store worth up to -3 <p> The Division has a lot of growth potential in the competitive scene and in the casual scene , everyone is looking forward to having fun , growing , and learning more about the game . Its a fun atmosphere where everyone is just having a good time and coming to practice . The games we play tend to be fairly casual and relaxed , but we still manage to learn from them and improve our play overall . <p> DoTA Division Spotlights <p> ImPanicking : This Staff Member has been running our 2nd Battalion Introductory squad as long as I can remember and he has been doing an incredible job . High member retention rates coupled with some extremely high levels of activity leads to him being just an absolute beast of a Staff member that we in the DoTA Division could not do without . <p> MadCore84 : Madcore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DoTA with me when we were just trying to start out a Division and he has been one of our most reliable members . At practice he is the life of the party . Helping to keep everyone in a good mood while also trying his hardest to win and improve himself . He s a member that we just are n't  going to let go of . <p> Minecraft Division led by : NotTellinU00013 <p> " We do have a recruitment team that has been growing . The Minecraft Division recruitment team have been searching for those players that want to be apart of a community . We believe that no one should have to play the game alone ! Right now we are in the process of improving our PC server to be able to offer a much more exciting environment for our squads and for the members of the public that would like to come and play on the server . - We hope to see members of TG join us .

We have grown to very large numbers , but sadly sunk to barely a squad . But none the less we have kept our strength and moved on . With the release of 3 DLCs and bonus new gamemodes , including the Co-op Frontier Defense Titanfall Division had a chance to rejuvenate ( Co-op squads , learn new maps and work as a team in protecting the harvester in Frontier Defense ) . We have kept strong , and still are , making the most of what Titanfall has to offer . Now we wait for Titanfall 2 ( 2016 ) and start all over again . " <p> Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sadly lacked the competitive edge ( MLG canned Season 2 ) , so I would love to see a competitive feel brought back into the whole Titanfall Division . So far various internal tournaments , such as the RAND ladder : I would also like to once again rejuvenate interest back into Titanfall ( late season ) once again . Titanfall has so much to offer , and we just need to remember that the possibilities are almost endless . <p> The overall majority of Titanfall members are still enjoying Titanfall and learning new skills along the way . Even with how far in the late season we are ( almost a year since release ) , Titanfall is still giving new ways to play the game , whether by ranked play , competitive matches , or just pub stomping , there is still interest in the game , and Titanfall is still giving back . <p> Titanfall Member Spotlights : <p> TG Desolator : - Since day one Desolator has been a great role model to his peers and has lead his Battalion strong .

Aussie has always looked to exceed expectation in every position he has held in TG , and in every office he has worked in .

@@75311402 @4011402/ <h> Tag Archives : XBOX One <p> Exclusives are somewhat of a rare breed . Usually publishers decide to release a game on multiple platform to gain as much revenue as possible , but sometimes there 's a one-of-a-kind moment , in which a game is born made for just one platform . This can be good or bad . Having to develop a game for just one platform is great for developers , because it gives them the opportunity to focus all their attention to one architecture . This will often turn out well for gamers too , since this often results in a more stable game . However , there are downsides to this as well . Of course , if you happen to be playing on a different platform than the game is releasing on , you cant play it . End of story . In some cases ( cough Final Fantasy ) this can also lead to repetitiveness . In this article well have a look at some of the " out there " exclusives , be it good or bad . <p> A very successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sported a trilogy , and even a 4th title , which was n't a successor to GoW 3 . Being released solely - on the Xbox 360 , this title was relying on its gory and humorous third-person action . This franchise has brought forth some of the most memorable moments in my gaming career . One of them was , I kid you not , cutting your way through a 30-foot worm , and the other was witnessing Dom killing his girlfriend who he lost a long time ago , because the Locust made her go mad . <p> Another very successful exclusive is the PS3-bound The Last of Us . This highly prized survival game gained massive amounts of compliments because of its deeply touching story . The storyline revolves around Joel , who tries to escort the little girl Ellie to a resistance group , which believes Ellie has the cure to an infection that has spread across the world . This is n't your typical zombie survival game , as the incentive relies heavily on the characters emotions and feelings . Besides the countless awards and nominations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Game of The Year award . <p> Journey is another PS3 exclusive , which features a robed human-like figure , trying to get from point A to point B. Literally . The objective of the game is to get from where you are when you start the game , to a giant mountain that lies ahead . Journey is a relatively short game , with a single playthrough spanning just a few hours , but the sheer beauty and style with which the game is created , has inspired many to play this game more than once . <p> Moving onto PC , this platform has amassed quite an impressive list of exclusives . Firstly , the classic title Age of Empires , which has quickly become a huge success . For many of us , the name alone brings up a feeling of nostalgia and memories of " the good old days " . Amnesia is another PC exclusive , that I 'm sure many feel as if they couldve done without . There 's no doubt any other exclusive could spike the sales of underwear more than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its realism , is not only a division within TG , but is also a PC exclusive . Another feature of this franchise is its large and open maps . Counter-Strike is one of the older titles in this list , but not the least unpopular . On the contrary , this game is still being played today , and with a positive amount at that . This title is most known for its incentive on tactical play and teamwork . Finally . League of Legends is the last in this select company of picked PC exclusives . This almost 4-year old RPG is n't just big , its massive. - As of January 2014 , the amount of people playing in a day is 27 million , a month is 64 million , and during peak hours , the player count hits a whopping 7,5 million players at once . <p> On the next-gen consoles there are a few exclusives as well . The first being for PS4 , namelyKillzone : Shadowfall . This futuristic and dare I say beautiful-looking first-person shooter was a launch title for the PS4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reviewed with some criticism , mainly for its linear gameplay . Other popular PS4 exclusives have surprisingly not even released yet . These two lucky few are Infamous : Second Son and The Order : 1886 . The first one is the third part in a longer-running series . Second Son shares the open world element that its predecessors had , and once again you possess superhuman powers and badass parkour skills . In The Order , you 're playing in London in the 19th century . You will view the actions from a third-person perspective , and you will weapons far more advanced than they actually were at the time , and you possess strange powers as well . Both of these titles are highly anticipated and will no doubt be a worthy addition to the PS4s arsenal . <p> Finally , we have the Xbox One , which is sporting no less than 16 exclusives at launch . The most popular of these being Dead Rising 3 . This zombie-survival game has made a reputation for itself thanks to its previous titles and the third iteration has n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall storyline and amount of content . However , some have noted that the amount of psychopaths in this game were on the low side . The second one is the product of a long-standing franchise aswell : Gears of War Judgement . This game was generally well received , although GoWpurists have claimed it catered too much to newcomers to the franchise . The racing simulator Forza Motorsport 5 was also on the Xbones list . This game scored an impressive 80 out of 100 on Metacritic . Fun fact : Forza Motorsport 5 contains almost 2 hours of uncopyrighted music . Finally , a free game is on the Xbox One-only list . Killer Instinct is a fighting game , well-known for its ADD-like commentary , with phrases ranging from the likes of " ULTRAAA COMBOOOO ! ! ! " to the infamous " COMBOOOO BREAAAKERRR ! ! ! " <p> That was a breakdown of the most popular exclusives . List yours in the comments below . <p> Microsoft have announced the price drop of the Xbox One from -429.99 to -399.99 in the UK . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper in the UK and will also be bundled with a digital download code for Titanfall . <p> The new price will be permanent although the free Titanfall download will only be while stocks last . Buyers will also be reminded they wont be able to use the code for their free copy of Titanfall until March 14th when the game is released in the UK . <p> Unfortunately for fans of Titanfall looking to purchase the Xbox One , the console wont be the special edition Titanfall console that was leaked last month . <p> Despite the Xbox One being sold worldwide , Microsoft are only dropping the price in the UK where it has been reported that the Xbox One has been outsold by the PS4 , though with this price drop the PS4 will still remain the cheaper out of the two with a current retail price of -349.99 . <p> However , many experts believe Microsoft have cut the price in the UK as that is their second biggest market worldwide after the USA . With Microsoft releasing a Titanfall bundle , this move could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titanfall being one of the most anticipated games of the year . <p> The Titanfall bundle is still a worldwide deal , though the price of the Xbox wont be dropped outside the UK . The Titanfall bundle includes- an Xbox One console , Kinect sensor , standard Xbox One wireless controller , standard Xbox One Chat Headset , one month of Xbox Live Gold membership and a digital copy of Titanfall from Respawn Entertainment . <p> " Standby for Titanfall . " Its a phrase I never thought I would hear as often as I have in the last few days . If you 're one of the select few that have n't heard of it yet , you are missing out . Respawn Entertainments new title Titanfall has been blessed with both an Alpha and a closed and then sort of Open Beta . The Beta was available for PC and Xbox One . The latter of which , was gifted an Open Beta afterwards . As with every new game , reviews will be made of it , and in this instance were no different . Please bear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titanfall . Standby for - incoming review . <p> The main part about Titanfall are of course Titans . These are giant mechs that can fire equally giant weapons . At the surface this could be seen as an overpowered killstreak , and who would blame those uttering these - words ? It is true that something like a Titan could become OP rather quickly , but luckily this is n't the case . Everyone gets a Titan , and every soldier on the ground is able to take down an enemy Titan . This can be done in a few ways . First , you can take the boring approach and fire Anti-Titan Ordnance at them . However , the other way of taking them down is where the fun begins . As a pilot , you can actually jump on an enemy Titan and rip a portion of their armor - off . Then , you can shoot them with your weapons and by that we mean- any- weapon and perform a massive amount of extra damage . Aside from this , you can also use the wall-jumping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Angel City for instance , makes you virtually untracable for enemy mechs . Add the Cloak ability to that , and you have yourself a stealthy combination of hiding from Titans for days . - These Titans of course , can be customized with various weapons , abilities and gadgets . <p> Now the player movement . Any person with eyes that has watched a bit of gameplay , will have seen that players have jetpacks that would put the average mister Bond and his Aston Martin to shame . These jetpacks make it possible to jump from walls , run alongside them , jump from them again , and then even double-jump to get wherever you like before you can say " this jetpack is awesome " . These unique movements open up a world of new tactics . Instead of flanking horizontally , you can now jump over and across the enemy , completely avoiding them on your way to the next objective , or you can choose to drop down and either A. break their neck Metal Gear Solid style , or B. shoot them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a large role in any self-respecting shooter . The weapons have no recoil and quick reload times . Do n't  expect any touch of realism here , this is Call of Duty influence at its finest . These weapon characteristics add to the games fast-paced gameplay , and would surely be missed , should we be left without . As this is a beta , weapon and attachment choice is limited , but the choices available are good enough . You have a lock-on pistol , a high-power DMR , an assault rifle and a submachinegun . You will also be able to equip a full or semi-auto pistol and an Anti-Titan weapon . One of my personal favorites is being able to reload your weapon while running , jumping and whatnot . Who does n't  like a good multitasker ? <p> Now , aside from all the good things , there are a few cons I 'm afraid . The party system is a bit askew . You join and invite players by using Origin . Aside from the fact that I 'm not a fan of Origin , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementing a joining system of the game itself . The balance is also a bit messed up . The Smart Pistol , a pistol that can automatically aim for you , is somewhat overpowered , and should definitely see its performance decreased . There is also a lack of a server browser and rentable servers . You " connect " to servers by choosing a data-center to connect to i.e. West-Europe , Asia , Northern America etc . A lack of choosing individual servers makes choosing the one with the lowest ping impossible , and makes you reliant on the data-centers provided . Another point of criticism from me personally , is people joining servers with a ping of 3 digits . The hit detection is superb , until you 're in a firefight with someone with a ping over 80 . The amount of bullets it takes to kill people quickly shoots upwards , leading to very unpleasant deaths . The last point of criticism is the AI . Now , this is n't the " usual " rant about the presence of bots in the game , but its about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are simply standing in the open firing with their small arms at a Titan , or gazing out a window . From the hours Ive put into this beta , I have been killed by a bot once , which was a very unfortunate event at that . <p> That 's about all on the Titanfall beta . Overall , the game that Respawn has delivered is definitely worth taking a look at . The game mechanics are well thought through , and the game as a whole feels refreshing . There are however , a few issues that will hopefully be fixed with a bit of community feedback and Respawns willingness to listen . If you have played the beta , please comment on your feelings about the beta . Did you enjoy it ? Will you buy it , or have you already ? Let us know in the comment section below . <p> Back in May of 2011 , an unknown game was acquired by the now deceased THQ . This game had much potential to be something out of the ordinary . This game , now dubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who brought to us the co-op classic known as Left 4 dead 2 and man are they mixing up the formula . So after THQ went bankrupt , the project was purchased by 2K Gaming who are now working with Turtle Rock studios to get this new co-op experience to our screens this year . <p> Evolve in an upcoming multiplayer FPS title for PC , Xbox One and PS4 . This game is currently a co-op VS experience for 4 players vs 1 monster ( Also player controlled ) in a battle to see who will show evolutionary dominance . This game has an interesting premise as it mixes old and new gameplay elements from previous co-op titles . This looks to be a gem for people who like playing strategic battles , as this is far from being just a fight to the death , this game is the fight for survival . So let 's start off with what we know about the classes . There are currently four classes , each with a role to fill , first we have the Assault . Now the assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your powerhouse and its his job to make sure the monster is pressured . Sure each class can do damage but none can keep up with the power of the assault . Next we have another familiar class to FPS genre the medic . Again quite straight forward , the medics job is to make sure each party member is up , ready to fight and is n't about to die . Third we have a more game specific class , the trapper . The trappers role is to turn the battlefield against the monster . He has traps that will limit or impede the progress of the monster during battle and during the search for the monster . Last is the support . Instead of the usual explosives and ammo supply , the supports role is to give out an array of buffs to the party and to turn the tide of battle when stalemates occur . Now the classes do n't  stop there . There is RPG like progression present here , as you play , you unlock new guns , new equipment and characters that new abilitys for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true for the monster but we will get back to him . <p> Next let 's talk about the environment or more to the point , your battlefield . So you will be fighting this beast in a forest located on a planet called Shear and its only an advantage , if you work for it . The planet is far from being the hunters friend , so the hunters have a lot of work to do to make sure that this is their battlefield . Now let 's talk about the locals . There is local flora and fauna that for the most part are your biggest enemys when your moving . The local fauna will become hostile if you invade their territorys and they can become a bigger enemy to you if the monster decides to use them to its advantage . Also in the earlier stages of the battle the monster prerogative is evolve , so you will have to hunt it down while you both battle for dominance over the local fauna , the monster to become bigger and you to reach the monster before your advantage diminishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These plants stay in an area known as the tyrant pool and if you are knocked in then you will be in the maw of a great beast , then you have to 2 problems and the monster has a golden opportunity to pounce . <p> So last I will tell you about the beasts the final player gets to run with . So the monster being a player controlled entity will lead to many interesting battles and few that will end the same . The monsters main goal at the start of the game will be to evolve as much as possible while the players are fresh in and have no idea of the lay of the land . The monster evolves via consuming the local fauna and going into a cocoon state where he can not move , when he emerges he becomes a stage bigger , faster and stronger . The monster has 3 stages of evolution and at the moment the main monster that has been released is the hulking brute known as the Goliath . The Goliath is a monster that is able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . The abilitys the Goliath start off with are something similar to the hulk , he has a massive pounce to cover ground that ends with a massive blow to anything fool enough to stand in the way , a flamethrower causing hunters to retreat when they are getting to close in great numbers and last but not least it has its utter brute strength to beat the enemy senseless into the ground . As you play the game you will unlock new monsters but at this point little is known about the other unlocks , the main thing said is that they are all agile , there will be no slow hulking tanks . <p> So as a summary , this game looks like a wicked play for someone who enjoys strategic FPS battle in party . The monsters and players seem rather well balanced as evolution will not give you utter advantage . A third evolution monster is not designed to be a walk of shame defeat due to being too slow , no it is at its highest power to eradicate the hunters from its play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of content and has a developer that is known for giving a wealth of content even after the initial release date have long since past . <p> So rip out those headsets , grab some mates and see who will be the hunter or the hunted .

The story continued to focus on Marcus Fenix and Delta squad as they continued their fight against the locust . The major downfall of the game was the various updates to the multiplayer portion of the game . It spawned a well known term in the Gears of War Universe known as " Updated " . <p> With much pressure on the team at Epic , they needed to follow up Gears of War 2 with a spectacular ending to the Gears of War Franchise . To begin the campaign for the much anticipated Gears of War 3 , they started a contest on Xbox Live where you could download a free avatar item to determine whether Clayton Carmine ( the 3rd Carmine brother ) - would either live or die by downloading a Kill Carmine or Save Carmine shirt . By surprise , this entry of the franchise became the first to have a beta available . This ensured that any glitches or flaws could be ironed out before the final games release in September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Multiplayer problems that arose in Gears of War 2 . September came and the final entry in the Gears of War Trilogy was released . Microsoft went all out for the release , with an exclusive Xbox 360 , controllers and with the additional partnership of MadCatz and a pair of Tritton Headsets . This game would do the franchise excellent justice to close out the series . The multiplayer finally was released as well and the addition of dedicated servers made online play nearly flawless . It was a step that should have been taken a long time ago , needless to say it was the right move . <p> A year passed since the release of Gears of War 3 and the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) was upon us . Microsoft and Epic was up on the stage talking about their new IP Fortnite , but before they walk off stage a video starts playing in the background . No one knows what it is until you see Baird , a known character from the series , it was then announced that Gears of War Judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release date of March 2013 on Xbox 360 . As with Gears of War 3 , those who pre-ordered the game would get an exclusive early access to the new game mode Overrun . This new mode along with Survival would replace the fan favorites of Horde and Beast Mode . As gameplay emerged of this installment people began to question the logic of the game . No longer did you face locust in multiplayer , it was COG vs COG , also there was now Free For All . As the release neared gamers came to find out that the game was outsourced to fellow Epic games partner and creator of Bulletstorm the Polish studio PeopleCanFly . As the game was released it was met with hard criticism by hardcore and longtime Gears of War fans due to the style change . The campaign actually took place prior to the events of the original Gears of War , and was exceptional in introducing a new challenge mode in Campaign mode titled Declassified which made the mission harder . The games sales also dropped significantly from Gears of War 3. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gears of War : Judgment- were very poor compared to Gears of War 3 . With a shy result of about 425,000 units which is around a fifth of the two million units Gears of War 3- managed to sell - in September 2011 . In August 2013 it was revealed that Gears of War Judgment sold just over 1 million copies . <p> Now on to the final part of my analysis . Is there anything left of the Gears of War Franchise after the abysmal release of Gears of War Judgment ? Does Epic take the reigns back of their prized possession and give us a Gears of War game similar to the ones we love and know , or will Microsoft and Epic take the Halo route and just keep letting the new studio make all future Gears of War titles ? Which ever way Microsoft and Epic decide to go , I will be watching the process closely . Being a Gears of War fan from the beginning and intending to continue to support the franchise no matter which way they go . The big question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe follow suite ? Only time will tell .

Bringing families and video sites to its knees , And for good reason . Fallout 4 the 6th Fallout game to be released and the second to be developed by Bethesda has hit the homes with major success selling 1.8 million copies digitally across all platforms withing the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the success of sales does not end there it has also beat Grand Theft Auto 5 in concurrent players at all time reaching 471,955 . With all this said What does Fallout 4 bring to the table this year ? <p> As in past Fallout titles you play as the " lone wanderer " off on your adventure to save the remnants of the USA from the post-apocalypse apocalypse . Fallout 4 shares this the major difference being with this title is its focus on gun play . Fallout 4 adds Things like base building , scavenging , gun crafting and many more new aspects and changes . Although as with the normal of fallout titles it has its bugs and issues . With things from a negative filter to your game breaking if you go to a certain area and just plain weird bugs ; But as with all Fallout titles it is still worth your time . <p> One of the first things that has changed is the total stat perk system in previous generations you started with five points in all your S.P.E.C.I.A.L . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they changed this to each starts at one a total of 21 points to allocate in the S.P.E.C.I.A.L . Which means you get a total of 28 Special Points to start off which is quite low compared to the 40 from the previous two titles . This does n't  hurt the flow of the game because they also changed how the leveling up system works in this title . <p> The previous titles have you earning a perk point every two levels as well as earning skill points to level into various skills . In Fallout 4 you just get one perk point every level to put in the variety of the special trees . Each special tree has ten perks in each tree for a total of 70 S.P.E.C.I.A.L . perks . Some of these perks have one level to put into them while others have multiple levels . I found myself at first missing the old style of leveling with perks and skills but as i kept playing throughout the game i was contributing that feel to nostalgia of the last two Fallouts and ultimately enjoy this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see this as a Lessening of the RPG in fallout but i have seen less things in RPG games and they still are in the RPG genre . <p> As i played i found myself drawn towards the building aspect of the game . So much so i dropped my current game and started a new on with his primary state being charisma so i could build better communities . When building up somewhere you have to take in that you need beds , food , water and defenses for the town . later on you can add things like traders if you have the skills for it . you can build a lot of different things with the building plots your given through ought the game from forts , trade posts , Giant towers even the Death star(sorta) . Now if you 're someone who is n't into the building aspect of the game . you do n't  have to go all out and build a base up . Building a base just helps you out with the crafting aspect of the game and selling some gear . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the end product was and later upgrading the defenses or buildings as i gathered resources and levels . Building definitely overall made the game tons more fun to me with some of the things you can do and with the mod potential to add even more things you can build in the game it makes it a lot more fun and enjoyable to look at if you 're just starting or once mods get fully supported . <p> Crafting has had a major overhaul compared to three and New Vegas . Now crafting goes from cooking food all the way down to fully modifying your weapons . have a laser pistol but want a rifle ? No problem , You can easily modify the weapon to your needs from scopes , barrels , fire rates you can modify to your hearts content . You also modify your armour , power armour in the same aspect . Of course you will need the perks required to do so respective to what you 're trying to do . Power armour as well has had a major change in this title as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also required power via a fusion core . Which overall makes sense when you think of it its power armour not a ballistic vest theirs technology and the bulk of the armour would weigh anyone down if you tried to wear it without the exosuit . <p> My favorite thing with the exosuits is you can tell civilians and companions to get into them . So you could have every civilian in your towns wearing exosuits if you had enough which is super cool to think about These changes overall mad for a better game play experience . i loved being able to choose completely how my gun and armour worked and you can mix and match pieces which makes a huge number of possibilities for your look . <p> The gunplay is extraordinary well done in Fallout 4 in the other Fallouts it felt like the gun play was very sticky or console like ( nothing against consoles ) . But this fallout feels very clean and crisp with the movement of the guns . The recoil feels like recoil when you 're shooting the gun which is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is modeled off of destiny and it feels crisper and more cleaner due to this . There 's also a light cover system where if you 're crouched behind a small wall or corner of a wall when you aim down sight you poke out and can fire which is extremely nice to see and does wonders for encounters . The gun play makes you feel your in the battle , combined with the crafting system it overall brings you into the experience of your character . <p> With all that said the game does have its flaws ( some of them glaring ) . The game feels more like a open world shooter with rpg aspects plugged in . The base building as good and fun as it was for me felt very tacked on . It felt something a modded did instead of a triple a studio.It behaved and acted almost identical to the building in a mod called exile for Arma 3 The dialogue and conversations you can have are very limited due to your character being fully voiced . In other games you could learn a lot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels very little is learned of the world you 're in compared to the previous titles . Not to mention the fact that the player ca n't role play there own voice in ruins the experience for some people . <p> You never feel like you 're playing the bad guy in previous titles there were obvious choices which made you a bad character . In this title you never have those choices that you are bad . You can be rude or sarcastic but in the end you 're still good . Which definitely hurt the story for me . Even in other Rpgs they have blatantly bad choices or at least make you look bad . In the Mass Effect Series of games you have the choice multiple times throughout the story to annihilate a complete species of aliens . That 's pretty dark , but nothing like this ever comes up in Fallout 4 . <p> Then there are just the blatant bugs throughout the game . Bugs from turning your screen negative , Guns not switching properly so your holding nothing in your hands . Bugs that break the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sky . Bugs causing you unable to advance the storyline . There are a TON of bugs . This is fairly normal with Bethesda games but with some things feeling tacked on it really feels at times that the game was rushed , but then again it could just a normal Bethesda game issue . Which is n't something to ignore . <p> Fallout 4 is a gun play emphasized RPG sandbox game . It has added a lot of new things into the universe of Fallout but comes lacking in the lore with this title . The gunplay feels amazing , the base building is a bit tacky and the new perk tree is a welcome change . I feel this is a very good game overall but for a Fallout game it feels very lacking in the story and lore . This is the best Fallout for gunplay but the worst in being a actual RPG . Fallout felt very focused in on the rpg genre before this title . This title opened it up to be more accessible to consumers but at the same time turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry point for new fans to enter , While old fans will see it as lacking the RPG aspect of the game but will still enjoy it . It feels rushed to a point and could use some more depth in the story and lore . Fallout 4 is hopefully a good step towards a overall good fallout title and in the next Installment hopefully they will keep the gunplay but go back to having a more RPG feel to the game then a open sandbox shooter with some RPG elements . It is by no means a bad video game its just a Mediocre RPG game for what we 've had in the past from the series . IF you 're a fan of the series or a fan of sandbox shooters Fallout 4 will be good for you .

Let 's see this out with some movie quotes.Live long and ProsperIll be Back ! <p> Its not often a horror game will literally make you jump off your own seat in pure terror , nor are there many games which make you turn it off to prevent a heart attack . Outlast is of course a game that will do just that . A free download on PS4 for any PS Plus members , I had been persuaded for a good week or so to download this chiller of a game . <p> Having spoken to one friend who , in his own words , " heard his footsteps , stopped but continued to hear some footsteps so turned the game off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out just what makes this game scary . After all , its just a video game right ? <p> After downloading the game overnight ( for free ) I returned home from work and immediately decided to give this game a try . With it being dark outside , I closed the curtains , turned off the lights and set the mood to play a proper horror game , one where the main character does n't  carry a gun , in fact the only thing he does carry is a camcorder , a pen and a notepad . Having put on my headset to add to the experience of hearing every single sound , I prepared myself for a nightmare . <p> True to its word , 7 minutes into the game and I nearly died of a sudden heart attack , walking into a library and seeing a body hanging from the ceiling and a loud scream echoing through my headset . With that leaving me rather shaken , I opted to pause the game so I could turn a light on , just in case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mutated being jumping out at me from a wheelchair . At this point I turned the game off , the excuse being that I wanted to watch The One Show on BBC1 . <p> Graphically the game is pretty good , if not better than expected . For a game only retailing at an average -15.99 and free for PS Plus members , many would n't expect a game to be such a gem . However the games gained viral success with many players commenting on how scary it is , adding to the entertainment . Researching the game its also important to note that the developers behind the game , Red Barrels , was founded by developers previously involved in creating Assassins Creed , Uncharted and Tom Clancys Splinter Cell . <p> The game is set in an abandoned asylum and follows the story of a freelance journalist , Miles Upshur as he investigates the activities and experiments that occurred inside the Asylum .

Playing on a large TV with a headset will make gamers feel they are in the game , exploring the asylum themselves , even the heartbeat which starts after every strange sound feels like your own . This is as close to virtual reality you 'll be able to get and believe me its well worth it . <p> Overall if you 're looking for a cheap game with a simple yet effective idea for a survival horror , then this game is certainly up your street . Cheap scares combined with excellent imagery , the game is set out like a typical horror movie . Red Barrells are definitely developers to look out for and I highly recommend this game to anyone who can handle a horror survival from their own living room . <p> Outlast is available on Steam for -15.99 and is free for PS Plus members on the PS4 . <p> Rumours have begun to spread over the internet that Sledgehammer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bringing back Captain Price and General Shepards Shadow Company in a new Modern Warfare game .

Today we are talking about the TWC and the HTO <p> As DBL spoke on briefly in the last article , DO 's were part of TWC at one point . On Jun 19th 2007 DO 's were no longer a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps Commanders and a Chief of Staff . This then lead to the creation of 1st and 2nd Corps and Tactical Warfare 's 1st Corps commanders and much later the 3rd Corps creation , but TWC had many great members that lead us to where we are and I would like to recognize them here briefly . <p> TW Ruissimo and TW Method were promoted to 1st and 2nd Corps Commanders respectively on Jun 20th 2007 . TW Biggy also was the Chief of Staff at this time . TG Ruissimo took CoS in approximately September of 2008 with TG MCTJim as 1st CC on 14 September 2008 and TG xHITMANx on 30 September 2008. 30 September 2009 TG MCTJim and TG xHITMANx took their place as the 1st and only members of TG so far to have been promoted to the rank of General. ( 4 stars ) <p> Following , TG Signal stepped up to lead as 2nd Corp 's CC on 10 September 2010 and DBLDeathDealer took over as 1st Corp 's CC on 21 October 2010 . Both were lead by TG Franco who took CoS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for TWC was due to our expansion as a community with the creation of 3rd Corps and it 's 1st and only Corps Commander so far , TG KrizZz , promoted on 10 February 2011 . Later on 12 November 2011 DBLDeathDealer would take his place a CoS as Franco went on leave and with Blistig taking 1st Corp 's CC on 16 November 2011 . TG-BIGWAHOO took Signal 's place as 2nd Corp 's CC on 3 December 2011 . The last member to join the ranks of TWC to present is Honest Outrage promoted to 2nd Corp 's Commander on 20 July 2013 when Wahoo transferred to Tactical Sports . <p> What about the HTO , now known as the TO , that has played such a large role in TG ? The 1st unofficial HTI was TW Method which lead some time before TW xHITMANx took the position as the 1st official HTI on 19 June 2007 . HITMAN 's promotion signified the real need for the HTO and the recognition of it 's existence . During this time HTIA 's were given more responsibility , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but more as an extra duty similar to News Team member today . WIth this , HTIA 's were also SL 's , SA 's , BTN Staff , or even Division Staff . Things for HTIA 's would remain this way for some time . <p> Our 2nd HTI was TG Texas who was promoted in approximately October of 2008 . He was then followed by TG Kilo our 3rd HTI , promoted on 9 November 2009 . It was during the next HTI 's tenure that things would change dramatically for HTIA 's . During these two HTI 's tenure many dramatic changes too how boot camps were conducted were made . The removal of the DI position and the verbal BC were replaced with a BC test where the recruits typed the letter of each answer in a post , that the HTIA 's would then score and edit with the remaining questions . As the recruit posted their post would become invisible , and they would wait for HTIA 's to tell them which questions had to be re-completed , because 100% of the questions had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> DBLDeathDealer took his place as our 4th HTI on 21 January 2010 , and during his tenure created a new train of thought for the role of HTIA , taking it from a side position to a full position responsible for coordinating with Division Staff and BTN Staff and assisting in training SS . It was during this transition that the HTO also started to assume much more responsibility than ATC 's and BC 's . <p> Our next HTI is a well known member today , and made some great innovations with SS training during his tenure . TG-TheProfessor was promoted as our 5th HTI on 21 October 2010 . During my tenure as HTI , the SSTSP was recreated to Biggy 's vision for the SSTP and DBL 's CPP 's were implemented . I ( TG HaloHobo ) took my place as HTI on 22 November 2011 . <p> TG-Moose took his place as the 6th and final HTI and lead the HTO through it 's transition to the new site and from the HTO to the TO .

Blistig , Honest Outrage , KrizZz , and DBLDeathDealer will all be hosting a livestream in which theyll be available to respond to pretty much everything you can throw at them . <p> On March 16th theyll be playing World of Tanks PC on the TG Twitch Channel .

So how did their respective builds fair ? <p> dropcap/dropcapMark Walton 's AMD build consisted of an AMD FX-6300 CPU and the Radeon HD 7850 GPU .

Without getting too much into the numbers , the games were run on a mix of High and Ultra at 1920+1080 with slight differences in the Anti-Aliasing used . For their performance , the AMD PC 's games ran from around 42fps in AC4 and BF4 on Ultra to around 87fps in Thief on Ultra .

They were running games at native 1080p , at frame-rates higher than a most of the current console offerings are running at , and with higher graphical settings that the console versions are running at . This is quite impressive . <p> My personal thoughts : <p> dropcap/dropcapTheir builds had some odd choices and the rules were a little restrictive in some key areas . The Intel CPU was a very poor choice and seriously bottlenecked the PC , of which was limited by the weak PSU that was picked . The requirement of having to use Windows as the OS was odd since that is n't the only OS out there . They could have gone with the Steam OS or any Linux OS , which would have cost nothing . This would have given the AMD and nVidia/Intel builds an extra $70-99.99 respectively to work with . <p> dropcap/dropcapI feel that it 's always worth noting when these sorts of PC builds with console budgets in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be remembered . While it is pretty much impossible to quantify , it is safe to assume that the long term costs of any hobby are truly where the real costs are . Do you enjoy listening to music ? Is the initial cost of the music device the part that hurts your wallet the most or the hundreds/thousands of songs that cost the most dollar pain ? <p> dropcap/dropcapThis is very applicable to gaming as it 's only a matter of a few hundred dollars to get your gaming system of choice , but the multitude of games you purchase over the years that add up and beat your wallet to a pulp . From $60 release costs to online subscription fees , the full generation long cost of a console gets pretty high . This is of course dependent on how many games you get each month and each year . <p> To see the exact PC builds and the exact in-game settings used , Here- is the full article from Gamespot.com

We have n't had a new recruit in a long time and i 'm hoping that changes soon . <p> TG REDWINGSGUY : Currently we are not as competitive as other divisions .

We also have plans to expand the division in numbers . Both go hand in hand in the sense that the more people we get , the more teams we can get . As soon as we can implement the 3 main team types ( IN , ST , &amp; Competitive ) , it show we are ready to move on to the competitive scene . We will be able to promote people through the teams if they wish to become more competitive , as well as have an outlet for those that do n't  in ST squad .

@@75311633 @4011633/ <h> EA E3 2014 Conference Breakdown <p> EA , the " worst company " voted for twice , has managed to impress many with its conference at this years E3 . <p> First , let 's look at some of the high-rollers . Battlefield Hardline was featured , and it both intrigued and disappointed many . The cops and robbers theme- did n't  fit the Battlefield theme according to some , but its nice to see things mixed up a bit . The closed beta went live yesterday , with footage looking very similar to BF4 , with a slightly re-touched HUD . The most notable difference is the pace . Where the main Battlefield series is still about large-scale warfare , Hardline is much more fast-paced , putting the emphasis on close-quarter gunfights . <p> Next up , is the game Ive personally been eagerly waiting for . The sequel to Mirrors Edge , originally named Mirrors Edge 2 , has been showcased on E3 with interviews of the developers and some game play . From what we 've seen , it looks like DICE has expanded the movement system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my opinion , this is a change for the better . The guns in the first part felt very clunky . Guns will still be present , but almost all the skirmishes in the E3 footage featured only some kind of nightstick . The combat also seems to be more varied , with a large arsenal of visor-smashing jabs , hooks and roundhouse-kicks . Frostbite 3 looks to add another layer of depth in this game , and its good news for AMD users , because Frostbite 3 already supports Mantle . <p> The final smash-success to be is of course , the Sims 4 . Gladys and here antics aside , this looks to be game of the year already . And all jokes aside , the final real smash-success in the workings is of course Fifa 15 . It looks to be the same Fifa as it has been for the last decade , but I have no doubt it will sell like hotcakes . The virtual Messi has made an appearance as is the tradition looking as splendid as ever . According to the spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spin included , but I 'd rather stick to the most realistic version of football : actually playing football . <p> Naturally , Fifa 15 was n't the only EA Sports title announced . As if EA could read our minds , theyve given us our yearly dose of NHL , Madden and even an unexpectedly surprising showcase of PGA , which featured Paracel Storms ( BF4 ) battleship crash . I believe EA has already been accused of ripping off of other games , but they seem to have covered themselves rather nicely ; by ripping off themselves ! As far as NHL , Madden and PGA go , its the same old same old we 've made it slightly better than last- year , pay up . " <p> So , that was what EA had in stall for us on this 2014s E3 . Cops &amp; robbers , Messi , and an epic battle between a golf course and a battleship . I 'm still not sure if that golfer hit a birdie or not <h> Post navigation <p> Ive been really enjoying the BF Hardline Beta . The game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@75311635 @4011635/ <h> Sony Reveals Project Morpheus : A PS4 VR Headset <p> The Game Developers Conference 2014 , otherwise known as GDC , is currently going on and there 's a lot of very lucky people getting to see a lot of cool things . One of those very cool things is the recently announced Project Morpheus from Sony . Morpheus is a Virtual Reality headset that is Sony 's version of the Oculus Rift that has been in development for the last few years . So what does this Morpheus thing mean to the gaming industry ? <p> Personally , I think ( and hope ) that VR is the near future of the video game industry . I do n't see it as a gimmick , I see it as something that will become a standard . The biggest perk to the Oculus ' Rift is that it is an open source piece of hardware and software on the PC , but what does the Morpheus have that the Rift does n't ? <p> Currently , we do not know all that much about Morpheus . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know that the current dev kit version is 1080p and has a 90+ - degree field of view , and we know a few other nerdy hardware facts . What I 'm interested in is the fact that it is Sony 's product . Sony they are a huge company . They will push , with a whole lot of money , that the Morpheus is a success . Will we see Rift-exclusive titles ? Probably not ; at least not to the scale of a AAA title . Sony will really push for some VR exclusive titles to push the sales of the Morpheus , increase its adoption rate , and really make it a clear advantageous feature that that Xbox thingy does not have . <p> Below is a link to the IGN article covering the announcement , but before that , here are some bullet points that some Redditors have pulled together : <p> Accelerometer and gyroscope sensors built into the head mounted unit as well as PlayStation Camera accurately tracks head orientation and movement , so as your head rotates , the image of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current prototype is wired " with a five meter wire .

@@75311636 @4011636/ <h> nVidia Green Just Got Greener <p> In the PC gaming world , players are often divided in two camps . The two keywords , or better said , brands , - are AMD and nVidia .

Further comparison between the two nVidia cards : both have a GDDR5 memory type , although the Ti version has 2GB of memory , and the regular GeForce GTX 750 is sporting 1GB of memory . Both cards also have the same architecture , which is the Maxwell GM107 . The memory bus for both cards is 128 bit .

@@75311650 @4011650/ <h> Battlefield 4 @ Gamescom <p> The biggest European gaming event has come to an end after 5 amazing days of companies showcasing their upcoming titles to the world ! We will take a look at how EA fared with Battlefield 4 over the 5 days and what we can take away from the event ! <p> Prior to Gamescom <p> Before we jump head first into all the juice on what we got to see of Battlefield 4 at Gamescom let 's take a look at how EA built the excitement just days before the huge event with The Road to Battlefield 4 . A new blog series put together by developers DICE to explore all the key aspects we are going to see in Battlefield 4 and Gamescom ! <p> New Multiplayer Footage , Open-Beta Details and BF4 Premium were the key talking points of day 1 at Gamescom ! <p> Paracel Storm : <p> Paracel Storm features intense naval combat , a major feature in this map is how the sea works in game and how Levolution takes effect in which we see dynamic weather changes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really breath taking to watch how well sea combat works with the choppy waves causing real hard thought battles ! The map features naval ships and jet skies to get around the map , along with jets and choppers to take to the air ! The key feature in this map though is the battleship which is present in the background of the map but as a wind turbine falls the Battleship comes crashing into the map changing how the game is played , what is really good though is that this battleship is not just a big obstacle to get around , there is something useful on board which teams can take control of ( I wont give any details away ) . <p> Open-Beta : <p> Though no exact date has been confirmed EA &amp; DICE have come out and said that the Open-Beta will be released early October . It will be available on PC , 360 and PS3 in which the Beta will feature the map showcased at E3 , Siege of Shanghai with the classic mode being conquest ! Battlefield 3 Premium members , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Medal of Honor : Warfighter ( Limited or Digital Deluxe Edition ) will have access to the exclusive beta early October for three days . <p> BF4 Premium : <p> " This membership will give players two weeks early access to five future Battlefield 4 expansion packs . Premium users are also prioritized in server queues and will enjoy unique camos , emblems , dogtags and more . Watch the Battlefield 4 Premium trailer below for the very first details of the upcoming expansion packs . " <p> Day 2 @ Gamescom <p> Day 2 at Gamescom saw more in-depth interviews with the developers at DICE and the showcasing of a new gamemode Obliteration . <p> Obliteration : <p> This is a brand new gamemode coming to Battlefield 4 , the aim of the game is to have two teams battle it out for one bomb ! The teams must obtain the bomb in which they have to plant it at an m-com and defend it until it blows ! The m-com point will not be known until it appears on the map and it will be totally random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to winning this game mode , it is vital to defend the bomb carrier and ensure that your enemy does not get to the bomb ! <p> In Day 3 we got to know a bit more about the rumors surrounding Battlefield 4 ! One very interesting rumor was that Battlefield 4 will now have VOIP in-game which stands for Voice Over IP , what had been confirmed was that BF4 will include VOIP but it will only be specific to your squad ! They discussed having an open VOIP for the whole server to communicate but they saw a flaw in which when you are on a 64 player server it would be too much to handle and would become annoying in basic terms ! <p> A more in-depth look at the spectator mode was reviewed and some really nice aspects have been brought into it ! So as a spectator you of course have control to roam around the full map which is great and will only bring benefits to Battlefield especially in the competitive scene ! As a spectator the HUD is split up where on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the other team , now this is dived into squads so Alpha , Bravo , Charlie etc and you can see how many kills and deaths each squad have obtained in total and to get a more in-depth view you can click on each squad in which a drop down of the players within that squad appears which tells you the class they are playing , individual kills and deaths as well as their score which is great as you can keep everything neat and tidy <p> The Executive Director of DICE was asked whether the rumors about the possible Titan mode previously seen in Battlefield 2142 would be returning to Battlefield 4 in which he replied " We know a lot of people loved that game mode and we have a very good team at home that can tweak and tune the game to make it fit but we could see it come back in a different style " so promising stuff on that for those who played Battlefield 2142 and know what the Titan mode was and want to see it again in Battlefield 4 ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked more about spectator mode and we got to see some new features of the spectator mode in which allows you to customise the HUD where you can enable and disable certain presets on your HUD to give you the best look ! The two main reasons behind spectator mode was for the competitive scene and though not a lot could be said about competitive play in BF4 , it is coming and we are told to get prepared ! The other reason was that DICE know how much fans love to make videos and this gives those people full ability to make tons of top quality videos with no restrictions ! <p> A lot of people tried to ask about the competitive play that is coming and though not a lot was said we were told 5v5 would be a popular competitive size . A lot was just emphasized on BF4 teams get ready ! So it is coming which is great for the community of BF4 ! <p> Day 5 @ Gamescom <p> So the final day of Gamescom which means the final day of seeing more awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hands on the beta which according to Origin will start on the 28th September for those who get the 3 day early access and open to all on the 1st October until the full release come the 29th October ! <p> At day 5 things start off just summarising very quickly some of the things that have been covered over the last 5 days ! We then got on to talk more about the spawn points of obliteration ( the new game mode coming to battlefield 4 ) on the new map Paracel Storm to which we know all spawn points are random and will all be on the main island itself ! <p> We talk more about some of the scopes in Battlefield 4 and how some have these range finders on them and what this does is when you are zoomed in , it will tell you the distance to which your reticle- is pointing at . This allows more easily adjustable shots at distance ! <p> Tire Reloading was explained in detail to clarify how it is going to work ! So what Tire Reloading allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself fully out of ammo on your primary weapon what you do is you start the tire reloading animation now you are not stuck in this animation , you can switch to your pistol if you find you encounter enemies but the animation does pause so when you go back to your primary it will continue on ! Now tire reloading will not work unless your gun is completely depleted of ammo ! If you try to use tire reloading whilst ammo is still in your gun , it will not work ! Also whilst on the point of reloading , if you reload whilst bullets are still in your magazine then you will lose those bullets so be wary of that ! <p> More was talked about another new game mode called domination which is very much like a small conquest ! The game mode will be played on very close quarter combat maps in which there are no set spawn points , all spawn points will be random and I believe you ca n't spawn on the flags you operate ! The game mode is set to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is meant to be really fun to watch and very action packed ! <p> That rounds everything up for Battlefield @ Gamescom ! I hope you enjoyed this and I hope you got to learn all the cool and awesome stuff that is coming to Battlefield 4 ! Stay tuned for more information on Battlefield here at Tactical Gaming News ! That is all for now , see you next time ! <p> You can actually see in origin when the closed beta starts = pre loading from 29th Sept which of course is 2 days before the release of it so October 1st for closed beta and 4th for open . <p> TGxBrownie <p> Cheers , <p> From what we know it is still in the game and it was mentioned at Gamescom that you will lose your bullets if you pre-reload ! No confirmation as of yet that it has been taken out ! So it is still there ! Also yes I have mentioned about the Origin details it is the 28th , though it has been taken off the application now ! 
@@75311651 @4011651/ <h> Tag Archives : Theme Hospital <p> Remember all those years ago , sitting on your PC pretending to manage an entire hospital , putting out bins to prevent rats , buying new hospital beds and adding an entirely new ward ? You do ? Great , because now you can relive those moments all over again with a free download of Theme Hospital ! <p> The popular business development game from Bullfrog Productions has recently been added to the " On the House " section of EAs Origin and is available for Free . The game usually costs -3.99 . <p> The game was essentially a sequel to the equally popular , Theme Park , becoming part of the Theme series by Bullfrog Productions which also spawned Theme Aquarium , Theme Park World and Theme Park Inc . The game itself was rather simple but kept many entertained and amused for hours on end , giving players the sense of freedom that most games around that time did n't  offer . The purpose of the game was to build and run a successful hospital , hiring staff to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clean areas for patients . <p> Many ruled the game out as a pointless exercise but with the addictive nature of the game , the epidemics soaring as levels went on and the general comedy of the gameplay , it became a huge commercial success selling over 4 million copies worldwide . Hilarious and crazy illnesses included spare rip syndrome ( growing an extra rib ) , King Complex ( the desire to become Elvis ) and my personal favourite , Bloaty Head . <p> The game was a popular choice in my household , with my sister enjoying the game just as much as I did and became a popular choice among games . Its this sort of game which does in fact bring back cherished memories of gaming in my childhood much like other classics including Abes Oddessy , Tekken and GTA . <p> Over the years , Theme Hospital has become available on Playstation , Android and OS X. The trailer itself makes it feel like an ancient piece of gaming history ! <p> Theme Hospital is currently available for free on Origin . For more information , visit Origin here
