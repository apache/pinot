Having gone through depression , anger , illness , self sabotage and eventually self acceptance , to finally learning to love myself , I feel like the following list is a good summary of important lessons life has taught me : <p> Your thoughts have created your life , whether you realise it or not . <p> Exercise is not something you " do " but a way of life . Just as you eat daily , your body needs exercise every day . Period . <p> Be your real self , however quirky that might be . And the right people will love you for it . <p> Reduce your sugar intake and stop ageing unnecessarily. - Give your body a break . Eliminate all sugar from your main meals . Instead save the sugar for special occasions and occasional desserts . <p> Its okay to take time out sometimes . You need just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need actively pursuing your goals . <p> Take pleasure in everyday things , whether its having dinner or doing the washing . Life is made up of a series of small ordinary tasks , not just the big events . <p> A little planning on the weekend results in a easier , more organised week . <p> Set your goals high , and do n't  tell- anyone . Its one thing to doubt yourself , you do n't  need to invite other peoples insecurities and opinions into the mix . <p> Your relationships are a reflection of your own inner energy , so do n't  give your power away by blaming others . Change yourself internally and watch as the people around you change . <p> Take time to relax every day . Do n't  try to do everything , do n't  try to achieve goals or prove yourself to anyone , including yourself . Just be . While it- sounds easy , its one of the hardest things I 've ever done . <p> Its that moment when you decide once and for all , you 're done . Youre done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's when things begin to change for you . That 's when your resistance finally subsides . <p> Do n't  lie , especially to children . They know you 're lying . They can tell the difference between your energy and the words coming out of your mouth. - Do n't  teach them inauthenticity at such a tender age . <p> Worrying is not harmless . Worrying gives energy to what you do n't  want , helping more unwanted stuff occur in your life . Its like planning for the unwanted . Youre bound to attract more unwanted to your life . <p> The kinder I am to myself on the weekend , the better life plays- out during the week . <p> The more you believe in yourself , the less you need to control anyone or anything . <p> Enjoy life now , as you never know how different things will be in 12 months time . <p> Be yourself and forget about everything else . People are smarter than they show , and its not long before they recognise authenticity . <p> The people you secretly admire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the first move and appearing- vulnerable . <p> At our core , we all just want to love and be loved . <p> Despite it all , the Universe is a pretty wonderful place . <p> The mostly calming affirmation is " Everything always works out for me . I am always taken care of " . <p> The truth does n't  stay hidden for long . Do the right thing and let everything- else be . <p> As soon as you start to appreciate- yourself , doors open to you in unexpected ways . <p> What about you ? what would you add to this list ?

The Law of Attraction ( LOA ) prevents anything around you changing until you change first , because your world is a reflection of your thoughts and emotions . And the change must be sustained a while before real physical change around you becomes apparent . <p> I have a number of exercises in the book which help you change your focus and hence emotions . One such exercise is the Love List . It seems simplistic at first , but those ive coached with it have found it not just enjoyable but a easy way to move towards what they want . Here is the extract from The Alchemy of Healing explaining the Love List exercise : <p> " Get a notebook you love and write the numbers 1 to 10 down a page . Make sure you love this notebook , search a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . Next to each number , list anything that you love right now about your life . It could be your puppy , your partner , your salary , the novel you just started reading . It does n't  matter what you list , as long as you feel some appreciation for it . Then throughout your day look out for things to take home and add to your love list . - Nothing is too small to be listed here . Try and fill in a page per day , and within a few weeks you will have listed hundreds of things that evoked appreciation within you . The purpose of this practice is to get you into the habit of looking for lovely things . Not only do you feel better when your focus is on good feeling thoughts , but you will begin to see more good coming into your life .

Your goal should always be to move up the scale , as your emotions improve and raise , your resistance reduces . And as a consequence of your reduced resistance , your life begins to improve , in amazing ways . <p> Its important to know that on every subject ( love , money , health , career etc ) you sit in a different place in the scale . So while you may- be optimistic about your relationship , you could be depressed about your job prospects . And consequently how you feel about every subject in your life affects your ability to succeed in that subject . <p> The exercises in the book Ask and It Is Given are specifically designed to help you raise your emotional set point on every subject you like . <p> Hello Jerlin , Instead of looking for the mental cause of any illness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve your general emotional state .

Pay close attention to how you feel and any time you feel negative emotion , change your focus to something that makes you feel happier or gives you relief .

@@50293252 @3793252/ 149485 @qwx559485 <h> The Power of Water <p> August 2 , 2015 <p> The Power of Water has been underestimated I believe , to heal , cleanse , regenerate and give life to our body , mind and soul. - I 've always loved water , and never felt any other drink satisfied my thirst quite like water . But recently my love and respect for this humble resource was renewed after I began to see what an increase of water did for my body . When I increased my water intake from the recommended 2 litres a day to 3-4 litres , my skin renewed and healed about 4 times as fast ! - My face now glows , and people have started commenting on how good i my skin looks. - I have more energy and my stomach is much happier . The other massive benefit of the extra water is that my body can process and handle anything I eat , without any reactions . Let 's face it , we all like a bit of naughty food once in a while , so why not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat ? <p> After 4 weeks of about 3.5 litres of water per day , my lungs , liver and kidneys have been cleansed and flushed out . I know because the lung- mucus I had has disappeared , all the inflammation on my skin from my lungs ( which maps to your right cheek in Chinese Medicine ) and liver ( which shows irritation through your left cheek ) have rapidly cleared , maybe for the first time in years . Finally- the dark circles around my eyes ( kidney related ) have also reduced . It has so far been the most effective detox ive tried . Eating clean , taking supplements and avoiding certain foods like dairy , wheat and meats was no where near as effective as doubling my water intake . <p> Other side effects of good hydration are weight loss , which funnily enough is the last thing people think about when wanting to slim down . After all our bodies are 70% water and our blood is 92% water . So in order for nutrients in your blood to be able to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water : While i 'm not a physician and cant give medical advise , i have seen the effect of water on the people around me . I suggest you increase your water intake slowly and monitor the results . Do n't  over do it . Listen to your body . My body easily needs 4 litres of water . I have friends who drink 5 litres , and that works for them . <p> Warning : Too much water can be dangerous so speak to your physician . My physician thinks 2 litres is enough , but I live an active lifestyle , I exercise and I personally need more . Everyone is different . <p> The quality of the water you drink is important too . Most countries are now contaminating their water with chemicals such as chlorine and fluoride , which are not good for the human body . If you can , get a quality filter to take these chemicals out . I use a reverse osmosis filter at home for my drinking water . Of course this means when I 'm out and about , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . You are better off being hydrated with tap- water than to deprive your body of this essential life source in fear of the quality of the water . <p> The quality of your thoughts about what you consume is extremely important . Dr. Masaru Emoto has shown through his experiments that the thoughts we think and hence how we feel , changes the structure of water crystals . And this is consistent with everything I have written about in my book The Alchemy of Healing , because our thoughts affect our ability to heal . Here are images of- water crystals and the corresponding thoughts that were- focused on them : <p> " Thank you " <p> " You disgust me " <p> " Love and Gratitude " <p> " You Fool " <p> What are your experiences with water ? I would love to hear your story .

I also have one at home but recently just been told the RO filtered water is acidic and not good in the long term . Would appreciate your stance ! Thanks before = <p> Thanks very much Maya , glad you liked it = Yes i had the same question and after discussing it with the water purification specialist i bought my filter from , my understanding is that water which contains minerals is considered to be alkaline while water that contains no minerals ( which is the case when you remove everything with RO ) is considered to be acidic . So the solution they offer you is an add-on to the filter which then adds good minerals back into the water . At the time i opted not to get the extra minerals that way as i wanted to do my own research , i think some call this Pi water ( also stemming from Japan ) . But i then got busy and never had a chance to do my own research . Now that you 've reminded me i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time i replace my filters . <p> In otherwords its really up to you . I would still rather drink pure water that does n't  contain toxic fluoride/chloride even if it is missing other minerals ( which you can get from a better diet ) than to go back to tap water . Having said that , i drink whatever water i get access to when im out or at work , so i would n't dehydrate myself if i cant find purified water . That would be silly ! <p> Hi Farnaz , I do n't  have a water filter system in my home . Based on your knowledge and research , do you believe a water filter pitcher would be helpful ? If I cant find purified water in a store should I look to purchase distilled , spring , water with electrolytes or other ? <p> Hello Sonja , It really depends on what you are trying to do . I wanted to remove Fluoride so i had to buy a reverse osmosis filter , it was the only option . But i drink tap water when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need to be practical . As far as i know the water pitchers with filters do n't  do anything , if there is bad taste in water they may remove it but i would n't say they remove chemicals . Please do your own research to confirm . If you can buy spring water , that might be the next best option . However please do n't  forget that the most important thing in all of this is to keep your energy high and happy . Even if you drink the best quality water on earth , if you are in bad emotional state , your body will not see any benefits . I feel i must remind everyone that the most important action to take is to ensure you keep yourself happy . If you are well emotionally , with average quality water your body will still thrive . So please do n't  stress yourself if you cant get the right filter . Your primary task is feeling good = <p> Hi Farnaz , thanks for your reply = I agree with you and I 'll try not to fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real proof of the power of water !

Its very clear children are born knowing- the Law of Attraction ( LoA ) , adults just train it out of them . I believe there is a lot we can learn from them , - so in the next few months I 'll a share a collection of lessons Ive learnt from these kids and their immense wisdom . <p> Lesson 1:The point of power really is the NOW ! <p> Baby no.1- was peacefully asleep in the afternoon ( the day she was born ) , when her nurse informed her parents that she required two injections . I do n't  remember what for , but each needle was inserted in her tidy fragile thighs , and for the adults in the room , it was hard to watch . The syringe was as long as her legs , and she screamed as they were inserted , my stomach dropped ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the injection , it seemed as if nothing had happened . She had forgotten about the pain and closed her eyes again and continued to nap . <p> This was amazing for me to watch . Babies in the Now . They are so in the present , that they do n't  continue reliving the pain and suffering over and over like we adults do . She instantly moved on and forgot the pain . <p> Had any adults thighs been injected with needles as long as her legs , no doubt shed continue to relive the experience for hours , days , weeks , months and sometimes years afterwards ! ! ! <p> There is a lot we can learn from young children , and their beautiful presence . They are not hung up about yesterday or worried for tomorrow ( unless of course they have been exposed to adults with similar traits ) . Children happily live in the present moment and make the most of it . <p> Lesson 2 : Laugh it off <p> Baby no.1- bursts into laughter after each sneeze . She thinks everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but actually quite enjoys her sneezes . Imagine how different life would be if adults burst into laughter after each sneeze ? Instead what tends to happen is you sneeze once or twice , and other people then begin to question if you are sick ? do you have some sort of bug ? or as my parents say " see i told you , you will catch a cold if you do n't  wear more layers ! " Even a tiny meaningless sneeze gets blown out of proportion and sometimes turns into much more than it needs to be . What if we adults enjoyed our sneezes ? What if you laugh the next time you sneeze ? Imagine how much that laughter would strengthen your immune system ? The cold would disappear before it even began ! <p> Lesson 3 : Enjoy your own company <p> Baby no.1- loves playing on her own , with literally any toy or object . She takes a hair clip and explores it for a long time before finding another object to focus on , and then continues in her happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn from . So many of us cant stand being alone . In addition our society often makes you feel awkward if you are alone for too long , after all , there must be something wrong with you right ? Being part of a crowd is definitely easier than choosing- a different path and being alone . But there is great benefit in alone time and in todays fast paced world , i really think its a luxury we should enjoy . The more you enjoy your own company , the more your energy will rise , and the happier you will feel .

@@50293255 @3793255/ 149485 @qwx559485 <h> Are you Nutrient deficient ? <p> April 22 , 2016 <p> Anyone who has read my book " The Alchemy of Healing " knows the premise , to change your energy and allow your body to naturally heal itself . First your emotional state must change , then your lifestyle will naturally change . Eating the best diet made no difference while I was feeling so negative ( often my feelings ranged from depressed , to anxious , to worried ) . I explained the journey I went through in detail and why " trying " hard to heal my body only resulted in more illnesses arising . The- focus of this book was making the reader understand that the majority of the healing must be allowed , as our body has the know-how and full self-healing abilities necessary . <p> But what if we are severely nutrient deficient ? I was severely Iodine deficient for years , which probably affected my thyroid and every other organ , but it was n't until my Natropath had me do a Iodine test that i found out . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iodine levels were at 13 , while a normal person must be over 100 ! She put me on- the best supplement possible and the rest is history <p> I recently watched a very interesting documentary on Food Matters , where Doctors were talking about the success they had at healing serious depression and dangerous tumours with high doses of Vitamins . The results were incredible , and what is- alarming is that Nutritional Therapy is not permitted in most western countries . One Doctor was forced to relocate his medical practice in order to continue and saving lives with Vitamins . I do n't  want to go into the politics of why the pharmaceutical industry wants people to be sick , that is obvious . But I do want to point out that the amazing research and dedication of many good Physicians on Nutritional Therapy can be accessed for free on the Orthomolecular.org website . <p> So my question to you is , are you nutrient deficient ? When was the last time you had all your tests done ? Are you getting enough Vitamins and Minerals ? Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood tests . Some tests may cost you more ( such as my Iodine test ) but are well worth it . Then look at what you are eating , you are far better off getting your nutrients from organic fresh foods than from supplements . But many argue that these days our soil is so depleted that its necessary to eat large amounts of vegetables and fruits , to get the same nutrients in our grandparents diet . So supplements may be necessary , and if that is the path you are taking , try to consume " whole food " supplements where possible . They contain natural vitamins derived from food , instead of artificially produced vitamins made in labs . Of course sometimes its not possible to get whole food vitamins ( I 've found it difficult to get my hands on them in the past ) , so- this should not stop you from taking vitamins . I believe some vitamins are better than no vitamins . <p> And as always , please do your own research and rely on your own intuition to guide you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better every day through the methods Ive discussed in my book , and very soon your body will rapidly heal . <p> Are you Nutrient deficient ? was last modified : April 22nd , 2016 by farnaz

For example ; Frustration about a- parent feels very different to me , as it does to my best friend , as it does to the next person , and- the next .

It is far easier and more fun to TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO BETTER FEELING THOUGHTS , thoughts that feel good RIGHT NOW !

I know people very close to me , who are experiencing tremendous financial hardship and are totally unaware that their constant negative talk of other people ( and ultimately themselves ) is preventing financial abundance . <p> What are you willing to give up for the gossip ? Are you willing to give up money ? good relationships ? health ? joy ? because whether you realise it or not , each time you engage in negativity towards yourself or someone else ( whether they deserved it or not ) , you are giving up much more than you realise .

Until your mention of the law of attraction , I never really thought about it as having an impact on my life " but when I think about the type of things I 'll gossip about , and then look at what I 'm having a hard time finding some success in healing from " it does make a lot of sense .

Any night I watch tv and then I go to bed , I feel tired the next morning when I wake up . I never feel refreshed . People do n't  realise how much their morning is impacted by the night before ! My next goal is to wake up earlier to work out , and as the winter ends and spring gets closer , it should be easier to achieve . I agree with you , prepping food on the weekend can save you hours during the week ! Let me know how you go =

She tried and tried , and every time the lid would bend or the body of the container would bend , so the lid never sat on the container like it first did . After 10 min of trying , she closed the lid as much as she could , placed it aside and walked to a new toy to play with . <p> In this child is the wisdom to know that good is better than perfect . Sometimes perfect is not attainable , and we adults still try to push through to perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we get totally thrown out of balance ( the vortex ) . <p> If instead of trying to reach unattainable heights , we do our best and leave the task done well , we can go on with our life happily , without beating ourselves up for coming short .

And chances are she will pick up the container tomorrow and place the lid on correctly , having learnt something new , she will use it as an excuse to feel new levels of joy , the rest of the afternoon .

I was sitting in the 3rd row from the front , next to a bunch of other Abraham- enthusiasts . It was so lovely to see so many other fans there . As always watching Esther Hicks channel Abraham live is amazing , as you get to experience first hand how perfectly they answer even the toughest questions . While i was too shy to ask my questions , my questions were all answered by the end of the day , and the conference ended perfectly . I took my sister along and it was her first time seeing Abraham live , so i was n't sure what she would - think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that seeing Esther become Abraham on stage really makes their teachings a lot more real . Afterwards i got a bit carried away at the Hay House book stand outside , and bought about 5 Abraham Hicks books including Ask and It is Given ( too well priced not to buy a second copy , The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent and The Astonishing Power of Emotions . The one i 'm really excited to read is their The Law of Attraction Essential Collection " which is a compilation of their 3 best sellers ; The Law of Attraction , Money and the Law of Attraction , and The Vortex , as well as their Law of Attraction DVDs . For anyone who missed out i do n't  think its available on their website yet but you can buy it from Booktopia - Overall it was a wonderful sunday to spend co-creating with other like minded individuals .

I was there and was lucky enough to be invited on stage but it was all such a blur that I really do n't  know what I asked exactly . It was about be a creative writer/actor or whatever and I seem to remember she broadsided me with a question that I could n't really take in so I just said the first thing that came to me and then I remember her/they saying words to the effect of take care of your own relationship with the Source and let others speak through you.

While i was n't on stage either , many of the talks are a bit blurry in my head so i 'm also looking forward to ordering the CDs , i havent had a chance yet . I 'm sure you 're arms looked fine , although i must admit i spend far too much time thinking the same about my arms = Did you fly from the UK just to see Esther Hicks ? Or where you here already for something else ? I 've often wondered if Abraham Hicks hold any gatherings in the UK at all ? I wish they would come here more often , there is something on every week in the US . From what i recall the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it took a good few months to get the CDs , i was wondering if my order had been lost . I 'd say wait a few more weeks and then contact them if you 're concerned ? I could n't have put it better Lynne , Esther really is beautiful on the inside and out ! No matter how bad someone feels when they speak to Abraham , they come out of the conversation more joyous =

Let me congratulate you on your big achievement , you have beaten Cancer ! That is a big deal , give yourself a big pat on the back . <p> Depression and Anxiety are right at the bottom of the Emotional Guidance Scale , so we need to focus on getting to you to go up the scale , so to speak . As you go up emotionally ( or your mood raises ) , you will feel relief and soon no drugs will be necessary . <p> Some simple solutions to feeling better are : 1 ) Go outside , go for a walk in nature , it is one of the best ways to find relief from depression . Spending time with nature balances your mood and ultimately your body . If you can , take up gardening . Or take a dog for a walk , anything nature related is good for the soul . 2 ) Distract your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching feel good , uplifting movies . Watch lots of comedy . Many people have healed themselves with attention to comedy and lots of laughter . 3 ) Eat better quality food , which means more veggies and fruits , more naturally occurring foods , and less processed foods . Processed foods contain artificial additives that prevent your mind from functioning at its best , and also slow your cells down . Of course , never eat something you do not like . If you force food onto yourself , the negative emotions you feel will cause you more harm . 4 ) Spend time with people who are happy and positive , which often means children . Children are connected to their Source and wise beyond measure , so watch them and take note ! Having fun with nieces or nephews or any kids in your family will bring you relief . This relief is needed for you to feel better . 5 ) Start an Appreciation Journal , or Love List as I have mentioned in my Book : Alchemy of Healing . This trains your mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in your life to appreciate , you just need to look for them . Make sure you WRITE them down , it is not enough to just think of aspects you appreciate . The simple act of writing ( with your hands and not with a keyboard ) creates thousands of new connections in your brain ! It is also not enough to just write . Make sure you FEEL appreciation for what you write about . <p> If you start with the 5 items listed above , you will very quickly see a change in your mood . And so will other people . <p> Be kind to yourself and take care of yourself , avoid negative people , news or media . Give all your attention to yourself and focus ONLY on FEELING BETTER right now .

So the solution they offer you is an add-on to the filter which then adds good minerals back into the water . At the time i opted not to get the extra minerals that way as i wanted to do my own research , i think some call this Pi water ( also stemming from Japan ) .

What you want to do is lift the emotions of your friends daughter . How old is she ? She needs to feel better emotionally so that her body can recover . If you can ( with the help of her parents ) , try and uplift her as much as possible . Make her laugh . Help divert her attention from the current problem ( or physical condition ) by putting her attention on something else . Play happy uplifting movies for her . If she is small , play games with her . <p> Also help your friend understand that children are always able to pick up the emotions of their mother/father . So if her parents are sad/depressed/hopeless then the child will unknowingly feel their emotions and not heal .

Yes my life was first changed by the work of Louise Hay , but then the changes became more rapid when i discovered the Law of Attraction . Its actually very difficult for anyone to pin point the exact thoughts that lead to a knee injury , but the important factor is , YOU DO NT NEED TO DIG UP OLD THOUGHTS ! I do n't  advise it . In order for your body to heal , you must stop the resistance you have going on , RIGHT NOW . Your negative emotions/thoughts earlier in life lead to the first injury at 19 , but your continued negative emotions lead to surgeries being necessary . Otherwise your knee would have healed and never needed operation again . <p> All you have to do now is work on your general emotional state and get yourself as happy as you can be . If you keep yourself in that happy state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal . You do n't  need to go back in time to figure out what caused your injury , and in fact its a bad idea .
